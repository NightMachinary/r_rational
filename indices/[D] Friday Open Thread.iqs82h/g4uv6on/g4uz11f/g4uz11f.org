Wouldn't call myself experienced; over the last seven years I've built my own, my brother's, and a friend's workstation/gaming rigs. For basically /any/ build, I'd take suggestions from [[https://www.logicalincrements.com/][Logical Increments]], create a rough outline on [[https://pcpartpicker.com/][PC Part Picker]] within the budget I was given, then post the part list, budget, and intended use to [[/r/buildapc]]. The folks there would then usually change out every part for something better/cheaper/more stylish. I would then wait for a week, see if there are any sales on parts similar to the ones I was recommended, and try and buy everything from one or two vendors.

Actually building the computers was usually the easiest part. Watch some youtube videos of your case. Read the mainboard manual before installing, some wires can get tricky and you should know which RAM slots to use for dual channel. Also try and put everything together outside the box before installing, it's way easier to troubleshoot that way.

Then once you've installed Windows, run a couple of benchmarks to see if you're within the expected margin for your PC. If you aren't, odds are it's a driver thing, but it might also indicate some hardware problem.
