I might, although it would be a vanity buy more than anything. My current computer is from 2013 except for the GPU, but I'm not really limited on the things I actually do with it. I would probably buy Ryzen, get an NVME SSD, and keep the GPU and hard drives while giving a still functional computer to my family. 1440p or 4k screens would be nice as well.

My advice would be to be realistic about what you actually will be doing with your computer (you do not need a 3090 to run League) and to consult people who have built computers before. There's a lot of marketing BS out there, so if you're not familiar with computer hardware beforehand, it's a lot better to just let someone else look at your parts rather than realizing your mistake $1000 later. Actually building the computer is usually pretty simple, it's occasionally called Adult LEGOs, but watch some guides before doing it. Also, "future proofing" is largely not worth it at all.

I'd be willing to look at your parts list whenever you have it ready.
