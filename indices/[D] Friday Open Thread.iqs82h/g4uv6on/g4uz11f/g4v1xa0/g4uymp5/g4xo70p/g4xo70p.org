Seconding posting your planned build for feedback. Put it together on pcpartpicker, then post it places and get feedback (on buildapc, pcmr, or heck, even these weekly threads).

As for me, I just did a big ol futureproof build a year or two ago. I might get a 3070 just because the cost efficiency is too good (and I can put my RX 580 in my wife's computer and get rid of the jet engine video card she has now), but other than that I should be good for another 3 or 4 years at least.
