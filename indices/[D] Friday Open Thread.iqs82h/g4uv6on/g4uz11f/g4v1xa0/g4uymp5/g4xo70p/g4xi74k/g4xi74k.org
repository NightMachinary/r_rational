I'm thinking to upgrade my GPU from a 980TI to a 3070 or so (or used 2070 / 2080, maybe used 1080ti, if I can find them cheap enough) for gaming mostly.

Also maybe gonna build an sffpc for the living room, and maybe a 3990x threadripper build for work, depending on how finances work out. Have 8 Ryzen-based PCs I'd be selling off near the end of the year to help pay for it.
