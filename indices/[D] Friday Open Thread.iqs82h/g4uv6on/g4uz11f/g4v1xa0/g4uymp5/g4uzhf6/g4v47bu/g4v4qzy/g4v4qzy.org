I have some bluetooth headphones, and then for VR games I've preordered the Reverb G2 which has excellent integrated sound. Plus, I've got an audio interface and microphones laying around, so I could splurge on decent audiophile headphones if I decide to get back into music production,though I'll be avoiding audiotechnica because they keep breaking on me.
