Regardless, the G2 is a great choice, I was all geared up to try to gently argue you away from Pimax and towards either the Index or the G2. The Index's controllers are cool, but there's already straps you can buy to attach to the Oculus Touch controllers so you can let go of them like the Index controllers, and those'll probably work for the G2's controllers too since they're so similar. I'd personally lean towards the G2 just for the 2k per eye resolution, especially since it being $600 versus the Index being a thousand bucks means that if a headset comes out in 2 or 3 years with 4k per eye and varifocal lenses it'll be easier to justify upgrading before the 5 years you mentioned.

EDIT: Maybe even sooner than 2 or 3 years:
