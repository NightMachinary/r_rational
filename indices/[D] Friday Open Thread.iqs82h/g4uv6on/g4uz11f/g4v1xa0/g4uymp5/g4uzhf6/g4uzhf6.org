Yeah, but I totally do need it to run victoria 2 :P.

More seriously, I'm intending for my rig to be a VR capable rig for flight/driving simulators and any other killer apps that come out over its 5-year lifespan, so unfortunately I'll need to shell out a bit of cash. I'm thinking of going with the 3070 and whatever mid-high range ryzen cpu amd puts out in october.
