I'm kind of betting that VR games will for the most part be geared to support oculus-quest type devices, while PC ganes remain geared to support 4k60fps, so I don't believe I'll need to upgrade my kit in four years. Especially as the tyrrany of Amhdal's law continues to restrict the effective performance of multicore cpus and gpus. Though if some killer app comes out that makes full use of a 4k per eye headset I'm haedly going to complain.
