YouTube recommendations have been pretty good for me. Like they have occasional missteps and finding new amazing pieces of music definitely isn't as common as once a week occurrence, but they pick up on the feeling I'm going for pretty often.

The biggest thing they have going for them (for me) is consistent recommendations even with very fringe genres. It really does feel like discovering amazing hidden gems. (And I find the balance of new to already known and liked music pretty good.)
