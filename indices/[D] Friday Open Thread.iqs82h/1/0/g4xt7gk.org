Been using the setup of OneDrive (storage) + CloudPlayer (for android playback and caching) for a few years now. It's not open source, but since I already had 1TB of storage on OneDrive and a folder based hierarchical system for organizing my music, it integrated really easily and I'm pretty happy.

While using OneDrive you can easily access and play individual music files from the web, it's still not really a music player. The android experience is the best and covers 70% of my music needs. Windows desktop experience is also decent. (can use whatever music player you're used to, I use MusicBee or the built in app).

Other desktop OSs suffer a bit in the simplicity of setting it all up, but it looks like you can do it on [[https://github.com/skilion/onedrive][linux]]) altho I haven't bothered to try. No idea about Macs.

I technically also have a plex setup that can stream my music [and a web interface!], but plex android app needed to create a user for their platform to use it with my server, which seemed like a badly transparent way to gather user data (since on desktop they don't really care). And I might be remembering it wrong, but I don't think their android app did any offline caching. The last point killed it for me, since I'm traveling semi occasionally through 4G blindspots.

My biggest problem was that being a decently sized music library (25GB) I didn't really want to transfer all of that to my phone (only have 64GB of storage there; can't have music taking up half of it). CloudPlayer has a setting of how much offline cache they use so I set it to only cache 8GB of the most popular songs.
