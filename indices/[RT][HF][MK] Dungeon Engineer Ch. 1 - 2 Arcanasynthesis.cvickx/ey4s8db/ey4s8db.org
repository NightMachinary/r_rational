I would seriously recommend you post this story on an actual text host and not just using reddit text posts for a number of reasons.

- You'll reach a wider audience by posting updates here and a potential local audience on, say, AO3 or Royalroad

- Reddit search is not well optimized and there's no good way to make a table of contents feature for easy navigation

- People mildly interested in the story here will look to the comments; seeing a wall of text may discourage them from checking it out on that basis

- Breaking up the flow of your story due to reddit's arbitrary character limit doesn't do you any favors

- Reddit posts are archived after six months and thus are terrible for any enduring reader engagement down the line
