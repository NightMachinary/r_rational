Interesting story. I was a little skeptical just based on the chapters posted here, but I followed the link that was posted and have binged through chapter 18 so far. It's interesting! I quite like the engineering approach Ike takes to exploring the world around him, and there is a lot of promise in the setup. I can't help but think of it as a video game, but I guess that is a conceit of the genre. You are definitely a beginning writer, but the writing quality has improved just over the course of the month you were posting these, so I look forward to more chapters from you. Thanks for the share!
