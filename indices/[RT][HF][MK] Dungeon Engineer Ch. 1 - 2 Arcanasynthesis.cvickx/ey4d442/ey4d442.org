*Continued final paragraph:*

What I'm sure must be every plant that I collected along with some bonus additions that must have hitched a ride, gets mentioned by Mr. Normal. No, scratch that, I did not see any fire flowers in that list, and I highly doubt they're an unidentified species. Glancing around, everything minus those burning blossoms has grown substantially, in some cases, entire new plants are sprouting! Vines cling to the moss on the walls, which, at this point, also includes the ceiling. Multicolored mushrooms and other fruiting bodies populate every surface that isn't occupied by a plant, and moths and flies visit various blooming flowers. Tiny animals sift through the undergrowth, munch on plants, or burrow through the soil. My humble cave is bursting with life that is reproducing and growing at a rapid pace. As it does, my mana regeneration skyrockets.

End of chapter 2.

​

Afterword:

Thank you so much for reading my story, I hope you enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed writing it!

*What is a ‘dungeon core' story?*

According to [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/110518.Protagonist_is_a_Dungeon][goodreads.com]]: "It is a genre where the main character is a 'Dungeon' or, in a more general sense, a powerful being that is bound to one place and has a great influence over that place by supernatural means. The main character has the ability to change reality around himself to improve his 'body' in various ways, which can include changing layout of the area; creating or improving its dwellers (plants, animals or magical/technological beings); any items etc. As the plot develops, protagonist improves himself and his domain, expands his territory and establishes contact with outside world."

*Disclamer:*

I'm a first-time writer, so this is all new to me. As such, my story is probably garbage.

In my opinion, the early chapters are more poor than the rest I've written so far. I'm working on them now.

At times my story will get technical for no real reason at all. Those portions are included because I enjoyed writing them and ultimately that's the reason I'm even doing this in the first place.

I've read a few popular rational stories (PGE, MoL, HPMoR, etc.) but I've only just now come to realize there is an entire community dedicated to this sort of fiction! I happen to've written part of a story which easily conforms to the Hard Fiction and Munchkinism flairs, but I'm less certain that it's truly rational. If it's not, either let me know in the comments or downvote. Thanks for bearing with me!

(I'd also peg it as a deconstruction of the 'dungeon core' genre, but its tropes aren't very widely known so I left that flair off.)
