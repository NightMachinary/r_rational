I think you're being a little strict. No story can be completely rational, and there is always subjective opinion involved.

 

Rational fiction, instead of rationalist fiction, is described on this subreddit as:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

 

I think The Iron Teeth definitely fits those criteria. When I write I always try to keep those rules in mind.
