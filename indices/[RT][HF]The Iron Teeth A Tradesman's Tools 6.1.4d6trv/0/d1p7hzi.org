The story was enjoyable to read, but I don't think it should be labeled as a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][RationalFic.]]

--------------

/(spoilers)/

To explain my reasoning, here are some conflicts + resolutions that happen in the story.

** Thug leader #1
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: thug-leader-1
   :END:
Method of killing: walking up to him and to a group of his henchmen disguised as one of his people and [[http://imgur.com/hZn7ZGr][slitting his throat from behind.]]

Criticism: Among more than 10 members of a 20-25 persons-large group of deserters, who have been working with each other for a while, everybody fails to notice not only that he's an outsider but also that he's not a human. I mean, sure, [[http://imgur.com/YfSMfxI][a cloak can conceal you somewhat]] (movie logic \ game logic) --- but not when you're walking in broad daylight and [[http://carloscara.deviantart.com/art/The-Iron-Teeth-578476140?purchase=print][have a green face with a huge nose.]] This disguise successfully works for him for the rest of the story as well.

** Group of thugs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: group-of-thugs
   :END:
Method of killing: Waiting until the first two members turn a corner, then quickly approaching and slitting the throat of the 3rd one. Then quickly approaching the first two and surprise-attacking them before they realise their third has been killed.

Criticism: They would've still heard it when the dying thug started choking on his blood.

** Thug leader #2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: thug-leader-2
   :END:
Method of killing: sneaking under his bed, waiting until he's vulnerable (getting undressed for bed) and attacking him with dagger+sword.

Criticism: The thug had no serious weapons nearby, which would be rather out of character for a paranoid band leader in the middle of a turf war. He also didn't utilize his super-strength to its full potential and didn't try running away to get assistance from his mooks.

Many of the beasts (harpies, the mimic, the troll) are nerfed into an easy-AI mode too when they are fighting directly with the protag and his team.

As I've said, the story itself isn't necessarily bad --- it's just not qualifying as a RF.
