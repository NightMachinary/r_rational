Is that space-warping magic I'm seeing mentioned +twice+ thrice now? And perception-altering magics as well? I'm interested in where magic in this story is going!

Obviously-a-Vampire-place is obvious, but cool! I'm wondering why William brought him there originally, only to have him go back without him the next day to buy him a trunk. Couldn't he have just got it there that day? Seems rather strange to not have Red comment on it, or is this more common than I realize? Perhaps William was showing Red off?

Also, Red is adorable. I'm wondering why William is doing his fancy a-lot-more-than-flower-code at him. Habit? Hoping he'll pick it up? Probably habit.

Can't wait for the next interlude!
