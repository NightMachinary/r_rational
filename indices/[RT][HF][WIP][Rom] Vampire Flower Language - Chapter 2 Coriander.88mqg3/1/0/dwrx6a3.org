I think the "fear aura" is part of a test. It's not the chest itself, but the shopkeeper exerting some of her vampiric influence on Red. She's been around long enough to know the styles of the various vampires who live there and knows her products well enough to immediately know which is the highest quality.

The test is not just whether he will pick out the highest quality one that matches his master's tastes, but whether he is willing and able to act in his master's interests when being influenced by outside sources. Once he opened the chest, he had "passed", so there was no need to continue the effect.
