Of the two, I find William's POV more fun to read, but I'm also enjoying the way Red's parts showcase how bizarre William's courtship is from a mortal perspective.

Also fairly certain the side of the trunk with the man throwing the disqus is fake somehow. Maybe the actual image is sensitive somehow and had to be covered up, or maybe the false side hides a hidden compartment or something? The dread Red felt before opening it is interesting too--magic, or maybe some kind of mortal-specific "basilisk" embedded in the design? I'm pretty curious about this trunk.
