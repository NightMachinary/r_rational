This is a romance story about a WW2 deserter and a high-status vampire; there's (hopefully) very thorough and detailed worldbuilding in this story, and don't worry, there's not a quivering member to be seen.

This is a longer chapter than the last one that gives a bit more worldbuilding and character development. Let us know what you think!

Another interlude is on track to be released in two week's time; we're about to start final edits on Chapter 3 to be released the first weekend of May.
