I think I understand now! I was mostly confused why you only brought up one of the mistakes, but if they're (almost) all mistakes then that makes sense and finally someone's explained it in a way I understand.

I'll try and fix them up for next chapter for sure, and I might go through and fix these ones when I have time.

Thanks again!
