Then we've made that error all through the chapter, correct? You just only quoted one example?

Some examples:

#+begin_quote
  “Shouldn't be a problem.” He hesitated. “Sir.” He added, still not feeling right speaking so casually to a guest.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “I would like a quite fine trunk if you see one, and I would hate you not to be able to purchase it.” He said, simply.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Thank you.” Red finally said. He carefully placed the wad of money into his pocket, etc
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Maybe.” Red didn't know how to begin deciding.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  “Glad you like it.” Red said, trying not to smile.
#+end_quote

I won't keep quoting them, but you get the idea: you reckon I should edit all of the above to have commas instead?

I always thought that 'logically' it should be:

"The thing is, there's a lot of times I start to say something and," I paused, trying to remember the next part of my sentence. "It always seems like I forget how I want to finish."

and:

"It would be great if I could have a jar of olives." I asked, grinning eagerly. "Oh, and how did your job interview go last week?"

It this just a case of 'grammar is weird, you put commas everywhere for /reasons/', or is there something I'm missing?
