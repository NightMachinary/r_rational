  I'm interested in where magic in this story is going!
#+end_quote

I'm glad to hear that! Do note that it's primarily a romance story, so the magic is going to be in the backdrop. But there's a lot of very interesting stuff in there for you to notice, if you're looking for it.

  I'm wondering why William brought him there originally, only to have him go back without him the next day to buy him a trunk. Couldn't he have just got it there that day? Seems rather strange to not have Red comment on it, or is this more common than I realize? Perhaps William was showing Red off?
#+end_quote

There's a few reasons that could be relevant:

- The shop isn't open at night / the shopkeeper doesn't like serving vampires

- William wants to mark Red as his "property", and taking him out where other vampires will presumably see him is one way of doing that

- William wants the chest he buys to be 'secret', so sends an unknown agent of his to do the purchasing

- William wants to see if Red is any good at shopping

- William wants to test Red's mettle: so to see if Red gets freaked out by relatively large-scale supernatural things (e.g. the music/weird people) and/or if he's intimidated by weird shopkeepers

- Buying stuff is /low status/; what vampire of William's age would debase themself so?

I'll leave it to you to pick which of those you like best/believe, or to come up with others.

As to why Red doesn't find it odd: he's spent the last 2-3 months working in a hotel that caters more-or-less exclusively to vampires. His definition of "odd" when it comes to eccentric rich people is different from most.

  Also, Red is adorable.

He is! He is so pure. Come June and/or July you'll get a good dose of more adorableness / potentially we will reach 'peak adorable'.

  Can't wait for the next interlude!

Hope it lives up to your expectations! It's edited so we'll post it on the 14th or the 21st, and Chapter 3 on the 5th of May as long as we get it edited in time. *nervous chittering*
