Still enjoying the story.

I don't mean to be too presumptuous, but I noticed a couple of things if you're interested.

#+begin_quote
  "But this one is excellent.” He said, silently closing the chest.
#+end_quote

That should probably be

#+begin_quote
  "But this one is excellent," he said, etcetera.
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  "I don't think my work is not worth quite so much, sir.”
#+end_quote

The "not" seems to be out of place here.

If you'll tolerate a more abstract criticism:

#+begin_quote
  And now, after working in her hotel for three months and seeing how perfectly suited this young woman seemed to be to running it, he'd become etcetera.
#+end_quote

That sentence feels just a bit clunky. If I might be so bold, I'd recommend something more like "after working in her hotel for three months and seeing how perfectly suited to running it this young woman seemed to be, he'd etcetera." The sentence as you've written it is probably grammatically correct, it just feels /off/.

Those three things probably only caught my eye because of how well the rest of it is written, and the last of the three is probably subjective (though I really do feel like it's breaking a "rule" that I don't know the name of, something to do with the subject of the sentence being the hotel). I'm definitely looking forward to more.
