  I don't mean to be too presumptuous, but I noticed a couple of things if you're interested.
#+end_quote

The only thing worse than having your flaws pointed out is having your flaws not be pointed out and allowed to continue existing, or something! So we'll always and forever be interested in feedback.

#+begin_quote
  grammar on quotations
#+end_quote

Yeah, I've always struggled with this. I know the convention in English /seems/ to be that you just put a ',' at the end of quotations all the time, but I feel like if the text in the quotation is a finished sentence, it should end with a full stop?

We have an "editor" (read: my partner who goes through every chapter with a red pen before it's posted), and he highlights every time we do that without fail. I've not made those edits because I have this stubborn opinion as above, but I'm open to changing it (I've started using emdashes now, for example). Is there something I'm missing? Why did you flag the comma on that particular passage and none of the others?

#+begin_quote
  The "not" seems to be out of place here.
#+end_quote

Cheers, that was a typo that we missed! Fixed.

#+begin_quote
  That sentence feels just a bit clunky.
#+end_quote

Thanks! Inside baseball: that scene was actually written and added in the last week (while one of us had the flu, no less), so it hadn't been edited as thoroughly as the others had and I think it shows in a lot of places as you noticed...

I like [[/u/ceruleantresses]] suggested edit and I've put that in. The sentence (passage, really) is about Paola rather than the hotel. It does de-emphasise the fact that Red is surprised that someone with the qualities {young,woman} is a good hotelier, but that's not completely forgotten.

Thanks for your feedback and especially thanks for the kind words!
