  The only thing worse than having your flaws pointed out is having your flaws not be pointed out and allowed to continue existing
#+end_quote

I wholeheartedly agree. I'd personally rather know than not know, and I think a lot of people feel the same. I feel like it's a bad sign when a creator takes personal offense to having legitimate errors pointed out.

#+begin_quote
  I feel like if the text in the quotation is a finished sentence, it should end with a full stop?
#+end_quote

Not if it's dialogue. Even if it ends in a question mark, the "he" is still part of the same sentence and should never be capitalized. "He said, silently closing the chest" isn't a full sentence, it's connected to the previous dialogue.

#+begin_quote
  "This is a finished sentence," he said.
#+end_quote

And not

#+begin_quote
  "This is a finished sentence." He said.
#+end_quote

The dialogue tag is never not included in the same sentence as the dialogue.
