It's mostly "you put commas everywhere /for reasons/," except "/for reasons/" implies it's arbitrary and it really boils down to

#+begin_quote
  "Red finally said."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "He said, simply."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "Red said, trying not to smile."
#+end_quote

aren't actually sentences, they're fragments unless you use a comma to connect them to the dialogue they follow.

I didn't notice most of the other ones. However, the first one and the fourth one aren't errors. "He hesitated" isn't a dialogue tag, it's an action beat. It functions on its own as a complete sentence.
