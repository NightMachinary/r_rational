If I were going to rewrite the sentence about Paola's skill running the hotel, I'd probably go with something like "And now, after working in her hotel for three months and seeing how perfectly suited she was to running it..." I see how your suggested alternative fixes the "to...to", but I think Paola herself should take center stage in the syntax, rather than the hotel. Though I guess it's the authors' preference that matters, not mine!
