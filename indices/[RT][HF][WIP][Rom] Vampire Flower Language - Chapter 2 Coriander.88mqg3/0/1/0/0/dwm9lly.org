  Though I guess it's the authors' preference that matters, not mine!

Absolutely, but I feel like there's nothing wrong with the hotel being the subject of the sentence in the first place. It just seems ambiguous whether "how suited she seemed to be to running it" is "correct" grammatically, and "how suited to running it she seemed to be" seems unambiguously "correct" grammatically, and whether or not that grammatical structure is a matter of preference also seems ambiguous.
