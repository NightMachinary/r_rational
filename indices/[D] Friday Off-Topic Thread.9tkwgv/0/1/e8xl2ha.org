By the time AI is advanced enough to retrodict a perfect simulation of all of the 100+ billion humans who have ever died just based on a perfect understanding of the laws of physics and extrapolating backwards from the current state of the universe, I think the humans who managed to live until after the abolition of death will have already been living in a simulation themselves for quite a while and there won't be any need for a physical body to explore the "real" world with because the "real" world will be nothing but a giant (presumably expanding) ball of computing substrate. It'd take an unfathomable amount of processing power to perfectly simulate the last 250,000 years of the universe. And of course there's the issue of how far back you go, because speciation isn't cut and dry. At some point there'd have to be a cutoff where you say "okay, you and your generation are the First Ancestors and we're not simulating any farther back, which means we're not reviving your parents even though they're almost perfectly identical to you in terms of genetics." And then there's the other species of humans like neanderthal, and other species of animals like dolphins and ravens (and of course cats and dogs; if I "wake up" after my death and they tell me they won't bring back my daughters just because my daughters happen to be cats then I'll tell them they don't have my consent to continue simulating me). So it's like "there's no fair cutoff point along any axis so do we just go ahead and simulate every single living organism to have ever existed in the last 3 billion years and after an organism dies start adding 1 IQ point and 1 point of complexity every year until literally all of Life has ascended?"

I tried writing a little something about an "ancestor" who died in 2018 waking up after being revived in the future for io9's "future of death" contest thing they were running, but I felt like my writing was too sterile, and the premise didn't feel particularly original (and I found out about the contest thing from a post on this subreddit so I thought at least a few other people from here might submit stories with a similar premise since most of us are all aware of the same general tropes), and I was (and still am) sick (alright, I'm not "sick," I've had /certain symptoms/ for like two months and this is the fourth time it's happened in three years and I'm starting to suspect since these symptoms are starting to look roughly annual that I might be developing IBS (and that really pisses me off)) so I wasn't in the mood to figure out how to continue the story or to fix the writing up to a standard that I thought would be "competitive" (which was stupid of me because I just looked up the winner of the contest and it's (in my humble opinion) just absolutely abysmal, both the writing itself and the premise of the story)...

Anyways, it's only about a thousand words, so I wouldn't call it a "story" per se, but if you're looking for that sort of thing then it's something to look at.
