I get spooked pretty easily, so I might not be the best person to answer. I get too spooked to play scary games - my wife makes fun of me for having put Amnesia down after the first ten minutes (I first tried it in the dark, alone, with headphones, as suggested, but it was still too spooky playing in the living room with people around).

As far as prose:

- A number of [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP]] entries, mostly those that have mission logs and work by omission/redaction/implication. I can never remember the numbers though.
- /John Dies at the End/, or at least the parts that aren't comedy. Helped by having originally read it late at night, when it was a web serial instead of a book.
- Chunk Palahniuk's /Haunted/, which is a story collection. Not all of them landed for me, and it's somewhat a mix of body horror and gross out with actual spooks.
- Seconding /House of Leaves/, though that book really benefited from me reading it while sick with a 104 degree temperature and having mild hallucinations.
