  "It's a trick that some alteration experts use if they want to be able to *create complex objects without carrying the originals with them*. They use a spell to record the blueprint of an object, *storing it inside their heads*, then simply use that blueprint to *create copies of the object whenever it strikes their fancy*. Well, provided they have the correct raw materials. In your case, that would be a blank book of similar dimensions to what you're trying to copy and a bottle of ink."

Zorian gave up this method of storing information after learning the more efficient memory packaging technique. But combining this with the Orb's vast storage capacity seems to allow for munchkining lots of stuff across restarts?

I could not find any indication of whether or not the objects can be magical. But taking the word "blueprint" optimistically, we can expect that with good shaping abilities and enough crystalized mana, it should be possible to instantiate various magical objects in arbitrary numbers. On the other hand, Zorian does not seem to be using this method (at least, explicitly) for creating things, so maybe it only works for mundane stuff.
