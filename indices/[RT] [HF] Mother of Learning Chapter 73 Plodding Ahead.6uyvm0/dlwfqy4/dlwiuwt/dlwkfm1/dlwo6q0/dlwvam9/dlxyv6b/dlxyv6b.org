Short version: 11 mages who brewed and drank a potion of agelessness. They can be killed (Oganj killed two), but won't die of natural causes.

I strongly suspect Silverlake is one of them. 90 years old but looks half of that: no white hairs, no missing teeth, no trembling or weakness in her hands when butchering the salamander. Advanced magical knowledge, apparently including pocket dimensions, which even Xvim doesn't know much about, but especially with /potions/. Doesn't give out her last name. If the Eleven will be part of the story at all, she's hands-down the best candidate.
