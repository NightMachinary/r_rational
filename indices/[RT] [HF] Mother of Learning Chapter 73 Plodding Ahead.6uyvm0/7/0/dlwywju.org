I had speculated in the past that Veyers transformation into Red Robe involved possession or merging by some sort of ancient fire elemental that was actually old enough to remember the Sovereign Gate. Or at the very least that his bloodline awakening ritual was flawed in some way to open him up malicious influences.

Ways the fire Elemental Salamander Kilnfather thing would relate to Veyers' bloodline awakening ritual:

*Yellow, slitted eyes

*Fire magic

*Elemental spirit infused into living beings

*Hostile tendencies

I'm still assuming he's RR, because of Zach's memory wipe and the timing and thoroughness of his disappearance. But there are still a ton of unknowns.
