If Controller powers really are tied to the Key pieces, then that means Red Robe had one.

Of course, we only saw that near the end of an iteration, and it was an iteration where he had an idea that there were other loopers, so it's not surprising that he would have collected a suitable weapon. What would be more interesting is his confrontation with Zorian at the very beginning of the next iteration, before he had time to assault the treasury or visit another continent (and he certainly didn't fight QI). Unfortunately, the fact that he didn't use purple beams there doesn't tell us much, since he wanted information, so he likely wouldn't have used them on Zorian whether he could or not.
