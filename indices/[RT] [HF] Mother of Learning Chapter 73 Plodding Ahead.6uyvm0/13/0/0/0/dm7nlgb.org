Nope:

[[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rampage]]

#+begin_quote
  noun

  1.

  violent or excited behavior that is reckless, uncontrolled, or destructive.

  2.

  a state of violent anger or agitation:

  /The smallest mistake sends him into a rampage. The river has gone on a rampage and flooded the countryside./

  verb (used without object), rampaged, rampaging.

#+end_quote

Nothing in there implies "unstoppable". Lack of /self/-control, sure.
