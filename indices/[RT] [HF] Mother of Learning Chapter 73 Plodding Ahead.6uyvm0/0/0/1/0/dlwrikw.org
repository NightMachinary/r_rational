Why wait that long? Just put it on a magical platform, lower it into the gully, and fire into the hole. Based on the trap simulacrum's experience, it'll sense them coming, but they should still have a moment of time to fire before it emerges.

Myself, I'm curious about what kind of ammunition they plan to load up that will be suitably devastating to the spider without damaging the eggs.
