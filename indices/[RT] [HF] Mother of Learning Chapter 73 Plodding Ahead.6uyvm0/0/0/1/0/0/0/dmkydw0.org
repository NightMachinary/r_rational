I dont think they use a lot of man-portable firearms in universe against holmes, they'd be using cannons and magic rather than anti-material rifles.\\
That said, the ideal ammunition would be something like the Lehigh Defense extreme penetrator. Start with a bullet shaped bullet, monolithic hardened copper or brass, cut four scalloped bits off the tip, chop the nose flat. Ends up looking like you broke a Phillips head screwdriver. Tissue and viscera is directed outward by the scallops, cutting through other soft tissue like a diesel powered pressure washer. The exoskeleton contains the damage. And because it does not rely on expansion to create its expanded wound tract, penetration remains deep. Probably will exit the arachnid.
