Sure, MoL could become a trilogy. Unfortunately, as I understand it, the rule of thumb is that publishers won't touch a debut novel over about 100k words, tops - and each arc is double that.

There might be more flexibility with ebooks, I'm not sure.

I'd love to see it published, but I'd be sad to see it cut down by 50% to fit.
