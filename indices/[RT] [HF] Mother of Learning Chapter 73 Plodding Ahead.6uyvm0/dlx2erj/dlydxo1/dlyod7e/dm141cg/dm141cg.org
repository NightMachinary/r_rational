I've always felt that each arc of MoL lends itself fairly well to being its own book, such that a published version would be a trilogy. There would be plenty of opportunity to flesh things out, but in this case, I feel like this timeskip would still be useful. There's just too much minutiae that could be seen as distracting from the overall story. Their actual goals are much more limited than their eventual skillsets would indicate:

1. Leave the loop.

2. Neutralize RR.

3. Prevent the Ibasen attack. 3a.Neutralize the necromancer mayor. 3b.Neutralize the Dragon Cultists in and around Cyoria.

Everything else is just a bonus they were forced to acquire to achieve their goals.
