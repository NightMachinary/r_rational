I agree: I wish there had been significantly more time spent on all of these scenes. Unfortunately, this book is full of situations that were summarized. This, imo, is a major shortcoming of the book. I feel these instances are usually done for the sake of pacing and lack of time for the author, so I can sympathize. It would be great if the book gets published and these scenes all get fully fleshed out.
