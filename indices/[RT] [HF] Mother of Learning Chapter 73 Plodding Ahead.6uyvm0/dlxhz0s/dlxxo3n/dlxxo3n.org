You may have a good point there. Zorian has focused on using his headspace efficiently, so he has just stored blueprints for notebooks, and later just for the ink on them. But with practically unlimited space, yeah, he should be able to store blueprints for instantly fabricating golems, or his prototype magic cannon.

You're probably right about magic items needing more work, though. You can't craft a spell formula without being able to actually cast the spell. In light of the latest world building post, I'd say that the mage has to direct mana into the formula in much the same way as directing mana into the elements of a regular spell.

So he could likely fabricate golem bodies en masse, but he'd have to individually craft the animation cores, which was always the hardest job.
