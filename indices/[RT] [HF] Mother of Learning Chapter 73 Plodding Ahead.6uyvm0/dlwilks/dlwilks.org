i got to say i found this chapter unusually boring, think it might be because there was almost no dialogue in the entire chapter so it just felt like an extensive monologue.

new knowledge are the relic powers. and that is nice.

found it odd that they'd spend time building houses, i mean even as a mage, just magic-ing up a house should be really costly mana wise so i can't really see Zorian building anything that way.

i hope the next chapter carry a bit more umph.
