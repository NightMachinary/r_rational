yes but what bothered me is that building houses are not a 5 minute endevour, even with magic it should take a considerable amount of time especially if you want to make them look good. building one i could easily buy since that's probably half a day "wasted" but if it's something you have fun doing time flies and they need breaks too but building so many feels iffy.
