The tradeoff between capacity and control has one exception that's been pointed out in the story in chapter 62:

  "Ha. Well, it's not just that," Zach said. "The fact I was able to keep up with the academy curriculum at all, even before the time loop, pretty much shuts down the theory I'm just lucky. I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too... convenient to be natural."

Edit: I think it's fair to say that Zach never got a good measure of his mana capacity before entering the loop, because Zorian didn't either, and Zorian was seemingly a much better student.

I've read most? of the same posts as you, so I can see where you're coming from that even if two of the "same" soul were merged, there's no guarantee that it would be problem free. But Zach and Zorian have the Marker built into their very soul, and that thing has a relative Swiss Army Knife amount of functions.

My view is this: the Guardian of the Threshold grabs the soul with the Marker from outside the loop, places it in the body inside the loop, the Marker combines the two souls and from that point on directs the loop to no longer create copies of that soul. Then when the loop ends, the Guardian will collect the soul from inside the loop and place it back in the body it was taken from. What I'm expecting is that when Zorian's soul from inside the loop is placed into his real world body, his (hopefully not too defective) Marker will then do the soul combining that Zach gained upon entering the loop. This will probably suck for Zorian, since his soul has diverged considerably from what it was before it entered the loop, but it shouldn't be fatal, because plot armor. Just weakness and a really bad headache for a little while, like with normal soul damage.
