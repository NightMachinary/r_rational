About 1.75-1.85 years, if they managed to use all 3 of the Black Rooms for an extra 45 days each loop. I've got to wonder if Zorian is going to hit his peak mana capacity soon.

I'm not sure how much Zach's skills are improving, but Zorian seems to have made considerable progress over that skip. And they're even richer now? If they don't blow all their money on anti-Ibasen invasion measures and paying back people who helped them upon leaving the loop, I think they're set for life.

I feel like once they leave the loop and figure out RR, RR isn't going to be much of a match, even if Zorian doesn't get the doubled mana capacity upon leaving the loop that Zach has currently.
