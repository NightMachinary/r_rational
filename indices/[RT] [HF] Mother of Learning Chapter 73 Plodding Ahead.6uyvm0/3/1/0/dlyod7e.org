:D Publication would more likely be a /barrier/ to fleshing things out. Publishers don't want to use extra paper on each copy. They likely wouldn't even touch MoL, as a debut work, without drastically shortening it.

I think the time-skips are OK. Sometimes there just isn't enough new stuff happening to warrant detailed description.
