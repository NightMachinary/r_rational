Ok, scenes in this chapter (of 7,600 words) were:

#+begin_quote
  1. capturing the orb by themselves (1,304 words \ 17%)

  2. chasing off the hydra, some speculations, and some banter (1,422 \ 18%)

  3. getting one new infobit from the Guardian, tying up two “loose ends” that I remember being discussed here (spamming of the Guardian with questions, and bringing the Orb inside a Black room) (2,453 \ 32%)

  4. the public's eye on Kael and on Imaya's house (457 \ 6%)

  5. meeting with a fire elemental (638 \ 8%)

  6. the House Letova heist (582 \ 7%)

  7. fast-forward sequence for nine restarts (804 \ 10%)
#+end_quote

I feel like #4, #5, #6 were too interesting to get so little screentime. To me, they felt rushed in the manner that the later chapters of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][/The Games We Play/]] have felt rushed.

How would you go about fixing that if you wanted to make them bigger, though? Move them to the next chapter to allocate them more space? Make #2 and #3 the shorter scenes? Something else?

  on the usage of portable canons against the spider

Are they supposed to be used as tools of area-denial and shepherding the spider in the wanted direction? Because if they directly hit her from those rifles, the eggs won't be likely to survive.
