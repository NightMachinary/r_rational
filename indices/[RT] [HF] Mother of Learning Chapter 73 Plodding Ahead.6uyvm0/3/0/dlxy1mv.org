I expect that we will see the results of those various endeavors in coming chapters. Pretty typical pattern.

And I just started reading The Games We Play a few days ago...I'll have to see if I feel the same way about it.

I'm rather curious about what kind of payload will be in the cannon. Regular bullets would be problematic, indeed, although it's likely that at least a few eggs would survive. OTOH, a sufficiently potent magical warhead might work well, especially if they can get a shot off while it's still in its lair.
