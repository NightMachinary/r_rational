But Red Robe didn't need the key to get out - he just left, which is why Z+Z are stuck in this situation.

I seem to recall Zach saying that RR isn't much without the litch backing him up, so I would be very surprised if RR can stand up to Z+Z on his (?) own.

That said, RR won't be on their own. They'll have an army behind them, this time with summoned demons. I can only imagine that there will be quite a lot of combat once they break out of the loop.
