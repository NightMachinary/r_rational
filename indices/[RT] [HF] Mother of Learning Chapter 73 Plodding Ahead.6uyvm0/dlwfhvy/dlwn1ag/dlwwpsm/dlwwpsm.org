One use of grey hunter eggs would be to farm them. I don't think that's Silverlake's plan, but it could be worthwhile after the timeloop ends, even if just as a source of enhancement potions. Security would be tricky; I think individual alchemical metal cells with airlocks for feeding, all inside a pocket dimension, could be viable.
