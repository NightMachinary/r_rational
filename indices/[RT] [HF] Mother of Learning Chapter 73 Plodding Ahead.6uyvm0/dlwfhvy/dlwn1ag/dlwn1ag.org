I'm curious what her response is going to be when they actually show up with Grey Hunter eggs. She seemed pretty unflappable, but two unknown teenagers with vast magical skills showing up outside her undetectable residence with items she wanted but had yet to request from them should merit some reaction. I guess they could bring Lukav or Kael along, since she's somewhat familiar with them, Alanic too, I wonder?

It would be funny if the eggs weren't an ingredient for some potion or ritual, but just something she really wanted to try eating.

Did that one simulacra of Zorian's turn into some sort of gun design enthusiast? It sounds like it started with normal anti-personnel rifle and now is playing with some huge magic-assisted anti-materiel rifle. The only job for the golems will be to make sure the eggs don't get crushed, because it's going to have absurd firepower enough on its own.
