I don't consider it plausible.

The only thing we've really been told about merging two souls is that "the resulting entity is virtually always rendered insane or otherwise defective from the stress of the merger". "But!" you say, "if it's two copies of the same soul, then there should be no stress and no insanity!" Well, either the resulting soul will be different to the two inputs, or it won't. If it is different, then we can expect insanity etc. If it's not different, then why would it have doubled mana capacity?

And the tradeoff between capacity and control [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/sapient-species-of-the-world/#comment-196][extends to all souls]]. Even if you could somehow double your mana capacity without altering any other aspect of your soul (highly unlikely IMO), it would not be free; you would lose a great deal of control, just as if you had a larger mana pool to start with.
