I've been so hungry for this chapter to arrive.

- how did the Chameleon drakes get the God Touched Hydra to materialise out of the orb? They don't have a handy soul marker. This is the third instance of a group being able to activate a special gateway. The first being the Silent Gateway adepts activating the Bakora gates, the next was the red robed fanatics whom were releasing the Primorial with their chanting. Here it is a group of lizards and a pocket dimension.

- What does this tell us about the nature of this mechanic? Next question is, does this help Z&Z in any way?

- nice to see a return of the magical rifle

- Lots of good info about portable dimensions.

- Zorian using soul magic as a means to telepathically communicate with his simulacrum. You guys predicted it!

- The Grey Hunter. How does a magical canon /not/ destroy the babies on her belly. So what's the plan, Zorian? Now I can't wait for the /next/ chapter.

- Next up: Silverlake, and back to Pocket Dimensions. This is why I enjoy this story do much!
