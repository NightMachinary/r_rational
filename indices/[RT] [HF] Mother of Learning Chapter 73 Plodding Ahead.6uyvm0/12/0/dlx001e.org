  how did the Chameleon drakes get the God Touched Hydra to materialise out of the orb? They don't have a handy soul marker.

It should be the hydra which has the power to jump in and out of the orb. Maybe the hydra was even created at the same time as the orb as it's guardian. The only thing the drakes did was make a lot of noise to call the hydra out.
