Hmm, that's unfortunate, so no getting information from the future then and getting state secrets out of copies of goverment leaders is probably also out.

Still, I feel like you could do something cool with extremely good imitations of specific people. Can the bots enter into a zoom call or upload youtube video's in which they appear as the person they are impersonating? Because if so, extremely convincing deep fakes of well known people can do a lot of damage.

If you want to go the boring (and evil) route, there is of course all kinds of nonsense you could get up to with blackmail or faked ransom videos, but that's boring. With a little more creativity, a lot of research and some social engineering, I bet you can get your hands on /a lot/ of sensitive information by impersonating the correct people.
