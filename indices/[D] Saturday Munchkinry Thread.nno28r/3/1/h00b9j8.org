So, first things first, always fill in one of the optional fields with /"Perfectly loyal to Silver_Swift"/, no sense in creating AGI's that are not going to do what you tell them to.

Secondly, you've got ready access to all of mankind's knowledge and expertise, so that's got to be handy. Just create custom made experts for whatever task you want to complete. Want to hack a bank? Have a quick chat with /"Worlds best hacker"/ and /"Brilliant cybersecurity expert"/.

Thirdly, can you fill in peoples names in the program's main field? If so, not only can you do cool things like calling in /"Dr Paul Ekman"/ if you want to tell if someone is lying to you (or /"Dr Cal Lightman"/ if fictional characters are allowed), but you can also have a chat with, for instance, a version of /"President Vladimir Putin"/ who is completely loyal to you and might be willing to share some state secrets.

Fourthly, can the programs be created to have information that humanity hasn't figured out yet? If so, get talking to /"2120's AGI Expert"/ and start skipping ahead through the tech tree towards human aligned super intelligences.

Edit: For that last one, make sure you enter /"From universe without unaligned AGI"/ as one of the optional fields, just to be sure.
