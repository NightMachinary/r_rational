You have a computer program which can create 'bots' according to broad parameters you set and which will then do things on the internet/places which could practically be influenced from an internet-connected device. This is how it works: You have one main field, in which you can type up to three words in English (or your native language if you prefer, but only one actual language is usable for the program's ui) plus up to one optional proper name. The words will be interpreted by the program in accordance with the usual grammar of English in the same way that fluent human speakers would go about interpreting it. This field is for setting the main, primary, purpose/personality of the bot. For example, you could write ‘Shakespeare enthusiast' or ‘elderly automobile mechanic' or ‘teenage creative writer' and that will be the core part of the 'bot's' schtick around which the ‘bot' will organize its behavior and to which it will integrate anything you put in the other fields. There are three other, optional fields, in each of which you can up to five words to narrow down the bot's personality/etc a bit. ‘Devout Catholic', ‘speaks three languages', ‘migrated from Argentina to Canada', stuff like that. The bot will integrate the stuff in these fields into its behavior as appropriate but will still be using the thing in the main field as its primary motivating behavior.

Once you have filled out the main field and such of the optional fields as you choose, the bot will be created with a turing-test-passing persona and will go onto the internet and behave like a human with that persona might plausibly behave. It will make every effort to seem like a real human and avoid revealing that it is actually a computer program, and will be no more good, no more evil, and no more effective or less effective in its goals than a human is capable of being, and its only ability to interact with the world is through the medium of internet-connected devices. You, when creating it, can only influence it in the broad way described above, or by talking to it once it is created, or by deleting it.

The program can operate up to ten bots at one time. If you delete one and create another using an identical description, the new one will not be exactly the same as the old one; e.g. the Shakespeare enthusiast might be a 50 year old Scottish man the first time you make it, and a 15 year old Canadian woman the second time.
