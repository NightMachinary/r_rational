Trying to find some older immortals and get a lay of the internal politics is an important long term goal.

The advantages you have are that you're generally less likely to be killed than older immortals, and that you'll probably be better acclimated to the present era than other immortals. For example, in this life you might be one of the few who have a good, intuitive understanding of modern technology. If the other immortal is correct about this being the second loop (I'm dubious, how does she know that but doesn't know if any other immortals are alive?) then it'll take things a while to settle down as farming gets invented earlier and earlier.

The later in the loop, the more divergent things get, so you should assume that each life you have is going to be completely unique. Thus, you should be trying to learn anything that you'll want to have in the future. This should include things invented due to a fluke (penicillin?) and pieces of information that are relatively simple to remember but have potentially large effects (theorems and proofs, useful algorithms, philosophy, transistors, etc). Of course this should be focused on things that are likely to be useful in the modern era - hopefully you never have to introduce crop rotation or plumbing.

Also, learning survival skills and some crafts will definitely be beneficial eventually.

At first I was disappointed that you wouldn't get to influence human history that much, but the benefit is that you're going to be able to spend many lives with modern luxuries and few without. A fun consequence of being so late is that the food will be wildly different each time due to crops being cultivated differently and cultures being different.
