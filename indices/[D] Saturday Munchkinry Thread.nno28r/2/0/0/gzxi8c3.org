  If the other immortal is correct about this being the second loop (I'm dubious, how does she know that but doesn't know if any other immortals are alive?) then it'll take things a while to settle down as farming gets invented earlier and earlier.

It's possible that she met another immortal previously, but hasn't heard from them in many years. Which would explain why she doesn't know if they're alive or not. And if the immortal she met also has no memories of previous cycles (Or only has memories of one previous cycle) she can make a guess that this is at least the second time through. Though you're right that if this is the case she has no guarantee that there weren't more cycles before the previous one.

It's also possible that she found out in that vision on her 50th birthday that this was the second cycle.
