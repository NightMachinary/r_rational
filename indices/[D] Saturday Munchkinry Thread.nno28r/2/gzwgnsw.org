The world is stuck in a very, very long time loop. Every 20.000 years, the world resets to slightly before 18.000 BC and human civilization has to start from scratch again.

Each century during this period, one Immortal is born. These Immortals have low grade healing powers, they stop ageing around their early twenties, don't get sick and don't die of starvation or dehydration. They can still be killed in combat or die in an accident, but when they die they are reincarnated in the next cycle with their memories and skills intact.

Each Immortal is born in the same year every cycle, so the first immortal is always born near the start of the cycle, the second one a century later and so on. The reincarnation process picks a body at random from the people born in this time window, without regards for gender, skin colour or any other physical traits. If nothing close enough to a human is born within that year, the immortal skips this cycle.

Immortals can sense other nearby immortals (within approximately 100m) and if they met in a previous life they also instinctively recognize each other, regardless of their current appearance.

On their fiftieth birthday (approximately halfway between their birth and that of the next immortal), each immortal gets a vision that explains the specifics of the time loop and their abilities.

You are the 197th Immortal, so you will always be born near the end of the cycle, having at most 300 years to live each time. You're being told all of this by the 193rd immortal (born in the fifteenth century). She tells you that the world is currently in the second cycle and that she suspects humanity went extinct in the first cycle before either of you were born. She doesn't know whether any other immortals are currently alive. What do you do?
