You have the power to materialize an invisible sensor anywhere on the earth, which you can see and hear via (replacing your normal sight and hearing while doing so). You can place/relocate the sensor up to once every 5 seconds, and can place it either by specifying a location (such as “1 meter behind that wall” or “100 meters above the top of the Empire State Building”) or by specifying a person with either their name or a mental image of them (ambiguities in names produce the sensor next to a random person with that name).

EDIT: When placing the sensor at a specific location (rather than at a person), you need at least a rough idea of the target location. For example, the “above the Empire State Building” prompt would fail if you don't actually have any idea of where the Empire State Building is, but having a map of NYC with the ESB marked on it would be enough to place the sensor above it, but not enough for a specific location like “inside the north-most elevator of the ESB”, though you could get to that before too long by looking around through the sensor. The only way that the sensor makes use of information you don't already have is when using the “find a person” mode of placing it. /EDIT

You are in a deathmatch with another person with this power (and you two are the only people with powers). Neither of you know who the other is as the beginning, but upon seeing the other person either with your own direct eyesight or through the sensor you will be able to identify them as your opponent by a colorful aura surrounding them (and vice versa them you). To prevent the game from taking thousands of years, both you and the other person live in Manhattan and cannot leave Manhattan for the duration of the game. How do you identify and then kill your opponent (with no regard to the consequences afterward, so no need to keep the killing secret) before they find and kill you?
