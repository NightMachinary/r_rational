I make sure to always carry an umbrella when I go outside so that I can't be seen from above. After that, I hire a bodyguard and don't worry about it. The chances of bumping into them on the street randomly are very low.

Instead, I use my powers for other things. Options include:

- Work as a private detective
- Work with the police to help on investigations
- Spy out the details of security systems for purposes of penetration testing
- Spy on corporate executives to get inside information that allows for making money on stocks that are about to make major product releases, or fail (go short on those) etc

EDIT: I'll leave papers scattered around me at all times saying "I won't bug you, you don't bug me. We've both got better opportunities with this power than to risk getting arrested for murder."
