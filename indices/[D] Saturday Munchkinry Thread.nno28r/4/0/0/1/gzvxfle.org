The power doesn't actually have omniscience itself. The only method that allows you to place it in a location you don't already know is via the “find a person” modality. In the examples above, if you didn't already know where the Empire State Building was, you couldn't specify it as the location.

Similarly, “relocate sensor to the location of my lost phone” would fail, because the power can only find places you didn't specify in the case of people (e.g., “relocate sensor to my friend Will Edderscmitz” would work, even if you don't know where he is).
