Where are you getting an Identity Card from? The OP said: "[by]specifying a person with either their name or a mental image of them (ambiguities in names produce the sensor next to a random person with that name)."

Regardless, that's why I've got a bodyguard. Oh, extra thought: I'll leave papers scattered around me at all times saying "I won't bug you, you don't bug me. We've both got better opportunities with this power than to risk getting arrested for murder." I'll edit that into my original post.

EDIT: Oh, wait. You meant 'Identity Card' as in a driver's license. Yeah, that's in my wallet and the scrying doesn't see through physical objects. Also, nothing in the description implies that it can do omniscient locations like that.
