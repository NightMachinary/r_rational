I think you are severely underestimating the threat you face here. The sensor isn't just a remote scry, it's an omniscient information gathering tool.

If I were your nemesis, with just my first statement *"relocate sensor over the Identity Card belonging to the nearest person having the same power as myself"* would allow me to see your photograph portrait, your full name, your home address and date of birth.

You think an umbrella is enough?
