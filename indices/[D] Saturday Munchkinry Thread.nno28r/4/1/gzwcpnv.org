The safest way to make money I can think of would be the stock market and insider trading. Crypto is easy to trace, and I'm honestly just not sure how I could do bank fraud fully remotely without getting caught. The stock market steady form of income in the short term, especially as I'm figuring out how to use it effectively. Calling in bounties (like the location of FBI's most wanted) would be enough cash for a few years, but would attract a lot of attention. The FBI would probably freak out if I called in more than 1, possibly if more than 1 was called in in a single year. Although being an ESPer for the government would be a solid way to have constant protection, but if my enemy did the same thing it could get really thorny.

Putting that aside, I'd stay in my home 24/7, getting deliveries of necessities through a trusted proxy (so the enemy can't use that as a way in). Ideally this would be an apartment that's not visible from the street so the enemy can't just methodically look at “the apartment behind that window” and find me. Even more ideally, it would be somewhere that doesn't show up on public plans/maps, but I'm not sure how I would go about that. Possibly blackmailing some rich people.

Another strategy would be living somewhere more public but inherently better defended. Finding a way to live at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740_Park_Avenue][740 Park Avenue]] without attracting attention would be good, it's pretty secure and it wouldn't attract additional attention to hire private security. The problem is I'd expect to be found pretty quickly, it's a well known building and it's somewhat of a logical option if you have lots of money and blackmail (which are trivial to get with the power). So I'm not sure it's a good idea.

I'd also purchase guns and trap/alarm my apartment, and possibly get the building to get better security. This way, even if I'm found by the enemy, I still have a chance of winning.

In terms of tracking down my enemy, I'm not sure. Regular monitoring of Manhattan areas, a progressive sweep of all homes in the area (which would take at least 42 straight hours based on 750k households and 5 seconds to move the eye), checking the news for crimes likely committed by them or unusual stock activity. It's interesting that it's a symmetrical problem, I'm not sure how to break that symmetry. At least I'd find eaglejarl pretty quick - I wouldn't be using purely birds eye views all the time, and an umbrella would stand out if it's not raining.
