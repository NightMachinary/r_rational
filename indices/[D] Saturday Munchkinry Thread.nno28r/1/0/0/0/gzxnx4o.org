Oh wow, this completely slipped my mind. Strangelet hypothesis, huh.

So the only physically plausible mechanism we know of producing strangelets is by scooping them up from the interiors of neutron stars right? If so, then making mana cost be cubic in *momentum-energy* would fix this, right? Because otherwise there's a lot of potential energy stored in having a bunch of free strangelets running around.

In fact, someone should try this in the story lol, thanks for suggesting it.
