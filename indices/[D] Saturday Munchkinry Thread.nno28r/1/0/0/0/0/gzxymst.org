I'm not sure that the momentum-energy thing would suffice to prevent their production. The inherent energy of strangelets isn't that high. Strange quarks are largely the same as normal (up and down) quarks, just a bit more massive. In fact, a mass of strangelets would be dangerous precisely because it could be more stable (lower energy) than normal matter, making it thermodynamically favorable for the normal matter to convert to strange matter (and releasing energy in the process).

However, if you want the strangelet bomb to not work, you can just have the surface tension of strangelets be low enough that they are not actually more stable than normal matter at the boundary. That surface tension is a physical constant that we haven't been able to measure yet, so you could just say “turns out that the surface tension is low enough that strangelets just evaporate rather than converting normal matter”.
