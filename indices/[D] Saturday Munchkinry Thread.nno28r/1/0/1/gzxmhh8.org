Ahhhh this is why I love this subreddit

So my original solution to these sets of problems was to stipulate that the best mages can only reliable affect matter at the cellular level (so no subatomic shenanigans), but your comment made me realise that, hell, that flies in the face of being able to make carbon nanotubes.

Or does it though? I mean, molecules are so much larger than individual particles or nuclei for that matter, so maybe I could plug this hole in by imposing a hard barrier in magical resolution.

Are you thinking of Sagittarius here? Magic requires mana contact though so, unless you can shape your mana at near-lightspeed you won't be able to follow the object fast enough to move it at those speeds. Spinning an object might work though, if it's artificially strengthened by Capricorn.

Actually I just realised how to fix these two scenarios. Instead of mana cost being cubic in mass, it should be cubic in /momentum-energy/.

EDIT: So a bunch of electrons, because they otherwise involve so much potential energy, would be prohibitively expensive to make.

Good catch. I'll try to think of a way to distinguish between matter and antimatter (all magic comes from CPT symmetry violations?? more at 11)
