Hmm, interesting. What would you consider to be elegant solutions to the Masquerade problem then?

I'm thinking:

- magic is imperceptible to non-mages (can't do this 'cause material effects)
- magical power derives from secrecy (which means any Chaotic alignment mage can completely disassemble the entirety of magical society)
- some government entity takes great pains to keep it secret (this goes against a natural incentive for arbitrary long periods of time; implausible)
- you need a high IQ to understand magic (hilarious, but no)
- "But the authorities won't believe me!" (lol maybe, until you show up in their office with 64 kilograms of uranium-235)
- magical realism (but then it's not urban fantasy anymore :/)

But admittedly I haven't read much of the genre to know any better, so...
