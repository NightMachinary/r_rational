  If you try to perform magic in front of a normie, it won't work, and magical constructs are destroyed when seen by normies.

Hmm, not sure how to tell a story where people reenact [WARNING: Worm spoilers] Taylor's cafeteria scene all the time though. Although I could see the appeal of Copenhagen wavefunction collapse as a Masquerade-enabling phenomenon...

  Or if mages are exempt, there's no reason that the cops wouldn't be tracking me down for illegally buying a flame thrower.

Oh...yeah that...actually is a thing. So there's this one character who does some clearly illegal magic so he can get sent to a maximum-security prison where he'll be safe from assassins.

  And the changes obviously have to backpropagate, which should make a bunch of unrelated things completely different in the present too.
#+end_quote

Yup, definitely! So that's another source of difficulty in advancing magical tradition because it's hard to compare what's physical from what's not if the physical keeps changing under one's feet.

My biggest concern is "how do I add magic to civilization without it blowing itself up to smithereens?" and my solutions to the usual genre conceits tend to be downstream of that. If anything, having local reality-warping is also a metatextual reconstruction of "why the hell do things keep happening to our characters?" which is an aspect of simulation-style fiction that I haven't seen addressed very much.

Plus, I expect it to be a natural source of hilarity lol, although I realise that I'd have to work twice as hard then to make it fit [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s standards.

EDIT: Oh yeah, mages are definitely exempt from the antimeme.
