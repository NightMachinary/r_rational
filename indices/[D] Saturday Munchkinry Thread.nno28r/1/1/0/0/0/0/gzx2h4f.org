How about magic requires secrecy in a more individual level? If you try to perform magic in front of a normie, it won't work, and magical constructs are destroyed when seen by normies. That way, magical effects can only be used in normal society indirectly.

There's still the problem that someone could demonstrate that they can do impossible things, but now they literally can't show them how. Not sure how to get around cameras though.

The original idea just seems to have too many consequences. If I conjure a fireball, there's no reason it shouldn't overwrite my own brain to think I bought a flamethrower, because I did in this universe. Or if mages are exempt, there's no reason that the cops wouldn't be tracking me down for illegally buying a flame thrower. And the changes obviously have to backpropagate, which should make a bunch of unrelated things completely different in the present too.
