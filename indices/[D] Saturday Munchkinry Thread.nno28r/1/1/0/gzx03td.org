Oh, because I'm trying to write urban fantasy lol and I feel like there's a lot of potential in magic + antimemes fiction.

EDIT: I don't think there's actually a way to reconstruct urban fantasy in a satisfying way without having some sort of reality-bending element to be frank. Being able to hide the effects of magic from a large segment of the population for long periods of time is completely bonkers, and the standard solution of "let's just memory wipe everyone all the time" is: a) even more ethically dubious, and b) too prone to compounding errors to be reasonably plausible.
