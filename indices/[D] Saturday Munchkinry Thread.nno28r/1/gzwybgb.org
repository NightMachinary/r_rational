What are the usual ways to munchkin matter creation/manipulation magic? I'm trying to do a reconstruction of the Schools of Magic trope by making them more predictable so I can commission some art to post on [[/r/magicbuilding][r/magicbuilding]].

Let's say mana is some kind of non-relativistic aether that is always measured to be at rest in vacuum, but is otherwise repelled by matter unless converted into more stable forms.

Give it three laws:

1) *Mana cost is super-exponential in information density*. So e.g., cells are completely out of the equation, but perfectly arranged carbon nanotubes are fair game, paper/leather/resin all stop mana much better than metals do, no use trying to make computers more powerful than, say, finite-state machines, etc.

The meaning of information density here is roughly in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, let's assume all kinds of matter can be described by at most 1 MB of text. Then, we can rank the mana cost of creating various kinds of matter by how easy it would be to compress such a description.

2) *Mana cost is cubic in momentum-energy*, and *time to cast is linear with mana cost*. A building made of simple, inorganic compounds takes months to build. But manifesting 1 mole of carbon-12 takes one second. Furthermore, if you try to instantiate some complex object without the requisite mana cost, nothing will happen except wasting your mana (thus, build incrementally!)

3) *Magic is atemporal*. That is, by 'magic' we mean transporting ourselves to a parallel universe where its effects have always existed. So throwing a fireball means teleporting into a universe where the only difference is that there's some hydrogen-oxygen mixture that's currently burning in front of you, rewriting everything else so that this is physically plausible.

Let's peg the specialised forms of mana into twelve different schools (codenamed with zodiac signs for now):

1.  *Aries*: the ability to convert mana into matter

2.  *Taurus*: the ability to "see" causal connections between pieces of matter; so less fortune-telling and more animal tracking

3.  *Gemini*: the ability to apply magic to mana itself; e.g., Gemini can use Taurus to predict how a given volume of mana will be used

4.  *Cancer*: the ability to create non-quantum light, i.e., everything that proceeds from Maxwell's equations, so for example, you can use the ultraviolet catastrophe to make light bombs

5.  *Leo*: the ability to define finite-state machines on matter; e.g., implement Maxwell's demon

6.  *Virgo*: the ability to wear mana as a metaphysical 'mecha suit' to enhance bodily abilities, e.g., speed, endurance, strength; somewhat similar to Glory Girl's force-field

7.  *Libra*: the ability to create ectoplasm that LARPs matter; think simulacra in MoL which do not have internal structure but otherwise act as if they do; this is also subject to Law #1 so making anything with a brain is prohibitively expensive

8.  *Scorpio*: the ability to transmute one kind of matter into another, following equivalent exchange-like rules

9.  *Sagittarius*: the ability to add deltas to a piece of matter's position and its derivatives

10. *Capricorn*: the ability to change the mechanical properties of matter. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_properties#Mechanical_properties][this list]].

11. *Aquarius*: the ability to 'restore' matter to a previous set point

12. *Pisces*: the abiliity to 'stop' or 'end' things; e.g., turn a volume of space to absolute zero

As it stands, there's a lot of ways to munchkin these abilities already. So some of the limitations I decided to move over to worldbuilding, such as:

- Each mage can only convert raw mana into one of the twelve types. Also, to affect matter you need to keep it in contact with the corresponding mana form so that mana shaping becomes an extremely important fundamental skill for mages.

- Mages have paltry mana regeneration capabilities. Most mana is thus sourced from SCP-like entities which only carry specific forms, and as such /mana is dangerous to obtain and is really hard to come by/.

- Magical tradition is young. Only 1 in 100 000 people are born with the potential to learn magic (though it can be taught given enough exposure), and so it took until the 1800s for there to be enough people to start a proper magical tradition. Since Law #3 means all magic is locally reality-warping, it's really hard to do science on it so there are various competing and mutually contradictory theories still.

- Corollary of the previous bullet point: Want to do some megaproject? Tough luck: there are only ~77 000 mages in the world and normal people forget magic as soon as they look away from it.

- There's an anti-munchkin league of powerful mages who are very much inclined to end your life if you become too powerful, and they employ the largest collection of Taurus mages. So secrecy and subterfuge is paramount if you want to end the world.

--------------

Some possible munchkinries that I may or may not want to curtail:

- recursive self-improvement
- simulacra apocalypse
- creating an armament of Little Boys
- going Scrooge McDuck on the non-magical economy
- piece of ground + magically-enhanced aerodynamics + relativistic speeds = kinetic bomb
- using the reality adjustment clause to speed up technological progress, since e.g., creating nanotubes in vast quantities retroactively manifests factories that can plausibly deliver you such quantities
- expelling vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere to speed up global warming and force non-mages to fund your space elevator
- changing the viscosity of the hotspot under a supervolcano to bring about the next mass extinction event
- a lens-based mosquito targeting system

Anything else I should watch out for?
