You have the ability to create a foam upon your hands. Upon this foam, you have a naturally secreted flammable substance that you can actively choose to secrete onto the foam. You can make the foam as large as you want, but the flame will generally last five seconds for each seven centimeters of foam upon your hand. You can put this foam upon other objects, as well with the flammable resource. Alternatively, if not upon your skin, you can secrete an acid onto the foam (Note, you cannot create the acid without the foam, nor the flammable substance). The acid Can burn human skin, and will burn through rubber, latex, and pretty much any other surface.

Disclaimer: This is for a story, but I'm hoping to get a little bit of help. I have some obvious ideas, and I'm currently thinking through others, but I'd enjoy what other people think.
