The reason that the foam is secreted is because it acts as a protection from the fire, so no, you are not fire immune. You can, however, create the foam over every surface of your body, if you choose to. I was thinking of the acid burning rather quickly, as I do intend upon it being Armor Burning. I'm not certain about the foam at the moment, but I'd say liter per second.

I would like to remind, that you can use the power to light fires from afar. In terms of applications, you could foam someone's eyes to blind them, than act with the acid. Alternatively, you could foam a person and then invert the fire by having the foam secrete the flammable resource on the inside.

Those are some of the things that I've thought of in application so far.
