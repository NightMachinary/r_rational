Does this come with the secondary powers of immunity to fire and acid? If not, it's best to be very careful with the power.

How fast can you secrete the foam? As fast as you want? A liter per second? Milliliters per second?

In terms of use, the fire is good for violating thermodynamics / warming things, and might be useful in combat depending on the above questions. If the acid can burn through pretty much anything, that's the real powerful part of the power. Depending on how fast it acts, you are possibly a deadly armor-piercing melee combatant, and could probably find good employment dissolving things.
