Information Divination Magic. Magic allows you to “add”/“create” information in a probabilistic fashion.

- With around 6 seconds of hand gestures and words you can add or create 1-2 bits of information.

- With two to three minute of words and hand gestures you can add or create 8-16 bits of information.

- With a few hours of meditating and occasional chanting you can add or create between 256-512 bits of information.

There are a few modifiers and limitations:

- A prop/tool that lines up with the type of information you are trying to get can generally double (and if it perfectly lines up triple or rarely quadruple) your bits of information. I.e a Ouija board for a one word message, a dowsing rod for a direction or location, an ornate pen and writing desk covered in occult symbols for short written messages.

- Having a group of N people supporting the primary caster adds 1/2^{N} for each additional person... so a really large group approximately doubles a persons bits of information

- You can't stack castings at the same time or within 4 times the time interval it took to cast. I.e. if you spend 3 hours at your writing desk making an automatic message with 1024 bits of written information, you can't get anymore information on the topic you were writing about for 12 hours after. 12 hours later though, you can continue the writing...

- Repeating the hour long casting can up to double the information on the base amount, I.e. with the writing desk you could get 2048 bits on the 2nd and later repetitions.

Using this magic works as follows:

- the words/gestures/chanting are mostly intuitive in a glossalasia kind of way, 1-2 bits require barely any practice, minute casting require a few months practice, hour long castings require a year or two if practice

- Information takes the form of intuition on picking between several options/choices/alternatives you are aware of and, probabilistically speaking might have done anyway. For instance, 1 bit of information might allow you to accurately pick between two options you were 50/50 on. 2 bits would allow you to accurately pick between 4 options. Picking can take the form of a lucky guess, a Ouija board or dowsing rod moving just right. With automatic writing, notably, you aren't paying the information cost on each letter but rather over the space of possible sentences you might write with spikes in information usage for especially informative words.

- For cases were the options are widely spread, some of the bits of information go to if the caster had counterfactual information that would allow them to narrow the options.

- if the options are unclear and/or very widely spread and the bits of information insufficient, the casting may fail entirely or give a simple approximation that lumps options together.

- Divinations about the future are limited by what in principle is knowable/predictable based on the present. In practice this means unintelligent and mechanistic but chaotic processes are predictable (I.e. the weather), intelligent processes (I.e. involving people) that are based on simple understandable choices are predictable but a bit fuzzy/noisy, and stuff that interacts with other future divination are entirely unpredictable.

So major obvious applications?

Minor handy little usages?

Edit: upped the information for the hour long casting, upped the seconds for fast casting to reduce discrepancy on time value of casting.
