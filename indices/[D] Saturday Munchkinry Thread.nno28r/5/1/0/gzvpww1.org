With other diviners regularly asking questions about the future and the stock market being noisy and chaotic, the buy/sell could only be within the context of the present. Would the buy/sell still be useful then?

The aliens question made me realize I left a major loophole... different people have different ideas about what options are possible/probable and the divination magic acts on options as the individual caster perceives them, not according to any universal prior. So a lot of big but simple questions can get asked using divination and by comparing between the answers people get, you can converge on the right answer very clearly. As a world building side-effect, I can see religious fundamentalists everywhere trying to deny the power of divination when the magic disconfirms their beliefs.
