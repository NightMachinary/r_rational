Big uses: Game the stock market (BUY/SELL on a particular stock being 1 bit of information), find natural resources (the dowsing rod). Find the answer to most any question (e.g., “are there intelligent aliens Y/N?”).

Minor uses: get good restaurant recommendations, choose what brands of stuff to buy, find people who you would be good friends with.
