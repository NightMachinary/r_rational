If you just stick it on a lever connected to an axle to drive a generator you could probably get a few hundred gigawatts out of it before you run into limitations of material science. That's not a bad result, but it's hardly going to change the world either, and I suspect there are better ways to use it.

Even if your goal is power generation, there's probably a smarter method of harnessing it.
