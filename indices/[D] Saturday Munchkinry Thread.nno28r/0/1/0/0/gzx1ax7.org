Hm, I'll assume that's true. Does the mechanism controlling the force also control the direction of the force? Also, is the mechanism part of the cube or is it remote with a range? It'd be pretty hard to change the amount of force once it's moving if it's part of the cube, but not impossible.

I wonder if this could be used to stop tsunamis or hurricanes.
