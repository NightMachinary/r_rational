The force is always in one direction relative to the block. You can control the magnitude of the force, but if you want to steer it, you have to rotate the block by some other means. There's nothing stopping you from turning the block around however you choose to do so, but it won't do it by itself.

Let's say that the interface for controlling the block is by applying a small voltage across part of it. You can glue a simple circuit with an antenna to the block to make a remote control if you like, but your interface device won't share the block's indestructible nature and can get crushed by impacts or by acceleration.
