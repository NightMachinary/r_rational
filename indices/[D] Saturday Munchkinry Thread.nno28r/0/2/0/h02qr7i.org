Any force is sufficient, it just takes forever with any kind of reasonable force. SpaceX's Starship has a thrust of 72 MN, if you had a million of those all pointing in the same direction it would accelerate the earth by about [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281000000+*++72+MN%29+%2F+%28mass+of+earth%29+in+m%2Fs%5E2][1.2Ã—10^{-11} m/s^{2}]]

With that much force it would take about [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.01+*+earth+orbital+velocity+%2F+%281000000+*++72+MN+%2F+%28mass+of+earth%29+in+m%2Fs%5E2%29][780.000 years]] to change earth's orbital velocity by 1%^{*.}

If you want to do it in a more reasonable time frame, you could use the force of 100 billion Starships to get it done in about 8 years, but then you'd have to find a rock formation that can withstand the force of a hundred billion Starships all pushing against whatever surface area one side of this cube has, which is probably not trivial.

 

^{^{*} I have no idea by how much you have to increase orbital velocity to decrease the amount of sunlight hitting the earth enough to counteract our current levels of carbon emissions, but single digit percent seems the right ballpark}
