Lift /very large/ masses very slowly into low orbit. A slow trip to low orbit with it in the center of a huge and hard to lose structure is unlikely to lose it like other space travel would, and if you can get heavy stuff into orbit like that using conventional methods to go anywhere else is fairly easy. For anything further away it's only worth it once the mass you're moving is to large to move any other way, and even using it on an extremely low acceleration is worth it. Probably, it's main use would be terraforming, especially very slowly altering orbits of things that you cant use conventional rockets on /because the reaction mass is pulled back to them by gravity/.

If you do want to generate power, rather than use it directly to spin something, pushing it /through/ something like a planet or iron star to create heat repeatedly, then using geothermal power form that heat, is probably more efficient in the long term.
