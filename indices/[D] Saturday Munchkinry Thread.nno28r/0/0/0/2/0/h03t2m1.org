It's the "going around for another pass" part that is difficult here. Any additional machinery you attach to the block isn't going to survive plowing through a planet at near light speed, so you'd lose control of it. You could make repeated impacts at speed high enough to leave the block buried, I guess, and dig it up again for each repeat, or let it pass right though with only a tiny fraction of its energy still remaining so that it's still recoverable.
