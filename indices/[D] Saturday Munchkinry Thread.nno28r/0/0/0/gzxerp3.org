I guess you could /very slowly/ use this to get Venus spinning again and try to give it a day/night cycle alongside more conventional terraforming.

Perhaps more realistic for people who don't want to wait that long, you could adjust Earth and Mars to have exactly 24 hour days, much to the relief of anybody who has to code anything using time standards.
