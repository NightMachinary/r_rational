You have a small block, about ten centimetres across, which can produce a force from nothing. The anomalous force acts on the block and causes it to move. This violates conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. The amount of force it produces can be controlled by some simple automatable mechanism. There's no upper limit on how much force it can produce, but for practical purposes if you request too much force it will just break whatever you connect it to. The block itself is indestructible, but easily lost if you accidentally bounce it off into space.

The main limitation is that there is only one, and will only ever be one.

It can be used to generate power of course, but doing the obvious thing of connecting it directly to a turbine shaft won't get you all that much more than a conventional nuclear power plant. Good but not amazing.

It can be used in spaceflight, but at very high risk of losing it forever.

What's the best application for this thing?
