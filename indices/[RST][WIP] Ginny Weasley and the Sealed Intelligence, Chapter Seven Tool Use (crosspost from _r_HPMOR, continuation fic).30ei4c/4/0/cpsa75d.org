Actually it was the opposite for me. The redefinition of nundu and leithifolds made sense and the idea of death having a lifecycle from mere physical death to soul death to minor apocalypse is cool.

The dragon thing though broke immersion. Dragons are basically daleks now? Small weak creatures controlling a much larger body :/
