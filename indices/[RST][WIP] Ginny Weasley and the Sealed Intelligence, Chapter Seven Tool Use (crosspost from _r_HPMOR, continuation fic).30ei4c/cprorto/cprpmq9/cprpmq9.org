me too. considering the original books, he's probably going to be the antagonist. Harry defeated Voldemort with an obliviate. What's Lockhart's favorite spell, again?

Maybe Lockhart will realize that Harry is a copy of Tom Riddle or something. It's too early to really make a reliable prediction. But wouldn't it be interesting if Harry gets lured down to the Chamber of Secrets by Lockhart in an attempt to expose him as the heir of Slytherin, and Ginny has to go save him? Maybe Lockhart will make the basilisk into an inferius or something. And students who the inferius basilisk looks at get petrified instead of killed because the basilisk isn't alive anymore.
