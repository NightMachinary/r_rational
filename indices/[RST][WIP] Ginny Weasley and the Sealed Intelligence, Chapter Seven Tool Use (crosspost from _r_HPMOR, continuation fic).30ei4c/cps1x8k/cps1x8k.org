Man, I was not expecting the Nundu to be redefined as a conglomerate of Dementors. (In canon, the Nundu is basically a big magic leopard.) That was pretty much the most jarring thing; whereas the dragon weakpoint thing was cool and the idea of lethifolds being baby dementors seemed reasonable, totally redefining what a Nundu is really doesn't work for me.

Maybe make up a new magical creature name? Nundu doesn't even sound particularly entropaic or deathly.
