W/r/t canon, fair enough. I had internalized "wizards aren't Christian," but this is mostly fanon. See [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/16058/are-there-practiced-religions-in-the-wizarding-world][here]] for a good discussion--it seems more accurate to say wizards in canon are as religious as the UK in general in the 1990s (that is to say, not very).

In HPMOR, on the other hand, wizards are at least much less religious, if not totally areligious, and explicitly not Christian. (See e.g. Minerva's mention of "Muggle religion" in Ch. 61).
