Ah, I just interpreted that as disdain. Obviously, Wizards would grow to somewhat dislike "Muggle religion" which they associated with witch burning. "Muggle religion" the same way we laugh at primitive people who don't allow us to take pictures for fear it will steal their soul, or worship cargo cults, etc.

There is a sense that they're areligious - There's no obvious theology mentioned and also they don't seem to have religious rituals. But then again they have /actual magic/. They /live/ in a world of real, actual magic and rituals. Why would they feel the need to make them up? The psychological need for ritual to make sense of things would be fulfilled by living in that reality.

  it seems more accurate to say wizards in canon are as religious as the UK in general in the 1990s

Yeah, I suspect the real reason is that Rowling wrote them in her own image and her own culture - instinctively spiritual with respect big beliefs about souls and afterlives but not publicly religious, with a few kooks who believe in tea reading hanging around the peripheries. And I'm guessing she drew more from Wicca and stage magic than actual pre-Christian practices in designing world mechanics.
