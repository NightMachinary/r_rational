Wizards are religious? They believe in an afterlife (both for canon and hpmor). They celebrate the same holidays (though I suppose that could be muggle influence). There's clearly something at least nominally religious going on even if canon never brought it up.

Going off Merlin, we can assume Wizard culture gradually split off from Muggles during or after King Arthurs time and gradually became more insular, which means they should show signs of roots that are somewhere between pagan and Christian - as they, in fact, do. (Yule ball, etc).
