That's a fair point, but this fic is derived from HPMOR, no canon. I assumed that celebration of holidays were a sort of hangover from the muggle world. At the very least, no one in HPMOR discusses religion except to say that it's comforting lies and not held seriously by anyone of importance. No one is seen expressing a concern over what God thinks.

I can get behind the fact that this author has a divergent point and can write whatever they want, but it seems to really jar with the spirit of its predecessor.
