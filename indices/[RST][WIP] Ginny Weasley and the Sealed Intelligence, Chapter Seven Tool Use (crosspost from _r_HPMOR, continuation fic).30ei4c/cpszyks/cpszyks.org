Noooo! Don't nerf the killing curse like that! It's specifically said that you cannot block the killing curse, EXCEPT for the patronus v2.0. Why don't all wizards run around with armor? They have non-living clothes on, why doesn't that protect from killing curse?

edit: Also, Dementors are death is a public knowledge thing now? Wtf?

edit2: I'm pretty sure Nundu isn't officially formed of dementors, and if it was, why the fuck would they keep all the dementors at the same place? Do they want to form Nundus? I think this fic takes too many artistic freedoms.

edit3: Lockhart knows Hermione has the true cloak of invisibility? And he tells that to the whole class? Seriously? Ah, he didn't, and he somehow found out at a glance, and told the whole class who couldn't have figured it out themselves anyway... Aaaand he obliviates everyone. Wtf.

edit4: Ginny didn't figure out she could make a bookcase or something shine, but had to make everyone else a target? That's pretty bad.
