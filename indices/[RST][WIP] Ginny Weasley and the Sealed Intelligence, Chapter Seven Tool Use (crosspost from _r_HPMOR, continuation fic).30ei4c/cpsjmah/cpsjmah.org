The only thing that bothered me about Lockhart's speech was how it basically made Quirrel's sound stupid and/or incomplete only because the author added a bunch of new v2.0 magical creatures. Pretty sure Quirrel would've mentioned something like Nundus if they existed in the original story. Still pretty cool though.
