I admit it feels odd as it was presented, but this was ginny's perspective, after all. Hermione's first impulse being "under the cloak" is entirely reasonable. Harry then convincing her that there's no real danger, the lesson is a good one, and that for them to just solve it for everyone would negate the value of the lesson, also seems reasonable to me.
