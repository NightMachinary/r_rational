That is one of the few things I think was reasonable about this chapter. Lockhart is, after all, the man who has made his name betraying hero after hero. That he thinks it's a legitimate tactic is reasonable. admitting it is somewhat less so, but if Lockhart is a Slytherin I can even see that working out in his favor.

Less reasonable is the cloaking, at this point is be very surprised if both Harry and Hermy can't cast good protegos, or go with my personal reaction, and get everyone to spam ma-ha-su as fast as possible. (When you're a tiny pixie a punch would hurt, and friendly fire is a minor issue. Well that unlucky got who gets hit with 50 would be sore , but alive)
