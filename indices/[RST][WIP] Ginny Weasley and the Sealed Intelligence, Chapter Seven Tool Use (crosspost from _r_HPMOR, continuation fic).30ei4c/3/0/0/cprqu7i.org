It may be understandable as an immediate reaction, but it appears that the attack was ongoing for some time. So what, they were just sitting under the Cloak for some minutes, because Harry is so precious now, you must call an orbital strike if someone so much as sneezes in his direction?

Edit: That 'no consequences' criticism raised against HPMOR also totally applies. Harry and Hermione /presumably/ screwed up? No matter, let's obliviate a whole room of people for convenience of our heroes, and carry on with the Status Quo. Lockhart is a scum, of course, he rewards Ginny for an outright /betrayal/, so it's a lesser point, but still.
