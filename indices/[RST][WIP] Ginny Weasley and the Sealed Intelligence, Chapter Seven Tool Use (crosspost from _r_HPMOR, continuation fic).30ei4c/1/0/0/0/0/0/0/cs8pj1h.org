Oh it was weird alright. It started with Harry dealing with actual PTSD and antisocial behavioral disorder from his time with the Dursleys, combined with independent experimentation of wandless magic before he got his letter. His approach to beating Voldemort is much more pragmatic, involving transfigured sniper rifles and grenades and such. Cool premise, right?

Then it ended with Harry's mom being resurrected through the Philosopher's Stone + his blood to kill Voldemort after he gets his new body. Harry becomes somewhat crippled (nerve damage from extended Crucio) and goes to America to live with Lilly, who's apparently into religion in a big way. A whole sequel story was written that I skimmed, where apparently the factions from the game Command & Conquer show up and for some reason the magical world has to help GDI beat NOD, all the while Harry learns to accept God's grace.

Like I said, started promising, ended up in a very strange place. The whole thing reminded me strongly of Orson Scott Card descent into ideological extremism. I ended up chatting with the writer via private messages for a bit, and they turned out to be fairly intelligent but a staunch Young Earth Creationist that ultimately said that when confronted with evidence against his faith, he had to side with his faith.

So yeah. I was a bit concerned with it showing up in this fan-fanfic. Religion is so rarely handled well in regular fiction, putting it in fanfic, let alone rationalist fanfic, can very quickly drive things off the rails.
