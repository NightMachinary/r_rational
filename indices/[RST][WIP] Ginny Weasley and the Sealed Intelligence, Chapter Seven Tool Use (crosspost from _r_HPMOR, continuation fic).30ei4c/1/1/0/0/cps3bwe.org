Alternate explanation: /smart people of academic raising/ (like Draco, Voldemort, Snape, and even Dumbledore) are very commonly atheists in magical Britain. The meme is still around, perhaps even with a majority of salt-of-the-earth wizards, but the kind of people who send their children to a magical boarding school (wizard Harvard) instead of, say, homeschooling them, are the kind of people who "know better than to believe in silly superstitions like that." Meanwhile, people-who-grow-up-reading-books (like Harry and Hermione) are very commonly contrarians (and therefore atheists, for one thing) no matter where they're found. Together, that's every character whose opinion we cared about in HPMOR.

Whereas the Weasleys are the kind of people I'd expect to cling to faith (if just for the "community experience" of churchgoing), even in a culture where most people are atheists.
