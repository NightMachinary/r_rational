They do celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts, don't they? Trees and everything. (And they say "Christmas", not just "holidays.") I always assumed when reading canon that that was a subtle statement that wizards live in pretty much the same historical-cultural meme-plex as muggles. (Well, it might have diverged somewhere in the last few hundred years---maybe since Salem---but most religions are older-enough than that for wizards to think of them as culturally "theirs" inasmuch as muggles do.)
