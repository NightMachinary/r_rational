It's more probable that within the first dozen billion years someone invents time travel and goes back to the big bang again. Let's assume that within each billion years there's a 90% chance that within a billion years someone in the universe resets back to the big bang. Consider the number of times time has been reset to the big bang. Skewing how probability works a bit, each time the number goes up by one, the number of digits that change represent the number of billion years that have passed, with the rightmost digits being the closest to the big bang. If each civilization that comes to exist finds itself in some random billion of years, it should expect to be close to the big bang.
