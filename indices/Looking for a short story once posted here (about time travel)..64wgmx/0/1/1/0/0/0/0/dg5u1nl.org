I am no cosmologist, but it was my understanding that complex life in the first 10 billion or so years was considered very unlikely due to the lack of heavier elements. 1-2 generations of stars had to nova to seed the universe with elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. If correct, that would cut the timeframe by two thirds, not counting time for that complex life to actually evolve.
