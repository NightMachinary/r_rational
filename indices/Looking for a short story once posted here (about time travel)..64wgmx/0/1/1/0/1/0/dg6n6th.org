There's a lot of potential civilizations across the universe in each billion years. I only need one of them to go back to the big bang, no matter what the others do.

I think there's another important question here: Does resetting time reroll random events beyond the target's light cone? If yes, there should immediately be some civilzation somewhere outside the target's light cone that resets again, shuffling the universe through a lot of instant rerolls.
