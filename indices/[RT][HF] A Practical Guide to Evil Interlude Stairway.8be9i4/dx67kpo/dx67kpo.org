So lets see the traps Procer has fallen for, either intentionally or unintentionally.

1. Scrying can be intercepted, blocked, or tools of assassination if the mages are skilled enough.

2. They do not seem aware of Cats mobility through gates, and thus dont seem to understand that they wont be able to outflank her.

3. They assume that this much sorcery can be flung around without raising an eyebrow or two, and that the 2 mage names of the empire cant figure out a way for this to backfire.

4. They assume the Daoine are going to even negotiate, which doesnt seem likely. They know the monster that lives south of them.

5. Still referring to Cat as Black Queen, and we saw the heroes doing that too. The sword saint and hero crew may get caught in a trap if Cats been keeping a lid on her transition. Cat didnt use an Aspect during the hero fight.

6. They dont seem aware of the Dead King mobilizing, so that Northern push is likely to get encircled itself.

So either Cat, Black, and First Prince are playing 6D chess at high level, with narrative weight transfers. Or someone dropped the ball on information warfare somewhere.
