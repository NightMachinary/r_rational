Yeah, too many of her First Prince's political opponents dumped into one host, with enough heroes to either prop it up or even take command when the expendable leadership is cleared off the board.

Though, if I'm right about Cat trying to trick Cordelia and make her power base unsteady enough for a peace settlement, she might have used their secret agreement to assemble all her enemies in one place and then empower them in some way (or at least cripple the loyal leaders more). The future Princes' Graveyard is a point against a scheme that convoluted, though.
