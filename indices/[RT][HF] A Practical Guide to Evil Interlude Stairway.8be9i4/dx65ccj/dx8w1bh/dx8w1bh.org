The question is, what does Cordelia get out of it? Cat tricking Cordelia is to me, at this point impossible. Cordelia tangled with the Empress and won, she is the superior manipulator by miles

I'm pretty sure the Principate is based on the Holy Roman Empire, (In which case, Praes could be the Ottomans and Callow poor Hungary in the middle, but that's besides the point)

So maybe the plan is to reform the principate? Consolidate power in Cordelia and unite it into a stable empire that has no need of crusades?
