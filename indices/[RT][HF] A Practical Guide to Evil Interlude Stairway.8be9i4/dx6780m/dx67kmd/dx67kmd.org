Well, he doesn't /know/ about warp gates and that Cat has multiple subordinates capable of making them, so from his point of view the plan has a good start. Add to that his numerical advantage in soldiers and heroes, the fact that gating towards uncharted territory across the entire country will take more than two days (Cat was busy hunting heroes that came from south, and she'll need to assemble her entire army and the Woe) and the risk of heroes waiting on the other side of the gate, and Cat's best response is to scry Kegan.

EDIT: On a second thought, [[https://practicalguidetoevil.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/continent-map.pdf][the map]] shows the thinnest point in the mountains to just a little closer to Harrow than Dormer is to Laure, and Cat stated in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/chapter-22-govern/][chapter 22 of the third book]] that marching that way would take more than a week, and that time in Arcadia can warp for plot reasons, so she has all the chances to arrive just in time.
