Frankly I dont think you can exactly retire from being a Villain or a Named. Like I know a claimant can surrender their tie to the name, but I dont think theres been a case of retirement. Also, to be Named is both a blessing and a curse given to those with the aptitude for it, Cats done too much to go back now.
