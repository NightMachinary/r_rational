I think you're severely underestimating the scope of the crusade and Cordelia's commitment to it. She'll soon have to fight on five fronts: North and South Callow, Free Cities, Dead King and the sea invasion of Praes. She's sacrificed a lot manpower, gold and political connections to get the crusade going in the first place.

She's not an idealistic Hero but it doesn't make sense to commit so many resources only to set your goal on drawing even. Her primary objective is almost certainly to conquer both Callow and Praes. She might have backup plans in case things go bad (like her deal with Cat) but imo they're just that - backup plans.

I agree that in all likelihood she knows the mages are compromised but I think she simply doesn't have a different solution on hand.
