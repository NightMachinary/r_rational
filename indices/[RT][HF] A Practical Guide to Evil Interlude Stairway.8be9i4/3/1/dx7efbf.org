How likely is it that Cordelia knows her mages are inferior as well? She isn't calling this crusade for noble reasons, she's using it as a political tool to expend Procer's remaining military surplus after the civil war which put her on the throne. She might want to annex Callow, but considering how hard it is going to be to control a population which now recognizes the Black Queen, a Praesi agent, as their rightful ruler, she has to realize that would wind up being temporary at best. Callowans have no reason to like the Principate at this point, as they are measurably better off, on average, under Praes than they were even under their own monarchy. The fact that the Empress allowed Cat to exterminate the "traditional" Praesi villain and that the Empire is about to eliminate most of the nobility which hold Callow's true ire mean that Ater has done nothing recently except meet the needs of Callow.

Cordelia has to know this. She isn't an idealistic Hero, and she knows that Callow won't just go with them because both nations are nominally on the side of Good. She's too cynical for that blunder. So, she calls a Crusade, "captures" some Praesi mages to learn their secrets, then sets all the restless soldiers of her nation on her foreign enemies. They'll grind each other down, but she would prefer that the Crusade end in a narrow loss which keeps Praes at bay for a generation and lets her keep face for at least attempting to do the "right thing" while accomplishing everything she ever needed domestically. Deliberately sabotaging the communications of her own side is an excellent means of guaranteeing this happens without any way of tying the failure back to her.
