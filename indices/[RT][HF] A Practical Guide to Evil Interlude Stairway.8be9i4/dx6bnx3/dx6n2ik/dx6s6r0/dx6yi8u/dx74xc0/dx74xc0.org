Ranger, like Archer, is a neutral skill-based Name. Thief seems to be the same way, and doesn't have many brute-force combative applications for her Name besides. As for the bag, it's bound to her Aspect (Hold, specifically), and while she's able stuff there even things she can't touch directly, up to and including the sun, letting a demon get to an Aspect is how Cat lost her own.
