I really don't think that's necessarily true. The DM seems to be a standard DM which means he is neutral overall, and if Solace is a potential DMPC helping the party as it were I don't think that really demonstrates anything. The DM is just putting challenges in front of the party while providing the means to resolve them; he is neither antagonistic or friendly by nature, he is just the driving conflict of the story in its every aspect.
