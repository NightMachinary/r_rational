Interesting. So we know on top of the 7 companions we encounter in canon Fallateher was another option. So who would the 9th be?

The Fallateher verse probably ends with Juniper becoming a soul mage and using all Fallateher's creepy mind control methods as his default toolset. With Fallateher helping him minmax once they work out how the character sheet works, which he'd find fascinating because of its connection to the soul. Maybe this is the Evil!Juniper path?
