I read this over the course of several hours as I got 2 minutes to read something, so I never noticed it was not sequential...I actually really managed to read it as this weird action sequence that kept having companions show up... the ending confused me until I went back through and realized what was going on.

Gotta admit, I'm a little embarrassed about it...but it was also a really cool Aha! moment.
