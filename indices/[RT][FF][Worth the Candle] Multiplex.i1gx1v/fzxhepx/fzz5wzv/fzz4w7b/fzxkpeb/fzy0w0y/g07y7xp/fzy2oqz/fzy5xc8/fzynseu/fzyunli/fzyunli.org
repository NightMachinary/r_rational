Nice! To be honest, I first clicked on the Amaryllis one, noticed that it lead back to WtC, was confused, and then proceeded to read the rest linearly. Bad luck, I guess.

(Then I thought that it was weird for Juniper to enter all those different houses and find random companions from the future, but I am very good at automatically ignoring nonsensical plotlines.)
