I kind of want to see that fanfic now. In feel like Solacec would lead things in the opposite direction of Amaryllis, where Amaryllis stresses over character sheet optimizing and narrative structure, Solace would intuitively take things as they are.

Plus a timeline where Juniper doesn't neglect and whine about the Locus but actually appreciates it would be fun... although I'm not sure even Solace saving him would be enough to get this timeline.
