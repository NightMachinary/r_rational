That was a novel experience, I also enjoyed it a lot, I was afraid there would be no resolution but instead you managed to end it in an interesting way. Absolutely loved the bethel chapter, I laughed

Edit: oh fuck me I had no idea about the ending until I read about it on the discord, very well played, masterfully so
