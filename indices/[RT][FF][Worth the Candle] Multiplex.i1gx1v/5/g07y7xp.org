That was a fun read. I also read through your other "what really happened while high on unicorn blood" chapter, since that appears to be the only other thing you've posted. It's good work, and I gotta say the writing style matched closely to canon. You sure you're not just AW spinning out some non-canon canon to get anonymous feedback on it?
