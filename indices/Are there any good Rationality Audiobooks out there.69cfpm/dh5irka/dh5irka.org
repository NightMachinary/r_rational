[[/u/raymestalez][u/raymestalez]] made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5us4xo/meta_rational_audiobooks/ddx4ufb/][a list a couple months ago of some.]]

In addition to what they listed, there's also a [[http://audiotwig.dauber.kim/][Twig]] audiobook, which is another book by Wildbow (writer of Worm).

Edit: [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1096][Also various shorter things from the same people that made the HPMOR audiobook,]] and a [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705][Metropolitan Man]] audiobook, which I realized weren't included in that list because I listed them in a different comment on that thread. I probably should have just linked that entire post, shouldn't I?
