The [[http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/We-Are-Legion-We-Are-Bob-Audiobook/B01L082HJ2/][Bobiverse]] series is pretty rational. It's about a kind of Tony Stark/Mark Watney type character who has his mind uploaded to a self-replicating Von Neuman probe sent out to explore the universe.

The character's hyper-competence may be taken to a slightly unrealistic extreme, but the books are otherwise pretty intelligently written, and definitely a fun read.
