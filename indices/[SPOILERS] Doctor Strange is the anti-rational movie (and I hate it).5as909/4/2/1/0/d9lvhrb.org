Hilary Clinton would have the same ability if elected, as does President Obama, as did George W Bush, as did the presidents before him. And yet, he specifically called out Donald Trump as being the probable ender of civilizations. Political bashing.

And I find it interesting that one person in this thread says "he's obviously not being serious" while you defend his statement, and both are being upvoted.
