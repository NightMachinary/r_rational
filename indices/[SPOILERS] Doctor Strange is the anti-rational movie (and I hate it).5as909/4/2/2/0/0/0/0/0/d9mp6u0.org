Sure, that's not what I meant. You disliking EY or tribal behavior is not something I (or anyone on this subreddit) is going to hold against you. You can like or hate whoever you want, etc.

But you're expressing that dislike in (what I feel is) a very uncivil manner. Like, "was caught wearing a string-bikini" is a pretty mean thing to say about someone who hasn't attacked you at all.
