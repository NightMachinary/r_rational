The intent of that line was to imply a situation a little less embarrassing than parading around in public without any clothes (the emperor's new clothes), as well as applying a little bit of humor to the situation.

Now if I had called EY, I don't know, a mouth-breathing moron with more fanboys than common sense, then yes, that would be a direct attack on EY, and your response would be completely justified. But I didn't, and you're overreacting.

EDIT: And again, it's not dislike of a person. I dislike that pointing out that EY is going against his own advice gets downvoted because of peoples' cognitive dissonance. In other words, it's people behaving irrationally on a subreddit devoted to rational thinking.
