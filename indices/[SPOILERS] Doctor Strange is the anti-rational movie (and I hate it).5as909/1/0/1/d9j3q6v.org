Yeah, this movie has a lot of moments where you feel something clever and sensible is about to happen, then it slaps you in the face and mocks you for expecting it to be smart.

For instance, in one scene Strange asks the bad guy "If you are really benevolent, why did you kill people?" That was the perfect setup for a brutal utilitarian response, "I'll kill millions of people if it's what I need to destroy Time and Death! They don't matter compared to the billions, the trillions of people I will save!"; instead we get a callback to Dr Strange's earlier nihilism, "I killed them because they don't matter and they're specks of dust in an uncaring universe.", which is really just a convoluted way of saying "I'm evil and and I don't care about killing people" while sneering at utilitarianism.
