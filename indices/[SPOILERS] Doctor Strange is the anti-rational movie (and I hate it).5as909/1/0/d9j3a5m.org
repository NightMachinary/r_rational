Actually, it sort of is worse. Glossing over important questions is Hollywood's M.O. There's magic, but no one thinks to ask the implications for technology, physics and science in general? That's a Tuesday over there.

Strange, however, asks the questions and then proceeds to utterly mess up answering them. Meeting the Ancient One, the typical Hollywood character would have said something about magic not being real, and then been shown magic, and then boggled at how small-minded they were. A rationalist protagonist would have explained how we're made of matter, the idea of a soul is silly, the universe doesn't care, and asked to be proven wrong.

Strange finds the anti-golden mean. He goes off on a rant about the universe being material and uncaring, just as articulate and sensible as a rationalist, but then proceeds to hold on to this idea religously, relenting only after being mentally thrown across the universe and back.

The Ancient One wasn't being aloof or myserious, she was perfectly willing to explain slowly and clearly to a modern, thinking, questioning person. It was the perfect setup for a rational story, where the protagonist doesn't have to wade through swamps of dogma and vaguely-described mechanics. The stage was set for an intelligent conversation in way you rarely, if ever see in movies, and he had to barge in there with a caricature of reason instead of the real thing.

So yes, it is more dumb than most Hollywood movies. Those are just stupid through and through. This one sets the stage perfectly for the rationalist, and then goes out of its way be dumb.
