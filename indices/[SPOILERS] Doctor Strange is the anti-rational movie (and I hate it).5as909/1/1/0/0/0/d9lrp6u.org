Well, I can play devil's advocate for both of those scenes.

Cap vs Spidey: Cap is an extremely skilled martial artist and has just sparred against Spidey for a bit, in addition to (possibly) observing him in action for quite a while (e.g. artfully dodging flying cars). Spidey seems to be physically superior to Cap in agility and maybe in strength, if not skill, and Cap would have known that.

Thor vs Cap's shield: Why would Thor, a literal alien, be bound by Earthling morals? He's clearly from a warrior culture and has no qualms about killing his enemies in battle. And, he is still holding back both vs Cap and vs Iron Man. If he wanted either of them dead, they'd be dead.
