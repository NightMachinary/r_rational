I haven't seen Doctor Strange, but the Captain America sequels have a similar weird anti-intellectual bent to what you seem to be describing?

I guess they're more /anarchist/ than anti-intellectual, with the whole "superheroes can't be bound by law because law might hypothetically conflict with doing the most good" theme, but it's certainly very similar.
