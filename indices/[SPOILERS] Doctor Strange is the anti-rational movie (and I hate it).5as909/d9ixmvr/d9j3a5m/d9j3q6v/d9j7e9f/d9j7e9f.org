Huh? His line was perfect; it communicated the same notion of a sacrifice of a short life to get everyone else the eternal one; but it did it in a witty way referencing earlier dialogue.

I think you're reading way too much into those 'setups'. The movie never even attempts to take itself seriously, and the viewer is expected to pick that up. Hell, the first scene where Strange is operating while being quizzed on random songs is explicitly there to set that tone. All those setups to 'rationalist moments' are just setups for gags.
