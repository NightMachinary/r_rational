I think you're disregarding the psychological components of the scene a little too much. I found it totally in character that a desperate, embittered, and by now hopelessly cynical Strange would fail to give the outlandish ideas their due in terms of rational examination, instead launching straight into a tirade about the uncaring nature of the universe, a worldview which is totally a projection of his own issues and despairs.
