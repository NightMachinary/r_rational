I think you nailed it.

Dr Strange behaving irrationally in that scene was perfectly consistent with what we'd seen of him so far, but it still annoyed me. Plus, he doesn't actually become more rational after that, he just switches from the "Science" tribe to the "Magic! (with defibrillators and weird wifi passwords)" tribe.
