Quote from a FB friend: "Does it bother anyone else that when Captain America dropped that aerobridge, that bridge that gets people from the terminal to the plane, on Spider-Man, he was totally probably killing Spidey? Like, Cap hadn't met Spidey before, and had no idea how strong Spidey was. Like, obviously in a few minutes of fighting you can tell Spidey is several times stronger than the average person. That doesn't mean he'll definitely be able to hold up several tons. He's also a kid. Cap didn't know that. Was he guessing Spidey would dodge? This wasn't a justified true belief.

Like, there is a different story where Captain America totally just killed a innocent American teenager, superpowers or no, and he is going to prison. This would be a big freaking deal. This has been bugging me for several months."
