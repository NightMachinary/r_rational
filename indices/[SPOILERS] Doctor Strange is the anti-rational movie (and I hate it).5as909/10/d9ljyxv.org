If you want relatively rational use of magic and supertech in a comic book verse, may I recommend the fanfic [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With This Ring]] (DC Young Justice self-insert)? It has some writing problems, but the main actually approaches magic with the appropriate level of "why are you not applying gains from trade to this?!"
