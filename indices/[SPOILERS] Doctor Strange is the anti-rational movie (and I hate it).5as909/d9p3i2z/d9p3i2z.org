The anti-rational writing intersected perfectly with a complete rejection of Sanderson's Laws to make this movie painful to watch. The rules of magic weren't internally consistent, and even where there were reliable rules, the characters failed at the most basic applications of what they HAD learned.

Seriously. Why would you RUN around a tilting, tessellating landscape fighting gravity shifts WHEN YOU ARE WEARING AN ITEM THAT ENABLES YOU TO FLY???? One which you have used successfully and apparently instinctively in prior scenes, and which ALSO has independent intelligence and could point out this solution itself? Maybe there's some anti-flying rule in the mirror realm but at no point was that explained or even hinted. Aaaaaaargh.

This is only one example, of course, but it's a really blatant one.
