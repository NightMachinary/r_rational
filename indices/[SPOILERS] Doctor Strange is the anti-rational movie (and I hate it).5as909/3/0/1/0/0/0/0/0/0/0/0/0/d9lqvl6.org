But why wouldn't any single individual who has a problem post the same thing?

Regardless of what "most" people think?

Also regardless of controversial of whether people think the movie should be rational or not I still think it is irrelevant. People should discuss the content of the post not say "It doesn't matter lol I liked it lol who cares lol why bother even making a thread lol it was just for jokes lol". 75% of the top four comments are basically telling the op that he shouldn't have bothered posting in not so many words. The one I've excluded probably could be thrown in there too.

It's just a sorry state when the OP wants a discussion about the rationality present in a movie and the 4 top comments are saying it isn't meant to be rational you fucking retard how could you possibly want something to be rational when it isn't meant to be you idiot.
