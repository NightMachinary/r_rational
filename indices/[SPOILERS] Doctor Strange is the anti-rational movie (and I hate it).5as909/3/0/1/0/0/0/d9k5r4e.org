The word "seriously" was a bit of a miscommunication from me (like when people use 'literally' for emphasis). I'm not, like, furious about this movie (once I've taken my pills).

I think if you're on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] for the reasons I am, which may or may not be the case, the irrationality of Dr Strange is going to bother you, which might have an impact on you enjoyment of the movie. I don't know why; I did like Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, so clearly "seriousness" is not the only thing at play, and I feel there's /something/ these movies have (or don't have) that's missing in Dr Strange.
