Clearly argued, and I see your point. I agree that it would be nice if even in posts in all caps reasoned discourse dominated the comments section.

The difference between simple signaling and what you did is someone is on the ground with a ouchie because you tackled them. If someone jumps around saying, "Look at me! Look at me!" you can just look away or say, "Stop, please. We're having a conversation."

This comment, for example, immediately garnered you my agreement. Much more effective than tackling, and no one has a scrape or bruise from the impact.
