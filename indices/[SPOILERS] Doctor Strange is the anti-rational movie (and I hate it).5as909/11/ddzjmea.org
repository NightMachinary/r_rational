I hate trite evilness and I have to say the villains were so disappointing. I thought during the speech about how it was immortal that maybe they'd be reasonable because stopping entropy is completely valid but nope they just made it super evil. Why does dom conquer? As a non entropic entity he could control the multiverse without conquering anything. He doesn't even have to wait since he exists outside time.
