I'm using the definition of the word "to have a low estimate of his personal importance". He doesn't ever think he has no important skills, but his transformation moment comes when he stops thinking of himself as intrinsically "better" than other people. Such as going out of his way to help those most in need, without regarding them as beneath him.
