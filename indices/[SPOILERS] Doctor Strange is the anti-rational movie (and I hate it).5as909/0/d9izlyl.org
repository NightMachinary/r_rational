Many of your problems with dr strange come from the fact that his backstory was locked in stone back in 1963. He isn't supposed to be a rational or believable character. He is supposed to represent a complex relationship between ability and hubris.

He is a talented character, brought low by his hubris. He travels the world, seeking to fix his problem without atoning for his sins. Only when he is truly humble does the world allow him to live up to his real potential. And whenever he becomes overly full of himself, he loses his powers and aids chaos, as a way of the universe punishing him for hubris.

It's an Aesop's fable. Not a modern, rational piece of fiction.
