... Does that mean you're /not/ going to write a witty rationalist Dr Strange parody? Well now I am sadness.

But yeah, this is not something I'd do on a regular basis. Dr Strange felt particularly aggravating at time, because the whole Agent Scully "stop taking the plot so seriously and accept that things are magical" theme sometimes felt like the movie was making fun of "me" in a mean way. But even then, I don't actually hate the movie (or only a little). I wouldn't recommend it to people who like rational stories, but I wouldn't think less of someone for liking or anything.
