Personally I liked the movie and while there were some annoying things I mainly thought it was rational enough for a hollywood movie.

He came there because it was the only lead he had left and it was the only thing he cared about. He accepts whatever mysticism bullshit they have going on and figures it's a cover for an experimental procedure because the idea that it's actually mysticism is highly unlikely. They then get patronising and start showing him random things (it really should be noted that they never say what parts of acupuncture or whatever work, just that they are based on something that actually does work) and tell him that this guy who had severe nerve damage basically learned to walk with a placebo.

This is like someone trying to save their company from financial collapse and then their colleague comes in and says they can get a bailout if they squeeze a rubber duck and jump in a circle. Sure, if Strange wasn't so arrogant he probably would have said something like "well can you prove it?" but he would have been expecting them not to.

Anyway, Swinton shunts his astral body because she's probably used to people having the perfectly logical reaction of disbelieving her and his first thought isn't "oh clearly this proves everything" but instead he assumes he was drugged because that's how these things are typically done. Here is where it's completely proven that magic is actually real and everything he ever knew was a lie and as soon as it happens he accepts it and asks to be taught like a rational person would.

As for him learning to use magic we skip past him learning all the minutia where he reads thousands of pages learning to focus his mind because the movie would have been awful if that wasn't the case.

His character is shown to be arrogant and headstrong time and time again and that's fine because as long as their flaw isn't "stupidity" any flaw can be present in a basically rational character. This is why he just tries out the awesome time manipulation that he just saw because he didn't see any warnings as they come in the end.

He chats with the guy who was completely trapped because he assumes that the minions would already be back if they could. It turns out that he dropped his gate-maker-thing in the desert without noticing so one of the minions finds it after a while.

The defib thing was annoying, the "death is good" was annoying, and how they brushed past some of the "you were born for magic" stuff was annoying. With that said, the evil ex-monks, Swinton, and Mordo all had good points as to why the others were untrustworthy or wrong. The ex-monks argument was based on the fact that Swinton had used Dormammu as a power source for centuries and since she keeps everyone else from doing the same thing it calls everything she says about him into question.

*Overall*, not a rational movie but certainly no less rational than the absolute majority of hollywood movies.
