I think WTR dances around the problem without solving it. It doesn't address the fact that Joker's rampages where he kills thousands of people really aren't that bad if all those people go to Heaven afterwards, for instance.

And while it does point out, eg the absurdity of a setting with super advanced technologies that don't spread, it doesn't make the setting any less absurd.
