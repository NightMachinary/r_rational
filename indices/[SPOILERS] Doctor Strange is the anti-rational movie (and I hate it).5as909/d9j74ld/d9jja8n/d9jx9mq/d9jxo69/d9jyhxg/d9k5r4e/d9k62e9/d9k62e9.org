Right, I'm not in any way saying that your review is out of place. I just feel like having a bit of signal in the comments saying "hey, I also really like rational fiction and it bothers me when a work is irrational and not aware of it, but in this case it didn't bother me because the entire thing is comedic in nature".

So yeah, I have no problem with your post, and the comment chain here is because I was just weirded out by how what I meant as "this seems to be a YMMV thing, rather than 'unwatchable piece of trash' thing" was apparently offensive enough to warrant a sarcastic takedown by [[/u/RMcD94]].
