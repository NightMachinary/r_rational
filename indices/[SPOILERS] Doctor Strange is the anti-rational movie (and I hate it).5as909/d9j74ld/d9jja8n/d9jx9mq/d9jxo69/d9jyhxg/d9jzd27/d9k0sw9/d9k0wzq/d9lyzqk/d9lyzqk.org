It was signaling. "I'm here; I like rational content. And I liked the movie. It's okay to like both." That was the extent of both [[/u/Anderkent][u/Anderkent]]'s message and intent.

If every comment here had been, "This isn't rational. Negative things," then those who identify strongly with this community (which you shouldn't) would feel some social pressure to also not like or not deem the movie worthy of watching.

Their comment was a gentle reminder that it's okay to dissent.

As an aside, it's not a good idea to tackle someone who says something you think had no value, or should not have been said. Everyone will just look at you oddly and not want to talk to you.

If other people smile and give thumbs up instead of ignoring whatever that person said, then that means what that person said had value to the other people around you. If you disagree, and think they should not value what that person said, again, tackling the person is a bad idea. Rather, clearly explain why you think what they said was not valuable. In doing so, open yourself to and in advance consider compelling arguments that would change your mind. If you're not open to those arguments, then you're trying to fit everyone else in your coin purse and it's really quite stuffy in there so please stop, ow, this hurts, I can't breathe, why are you doing this to us?!
