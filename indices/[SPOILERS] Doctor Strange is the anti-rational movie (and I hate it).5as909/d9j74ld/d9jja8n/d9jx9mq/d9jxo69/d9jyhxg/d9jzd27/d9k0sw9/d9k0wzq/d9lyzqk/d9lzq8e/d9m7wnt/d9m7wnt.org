Reading 5+ comments that are basically variations of "I disagree with the OP" does sting a bit when you are the OP :p

That said, I don't think the several disagreeing comments are out of place. My post was a long and angry message that signaled "DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE". If you think the movie is worth being watched by the people on this subreddit, you might feel that it deserves a strong "this movie is still kinda good" signal, hence the multiple responses.

Aside from that, I agree with TennisMaster2: you could have made your point without being confrontational about it. Of course, um, you're free to communicate however you want. But being less aggressive might have helped you drive your point across. :)
