All 5 of the top comments are signalling then.

Nor am I interested in this subreddit pandering to people who have Edit: not understood the most basic of rationalists tenets about tribalism, nor do I accept that anything about the rationalist community even remotely fosters the idea that there can only be rationalist content and everything else is terrible. If people feel social pressure due to tribalism to not like the movie then I don't care. I'd rather people stick to discussing the topic than signalling. If there comes a point where no one disagrees with a main topic (ie almost of the big names EY, AW, etc posts) then alright people can literally just signal, but still even then people should look at comment number 5 for examples of how to do that, not any of the other four.

  As an aside, it's not a good idea to tackle someone who says something you think had no value, or should not have been said. Everyone will just look at you oddly and not want to talk to you.

People don't look at people on the internet.

  Rather, clearly explain why you think what they said was not valuable.

You should be telling this to the guy who originally posted, as I mentioned in my first post I was being cathartic after seeing the fiftieth fucking signalling post instead of anything of actual bloody value.

In fact everything below the line is something you should be saying to the signallers.
