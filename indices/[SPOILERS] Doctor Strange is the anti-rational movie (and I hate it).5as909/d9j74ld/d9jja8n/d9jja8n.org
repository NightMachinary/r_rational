You should post this exact comment in every single thread on this subreddit. I mean clearly everyone here, including OP, totally thought this movie was aiming to be rational and I heard there's this one guy who thought Harry Potter was meant to be rational and even wrote a whole fanfic filled with subtle (really hard to notice them) criticisms of how irrational it was!

In fact, there's a whole subreddit dedicated to them and you should probably go tell them how much you enjoyed Harry Potter because they probably didn't know that you did.
