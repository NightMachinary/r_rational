1. Fold a sheet of paper into a rectangular prism. Draw the pentagram on one side so that the paper stiffens. Does it remain in its rectangular form?

If the answer is yes, then do the following:

1. Stiffen three sheets of paper, A, B, C. A and C are flat, B is a rectangular prism. Place A and C at the ends of B so that you have a pillar with a top and bottom. Pile stuff on the top. Can you make the pillar come apart, either by collapsing B or having C be cut?

If the answer to the last question is "no", then you have an (infinitely?) strong building material.
