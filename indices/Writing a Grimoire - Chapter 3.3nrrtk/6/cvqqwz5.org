Next step is to study the transition point, see if there's any way to detect what exactly is happening with the stiff paper, cold paper, etc, at the moment of the 'magic shift' or even afterwards. Not sure how you'd go about that, but maybe start with simple things like an EMF detector, thermometer, etc. See how cold the cold paper is getting, see how stiff the stiff paper is getting. Are we talking about something with an infinite tensile strength (instant space elevator!) or does it have an upper limit? What sort of weird shit is happening with the atomic bonds?

Other basic tests should be done (carefully) as well. See if what making small changes to the patterns do. Change one symbol and see what happens when you finish the design. The center symbol seems to be the key, but can anything happen before you input the center symbol?

Also, the symbols (triangle with line through it, etc) are clearly basic alchemical symbols. They should probably research the symbology, test other symbols with a similar history of use in 'magic' what happens when you use the same inner symbols, but use a hexagram or septagram instead of a pentagram?
