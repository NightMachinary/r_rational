Oh, we should absolutely be cautious about any procedure.

However I think the discovery of 'magical' effects from drawing pentagrams, especially in such circumstances, bumps up the probability that our cultural background on magic is actually grounded in fact from negligible to considerable.

Given the state of the world and the kinds of powers (or Powers) required to keep this a secret, and it's not looking like the conspiracy is friendly. So I'd avoid blood magic; it could be catastrophic and there are safer tests to try first. Like FOOF etching.
