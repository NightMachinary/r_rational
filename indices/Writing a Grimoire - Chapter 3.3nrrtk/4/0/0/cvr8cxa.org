That's only true if we assume that the myths about magic have any truth to them about blood. For all we know, a red marker will have the same effect as we imagined blood would have. Of course while blood being dangerous has a higher prior probability than for anything else, I'd still treat /any/ unknown, potentially dangerous, experimental procedure with caution and not just ones where we're using blood.

Of course, you're probably right that we should hold off on using blood until after a number of experiments have been done.
