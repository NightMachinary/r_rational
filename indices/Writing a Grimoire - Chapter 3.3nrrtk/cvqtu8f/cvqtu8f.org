This time, I recommend the next actions to take is to:

- Experiment with the frozen papers. Will they ever warm up? Try burning them or putting them on top of a radiator. Check how quickly they warm up if it occurs. Check if other objects are actually getting colder while in contact with the paper. It seems like it should be, but you can't be too sure when dealing with magic.

- EDIT: I'd also touch a thermometer to the paper for it's temperature and putting the sheet in a bowl/tray of water (check it later if the water freezes).

- Experiment with the hard papers. Is it sharp? How sharp is it? Test it on metal, wood, diamonds even if you can get it (I'd be willing to spend money for this test). You want to know how hard it is on the Mohs scale based on what gems it can scratch or be scratched by.

- Experiment with the hard papers. Will they break under any amount of pressure? Try placing them as a bridge between two chairs or anything that's available to rest two edges of the paper on (don't let anyone hold it during the experiment). Does it snap or bend under any amount of pressure?

- Experiment with the hard papers. How elastic is it? This can be tested based on how high things can bounce when you drop it from a high height onto the paper. So I'd use a lot of materials such a a rubber ball, a metal object, wood, or some plastic pen to see how high it bounces off the paper compared to how high the same objects bounce off the floor to measure how well the paper is absorbing energy from outside forces.

  - Note that testing for the Mohs scale, pressure resistance, and elasticity are all very different [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness][notions of hardness]] which is why a diamond can be a 10 on the Mohs scale and still be easily crushed by a hammer.

I'd recommend the next pentagram experiment to be:

- Try drawing the pentagram the same way except with the lines drawn first, the top two triangles drawn and then the middle triangle.

EDIT: I should probably explain how to do a [[http://www.oakton.edu/user/4/billtong/eas100lab/hardness.htm][Mohs test]].

If the paper scratches the following:

- a fingernail, it's hardness is 2 to 2.5.

- a copper penny, it's hardness is 3.

- a nail, it's hardness is 4.

- a knife blade, it's hardness is 5 to 6.

- window glass, it's hardness is 5.5.

- a steel file, it's hardness is 6.5.

- a streak plate, it's hardness is 6.5 to 7.

- a quartz, it's hardness is 7.

- a diamond, it's hardness is 10 or higher.

Note that materials of equal hardness will have difficulty scratching each other or only make small scratches (which is why our fingernails can't scratch themselves).

This [[http://geology.com/minerals/mohs-hardness-scale.shtml][site]] gives good instructions about how to safely conduct the Mohs test.
