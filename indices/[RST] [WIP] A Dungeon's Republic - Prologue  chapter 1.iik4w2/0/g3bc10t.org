I read your story, and while I find the premise interesting there are some serious flaws. If you want a more detailed review I can post one, but I think you need to reread and edit your story carefully. Be especially careful about run-on sentences, and try to make the dialog flow better.

As for this being a rational story, so far it seems like you're going in the opposite direction. There's a huge /Deus Ex Machina/ in your first chapter, which doesn't really bode well.
