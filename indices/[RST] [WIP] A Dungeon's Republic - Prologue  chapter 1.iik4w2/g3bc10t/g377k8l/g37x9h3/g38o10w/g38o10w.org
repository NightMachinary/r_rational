The story is going to be a hard fantasy rationalist take on both the "Dungeon Building" and "Kingdom Building" genres with an emphasis on trying to avoid a lot of the less rational tropes associated with this kind of story (Like having a single character knowing a ridiculousy amount of information on how to make different marvels of engineering or simply not bothering to explain the different mechanics on how a dungeon would work).

The story will also have a strong emphasis on characters developing their rational thinking skills in order to survive on an island with very limited resources.
