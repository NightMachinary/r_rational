  What happens if you keep piling on the changes? What kind of person can actually live on the edge of a singularity, keeping pace while all around them the world is melted down and re-forged monthly, daily, hourly?

One of my favorite books, available free at the above link by the author ([[/u/cstross]]). There are nine chapters and each one takes place about ten years after the previous one, which covers the leadup to the Singularity and more or less out the other side. I've got my dead trees version of it, which I treasure greatly, but it's /free/ here for the reading. It won the Locus award and got nominated for a lot of others. Lots of transhumanist themes going on, as it's more or less about the Singularity.
