  For example, someone linked me Mother of Learning, and I went through 65 chapters only to find out that the book is incomplete and the author probably has no idea where he's going with it, considering the lack of character and plot development.

Lack of plot development? Huh?

I'd advise you to stick with it; the author updates fairly regularly, and as someone who's been following it serially, plot development happens quite often and unexpectedly.

Web serials are basically the logical conclusion of a series-- Instead of giving you a fraction of a story at a time, then waiting years for the next part to be ready, you just get updated chapter-by-chapter. Referenced to non-web-serials, MoL is a bit more than 2 massive doorstopper books in.
