I know what a web serial is.

I read the whole thing. The last twenty chapters could have been been condensed to 2-3 chapters. Do we, as readers, need to know how the negotiations with each and every aranea colony went? Do we have to be described each and every morning at the start of the month and subsequent train journey?

The MC described his visits to Xvim at least 10 times, and every single time it went pretty much the same, and he thought the same things.

And meanwhile, something very original, the thought process of the simulacra is barely touched upon.
