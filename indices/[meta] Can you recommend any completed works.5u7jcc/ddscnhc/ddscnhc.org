The author of Mother of Learning knows exactly where he's going with it. He planned it all out before he started, and it shows, with a very complex mystery and lots of foreshadowing. I'm loving every chapter, and I know many others do too. If you thought it was amateurish, I'm not sure what I can recommend to you.
