[[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] is interesting... though the romance in it feels a little bit like wish fulfillment to me, which turned me off a bit. But the main premises and the way powers are taken to their logical conclusions is appealing.

I'm not sure if you're okay with fan fiction, but you might want to check out [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]] (a Naruto story). I found it to be well written and it's complete.

Also [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] is a very good take on the rise of General Artificial Intelligence that uses aspects of the My Little Pony Frienship is Magic universe (though it's set in the real world). Don't let the source material turn you off, because it's not important at all to understanding the story and the way the author integrates it into a real world setting is quite interesting. I'd never seen an episode of MLP before reading this and I loved it.
