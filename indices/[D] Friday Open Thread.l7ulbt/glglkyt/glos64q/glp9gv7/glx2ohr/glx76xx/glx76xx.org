god my ex boyfriend's family in France had a Christmas party. Something like 10 people, 4 were covid positive, the doctors said it was ok because they really wanted to celebrate christmas after such a hard year. I was like WHAT.

We had another 0 yesterday, today's results in about 5 hours (edit: another 0). Apparently the contact tracers are going to get all close contacts to isolate for 14 days and then we will go out of lockdown but with some level of restriction.

I have ordered more masks as we have two cloth masks and like 10 disposables in the house.
