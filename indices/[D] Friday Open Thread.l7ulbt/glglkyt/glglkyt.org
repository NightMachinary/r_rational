for those of you following me, my jurisdiction hasn't had covid "in the wild" for 9.5 months until today when we had a case in a security guard for one of the quarantine locations. we are now 2 hours from a 5 day hard lockdown.

imagine a city of 2 million people who have been acting as if covid doesn't exist since august.

imagine them having 6 hours to buy toilet paper in.

Yeah.
