Well, I almost made it. About a month until my projected vaccination time and I catch COVID. No respiratory issues (yet) but frequent chills, 24/7 headache, and fatigue. I'm in a very low risk demographic, but am disappointed in myself and fearful of long term effects.

I was in some extreme circumstances, but still could've done better. Don't let other's lax attitudes and disregard for safety lull you into complacency about your own precautions. Hopefully they turn out to be nothing, but I didn't think much about long term risks before I caught it.

Now to do my best not to get anyone else sick.
