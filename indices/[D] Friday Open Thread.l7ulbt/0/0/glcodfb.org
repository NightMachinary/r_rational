Sorry to hear of your illness. Glad you're taking measures to keep others safe. I heard that monoclonal antibody infusions are now becoming available to the public- at least in the Minneapolis area. It looks like treatment is limited to people with health issues like diabetes for now. Checking your state's COVID resources for similar programs is worth your time. These infusions help up to 10 days following infection.
