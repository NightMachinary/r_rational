There are different [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124652/][standards of evidence]] (see also: [[https://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0201/p548.html][link]]) followed within different fields of medicine, and in regards to what type of question is under examination.

For proposed treatments, the standard of evidence is much higher, in which case you would be right that we shouldn't rely on evidence from any study that wasn't rigorously designed with appropriate controls.

However, the standard of evidence for prognosis (i.e. a forecast of the likely course of a disease or ailment without intervention) is much lower. The question of Covid-19 sometimes causing lingering lung damage /is/ a prognosis. For prognosis, a case series is typically taken as acceptable evidence /if/ the results are consistent across multiple studies /and/ until better evidence is available. All four of the links I provided are case series of varying quality, and all agree on the presence of lingering lung damage in some percentage of patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19.

Obviously, this does not tell us a prevalence, as you mentioned, but it does tell us that lingering lung damage is an observed outcome for some hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It would be /prudent/ to take that possibility into account during recovery rather than make specious claims of 'no evidence'.
