It's a pandemic which has been going on for more than a year, with hundreds and hundreds of medical studies done in that time - including the various ones linked in that youtube summary. Determining if long term sequelae are likely would surely be a very important discovery.

Nonetheless, there remains no good evidence - the studies in that youtube are no better, with a self report survey and two more no control studies which tell us nothing more than post viral symptoms exist in some people. I don't want to tell people how they should respond to risk, but at some point it's worth thinking like a Bayesian and realizing that the serious absence of evidence must push you towards evidence of absence. Even the surveys, which are about the only things we have to indicate if long term effects are an issue, have only found 2% of people continue to report symptoms (extremely vague symptoms like fatigue) after 3 months.
