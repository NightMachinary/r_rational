I cede on phonetic; I've been under the mistaken assumption they were related up until now, so thanks for updating that.

I don't cede geosynchronous. Etymologically "geo" in general may mean both, but in this specific case it's referring to the Earth, and there are specific terms used for other planets. There might be cases in which geosynchronous is acceptable for other planets - if you're writing science fiction about humans that aren't from Earth (e.g. The Hand of Darkness) and you're working under the premise that you're translating it to be understood - but if someone uses it to refer to Mars, rather than areosynchronous, they're wrong. Even in the counterexample I gave, "synchronous orbit" would work better.
