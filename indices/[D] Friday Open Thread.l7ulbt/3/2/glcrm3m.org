  The unit "years" is actually OK in my view. For any culture that evolves on a planet orbiting in the green zone of a G-type star, the orbital period is likely to be approximately a Earth-standard year.

But there are lots of reasons aliens might not use years. If the atmosphere didn't give a good view of the heavens. If the planet had no axial tilt or a 90 degree tilt. If food growing or biological cycles weren't tied to seasons.

A meter is an abstract unit, but a year is tied to the reality of life on that planet.
