If the point of the story is to examine that sure. If not my point still applies. Could be 2 cthulhus talking to each other underwater for all it matters, for the readers to understand the author has to use a language the readers know, same thing with numerals and measurement units. It's implied that they aren't speaking english, using our decimal system or our measurement units. It 'looks' that way to us readers, it's a translation so we can understand their dialogue.

​

Stories aren't lesser for doing this, it's just the simplest way to have alien perspectives in a story.

​

If you don't do this you either have to write around the issue or make those things up, which is not worth the effort in most cases while also causing unnecessary confusion and complexity for very little benefit to the overhaul story.
