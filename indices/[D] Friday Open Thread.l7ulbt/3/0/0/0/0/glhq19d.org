Have you read The Last Angel? The cultural differences are an important part of the setup. Humans are interacting with aliens. The complaint is specifically about a chapter written from the point of view of an alien.

It's not the same circumstance as MoL, where the characters are humans in a very recognizably earth-like setting. Ironically, you're being more prescriptive than the OP.
