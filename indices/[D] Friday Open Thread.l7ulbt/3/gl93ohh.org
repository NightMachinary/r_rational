So I've been reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]] that was mentioned here recently. And I have some comments on cultural references in SF. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I have some nits to pick with regard to cultural references, that I think are worth discussing with other readers and writers of the genre.

The story revolves around The Compact (think The Covenant from the Halo series of video games) which has existed thousands of years before encountering humanity. We have a galaxy full of bipedal alien races (c.f. the Star Trek problem), but let's not worry about that for now.

There are several instances of cultural references in the text of The Last Angel that I found a little bit jarring, and which I'd like to see being avoided in future works by everyone.

*General Cultural References*

At one point, this squad of shock troopers (alien race called Tribunes) is having communication problems (actually due to subtle and active jamming by their adversary), and compares his state-of-the-art military comm gear to "a dime-store radio".

So in 2021, "dime store" (or the even older "five and dime store") is already a dated reference for USA citizens. And it makes no sense whatsoever for an alien species (that has existed for thousands of years before humanity had dime stores), to refer to them in a time thousands of years /after/ any dime stores have existed at all.

So in this case, I'd replace "dime-store radio" with "children's toy radio" because that is much more likely to exist across multiple cultures. I encourage you all to think about this sort of thing in your own writing.

*Units of Measure*

At another point in the story, another Tribune refers to an incident in his youth where he and his sister were running from danger as the ship they were on was being attacked. He says (thinks) about how he was "a few meters" ahead of his sister when they were separated by a closing pressure door, and she was sucked into space.

I've read more than a few SF novels where the aliens had their own units of measure, and that was always a bit clunky. And of course there is the conceit that these aliens don't actually think / talk in English, and that we're reading some kind of translation of the original anyway.

But even beyond that, I'd like to see SF authors avoid references to our culture's units of measurement when possible. If the phrase had been "a few strides ahead" instead, that is much more cross-cultural and less (to me) intrusive to the flow. And what is a meter, or a yard anyway? It is about one stride, so it would be common for many cultures (of bipedal aliens) across time and space to have a similar unit of measurement.

Again, this is not a call for SF authors to invent their own units of measurement for every alien species. That is more annoying that useful in my opinion. Maybe just write something like "the ship came out of warp about 10,000 [kilometers] off the bow" to indicate the units have been translated. I don't know if people would find that more annoying or not.

The unit "years" is actually OK in my view. For any culture that evolves on a planet orbiting in the green zone of a G-type star, the orbital period is likely to be approximately a Earth-standard year. And in fact, The Last Angel does mention a Compact-Standard Year occasionally. It isn't going to be exactly an Earth year, but that's OK for storytelling purposes.
