I'm being pedantic but your etymologies are kinda wrong.

'phonetic' comes from Greek 'phōnē' meaning 'voice'. The word 'Phoenicia' is completely unrelated.

The geo- in 'geosynchronous' comes from Greek 'gē' which means both 'Earth' (as in the planet) and 'land' or 'soil'. Using one word for both Earth and land is quite common (see Latin 'terra') so using the word 'geosynchronous' when on Mars or some other planet isn't necessarily wrong etymologically. That said, it is possible that when words using geo- (e.g. 'geography') were first coined they might have referred to the planet exclusively rather than land or soil though I can't really find a definitive answer.
