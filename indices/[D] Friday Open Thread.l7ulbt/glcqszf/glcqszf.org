Until poking around lit subreddits recently, I didn't realize how popular audiobooks have become. People use the word 'read' and 'listen' interchangeably, which is weird to me.

It's made me wonder why there aren't more things like old radio dramas. Pod dramas? I'd think more writers would adapt to the medium and produce things more script like.
