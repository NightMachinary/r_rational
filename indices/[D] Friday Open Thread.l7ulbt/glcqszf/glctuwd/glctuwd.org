There's a whole category of fictional podcasts, I think "Welcome to Nightvale" is an archetypal one. I haven't listened to any of them, but I assume some fall under that kind of content?

Alternatively, there are the DND podcasts, which are more script-like than normal? (more like unscripted-like am i rite?)
