Apparently you still don't.. It's implied, regardless of story, narrator or character origin, in *any* story that isn't set irl.

Just like people don't complain about reading stories about aliens appearing to speak english to each other, because it's implied they're not speaking english. When an alien in a story uses a measurement unit it's also implied that he's not using meters or liters, but his own analogue.

Human measurement units in these cases can be seen as a normal translations. Stories humans make are, in general, made for humans and so it's inherently written with human measurements and languages.
