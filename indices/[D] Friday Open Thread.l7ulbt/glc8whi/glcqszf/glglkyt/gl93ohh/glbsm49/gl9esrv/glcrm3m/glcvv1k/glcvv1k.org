Even more so than Earth units, I've put a lot of thought into the usage of words that are etymologically derived from places. Things like "phonetic" (from Phoenicia) or "geosynchronous" (which specifically refers to the Earth, as opposed to something like areosynchronous for Mars), where people realistically shouldn't be using it. Neither is a fantastic example, since phonetic is pretty acceptable and geosynchronous being used for other planets isn't a mistake most scifi authors make, but it elucidates the point adequately.

I wondered for a while if this was /actually/ a problem, or just something I worry about for no reason, but then I read Brent Weeks' Lightbringer series and realized it actually is - that series uses so many Earth concepts that it's incredibly distracting. So now it's something I consider when writing, and something I tend to nitpick/notice when reading.
