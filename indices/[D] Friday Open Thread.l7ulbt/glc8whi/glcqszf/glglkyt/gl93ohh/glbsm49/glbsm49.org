The measurement units don't really bother me, it's implied.

​

Unless you preface the story with a 'this story takes place in a different world, with different languages, cultures and systems of measurement. When you see a unit of measurement or expression that seems out of place assume it has been adapted for the optimal interpretation for most readers.' some nitpicky people will complain.

​

I know people in for instance MoL don't speak english, don't use the measurement units we do, have different grammar, conjugation, alphabet and pronunciation for sounds. Some things are implied, they don't always need to be stated.

​

Imho this type of nitpicking are the ones that tend to make many people not like nitpickers. Nitpick meaningful things, the plot, worldbuilding, prose. Not things that are inherently implied in any story that's not set IRL with characters that speak english and use your preferred measurement system.
