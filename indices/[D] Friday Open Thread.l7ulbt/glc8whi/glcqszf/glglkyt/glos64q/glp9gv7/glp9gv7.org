Easy peasy so far. We're in Day 2 and we've had two days of 0 results. I'm hoping that this case was in the 80% of covid carriers who I've heard DON'T transmit the virus?

I got tested yesterday morning, at was apparently the most busy testing centre (I was there about two hours, but got there before it opened and was near the front of the queue). The line of cars for it was like several kms long.

I got my results back 7 hours later (I've been sick a week now so I was in the "symptomatic" group for test processing priority). My husband was tested from the same car and his results were 18 hours after the test.

The New York Times actually wrote an article about our city: [[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/world/australia/perth-lockdown.html]]

People in other parts of the world are acting like we're overreacting: I shared a screenshot of the [[/r/coronavirus]] subreddit comments with (American?) saying how ridiculous we are being. Personally the average western australian knows we've been lucky to spend 7 months living the post-covid life with no restrictions /and/ no cases/deaths. If we do a 5 or 14 or 30 day hard lockdown to give us another 7 months of freedom then I'm happy to pay this price. (Note: Australia is slated to be vaccinated by December due to global shortages and our local vaccine candidate somehow causing false positive HIV tests)
