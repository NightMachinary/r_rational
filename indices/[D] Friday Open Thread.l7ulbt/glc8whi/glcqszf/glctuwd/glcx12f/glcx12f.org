There is a huge wealth of old radio dramas in public broadcast corporation archives but its buried deep in analog archives and the relevant entities don't have enough money for proper digitalization+archivial.

In germany the public broadcast radio archives can be internet accessed back only 11(!) years, but often they'll play older stuff which we plebs don't have access to.
