well, there are the surveys, one of which you linked. Self report surveys aren't exactly reliable, but findings of 1-2% of people reporting long term effects suggest it is certainly not going to be a widespread issue.

But more importantly, the lack of evidence must, in some form, be considered evidence itself. Here's one of the most widely reported stories about coronavirus, with the entire scientific establishment dedicated to uncovering everything they can about the disease, and millions upon millions of potential test subjects. Any scientist could instantly make a name for themselves by demonstrating the dangers of long covid. Yet for all that, the evidence remains a handful of surveys and a few follow ups with hospitalized cases. Proving the non-existence of something is extraordinarily difficult, as I'm sure you're aware.
