  well, there are the surveys, one of which you linked. Self report surveys aren't exactly reliable, but findings of 1-2% of people reporting long term effects suggest it is certainly not going to be a widespread issue.

I don't know which survey you are referring to here.

The first study I linked about Covid-19 survivors was not a survey - it had results from actual medical measurements of 57 patients, 40 of which were considered to have been non-severe cases and 17 severe. The measurements were taken 30 days after discharge from the hospital. In fact, if you read the methodology you would see that your assumptions about "lung damage being from something else" are in fact false since the medical histories of all 57 patients were assessed as part of the study. Of those 57 patients, 54.4% showed lingering lung damage in CT scans 30 days after discharge.

The second study of survivors that I linked was also not a survey. Its results were based on medical measurements of 86 patients 6 weeks and 12 weeks after discharge from the hospital. I fact, the [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7736754/][later published paper]] by the same author showed that of the 133 survivors included in her study 42% had impaired lung function as recorded by medical tests 60 days after covid-19 onset, and 36% still had impaired lung function as recorded by those same medical tests 100 days after Covid-19 onset.

Your comments at this point seem to demonstrate you are not actually reading or considering the evidence presented to you.
