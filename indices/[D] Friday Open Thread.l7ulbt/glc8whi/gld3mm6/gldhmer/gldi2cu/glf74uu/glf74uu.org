I'm puzzled as to where you are drawing that conclusion from. To my knowledge there have been multiple scientific studies of Covid-19 patients dating back to early 2020, and more recently, all showing lingering lung damage. For example:

- [[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/06/study-finds-lung-impairment-recovering-covid-19-patients][A June 2020 study indicating lung damage in survivors]]
- [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7588618/][A July 2020 postmortem study indicating lung damage]]
- [[https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/937263#vp_1][A September 2020 study of survivors indicating lingering lung damage for as long as 12 weeks in some patients, with some patients recovering faster than others]]
- [[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/11/postmortem-lungs-covid-19-patients-show-massive-damage][A November 2020 postmortem study indicating lung damage]]
