Three of these studies tell us nothing about "long covid". Two of them concern those who died of the disease, Which is useless for long term sequelae, and one just says that a chunk of patients had lung damage. There's no control, no estimate of prevalence, it's useless. Perhaps the third link establishes something, but it's walled off.
