  I don't know that bullets make much sense given what you've said. You mentioned that only using handcuffs made out of the stuff doesn't work. In those conditions using it as a bullet seems totally useless.
#+end_quote

Yeah, the bullets would never shut down magic fully. If you want to catch the mage alive, though, you may want to use the bullets just to /weaken/ them a little. The strength of the effect is severely limited by the small size of a bullet/arrowpoint, but also slightly increased by being stuck /inside/ the body. The effect is small but noticeable, and possibly worth it if you don't want the target dead. But yeah, as I said, it's seldom used, and even then you probably want to mix in some poison.

  What happens when it breaks? What happens when you grind it up? Can you embed bits of it in cement lets say or even iron to get whatever concentration you want plus strength?
#+end_quote

Two slabs/one shattered slab piled together is as effective as one same size slab. The dust is pretty useless unless you make a huge pile of it. Mixing it with other material does work, although you will need more total Kunda (The material) to achieve the same effect the more diluted it is. You can however improve the hardness/whatever of the end product by mixing it.

#+begin_quote
  I also would like to point out that as stated this material is merely an equalizer.
#+end_quote

Well, plus super exhaustion.

  How heavy is this stuff?
#+end_quote

Like marble. So about three times as heavy as water. That's way lighter than most solid metals, but not 'light' really.

#+begin_quote
  If it's light enough you wouldn't see it used as a bullet, but possibly big balls of the stuff could be thrown by a canon or catapult to try to disable enemy positions.
#+end_quote

I somehow didn't think of this. It's expensive, but this is absolutely something that would see occasional use, especially since you can reuse most of it as long as you take over the place. Thank you.

#+begin_quote
  Ideally you'd want to build walls around a fort with this stuff but it sounds like it's too expensive for that.
#+end_quote

Way too expensive. Plus, it would be impossible to have anyone inside the wall firing cannons/using magic/patrolling within several meters of the wall. Completely unrelated, but in my world if you want to guard against magic you basically cover walls in metal, because the denser matter is, the more it resists magical attack. This is also really expensive, so countries have treaties about not destroying too much infrastructure with magic.

#+begin_quote
  Depending on how long it takes for people to recover their magic it might make sense to force everyone to be drained before going into high security areas.
#+end_quote

This is a good thought, but made less necessary by my world being one in which every magician can easily probe any other to see if they are holding magic or not.
