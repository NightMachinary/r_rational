It's the amount of work that goes into making it. You need magicians to do it, and magicians are the very wealthiest and most powerful people in society. It's slow, draining work, and you're not allowed to train extra magicians because of international treaties set down to prevent a second magical world war/apocalypse. The nobility has /all/ the power, and they don't work for cheap. Some of them might make moderate amounts of it for themselves, though.
