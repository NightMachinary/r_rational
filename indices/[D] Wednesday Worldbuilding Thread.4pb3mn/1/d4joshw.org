Alright you munchkins, I have one for you.

In my world, there is a special material called Kunda. Were it not for magic, it would just be an overpriced building material somewhere between marble and blue plexiglass. It's very expensive to make, especially when your world's technology is roughly in the 1600s. Never the less, it's something every country can and does produce, because of its magical properties. It's the only known material that prevents people from using magic. People don't know the /how/ of this, but the author does and the main characters will eventually.

When you have a large chunk of it, say the floor of a room, then it emits a magical field that is detectable by any magician who is actively holding magic (Which they can do for a few hours every day). But if you step into the field, say by entering the room, then the field will prevent you from drawing magic (Which you need to do before you can use it), and also it will drain you of the magic you were already holding. This will take less than a second if it's a few inches thick and covers the whole floor, but with a little math you can design a floor that works more slowly/doesn't completely drain people's magic. Lastly, the material will make you feel utterly exhausted and make every action one that takes a lot of effort and concentration. Even standing. Leaving the field allows you to recover within seconds. You are not /actually/ made exhausted, it just messes with your body's feedback systems. Knowing this does not let you act normally, because your body doesn't think. The energy drain effect works against non-magicians and animals. Not plants, though. Because the field does extend upwards, bugs that fly into it basically fall down and starve to death.

If the chunk is smaller, say a pair of manacles, the effect is lesser, and would not be guaranteed to be effective. If you want to transport a magic user prisoner, you either need to put them on a big slab of the thing or make armour of it. It's more effective if you're on the edge of a big slab than surrounded by thin layers. Because magic. Prisoner transports usually just build a big heavy cell into a carriage and add an extra pair of horses.

It's expensive to make, as I said, so there is not a lot of experimentation going on. That said, currently every country knows that every other country has:

1) Prison cells with floor, walls and ceiling made of the stuff. Not bars or doors, though, because it's nowhere near as hard as iron

2) Big slabs of the stuff on the floor before the throne/other locations where you want to openly prevent one side from using magic. Also even non-magicians tend to fall on their knees when taken by surprise by Kunda, and some kings like that.

3) It's also used by snipers. As bullets. Not very frequently, however, because while the material can prevent magicians from using magic in the first place, it has no special effect against magic already in place, such as a shield, and if your target is unshielded you usually just want to blow their brains out before they notice you. For those rare times when you want to capture someone alive, though, you can try to shoot them with a few bullets to weaken them, and hope they don't commit suicide/also apply some poison to the projectile.

But. Other than these three uses, do any ideas occur to you lot? The material has been known for centuries, and I wouldn't want to find myself with a plot hole because no character could think of obvious ideas abc.
