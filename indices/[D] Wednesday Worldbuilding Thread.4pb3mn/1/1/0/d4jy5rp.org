  you mention its effect on magic people are holding, but how about magic that's already been cast?
#+end_quote

No special effect on such magic.

#+begin_quote
  If it doesn't drain magical effects, it could allow golems (or something of the sort) to cross unaffected, could be used to arm golems with quantities sufficient to disable opponents,
#+end_quote

Sure could! Golems are a thing in my world, but only in the distant past and late into the story. When in play, they very much do make use of Kunda.

#+begin_quote
  It sounds like this should be useful in making traps (for animals at least, if not humans).
#+end_quote

An excellent point I had not considered but will add to my repertoire. Too expensive for your average hunter, but I'm sure it will make sense to use somewhere.

#+begin_quote
  Can magic be used against it? You can detect it with magic, but can you lift it with magic? (Say there's a trap that drops a slab of it on your head...) Kunda projectiles can't break a magic shield, but what's the effectiveness of magic projectiles against a kunda shield?
#+end_quote

Yes and yes. That said, telekinesis is a specialisation most mages can't do much with in my world, But if someone built a wall of Kunda, a mage could certainly damage it from a distance. In my world, if you want a wall that is able to resist magical attack, you have to cover it in a nice thick /expensive/ layer of solid metal. Treaties heavily regulate how much damage mages are allowed to do to enemy infrastructure, city walls and such.

  Would this be used to help break victims of a torture chamber/interrogation room?
#+end_quote

The victim would certainly be uncomfortable, but any rest they got would be as healthy as if it had been normal marble they were sleeping on.

#+begin_quote
  Would it be used in casinos/gambling houses to prevent people from magically gaming the games ... or should it be outlawed because its presence, which is physically draining, might encourage people to remain seated at the games longer? How about other businesses --- if low quantities of the stuff could make people even 5% less likely to move around (i.e.: leave) then any business with an unethical owner and an interest in keeping people on the premises (restaurants, bars, drug dens) might be using it.
#+end_quote

Goodness me, I had not considered this at all. Well, firstly, a casino wouldn't be very popular if all its customers were magically tired every time they sat down to gamble. There wouldn't be any /laws/ against it, but it would be bad for business. Probably the owner would jut occasionally hire a mage to sneakily probe everyone present to see if there was magic in play.

Your point about other businesses is fantastic. I can already see I'm going to have to mention some clever bastard making their entrance and exit in different places, with the exit corridor having a little bit of Kunda mixed into it so people subconsciously don't want to go through it.

#+begin_quote
  Could it be used in mattresses? The illusion of exhaustion being represented as allowing people to fall asleep easier, and the immediate restoration of energy on rolling out of bed being represented as an empowering start to the day...
#+end_quote

Well, probably not /in/ the mattress, but you could put a normal mattress on a slab of the stuff. This would indeed help people fall asleep if they weren't quite tired enough without it. Too expensive for most people, but the rich and powerful might invest in this. Hm, I will definitely have to include this.

Thank you very much!
