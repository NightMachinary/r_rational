Is magical telepathy a thing? If not, can I broadcast coded messages to every magician nearby by having a guy run up and down a hallway with a sack of kunda dust and let them sense it? Or it may be better to twirl a kunda-doped fan or staff, to take advantage of the vertical bias by changing the horizontal cross section.

Similarly, is magic marking a thing, or could there be a reason to bury enough kunda to sense an otherwise uninteresting location? Maybe mark the path through a maze or something, to deter muggles or as a party trick.

Is the magic-draining effect the same if you jump on and off a kunda plate, as if you just stood on it for the same amount of time you were on it? Could you save money by forcing your victims to take a winding path that goes back and forth over a thin stripe of kunda that they could otherwise run over? Labyrinths might be useful to maximize your enemies' exposure to your limited supply, rather than always relying on one big slab. Even if the effect is weaker overall, the extra exposure time might make it worth it to disable magicians.

Why would you make prisons with huge slabs built in? I'd expect a only a few quick-drain slabs, probably the same ones that get deployed to the field. The normal cells can have a cheaper thin bed of kunda dust under the floor, just enough to keep the prisoners from recovering their magic. Its almost as safe magically, more safe physically, and a whole lot cheaper. Granted, you're giving up most of the omnipresent mood of drained dispair, but you've got to look at the price tag on that.

Is kunda water-soluble? If so, what concentration is needed to make the fish too lethargic to bite quite as much? The effect doesn't need to be much to wreck a fishing community. It probably takes too much to be practical, but it was worth a thought.

On that note, how much kunda is wasted? Almost all manufacturing and sculpting of the stuff probably creates some dust, and you can't recover all of it. That'll get washed away with the rain eventually, along with any lost to weather or damage. Kunda is building up, slowly but surely, in rivers and off the coast. Is this world being set up for ecological disaster?
