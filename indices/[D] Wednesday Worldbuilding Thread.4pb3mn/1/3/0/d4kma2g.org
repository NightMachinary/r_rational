  Is magical telepathy a thing?
#+end_quote

Yes. Fairly short range, and every (skilled) magician in range can pick up the signal, so for secrecy you need codes or a private language.

#+begin_quote
  Similarly, is magic marking a thing, or could there be a reason to bury enough kunda to sense an otherwise uninteresting location?
#+end_quote

A normal magical mark would fade within minutes, certainly less than an hour, unless someone was maintaining it. So yes, Kunda could indeed be left as a marker only a magician would be able to look for quickly.

#+begin_quote
  Is the magic-draining effect the same if you jump on and off a kunda plate, as if you just stood on it for the same amount of time you were on it?
#+end_quote

You recover within seconds of stepping away from the Kunda, so repeated brief exposure would be annoying but not harmful. You wouldn't weaken an opponent by draining them and then letting them recover. If you want them weak, you need to keep them exposed.

#+begin_quote
  Why would you make prisons with huge slabs built in?
#+end_quote

Your prisoner will be back at full strength mere seconds after getting away from the Kunda, so you want the full effect to keep them docile. You also don't want to risk a situation where an unusually crafty magician is able to somehow create a distance between themselves and the stuff, like by digging it out and piling it in one corner or climbing up to the ceiling somehow.

#+begin_quote
  Is kunda water-soluble?
#+end_quote

No. In order to mess with a population of fish, you'd need ridiculous mounts. That said, there might be the very occasional sunken palace somewhere where some cells in the dungeons and most of the throne room are devoid of life.

#+begin_quote
  On that note, how much kunda is wasted? Almost all manufacturing and sculpting of the stuff probably creates some dust, and you can't recover all of it. That'll get washed away with the rain eventually, along with any lost to weather or damage. Kunda is building up, slowly but surely, in rivers and off the coast. Is this world being set up for ecological disaster?
#+end_quote

Alas no. The dust does almost nothing unless you pile up huge amounts of it, and as it leaks out into the world it will eventually be broken down to the point where the almost no effect turns into actual no effect. There are disasters waiting to happen, but they won't come from Kunda.
