Fair point about not needing them docile, but since it's both or neither, they are going to be exhausted in any situation where there is enough Kunda to keep them completely unable to wield magic.

Certainly there is great economic incentive to minimize the amout of Kunda you use. Maybe I should just make Kunda cells really really small.
