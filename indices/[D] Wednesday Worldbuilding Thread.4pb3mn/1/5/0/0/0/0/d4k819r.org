Okay. So an ordinary shaped charge over an intact slab is better.

There are also nonmilitary uses, for example something like a magical safety shower for mage labs. A slab in the corner to run to if you accidently set yourself on fire or something. Possibly combined with an actual safety shower, in case you accidently set yourself on fire or something.

Quick edit: that last gives every mage a reason to at least have made a little bit of it.
