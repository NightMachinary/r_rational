No, the field will not have any effect on magic that is already doing stuff. It will only prevent you from casting or maintaining (Plus the exhaustion). So you can magically snipe someone standing in the field, or even use magic to break the Kunda itself. It's not much more durable than ordinary marble (Though you are going to have to separate the chunks to make the effect weaken. A shattered slab with all pieces put together is still at full strength).

Magic is stored in the whole body (So yes, tall fat people get to be stronger in magic), and the bigger the body, the more Kunda is required to make certain they can't use magic at all. If you want a magician to /wear/ enough Kunda to be guaranteed to be unable to use any magic, you are going to have to put them in basically a full set of armour. Or just chain them to a slab.
