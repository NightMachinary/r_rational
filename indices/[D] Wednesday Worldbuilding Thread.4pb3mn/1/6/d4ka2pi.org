Does Kunda help you fall asleep?

Is there any use for it as a recreational substance (i.e a drug-equivalent)? I can't think of any reason someone would want to be exhausted, but I can't think of all of the reasons people want things.

Can small (and cheapish?) pieces of it under doors and windows act like a bug screen in a palace?

Can you train past magical exhaustion like you can train past mundane exhaustion? As an example of this, I couldn't exhaust myself as much as [[http://www.slate.com/blogs/five_ring_circus/2014/02/10/sochi_olympics_2014_skiathlon_why_do_cross_country_skiers_always_collapse.html][professional cross country ski racers do]]: I would stop skiing long before I lost the ability to stay upright.

You said the field extends upwards. Is that a function of Kunda (the field is repelled by gravity or something), or else a function of it being a floor (the field propagates in all directions equally, but "up" is the only one we care about).

Can anything block Kunda-radiation? If so, you can build hidden traps or possibly armor.
