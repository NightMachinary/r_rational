What are the effects long term subdermal contact? Can you essentially weight-train with these, by exposing yourself to a small amount, training until you achieve your ordinary fitness, increase exposure, retrain, etc? How would the development of the body be effected, if an amount is implanted at a young age? If the ability to do magic is something that develops alongside the growth of the body, could you permanently cripple a person's magical development with Kunda implants? Or maybe the opposite, along the lines of the previous weight training, developing their ability to use magic hyper-efficiently by training them from a young age to overcome increasing amounts of Kunda interference?
