Not to nitpick, but large portions of the gains in performance associated with traditional (weight) training are neurological: the nervous system is trained to send stronger signals, ignore the feeling of exhaustion, and move the body more efficiently.

So I suppose that if kunda is so... /precisely tuned/ to the specific neurological feedback loops which are used by the motor and attention systems that you can't train to withstand kunda... that's pretty creepy.
