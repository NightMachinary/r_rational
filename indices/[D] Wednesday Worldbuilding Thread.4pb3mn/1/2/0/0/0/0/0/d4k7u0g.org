Well, I don't have the requisite knowledge of neurology to come up with a neat explanation there. I /want/ Kunda to be something you can't train away or mitigate (Other than not being near it), so somehow the human body is going to have to be unable to compensate for it. Ultimately magic is fictional. I think in this case "It messes with the body's feedback systems/nerve impulses" is as deep as it will go. The characters all start out thinking it's somehow actually draining something, so hopefully it won't be an issue readers feel detract from the story when it's only partially explained.

Thank you for pointing this out. Maybe I'll think of a better explanation in time.
