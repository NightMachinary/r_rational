No permanent damage, but:

The effect is amplified because the Kunda is touching them in all directions. Even so, size is critical. A baseball sized hunk would cripple them magically and physically until it was removed, but just forcing them to swallow a few coin sized shards/putting a few bullets in them would only weaken them somewhat.
