So basically, no curing, pickling, cooking, smoking, sugaring, or dehydrating?

If there's civilization at all, then they're going to have a tough time of winters, or they'll be confined to latitudes where winter isn't an issue. Most food is going to have to be fresh, which means that people can't be far from their food source. That makes proper cities a lot more difficult, and trade gets significantly pared down (no spice trade, for a start).
