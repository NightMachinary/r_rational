Food doesn't degrade at the same rate. Honey is very stable, I believe. I've heard miron jars prevent degradation as well, but haven't had time to look at the science behind why.

Seeds aren't in a constant state of degradation, either.

You have to use magic to explain the effect you're seeking. A worldwide curse from a past civilization, perhaps.

In that case, people in the north would eat like Eskimos, fishing and eating nose-to-tail everything they capture. Humans might migrate to tundra during summer to hunt, but would leave when it grows cold. Desert dwellers would rely on cacti and plants like aloe vera as well as insects. The majority would reside near the equator or in temperate areas, subsisting off of seasonal fruit and perennial greens - basically anything that can grow and has bountiful, consistent harvest year round. Fats from fruits, nuts, seeds, and fish, and though probably a delicacy, perhaps livestock or game as well. Protein from insects. The civilization would be very keen on preserving the environment, and would likely live close to nature. Maybe each family has their own garden, or share several village-wide gardens. Anything that could potentially poison plants would be avoided as an existential risk. Might live in twisted, living trees, though that technology would be advanced.
