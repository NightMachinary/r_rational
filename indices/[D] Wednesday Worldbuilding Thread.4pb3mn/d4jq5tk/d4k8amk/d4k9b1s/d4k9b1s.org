I have an explanation, but I didn't want to bring forward random details that weren't relevant.

To summarize the idea is related to my magic system in general. What if under normal conditions slight magic/physics modification is needed to let cells work. What then if you take those cells somewhere, where the native biology and the physics to support it are significantly different. Assuming that stuff can turn up the crank on it's tuning of physics than I'd posit you'd see some of the effects I talked about. Basically when things die they stop modifying physics and suddenly the all their molecules become terrible unstable and fall apart. This explanation isn't something I plan on sharing with the reader which is another reason I'm reluctant to mention it here.

  Seeds aren't in a constant state of degradation, either.

No they aren't, but if you assume they've got cell apparatus actively maintaining the physics that allows their chemistry to be stable I think it's reasonable to say they have to use more to keep things stable in such a strange environment.

I came to this trying to work through the implications of my magic system and in particular thinking about how to set up a world where guns, engines, and the like were impossible. Basically I was thinking about disallowing high energy densities. The problem is that humans and life in general is pretty energy dense. We can get around that with the above, but at the price of having stuff burst in to flames when it dies. I thought about this for awhile and arrived at two problems. First top soil. If everything's burning up there won't be any topsoil accumulating. I'd already decided that humanity and our plants and animals in this scenario are transplants, so the obvious solution is having native life which produces top soil sufficient for plants that we can actually eat to grow. We run into the whole energy density problem again, but I decided I was more interest in the implications of a society without much food storage at this point so just kept going. Then I ran into problem two. A lot of food we eat doesn't actually die until we cook it. Seeds exist explicitly to survive until they can grow into a plant. I decided it made sense though to give them a shorter shelf life given they have to drain energy to keep stable where normally they can basically just sit there.
