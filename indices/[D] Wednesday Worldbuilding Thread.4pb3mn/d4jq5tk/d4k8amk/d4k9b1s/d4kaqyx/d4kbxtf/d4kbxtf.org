If a chemical arrangement simply isn't stable anymore that energy has to go somewhere. Maybe it wouldn't actually catch fire, I think it would depend on how closely together cells die, but I'd guess the result of basically every molecule inside a cell falling apart would be pretty close to fire. It's basically what fire does anyway.
