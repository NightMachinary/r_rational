I'm trying to think through the repercussions of somehow preventing food storage. Essentially food catches fire upon a significant fraction of the cells experiencing cell death and in the process of preventing this seeds have to burn there energy much faster so can't really last much beyond 6 months.

I might or might not allow for magical items that prevent this in a small radius. If I did they would be rare and of fixed supply.
