  If it's known that it kills bugs, is it practical to use it as a pesticide? No. You would need too much. You could conceivably cover the ground in it and just have furrows with earth and plants in them, but that would be ridiculously expensive.

What's the cause of the expensiveness? It doesn't seem to be scarcity of material, if every country on earth can produce it. Is it something that can't be mitigated with economies of scale or the advance of technology or thaumaturgy? (Aluminum went from difficult and expensive to cheap and ubiquitous. Does anything prevent this from happening to kunda?)
