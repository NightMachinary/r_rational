  Do you want Muskwalker to be the guy using Kunda to slightly trap people in his drug den or the guy who gets executed for trying to trying to buy magician spots on the sly?

(Originally had it as Muskwake, as in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meskwaki][Meskwaki]], but changed it to be less culturally-appropriative and more intuitive to pronounce and allow alternate usernames by swapping -walker out with another agent noun.)
