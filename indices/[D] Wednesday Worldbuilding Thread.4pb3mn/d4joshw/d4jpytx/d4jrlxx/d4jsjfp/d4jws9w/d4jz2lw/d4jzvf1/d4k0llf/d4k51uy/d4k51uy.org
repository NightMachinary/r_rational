Ooh. So here's a loose plan:

1.  Become local-level rich. (If a magician, make and sell kunda; if a muggle, run a casino with juuust enough kunda to make people 5% less likely to want to get up from the tables.)
2.  Use wealth for political influence, mercantile influence, and sufficient goons to acquire and maintain a monopoly on the local kunda production/trade.\\
3.  Find a local magician susceptible to vice and corrupt them, letting them spend their fortune in your chosen casinos, bars, bordellos, whatever; 5% more likely to stick around means increased opportunity for addiction to form.
4.  When they hit rock bottom, offer to get them cleaned up and back on their feet in return for doing just a liiiiittle work for you, since you own the kunda trade around here. You now have a debt slave. Repeat ad libitum.
5.  Use increased kunda production at reduced cost to become nation-level rich.
6.  Contract with developing nations to replenish their treaty-enforced magician quota when existing magicians die or emigrate---you'll help the process along if necessary---in exchange for a portion of the proceeds of your new industry.
7.  Train/uplift new magicians from the working class, teaching them just enough about magic to produce kunda.
8.  Continue to increase wealth (becoming global-level rich) and plant kunda sweatshops around the world until few or no old-school magicians still remain. (This may take more than one lifetime; at some point your company is taking over this plan.)
9.  Use wealth to control the international conversation on magicians, setting up competing memes of "worthless minimum-wage workers just above burger-flippers" vs "downtrodden human beings working under terrible conditions, with rights just like anyone else". Make the prospect of them producing a new world war/apocalypse absurd; make the old tragedies a footnote of history.
10. Use political influence to overturn the magician-quota treaties as a useless relic of a past when magicians had power.
11. Open up sweatshops and factories in every major city in the world - enough to make kunda an everyday commodity (with exciting, heretofore-undreamed-of new applications being discovered on a monthly basis!) and put your Sleep-Like-MagicÂ® bedframes in every house.

(edit: I keep thinking 'wizard' instead of 'magician')
