  Does it kill microorganisms as well?
#+end_quote

...I never gave this any thought. Crap. That said, err... No, it does not affect single celled organims because +reasons+ the effect it has on animals is due to the way it messes with the body's nervous system. No nervous system, no effect.

Also my world has no undead, so no invincible skeleton armies with magic immunity.

  What kind of effect would it have if powdered and drank or eaten? What if you fed it to plants (plants used for food, plants used for textiles, plants used for timber...)
#+end_quote

In low concentrations it is so weak it can't be measured. If you cut someone up and put a baseball sized chunk in them, that would cripple them. But just making them eat or drink a little would do nothing at all. Similarly, the concentration you would get in normal clothes or wood would be too low to be effective. One method of transporting prisoners, as I said, is to basically put them in a suit of armour of the stuff.

  If it's known that it kills bugs, is it practical to use it as a pesticide?
#+end_quote

No. You would need too much. You could conceivably cover the ground in it and just have furrows with earth and plants in them, but that would be ridiculously expensive.
