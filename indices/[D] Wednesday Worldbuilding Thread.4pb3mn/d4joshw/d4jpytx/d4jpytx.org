I don't know that bullets make much sense given what you've said. You mentioned that only using handcuffs made out of the stuff doesn't work. In those conditions using it as a bullet seems totally useless.

I also would like to point out that as stated this material is merely an equalizer. It lets you stop somebody from using magic, but if your in the field it stops you too.

Question though, you mention it's fragile. What happens when it breaks? What happens when you grind it up? Can you embed bits of it in cement lets say or even iron to get whatever concentration you want plus strength?

How heavy is this stuff? If it's light enough you wouldn't see it used as a bullet, but possibly big balls of the stuff could be thrown by a canon or catapult to try to disable enemy positions. It really mostly depends on the expense. Ideally you'd want to build walls around a fort with this stuff but it sounds like it's too expensive for that.

One potential interesting application of it is in the fact it drains magic. You could protect a much bigger room from any magic users by having a big hunk of this material at the entrance and making sure no one can get in any other way. Depending on how long it takes for people to recover their magic it might make sense to force everyone to be drained before going into high security areas.
