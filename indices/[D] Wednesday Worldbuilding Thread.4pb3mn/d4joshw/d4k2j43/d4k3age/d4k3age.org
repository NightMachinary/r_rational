  Is the exhaustion effect mitigated by stimulants (ie caffeine?).
#+end_quote

No, not in the least. Possibly you might feel extra uncomfortable, since your body is sending mixed messages.

#+begin_quote
  You also mentioned the effect scales with surface are in contact with the wizard, does that mean a dissolving capsule of dust would be more effective than an equivalent solid mass?
#+end_quote

No. A given chunk will have more effect if it's inside than if it's just pressed against you (And less still at a distance), but if you feed someone a lot of dust, it's just going to get spread out throughout their digestive tract, and you'll get less effect than if they just swallowed a solid piece of it. And none of it will go into the bloodstream.

#+begin_quote
  Given what you've said about the dust, it could be used to subtly weaken other mages by pumping it into the air supply, hiding it the food, or even just slowly adding it to a room via pipes.
#+end_quote

The dust does very little, apologies if I was unclear. you could give a magician a marginal handicap if you kept feeding them small doses, and a small/moderate one if you put bullets/arrows in them. But at that point, usually you'd just aim one at their head and end it. Internal use is not where I see Kunda excelling. Although if you were looking to give them just a marginal handicap that noone would suspect, say before they try breaking a record or showing off their slight edge in some competition, then I suppose subtle Kunda poisoning might work. I'll keep this in mind. Thanks.
