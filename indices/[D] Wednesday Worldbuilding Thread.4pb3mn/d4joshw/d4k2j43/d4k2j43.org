Is the exhaustion effect mitigated by stimulants (ie caffeine?).

You also mentioned the effect scales with surface are in contact with the wizard, does that mean a dissolving capsule of dust would be more effective than an equivalent solid mass?

Given what you've said about the dust, it could be used to subtly weaken other mages by pumping it into the air supply, hiding it the food, or even just slowly adding it to a room via pipes.
