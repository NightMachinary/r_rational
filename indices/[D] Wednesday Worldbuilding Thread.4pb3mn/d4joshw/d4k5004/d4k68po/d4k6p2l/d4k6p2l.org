The explosive payload would go under the slab. Can mages shield from kryptonite shrapnel? Or over the slab, and the mage has to worry about keeping enough shield to protect from shrapnel while being drained by the slab. Or the mines can be nonexplosive inert slabs which produce a moment of weakness to exploit some other way simply by being unwittingly walked across.

Another good spot would be a just under a castle's murderhole. Oh, and inside any hidden sewer drains any intrepid heroes might try to use as a back entrance.
