Alas, Kunda has no permanent effects. Not sure if anything much happens if you implant a (sterile) normal rock in someone, but... that.

You can't weight train with them for extra benefit. You would feel tired, but wouldn't get any extra strength. Possibly you could train endurance/discipline from the sheer extra time spent fighting while exhausted.

No developmental changes, magically or otherwise. Magic is all about the brain.

/Although/... Hm. So, in my world, there is no hard limit on how much magic you can use in a day. The more you use, the more tired your brain gets (Like you're taking a really long examination/studying session), and your ability to control your magic decreases. Less control means that the magic in you is going to become more and more unruly, and do more and more damage to your body. I suppose practising while made sluggish (but not shut down) by the Kunda would allow you to practise controlling magic while exhausted without taking quite as much damage. Hm. So... magical endurance training. Yeah, that's definitely a thing now. The students are gonna hate it, and the villains are gonna have done it so much for years and years. Excellent.
