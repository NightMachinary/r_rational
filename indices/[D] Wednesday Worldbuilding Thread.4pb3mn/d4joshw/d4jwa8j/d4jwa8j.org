Scattered thoughts..

Depending on what kind of magic there is - you mention its effect on magic people are holding, but how about magic that's already been cast? If it drains magical effects, it should be used to dissipate curses, dispel disguises, and un-enchant artifacts. If it doesn't drain magical effects, it could allow golems (or something of the sort) to cross unaffected, could be used to arm golems with quantities sufficient to disable opponents, and there may be the possibility of a counter-spell such as stamina boost to evade some of its effects.

It sounds like this should be useful in making traps (for animals at least, if not humans).

Can magic be used /against/ it? You can detect it with magic, but can you lift it with magic? (Say there's a trap that drops a slab of it on your head...) Kunda projectiles can't break a magic shield, but what's the effectiveness of magic projectiles against a kunda shield?

Would this be used to help break victims of a torture chamber/interrogation room?

Would it be used in casinos/gambling houses to prevent people from magically gaming the games ... or should it be outlawed because its presence, which is physically draining, might encourage people to remain seated at the games longer? How about other businesses --- if low quantities of the stuff could make people even 5% less likely to move around (i.e.: leave) then any business with an unethical owner and an interest in keeping people on the premises (restaurants, bars, drug dens) might be using it.

Could it be used in mattresses? The illusion of exhaustion being represented as allowing people to fall asleep easier, and the immediate restoration of energy on rolling out of bed being represented as an empowering start to the day...
