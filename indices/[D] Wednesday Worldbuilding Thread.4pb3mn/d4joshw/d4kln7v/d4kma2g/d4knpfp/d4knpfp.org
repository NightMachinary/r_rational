  Your prisoner will be back at full strength mere seconds after getting away from the Kunda, so you want the full effect to keep them docile. You also don't want to risk a situation where an unusually crafty magician is able to somehow create a distance between themselves and the stuff, like by digging it out and piling it in one corner or climbing up to the ceiling somehow.

Why do I want them docile? I have them in cheap iron chains. I don't care how much they thrash and scream as long as they're not throwing fireballs. I was thinking of the dust floor being under a stone one, or in pockets in the stone, or mixed into concrete or something, to prevent tampering. Transferring prisoners from mobile restraints to the cell can be done with the same procedures for a full-Kunda cell - presumably, put them in the cell before uncuffing them.

Basically, I think prisons should use Kunda only for its anti-magic-drawing properties. You don't need the cells to be quick at draining magic someone is already holding since prisoners come in empty, and you don't need your prisoners catatonic when you can use muggle methods. Overdesigning with Kunda could make the jail more expensive than the estate of the lord who commissioned it! Or at least, costly enough that they can't afford that extension to the east wing that they wanted.
