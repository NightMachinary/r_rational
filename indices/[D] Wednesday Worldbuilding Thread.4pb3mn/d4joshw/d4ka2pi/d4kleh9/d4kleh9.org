  Does Kunda help you fall asleep?
#+end_quote

Somewhat. It won't make you sleepy, but if you were already able to sleep, it will speed the process along by taking away any restlessness/need to keep going your body might have been telling you about.

#+begin_quote
  Is there any use for it as a recreational substance (i.e a drug-equivalent)?
#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote
  Can small (and cheapish?) pieces of it under doors and windows act like a bug screen in a palace?
#+end_quote

No. Bugs are weak against it so it would affect them a bit even in low amounts, but not enough to stop them crawling through a gap.

#+begin_quote
  Can you train past magical exhaustion like you can train past mundane exhaustion?
#+end_quote

It's a bit of a special case. If you start out fresh, you can force yourself to keep going through the magical exhaustion until you hit your real limits, but every action will be more costly than usual, and you'll get real sluggish. It's not 'real' exhaustion you are feeling, and you'd only get the normal benefits of training. Plus a little discipline an stubbornness, perhaps. It would certainly help you /mentally/ adjust to keep going despite normal exhaustion, but not physically. I'm still thinking about this point. I'm not sure whether I'll have it let people train to keep going until they collapse.

  ou said the field extends upwards. Is that a function of Kunda (the field is repelled by gravity or something), or else a function of it being a floor (the field propagates in all directions equally, but "up" is the only one we care about).
#+end_quote

Second one. Goes in all directions.

#+begin_quote
  Can anything block Kunda-radiation? If so, you can build hidden traps or possibly armor.
#+end_quote

Any matter will lessen the effect, the denser the quicker. Heavy metals is the best bet if you want to make a barrier, but something like a suit of armour would not be enough, unless it was so thick you couldn't move in it. You could put a thick layer of lead or something between people and the Kunda and retract it if you wanted to make a trap, though. Expensive but doable.
