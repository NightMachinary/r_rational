Does Waldo ever interfere with non-magical status quos? Maybe curses like vampirism don't count because they're "unnatural". Of course, the problem is only with magic that enforces itself and thus tries to supercede the natural order - slippery slope and all that. Magic in general is fine as long as natural people are pulling the trigger. It's just coincidence that this logic makes Waldo's extremely useful cane permissible by his own moral code.

If Waldo does canonically interfere with mundane tyrants, it's a simple retcon to reveal some nasty persistant magic behind them.
