Is there a model of single-timeline time travel that doesn't allow outcome pumps?

I'm not really sure if this is a good question to ask, but I'll try to explain. First and foremost, time travel is purely fictional and as such there are many competing models of how it works. I'm looking for one with certain properties.

It should be a single fixed timeline, with all changes to the past already accounted for and woven into history. Paradoxes are impossible, retroactively if need be. The trouble is, the way this is normally written, you can "steer" probability away from certain outcomes just by pre-committing to trigger a paradox if you encounter those outcomes.

So, if you really want tomorrow to be a sunny day, you can vow that you will go back in time and kill your parents before you were born (or some more mundane paradox, like stealing the keys to the time machine before you can use it), and as long as you have the determination to follow through on that vow... you won't have to, because it'll be sunny.

That's funny, but it doesn't make much intuitive sense. There's no causality there. No amount of weather scientists examining the data will explain why that day was sunny. Even if they know you have a time machine, /you never actually used it/ so clearly you can't be blamed. It seems like cheating, affecting the past without actually using your time machine. And from a writer's perspective, it completely defeats the point of having a single fixed timeline, which was to stop worrying about how the actions of alternate selves impact history.

Now, it's also said that if you try to do something paradoxical anyway, the universe will conspire against making that paradox happen. If you try to kill your grandfather before your parents are born, your time machine will break down or your gun will jam or you'll learn that you were adopted and the man you killed wasn't your real grandfather. I'd like a model where that happens when you try to change the future in a way that it can't be changed. If tomorrow is sunny, it was going to be sunny anyway. If it's not sunny, you can't trigger a paradox to undo it, because your gun will jam or something.

What I'm struggling with is: how do you distinguish between events that are part of a time loop and can be affected by it, and events that can't and will find some other way to resolve a paradox if you try to change them?
