This does not fit your model, but it might point you one useful direction. I once encountered a story about a blade retrieved from the future that became a looping object, such that the copy retrieved was the one that had already come back in time. The protagonist realized it could not always have happened that way because a sample was taken from the knife--eventually there would be no more knife!

I saw abruptly that this was a form of entropy, and that in any scenario where some timelines are "before" and some are "after" this type of entropy should exist.

Now think of a paradoxical timeline not as a unit but as a cascade of outcome-shifting timelines, and you can see that such a cascade is unstable--entropy continues to increase. Eventually the increase will either break the chain or end existence completely.
