There are models of timetravel where any action that would cause a paradox instead causes you to explode, phase out of existence, or go crazy.

Even if outcome pumps are possible, there's still the probability of your protagonist existing to consider. They shouldn't end up being the sort of person who causes extremely unlikely things to happen all the time, because that would be unlikely.

Outcome pumps are dependent on your ability to reliably influence the future. There's a sweet spot in between "change can't possibly cause a sunny day at this point, so time travel has to be effectively impossible or there would be paradoxes everywhere" and "chance conspires to immediately kill you in some unexpected way if you even /think/ about causing a paradox."
