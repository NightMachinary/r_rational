In a single fixed timeline, everything is part of the timeline and there's no distinction between past and future. You can no more change future events than you can change past events. It's not a matter of certain things being "inside" or "outside" the loop, because there is no loop - or if there /is/ a loop, then everything is inside it. The primary difficulty of the single timeline model is that it can feel incredibly arbitrary; things happen because that's how things happen, whether it's in the past or the future.

Incidentally, I think "the timeline conspires to stop paradox" is the wrong way of looking at it. Instead, pretend that you've got a chess game. Generate all possible game logs, including those with illegal moves. Then, strip out all the game logs with illegal moves. What you're left with, no matter which game you watch being played, will be a result that stays within the confines of the rules, /not/ because there's some authority enforcing those rules, but because you're only looking at the legal games. The timeline isn't conspiring to stop anyone, the timeline is simply free of paradoxes, and if it weren't, it wouldn't be the timeline.
