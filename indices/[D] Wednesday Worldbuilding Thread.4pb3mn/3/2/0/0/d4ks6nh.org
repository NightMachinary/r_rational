Hmmm. Options:

- Paradoxes remain possible (this runs counter to one of the rules defined in your original post)
- Paradoxes are impossible, but the non-paradoxical results are not /evenly/ distributed across the probability space

The first option I will ignore. As to the second - if the non-paradoxical results are not evenly spread across the probability space, then this implies that there is some sort of consistent bias to the universe's paradox resolution. The exact nature of that bias could of course be anything... but it needs to be a bias that makes sense on a particle scale (so a simple bias towards increased - or decreased - lethality seems unlikely)
