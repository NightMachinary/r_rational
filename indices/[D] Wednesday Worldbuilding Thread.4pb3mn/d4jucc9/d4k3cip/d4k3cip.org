If you trigger a paradox, it doesn't just drain probability out of the case where there wasn't a sunny day, it drains some relatively lesser amount of probability out of the case where you decided that you would trigger a paradox if it wasn't a sunny day. Any timeline where the future is full of people trying to abuse paradoxes for their gain is going to be almost completely drained of probability, and so your story is most likely to be about a timeline that rarely came close to paradox.

That, you see, is the Great Filter.
