  Let's say that time travel is a simple consequence of some as-yet undiscovered scientific discovery. Once that discovery is discovered, the stream of coincidences preventing time travel might be sufficiently complex as to make to no-time-travel timeline more unlikely than a simple limited-time-travel timeline (similarly, a sufficiently unlikely series of coincidences preventing that discovery may increase the complexity of the no-time-travel timeline significantly).

Sure, but that's a /lot/ of additional suppositions there that single-timeline time travel requires; and even if there is, for some convoluted reason, almost no chance of a self-consistent timeline /not/ inventing time travel, chance should seem to conspire that it's used literally the minimum possible amount, which raises similar questions about why we ever see it. Not unanswerable questions, but again, it requires lots of unlikely suppositions in order to make sense.
