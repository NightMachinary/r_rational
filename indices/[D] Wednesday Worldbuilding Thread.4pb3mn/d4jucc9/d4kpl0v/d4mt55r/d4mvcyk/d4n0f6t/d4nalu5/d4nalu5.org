Not necessarily.

Let's say that time travel is a simple consequence of some as-yet undiscovered scientific discovery. Once that discovery is discovered, the stream of coincidences preventing time travel might be sufficiently complex as to make to no-time-travel timeline /more/ unlikely than a simple limited-time-travel timeline (similarly, a sufficiently unlikely series of coincidences preventing that discovery may increase the complexity of the no-time-travel timeline significantly).

...ooooh. /Here's/ a scary thought. The simplest timeline might be one in which the nearest star goes nova every time someone discovers time travel. /That/ might be the Great Filter.
