  So, if you really want tomorrow to be a sunny day, you can vow that you will go back in time and kill your parents before you were born (or some more mundane paradox, like stealing the keys to the time machine before you can use it), and as long as you have the determination to follow through on that vow... you won't have to, because it'll be sunny.

Not necessarily. There are a number of ways in which the paradox can refuse to happen.

- Your time machine may misfire, sending you to the wrong place or time.
- Your gun might jam
- You might have a heart attack
- Your mother's marital fidelity left something to be desired, and the man you shoot is not (biologically) your father.

So. Let us assume that the universe simply eliminates all paradoxical results from the timeline; the remaining non-paradoxical results are then expanded to fill all the probabiity space.

Let us say that your odds of dying due to a heart attack or other similarly unstoppable cause (tomorrow) are one in ten thousand (before considering the effects of paradox). Let us imagine that the odds of tomorrow being sunny are one in ten. Normally, these events are uncorrelated; the odds of you dying in a heart attack /and/ the day being sunny are one in a hundred thousand; the odds of you dying of a heart attack /and/ the day being cloudy are nine in a hundred thousand; the odds of you living through tomorrow /and/ the day being cloudy are 89991 in a hundred thousand; and the odds of you living through a sunny day tomorrow are 9999 in a hundred thousand.

For simplicity, let us ignore all other resolutions of the paradox - either the day is sunny, or you die, or there is a paradox. Now, the paradox happens in the "day is cloudy, but you live" timeline - the 89991 in a hundred thousand chance. Those 89991 possible futures don't exist, due to paradox.

Which means that only 10009 possible futures exist. There are 9999 chances of a sunny day that you live through; one chance of a sunny day that you don't live through; and nine chances of a heart attack on a cloudy day.

In other words, an outcome pump designed to produce an event with a one-in-ten chance of naturally occurring /multiplies your odds of sudden death by ten times/. Trying to outcome pump your way into winning the lottery is a more likely suicide than jumping off a cliff would be.

So, this doesn't explicitly /disallow/ outcome pumps, but it gives a very, very good reason not to use them.
