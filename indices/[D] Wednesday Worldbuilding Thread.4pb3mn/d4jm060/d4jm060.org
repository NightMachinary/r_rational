So I've been trying to write a rational /Where's Waldo?/ with Odlaw as the villain-protagonist. The essential dynamic that I'm going for is that Odlaw is an agent of chaos and Waldo is an agent of the status quo.

In /some/ places this works well, because Waldo as a hero is essentially reactive and attempting to right things that have gone wrong. But I'm having trouble with some of the Waldo canon that contradicts this theme. For example, in [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/My_Left_Fang][My Left Fang]], Waldo is trying to help a young vampire grow up to be human instead, which is easy to reframe as morally ambiguous if not outright evil, but doesn't fit in with the narrative of Waldo as maintainer of the status quo. For another example, in [[http://waldo.wikia.com/wiki/It%27s_A_Gruel,_Gruel_World][It's a Gruel, Gruel World]], it appears as though the curse that Waldo is trying to lift has been in place for a fairly long time.

Any thoughts on how to deal with the more troublesome parts of Waldo canon? The reframe doesn't have to be charitable at all, because it's through Odlaw's eyes. Ideally if there are additions to canon, they're as natural as possible.
