The complaints that I've seen don't actually touch on anything about whether the story rational. By far the main complaint has always been that the main character's level isn't going up, which is a feature of the system, and this was explained repeatedly while the main character hadn't reached his cap yet.

If you're getting a bunch of complaints that this story is too much team-building and rules-discovery and not enough cookie-clicker, then the story is not the problem, but that we somehow picked up a bunch of people who aren't actually interested in rational fiction.

As for "frequent update schedule," this story updates once a week. That's downright glacial compared to some of the other stuff that's constantly on the front page.
