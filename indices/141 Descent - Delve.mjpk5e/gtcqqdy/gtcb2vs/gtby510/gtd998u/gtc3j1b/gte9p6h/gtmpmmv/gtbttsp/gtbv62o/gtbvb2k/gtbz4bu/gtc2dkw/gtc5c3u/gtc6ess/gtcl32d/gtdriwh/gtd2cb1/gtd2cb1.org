  The plot and characters are all shallow as a puddle.

You not liking the characters and plot doesn't influence how rational it is.

  I'm saying that, in terms of rationality, nothing sets this story apart from literally every other literary RPG that exists.

Are you serious? Name any other Isekai RPG which is not mentioned or recommended on this sub which goes into deep detail about how the system works, the MC uses actual IRL math when interacting with his/her system and all the points [[https://www.reddit.com/user/AccomplishedAd253/][AccomplishedAd253]] made.

Sure, it may not be the best quality, but it absolutely is more in line with rational and rationalist fiction than 95% of other isekai's. And IMO as I mentioned in last weeks post, it is more on-topic than half of the other stories posted here.
