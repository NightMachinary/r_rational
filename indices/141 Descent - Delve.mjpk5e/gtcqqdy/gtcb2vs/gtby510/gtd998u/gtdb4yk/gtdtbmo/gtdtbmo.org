  But the illusion shatters once you consider what the optimal combatant skill sets look like - a fire magician would have around 10 active skills and 40 passive skills at level 50.

Though I would expect that only a tiny, tiny number of people have the opportunity to map out an optimal skill set. Nobody's sharing information, and the ability to view the skills on offer for various trees is locked behind an EXP gate that nobody outside of Rain's Dynamo build can afford to open.

Most, I expect, would just take whatever skills are in the next tier of the tree they've already unlocked, active passive or otherwise. So the average level 50 fire mage (in as much as there can be said to be one when most people top out before 20) probably has every variation of 'shoot fire at enemy' skill topped out even if they're largely redundant with one another.
