Mentally I've got Delve categorized as â€˜rationalist but not rational'. It feels like a story where the author is trying to walk through the fundamentals behind Rain's decisions, particularly with the open book formula and explicit math, but they've run into a wall where the setting isn't actually robust enough to handle what the author wants to be doing. So it ends up in a compromised position where on the one hand they're trying to be true to the intent of the story, and on the other hand they're trying to paper over the variety of holes they don't want to take over the setting.
