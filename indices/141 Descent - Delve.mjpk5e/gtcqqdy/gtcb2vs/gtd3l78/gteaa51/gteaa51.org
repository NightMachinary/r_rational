For what it's worth, I read this chapter just to see if it was as bad as everyone says it is. Spoiler alert; it's really not. The most grating thing is the lack of leveling or anything to do with the system. I think the author really should've warned folk in advance that leveling was gonna be taking a backseat in this story in the later chapters. I mean....why would you make a LitRPG and not have leveling be the main focus?/ But other than that, the other complaints (cheesy memes, unrealistic decisions, etc) are no worse than other fics I've seen recommended here. If you don't care about the leveling, then IMO you don't even need to stop reading.

If you're looking for stories that can balance leveling with good plot development, I would recommend Salvos and Threadbare. Particularly the latter, as Andrew Seiple (author) has a lot of sequels. I would read those quickly, as he plans to publish them and possibly remove them from his site in the future.
