I downvoted this week's Delve and hid it, as I have been tending to do lately.

As a consequence, I only stumbled across your comment here by accident, and am getting to the discussion after much of it has already been had. I feel like I'm probably not alone in this amongst the people not in favor of Delve here. I don't know what can be done about that though.

I will say that it seems there are a large amount of commenters here, some of whom I've had discussions with, who have expressed that Delve is the only story they're following on [[/r/rational]] and/or the reason they found [[/r/rational]]. A few weeks ago somebody made the (presumably false) claim that Delve had "likely brought more people to this subreddit than anything not on the podium (HPMOR, etc)". This worries me - you're probably more aware than I am of the subreddit stats - it looks like subredditstats claims that subscribers have approximately doubled since 2019-ish but let me know if that's misleading. I think that Delve is a powerful representative of the kind of value-drift we probably want to avoid, and I think with such recent growth that value-drift is something which could become a problem.

Right now, obviously, we have the amazing WtC, and also Pokemon: The Origin of Species, Animorphs: The Reckoning, and Need To Become Stronger as long-running and not-yet-complete flagships, and the unexpectedly good Pith as a newcomer. We have other less frequent ongoing stories like The Optimized Wish Project, the younger Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, and Avatar: The Last Rationalist. And we have some sporadically excellent one-offs. For anybody here to feel that Delve is representative of [[/r/rational]], is the only reason that they're posting here, or that they perceive it "gets the most discussion" raises some alarms. It makes me think of [[/r/gamedesign]], which once had a powerful draw but I abandoned 2 years ago when its mod(s) refused to strictly enforce the sub's rules and it became inundated with unity tutorials, questions about blatant game dev, game critiques, and various other clutter that made it unreasonable to expect for new users to understand what wasn't on-topic [looking there now, it may have improved 10 months ago with a new mod direction? I hope so.] I'm sure there are other salient examples of subreddits that have lost their ways when their userbase has grown too large and prior mod policies weren't adapted, and maybe we're not there now and won't be for some time. But I worry, anyway, that the ecosystem that has produced so many authors producing the amazing stuff that we have here might get lost.
