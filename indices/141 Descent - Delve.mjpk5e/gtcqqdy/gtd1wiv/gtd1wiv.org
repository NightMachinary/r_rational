Personally I like the negative commentary, what is the point of discussion if there are no opposing views? Not sure why you see that as a negative.

To add to that, I think the fact that there are so many negative comments is actually evidence for it belonging to this sub more than not; Why would someone bother writing a negative comment here in the first place? I'd say someone who would bother going that far to share their displeasure must have already invested a lot in the story for their disappointment to actually matter to them enough to act on it (as opposed to just not reading the story). Each of these reports, negative comments etc are all people who at some point LIKED Delve or hoped the story would turn into something they liked, and were turned off as it progressed for whatever reason.

^I don't think a story should become off-topic because the latter parts don't fulfill the promise given at the start, or (the main criticism) that the progress is just glacial. This would only affect "live" readers and should not IMO affect how it is aligned with the topic of the sub.

​

For my more subjective opinion, I think [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Nick_named_Nick/][Nick_named_Nick]] hit the nail on the head with his comment:

  I think people who don't like the pace of the story mix that dislike into a big ol blender and when they pour it out on Sunday morning's they get “this isn't rational” instead of “I don't like the story anymore because nothing has happened since February 2020.”

The criticism is valid and completely irrelevant to how on-topic it is.

Is unfortunately what I personally believe is happening in this case, and it would be a horrible direction this community is taking if the bullies are given a win. Especially in light of the recent conversations about the problems with gatekeeping and the general public's negative view of rational fiction, which this drama is just proving them correct.
