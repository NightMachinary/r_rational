I'm still reading Delve. Is delve strictly rational? Does it raise to the standards of Mother of Learning, HPMOR, Worth the Candle and the other "best" works on this subreddit? Not really on both counts. I agree with several others here that the fiction suffers from impressively poor pacing. In addition, it started with a strong theme of "numbers go up" and "world discovery" in the first few tens of chapters, until the author realized that he couldn't keep those patterns up and had to pivot, which clearly irritated many readers.

Delve kind of lives in this limbo where its LitRPG status gives it a bad rap, but the formulaic nature and self-consistency make it more rational than almost any other story of its genre. I think that the story is still "rational" in the sense that the main character is making reasonable efforts to optimize his power and growth - that rationality simply does not extend to his broader spectrum behavior.

That said, I agree with other commenters in this thread that the debate and readership brought by Delve is good for this community. If we had 3x as many WtC/AtR/MoL/etc level stories floating around, I'd be jumping on the bandwagon to get it outta here - but that's not the world we're in right now. The story only pops up once per week, and as of this edit, it shows up as about 1/23 of posts which makes it something like 4% - not a dominating factor in the subreddit, especially when compared to its readership.

I support allowing Delve to remain on the subreddit, but potentially revisiting the topic in 4-6 months.
