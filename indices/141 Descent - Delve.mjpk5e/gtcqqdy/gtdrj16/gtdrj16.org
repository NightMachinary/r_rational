You say "frequent chapters", but it's only once a week. That's actually relatively infrequent for a web serial, the same tempo as The Daily Grind (and I think less wordcount per update) and far less frequent than most.

I don't think Delve is very good, and I agree with the critics that the pacing is awful. But quality is not currently set as one of the reasons to ban a work from being posted here, so.
