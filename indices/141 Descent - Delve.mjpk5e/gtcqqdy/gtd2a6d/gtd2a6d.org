I personally think we should keep it around. I personally don't read it anymore, but I've enjoyed some of the discussions in here. I also think that, currently, this is a slow subreddit, and Delve isn't exactly blasting tons of great discussions off the front page.

In general, I think if there's a legitimate disagreement about including or disincluding something, communities should err on the side of inclusion. This is partly because getting rid of something that other people want tends to hurt those people more than it helps the people who don't like it. It's also because there's a bias toward more rules and restriction in general, partly because restricted things and people become invisible and at that point can't advocate for themselves. I think it also aligns with a general principle of tolerance, and understanding that, though something might not be for you, it might be for someone else.

I think this community and this sub might grow larger over time, and then these questions can be reevaluated in the light of different dynamics. But, for now, and though I would not be particularly disappointed if these threads ceased, I vote for keeping them around.
