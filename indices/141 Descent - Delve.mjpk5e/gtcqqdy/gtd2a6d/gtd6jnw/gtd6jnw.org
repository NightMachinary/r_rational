  This is partly because getting rid of something that other people want tends to hurt those people more than it helps the people who don't like it.

Heavily moderated subreddits have their use, because anything which isn't tends to evolve into a lowest-common-denominator scenario. This is typically the crux of the matter for me.

The issue is that there just isn't enough convincingly rational fiction to go around. If this subreddit held itself to lofty standards, it would probably just slowly die. I don't think we need to grow the subreddit, but as small and unloved a niche as this already is, I'd rather not chase away a story that at least a good number of people here are enjoying.
