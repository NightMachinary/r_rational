  What, so you think The Daily Grind, The New Humans, Dear Spellbook all are objectively more in-line with rationality?
#+end_quote

I haven't read any of those. Mainly because they didn't seem that rational and I wasn't taken with the premise.

They aren't posted weekly, though. It's a lot more reasonable for an occasional posting that is more fringe.

  Even Pith may be better quality but absolutely ticks off less of the boxes in the wiki for rationalist/rational fiction. You think Pith should be banned too?

+Also not posted weekly.+ I take it back. It looks like it is posted weekly. Maybe it's too much and not appropriate? I'll leave it to people who have actually read it to make that evaluation. I dropped it after the first couple arcs, so I can't say whether it grew to be rationalist or not.
