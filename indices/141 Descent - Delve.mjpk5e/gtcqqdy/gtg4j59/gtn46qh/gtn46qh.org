  If a rule is instituted that attempted rational stories don't belong the only things left on the sub will be hpmor, worth the candle, and arguably mother of learning.

That is patently false.

Have you not read Pokemon: The Origin of species? Animorphs: The Reckoning? Pith? The Optimum Wish Project?

You mention completed works like HPMoR and MoL. That makes me wonder if you just haven't heard of other defining works, which this sub helpfully even lists for you:

Luminosity

The Metropolitan Man

A Bluer Shade of White

Branches on the Tree of Time

The Waves Arisen

though granted, the Wiki's out of date, and there are others which arguably should be added, and some listed below those which certainly ought to be upgraded.

Point is. What are you talking about? If you aren't familiar with even the ongoing works by what I would consider "leaders" of rational fiction, nor more than a surface level of this sub's history, why are you making such pronouncements?
