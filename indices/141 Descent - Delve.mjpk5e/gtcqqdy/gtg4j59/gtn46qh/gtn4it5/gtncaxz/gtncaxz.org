Heres is a list of the rational, ongoing stories in the sub from the last 2 months that I can come up with, that excludes random litrpg's from royalroad that have no connection to [[/r/rational]]:

(Full list of *ongoing* works that I can think of, omitting LitRPGs and the like that just happen to sometimes get posted but aren't connected to [[/r/rational]], like Doing God's Work or Seaborn. "?" for works which I can't remember whether they were posted in that window or not.)

1.  Optimal Wish Project

2.  Hermione Granger and the Silent Country

3.  Pith

4.  WtC

5.  Origin of Species

6.  Naruto: Need to Become Stronger

7.  Practical Guide to Evil

8.  To The Stars (?)

9.  Pyrebound

10. Animorphs: The Reckoning

11. The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere

12. The Promised Neverland

13. Truman's Map

14. Salvos

15. Dear Spellbook

16. The New Humans

17. The Daily Grind

18. Wise Blood

19. Oneoffs by Sprague Grundy

20. Oneoffs by AlexanderWales

21. Lighting up the Dark (?)

22. Dungeon Keeper Ami

23. Inheritors

Note that if we were to include all the royalroad ltrpg's that are have as much claim as Delve, or all the rational-adjacent stories whose fans are polite enough to keep in their own subs rather than veer towards off-topic-ness, the list would be longer, and have a /significantly/ greater average update frequency. The important thing /isn't/ which things are currently posted here that are better than Delve so much as how many off-topic things will get posted here if norms around what is on-topic are eroded.
