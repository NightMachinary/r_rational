Really? What are these other's that are of similar quality to Delve?

I can think of 3 recent-ish additions. One of which involves an office dungeon, one a spellbook, and one some new heros. I tried taking a look at the first two to assess Delve, and - the eveness of their writing may be less than Delve's, though the first of them is perhaps only because it is more ambitious. But if you look back a year, two years, three years - Delve does not fit in. Delve is a divergence from what this sub is, and many (though not all) in this sub have rejected it. Why does Delve need to be here and not elsewhere? Because there are maybe some pandemic-era stories that have started up that aren't as good as The Good Student (which, I think, stopped getting posted here amidst /significantly/ less contention about fit than Delve has inspired) or Pyrebound or Delphic or Aeromancer or The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere, all of which never really blew up here but offer a much, /much/ better representation of what [[/r/rational]] is (note: The Flower and Pyrebound are on-going, Delphic is ... on hiatus?, Aeromancer was abandoned a few years ago - so just going from what I can think of off the top of my head, this offers a pretty good swath of time extending into the current month). And all of that is without getting into all the other stories that are active RIGHT NOW, so many of which are getting ignored:

(Full list of *ongoing* works that I can think of, omitting LitRPGs and the like that just happen to sometimes get posted but aren't connected to [[/r/rational]], like Doing God's Work or Seaborn)

I do not buy that Delve is a "perfectly average ... story, similar to lots of others that get posted to this sub" without applylng gobs of recency bias and outright amnesia.
