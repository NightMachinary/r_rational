If a rule is instituted that attempted rational stories don't belong the only things left on the sub will be hpmor, worth the candle, and arguably mother of learning. If all the average lit rpg stories get banned there won't be much left. Banning delve and not any of the other regular stories like daily grind seems silly.

Basically, if you just banned all the negative comments in the delve posts it would fit in perfectly amongst the other second/third their stories that don't actually get many comments because they just aren't that good
