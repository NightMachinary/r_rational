I think it would be best to have this comment as a top-level post by itself, because otherwise you're only hearing from the people who like to read Delve (or the comments at least) which biases the opinions you'll hear.

As a top-level post, "Should we permit Delve to stay?", then you'll get to hear from everyone involved in the subreddit instead of a subset.
