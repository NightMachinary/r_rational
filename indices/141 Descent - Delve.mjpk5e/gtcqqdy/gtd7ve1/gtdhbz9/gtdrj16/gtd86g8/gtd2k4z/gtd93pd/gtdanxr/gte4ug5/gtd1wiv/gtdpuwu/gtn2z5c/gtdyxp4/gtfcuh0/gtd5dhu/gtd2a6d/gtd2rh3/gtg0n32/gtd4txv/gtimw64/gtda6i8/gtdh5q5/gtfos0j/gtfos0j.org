Seems like discussion is very much in favour of keeping the threads around, but I'd still like to add my support.

I can understand the need to be harsh on what's allowed in big subreddits; otherwise you'll get a proliferation of karma farming and lowest common denominator taking over. But rational is not a big subreddit, and it gets only a handful of new topics every week. As others have pointed out, Delve is one of the few stories to get consistent upvotes and discussion, even if there are some downvotes and plenty of negativity within the threads. A small community like this should be capable of self-policing. If it had negative votes and hardly any discussion, then it would be a much better candidate to be exiled. The fact that it doesn't indicates it is still worthwhile.

That being said, I feel like some of the rancor around Delve could be managed with a slight adjustment. The suggestion to switch to once monthly Delve threads could work well to stop the feeling that it is clogging up the subreddit, and each week's chapter is quite small so wouldn't negatively harm discussion. Alternately, a brief hiatus could be effective - say til 150 - allowing some of the negativity to subside and the story to return to its most popular aspect of leveling.
