Now that is a funny thought.

"In response to the negative commentary on Delve, we have decided to ban all negative commentary on Delve"

I do agree though.\\
Delve had the unfortunate twist of shifting its focus 30 or so chapters in from hard-power by levels to soft-power by inter-personal relationship and alliance, it picked up a lot of salt from people that didn't like that shift.
