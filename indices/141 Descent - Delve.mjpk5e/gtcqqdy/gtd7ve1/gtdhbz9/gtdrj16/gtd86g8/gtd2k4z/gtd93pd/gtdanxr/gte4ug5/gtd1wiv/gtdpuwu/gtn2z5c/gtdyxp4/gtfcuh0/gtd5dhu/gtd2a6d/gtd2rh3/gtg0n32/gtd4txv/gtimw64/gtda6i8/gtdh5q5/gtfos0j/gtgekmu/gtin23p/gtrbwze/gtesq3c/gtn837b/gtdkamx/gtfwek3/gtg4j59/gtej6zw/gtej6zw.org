I read lit rpg as a guilty pleasure. From the lit RPG subreddit I could cross post dozens of stories that have the exact same EXTREMELY low rational content. They all have "rules" and numbers and math. None of them facilitate any rational discussion.

This story in particular does not have any puzzles to solve or examinations of motives that are more than a chapter or two long.

Just because something technically barely meets a criteria for what is rational doesn't mean it has rational merit.

This chapter introduced a problem never before mentioned or even hinted at, had an author provided ready made solution via an arbitrary math equation, and the main characters acted like an issue everyone had wondered about has just been solved.
