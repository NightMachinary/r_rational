Sure, except this is not an employee, its a volunteer running a free show, and there are people in the audience who stop liking the show and instead of walking out start yelling at the author and try to get his poster at the front of the venue torn down.

To address my previous comment that criticism is good: if someone doesn't like it and wants to share that opinion they are free to talk about it in-front of the poster with whoever they want, but the second it gets to the point of trying to get it torn down because they personally don't like it is crossing the line.

I'm amazed at the arrogance of trying to liken a free webnovel as an employee who is creating problems for you though. XD WTF?
