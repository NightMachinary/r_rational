What, so you think The Daily Grind, The New Humans, Dear Spellbook all are *objectively* more in-line with rationality? (which should be your bar for banning something) All those are posted whenever there is an update. If you are going to separate them because their updates aren't regular and weekly then sure, I'd disagree that this should be a bar to remove something but it has nothing to do with being off-topic.

Even Pith may be better quality but absolutely ticks off less of the boxes in the wiki for rationalist/rational fiction. You think Pith should be banned too? - Or is it not rationality that is the bar but quality? Then I also would disagree with you but again it has nothing to do with being off-topic, especially when all the criticisms of delve are so subjective.
