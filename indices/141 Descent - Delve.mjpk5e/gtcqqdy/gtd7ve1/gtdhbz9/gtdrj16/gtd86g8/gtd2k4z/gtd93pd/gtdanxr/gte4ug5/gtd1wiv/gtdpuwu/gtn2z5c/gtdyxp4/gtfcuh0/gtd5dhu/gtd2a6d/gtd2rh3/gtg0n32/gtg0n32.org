I agree with the other posters who suggest the criticism Delve gets is less because it is not rational and more because it is slow.

My opinion is that its slow pacing is an intentional, daring choice, and that in context it makes the story more rational. At its core, Delve is an uplift story. The protagonist is transported to a world locked into repressive, authoritarian social and political structures. As in our world, the powerful tend to grow in power with time and the powerless remain powerless. But this tendency is supercharged by the RPG elements of the world. Accolades and access to leveling support allow hereditary transfer of power on a level impossible in real life. The privileged class are not just wealthier, better educated and politically and socially advantaged. They have superpowers.

The protagonist feels this is morally wrong and should be changed. He starts from a position of moderate privilege (awakened with a decent level cap), but very little personal power. The plot is him trying to increase his power enough to lift at least his part of the world to a more just, egalitarian state.

This is an extremely ambitious goal both for the protagonist and the author, because any realistic attempt at achieving such a monumental task from that starting point is going to take a huge amount of time. Delve takes that time. It shows where the side characters start, and it shows them gradually change under the positive influence of the protagonist. The progression and payoff is less "numbers go brr", and instead "the powerful, reclusive, misanthropic, non-human smith apologized to a human he mistreated and took the time to fashion them a prosthetic leg." Then that human, a retired adventurer, took his new leg and joined a less experienced combat team in hunting down a monster that was causing problems to the community. This helped to secure the camp enough that the two most powerful members of Ascension could could leave to take the protagonist on a delve to increase his level without excessive worry for the safety of everyone else. All of this moved really, really slowly. But every bit of it was the rational consequence of the actions of the main character.

In most LitRPGs, the protagonists solve problems primarily through the increase and exercise of personal power. In Delve, problems (including those caused by the character weaknesses of the protagonist) are solved by people working together as a community, with characters helping according to their personal capabilities and motivations. Ameliah is overconfident and impulsive. She picks a bad fight. Rain is inexperienced in violent situations and places too much trust in his girlfriend. They get their butts kicked. Tallheart ex machina saves them from the negative consequences of a bad choice. Is that irrational? On the whole, I don't think it is. Each character (including the antagonists of the arc) is acting in accord with their previously established nature, motives, and abilities. Each changes and grows from the experience.

I believe the focus on soft power as payoff and progression is admirably rational, and close to unique in the genre (at least among stories I've read). In the real world, political and societal change takes a huge amount of time and effort. A LitRPG with a main character who is essentially a community organizer has the potential to say worthwhile things about rational decision making that are arguably deeper and more meaningful than those focused on an RPG munchkin looking for exploits in the game rules.

Does Delve actually say those things? That's subjective. I'm not sure it does. But it does at least try. I think that deserves a place in this subreddit.
