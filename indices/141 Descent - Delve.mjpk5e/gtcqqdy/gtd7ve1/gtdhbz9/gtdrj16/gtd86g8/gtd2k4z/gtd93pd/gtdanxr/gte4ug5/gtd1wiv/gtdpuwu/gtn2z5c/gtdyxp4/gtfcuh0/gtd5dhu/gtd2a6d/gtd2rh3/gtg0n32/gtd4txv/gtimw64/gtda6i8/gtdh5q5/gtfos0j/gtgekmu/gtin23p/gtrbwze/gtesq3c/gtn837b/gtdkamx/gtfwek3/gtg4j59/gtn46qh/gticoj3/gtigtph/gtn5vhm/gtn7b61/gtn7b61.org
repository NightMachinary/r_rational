I think all of those stories should be getting posted here. A sub reddit can have posts that don't get upvoted or commented on because people think that they aren't good, but all of those stories were in conversation with rationalist literature, such as it is. If all the people that didn't like Delve just stopped posting on it the posts would look like the posts for Pyrebound did. They'd get a handful of comments and quickly drop off the front page. This entire fight is just completely bizarre. Reddit is literally built entirely around handling this "problem".
