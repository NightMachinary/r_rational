  They aren't posted weekly, though. It's a lot more reasonable for an occasional posting that is more fringe.

Ok, well if you agree that half the things posted here are just as off-topic as Delve, then our only disagreement is whether weekly posting is too much; I would disagree completely, the sub is so spartan that it doesn't crowd out anything else, maybe I'd have an issue with daily posting but definitely not weekly.
