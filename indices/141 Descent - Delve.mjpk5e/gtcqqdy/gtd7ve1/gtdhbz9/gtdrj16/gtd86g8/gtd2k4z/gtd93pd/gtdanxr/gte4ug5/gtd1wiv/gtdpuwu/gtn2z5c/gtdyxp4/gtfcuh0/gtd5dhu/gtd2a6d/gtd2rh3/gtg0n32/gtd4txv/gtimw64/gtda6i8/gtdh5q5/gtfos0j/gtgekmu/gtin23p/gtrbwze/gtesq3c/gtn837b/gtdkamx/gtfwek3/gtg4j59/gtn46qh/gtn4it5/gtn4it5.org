Someone on the internet made an exaggeration to prove a point. I'm glad you've provided me with a list of exactly 12 stories that are to be allowed on this sub-reddit in the future, instead of the measly 3 I suggested, with a full 4(?) that are ongoing, with about half of the list being stories from a single author.
