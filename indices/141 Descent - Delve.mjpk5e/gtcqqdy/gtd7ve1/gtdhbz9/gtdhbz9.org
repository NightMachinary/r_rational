I think the hate for this story started out as a reaction to “pacing issues” (never bothered me, story has kept delivering what I wanted) and has become a toxic cool kids signalling meme which quite frankly grosses me out. I'm struggling to put it into words, but the fact that these people are using reports instead of downvotes is troubling.
