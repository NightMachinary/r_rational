The story itself is predictable due to it's simplicity. the actual specifics of the world or system are not. Or did you somehow predict the exploit of training with accolades? Or the way that Rain's slime magically managed to get into his soul when it died? Or how meditation allows building of mystical 'bastions' in your soulspace? Or that connecting to the forebearer artifact would allow Rain to program a terminal system for his abilities? Or literally any other development of the system that wasn't simply stated outright?
