  A store isn't not rational, if you can't predict what's going to happen.

I never said it was. It's just the main way that a story often shows some element of rationality, even if the story is not itself a fully rational story. But it's completely lacking here.

#+begin_quote
  is one of the many possible rational adjacent tropes.

Yes. And this story fails every single other one as well. The closest you get is munchkinry, but even there, the munchkining is only ever handed down by edict. Nothing Rain has ever munchkined to any effect was based on pre-established rules.

Just because the MC uses math doesn't make the story rational.
