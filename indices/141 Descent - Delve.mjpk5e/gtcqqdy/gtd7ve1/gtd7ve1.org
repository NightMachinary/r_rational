I have yet to see a good faith argument for why Delve isn't rational and I have been reading every chapter thread here since Delve began. I do think the quality of the story has declined quite a lot lately and I pointed out several of its failings on the last chapter's thread. That said, none of those failings have anything to do with not being a rational story which, as far as I know, is the only criteria for determining whether something belongs in this sub or not. As I also pointed out on the previous thread, more than a year ago no one was complaining that Delve wasn't rational and none of those characteristics changed. What changed was that a lot of people who liked it before, hate it now and instead of just dropping it or even doing some constructive criticism, they just want to wipe it off the face of the subreddit.
