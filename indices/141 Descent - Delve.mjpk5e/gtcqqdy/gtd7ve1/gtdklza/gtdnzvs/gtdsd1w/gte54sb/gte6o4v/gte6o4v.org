No... what did I say that conveyed that impression? I'm saying that it's not rational because there is nothing that can be figured out by the reader before it is revealed. The 'hard work' the MC puts in simply reveals new author fiat rules, that are granted only after enough months of real-world time has passed. There's nothing rational about 1 year of weekly updates being the needed bar for some random new mathematical exploit to be given to the MC, especially when that exploit is based only on rules and details provided in the very chapter it is discovered.
