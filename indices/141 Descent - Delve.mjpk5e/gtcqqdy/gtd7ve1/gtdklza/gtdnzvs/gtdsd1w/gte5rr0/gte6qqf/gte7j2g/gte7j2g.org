  You totally predicted that Rain was going to get a slime in his soul before it happened?

I didn't predict it, I said it didn't surprise me. Given the facts that had been presented to us, it felt like a fair development.

  When did he theorize this was possible? As far as I recall, he went from not understanding how to get anything more complicated than a clock to show, to suddenly having a full bash shell. In one chapter break....

I don't remember the exact chapter but he did consider it. And the one chapter break you are referring to corresponded to him being trapped in limbo for subjective weeks (or more, I don't actually remember how long it was) with nothing else to do. And if memory serves, he already had a calculator before that.
