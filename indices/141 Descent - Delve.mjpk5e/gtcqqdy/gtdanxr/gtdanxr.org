I'm not a regular poster but I'm been here lurking for quite a while, there are few stories normally posted here that I enjoy anymore, so losing the one I do would not be nice.

I do think that a lot of the negativity doesn't come from a mental space is not 'i don't like this anymore' is more kin to 'falling out of love with a story'. It has happened to me and is nasty, surprisingly so. There was this novel that I loved that went from excellent and fast pacing to even more glacial than delve, it became mostly self serving story going nowhere and milking the patron money. I became genuinely spiteful with the thing, Ive moved on i got no time for grudges but maybe some of the angrier readers are going through that?
