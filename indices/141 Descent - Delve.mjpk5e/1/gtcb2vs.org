Glad we finally have levelling in this story again, the system was always the main driver of interest for me. I really hope we get to see level 25 and the legendary class unlocks relatively soon. Relatively.

On a more meta note, I also look forward to seeing the hivemind opinion switch back in favor of delve, at least until levels stall again. I can already see it happening in this thread.
