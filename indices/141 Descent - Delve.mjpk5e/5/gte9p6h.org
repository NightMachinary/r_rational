I feel like Delve would benefit from a thread once a month to discuss recent developments; it doesn't really progress far enough in a week and that leads to issues. Then again, the patreon gating is another problem which effectively divides the readers in two, and worse, means many of the readers apt to defend Delve instead of attack it are kind of segregated off from the main discussion by weight of foreknowledge.

In some ways, I've enjoyed the Delve threads because it undeniably dances on the line of what this sub considers acceptable, and seeing meta-fights about its acceptability and its rising and falling fortunes of this each week is an amusing minigame. It's kept fresh by Delve's neurotic tendency to jump between perspective and the extremely inconsistent quality this tends to produce week to week, but I can understand how patience with it is running thin.

As a third point, I used to like discussing Delve on its own Discord, but then that got phone-ID gated and I ditched it. So there might be something of a low-effort-commenter refugee community from that alone.
