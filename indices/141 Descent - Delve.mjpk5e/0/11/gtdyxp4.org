I'll vote for keeping it as well. I've been a patreon supporter for a long time and used to enjoy coming here for the comments section. Its unfortunate that people complaining about the story have poisoned that well, but I view that as an issue with those people, not the story.

The arguments for why this story isn't rational can often be rightfully applied to other more popular stories on this sub that most people would consider rational. It seems obvious to me that what sets Delve apart is the quality of the story, and the idea that this story should be banned because the authors been fucking it up recently is kind of shit.
