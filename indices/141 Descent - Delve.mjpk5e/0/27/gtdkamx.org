I like Delve. It has its problems, but I've enjoyed reading it and will likely continue to read it. I don't think it's rational, however, and I don't think it should be on this subreddit.

The criticism of the pacing, and characters and whatnot is all reasonable, but I actually think that's besides the point. The reason Delve doesn't belong on this sub is that there really isn't any rational discussion to be had. What little rational-adjacent portions of the story there are are almost exclusively small math optimization problems, that can only even be addressed after the author gives us the answers. Most of the questions or details in the story are like this. The plot and MC's advancement are almost exclusively by author fiat. There's very little that can be interestingly discussed on this subreddit, beyond just critical review of the story structure itself. It doesn't seem like a worthwhile fit for a rational discussion forum.
