I dunno. I think that people could probably have a discussion about and dissection of basically any story through the lens of rationality. Honestly, I kinda wish this subreddit spent more time talking about non-rational stories through the viewpoint of rational fiction, because it's kind of neat. That's what a lot of the more fun fanfic is, after all. And I've seen comment chains on stuff like Mother of Learning that go into flagrant speculation and wild-ass guesses. Educated guesses, sometimes, but only sometimes.

Basically, what I'm getting at is, blaming the story for the commenters being lazy isn't fair.
