Let me put it simply, Upvote farmers are scum. The only purpose this type of post has is to upvote farm.

​

Everyone that reads Delve is subscribed to it and can see when it comes out without this post. Discussion happens in these posts very rarely. People that want to discuss it can go to plenty of other places to do so.

​

Why keep this posts around just so some guy can farm upvotes ? Fuck that, he doesn't even comment on the sub, he's a lurker (maybe not even that) who every sunday posts delve and gets some upvotes.

​

It's not like there's several people posting, just one dude, just ban him if he doesn't stop.
