Something else I think it is important to address:

We don't post A Practical Guide To Evil here so much anymore, largely because it was contentious whether it was rational or not. Besides, it made sense to focus on its own subreddit.

Pact, Twig, Ward, and now Pale are not posted here - it was argued that they were not rational, and even once a week posting wasn't necessary. Besides, discussion makes more sense in its own subreddit.

And there are various others. For instance, I count about 5 litrpg's which are popular with readers here, which do not get weekly posts here.

Those making arguments that there are so few things posted here that Delve /isn't/ crowding things out when it occupies 4% of posts are missing that that is partly because the other, much more popular but not-quite-rationalist works /intentionally are not getting posted here out of respect for this sub/ and its desire to maintain diversity and focus and have found themselves other spaces for discussion.

LightWaivers used to post pony stuff here and that was contentious, and similar arguments about volume versus sub-focus occurred. Breaking_The_Candle sometimes does, and posts other things too, but limits theirself to about 2 recommendations at a time, and while I downvote those, they are at no risk of changing what it looks like this sub is.

Why can't Delve and its proponents show the same level of respect for the rest of the community that all these others have?
