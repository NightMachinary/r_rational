The sidebar gives some criteria to look at:

#+begin_quote
  In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.
#+end_quote

Definitely present. Take the recent Hagar fight: in a standard LitRPG, the result of this would be either that Rain uses some absurd exploit to win the encounter solo, or that he fails and pivots into a training arc angling for a rematch. Neither happens: Rain attempts to use an exploit, but is worried that the obvious downsides of his combo will bite him in the ass. This is followed by the obvious downsides biting him in the ass and him having to get saved by his higher level teammates, who are consequently more more willing to pressure Rain to take what they deem to be 'necessary steps' to prevent a repeat of this incident.

#+begin_quote
  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

You can quibble on 'intelligent' given that the MC has a very naive worldview and doesn't seem to grasp the enormity of the danger he is in. But in terms of creative use of resources, he has done pretty well for himself; coming up with novel-in-universe builds, correctly identifying a major systemic issue in society and trying to create an organization which will correct for that problem.

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

If anything, the problem is that Rain navel gazing about his own motivations is a major driver of the awful pacing issues that get people up in arms about this story. You might argue that too much waffling about the character's decision-making process is a failed execution of this feature, but I don't buy it - it just means that the failure is a failure to be a good story, not to fit into the rational fiction genre.

#+begin_quote
  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
#+end_quote

Not really present.

#+begin_quote
  Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Very much the case here, especially if you are willing to consider Rain's struggle with soulstrain as a direct analogy for the cognitive distortions brought on by a chronic illness; Rain puts a great deal of his effort into routing around these issues and finding ways to better himself which do not aggravate his condition.

#+begin_quote
  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
#+end_quote

The background characters are more more rational than the on-screen characters, generally speaking; the worldbuilding does a decent job of extrapolating various models of running a society based on the existence of the personal power differentials brought about by the level system and how these social responses would subsequently evolve over time due to interaction with one another and lost purposes. (Looking at you, Adventurer's Guild). It doesn't talk about it in those /terms/, but if you're aware of the concept you can see them clear as day working in the background.

Overall, I think that Delve is not a great story, but also not a terrible story. It has several faults, but those faults are generally not the sorts of faults that disqualify a story from being rational fiction, and have a great deal more to do with the bad pacing and the inconsistent quality of the character writing.
