You listing it out like this actually highlights something to me. I think that Delve might be written explicitly off of that list, with the author trying to hit every checkbox on the lineup of what is seen to make a rational story, without consideration for if that makes a compelling story. The way the narrative occasionally takes massive diversions into math, especially, feels like an attempt to prove to the audience that the world is internally consistent, without showing it. It's a cheat code for the kind of worldbuilding that a good fantasy story does early and often - establishing the rules, then sticking to them, then giving you a twist - but without the twist. Because math doesn't do that.
