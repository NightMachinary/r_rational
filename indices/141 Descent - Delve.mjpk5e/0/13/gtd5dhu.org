Ultimately I think the reason why Delve gets a lot of hate is pretty simple, it has bad pacing, really bad slow pacing.

Still it fits what you'd expect from a rational story, the world is consistent, the stats and numbers actually mean something, unlike most litrpgs where it's just padding to give a sense of progression, that's why it has a whole [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_C99jHLyw_ARFfKNPvmGAxUCrKbNWOXE0kTVIUDYH9g][calculator / character sheet]] to evaluate the MC abilities present and future.

Beyond that the actions of the characters make sense in relation to their internal motivations, lots of people whine about Rain being too soft, but you only get that impression because in universe time he hasn't been in there for that long and changing takes time and new experiences, again this is an issue with pacing, not the character.

Ultimately I get why some people are mad, but they take that one aspect and try to pretend everything about the story is bad just cause of that one aspect.
