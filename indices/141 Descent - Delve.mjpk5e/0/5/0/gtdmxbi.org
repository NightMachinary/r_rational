  The story only pops up once per week, and as of this edit, it shows up as about 1/23 of posts which makes it something like 4%

oof, I was going to suggest a "one post a month" compromise, but if it really is 1/23rd of all posts, that's enormous. And illustrates the problem perfectly: it's not that we have too much Delve, but that we lack stuff that's Not Delve.

More of us need to man up and become hack frauds so we can have /new/ things to complain about.
