Reporting because you don't like it and harassment with the aim of getting it banned = bullying.

Criticizing and discussing the story != bullying.

There is a fine line between constructive criticism/discussion and bullying, I would think that line is fairly obvious though, and it is also obvious how one is a net positive and the other is a net negative.
