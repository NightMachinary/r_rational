That's a wonderfully well-put presentation of interpreting Delve. I do want to just point out though that Ameliah didn't really come off as overconfident (she was really worried about any confrontation with the noble lady outside the mine) or impulsive (she seemed cautious and thoughtful) in my reading of the story.
