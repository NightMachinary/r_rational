The thing with training with accolades wasn't the solution to a problem, so I don't see a problem with it being introduced. A bit arbitrary sure, but accolades hadn't been explored in depth yet so I feel like the author has some leeway there.

The slime entering his soul didn't surprise me at all; we already knew they were connected through Rain's soul, and that his soul had a hole in it. I found it ridiculous, but a fair development all the same.

The soul meditation thing is all mystical mumbo jumbo, I'll agree, but then again, there hasn't been any concrete benefits from it either. If he does get something from it, I expect it will be the same Reading ability we already know the Watch has, as well as being able to disguise his “emissions” from others like we saw one goldplate from the Watch doing.

Lastly, connecting to the artifact didn't “allow” him to program his terminal, it just gave him plenty of subjective time with which to do it, something he had already theorized was possible, but never had a lot of free time to try. And yes, I did think something like that might happen since he managed to force his IFF skill to work with blacklists, whitelists and to selectively distribute different aura intensities to different people (that's basically a program in itself).
