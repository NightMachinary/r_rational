The whole thing with this kind of stories tends to be that the MC figures out /new/ ways to use the system. It's pretty hard to lampshade stuff the MC has to invent, as you can't show other people having those things. And even if they did have some of those things, they are secretive as fuck, so they wouldn't tell. It's easy to see that Rain and the girl gets together blessed by the power of tropes.
