Hmmm i visit those threads to check up on the story if anything happened and ofcourse for that sweet sweet drama. I stopped following it /some/ chapters ago because it got really ridiculous. it may have had some rat adjc elements to it in the first 90 or so chapters but when most of the wordcount of the story is spent doing something else i dont think you can justify it staying here. Yeah it has some elements which are nice but they are so few and far inbetween that i dont think they serve as a good justification for the story to keep getting posted here every damn week.

I generally dislike the insinuation that people that dislike the story "mix the dislike of the pacing with it not being rational" but lets say thats true. I also dont think the story should keep getting posted here every week if all we will be seeing is complaints. ALso the complaint of pacing in itself is still valid ? when half the wordcount of the story has nothing to do with the matter at hand why does it keep getting posted here.
