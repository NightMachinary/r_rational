Delve keeps getting removed because people are (charitably) reporting it as off-topic in a good faith effort to keep the sub on-topic or (uncharitably) using the report button as a super-downvote. I'd like to keep our reporting threshold where it's at, since it /does/ help get rid of obvious spam and trolls if mods aren't continually camping the subreddit, but that means that Delve is a problem.

I don't read Delve, never have, and don't intend to. The story gets posted pretty much every single time, there's rarely much good discussion on it, the upvote ratio is quite bad, and there are frequent chapters which means that it takes up a fair amount of the subreddit's front page. IMO, all the problems are further exacerbated by the Patreon gating.

With that in mind, I think we need to make some kind of determination of whether or not it actually belongs here, because it's a source of some animosity between users. Again, I don't read Delve, and it doesn't seem like my cup of tea. I'm generally against things getting posted and discussed here if they are only kind of adjacent and disliked by a solid contingent of people. On the other side of the coin, it's typically not been the moderation policy to remove things strictly on the basis that there's some argument about whether or not they belong, since that would mean mods have to read everything posted to the subreddit, and those judgements are ultimately subjective anyway.

Take this opportunity to argue the issue, with as much civility as you can, and after discussion among the mods, we'll either ban it entirely or keep it for the foreseeable future. (Personally, as someone who occasionally dips into the comments, I'm in favor of it going, since the comments are mostly low-effort and/or complaints about the story.)
