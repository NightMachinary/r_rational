I'd vote for allowing it. It's not a good story, largely because, as has been repeated ad nauseum, the pacing is horrific and the characters are mediocre at best. But at the very least it's /trying/ to meet most of the goals of rational fiction (even if it's not intentionally/explicitly rational), and I don't think the sub should disallow things just because they aren't good.

I also really don't think it's that hard to ignore, nor is it crowding out other, better things, given the relatively low volume of posts on the sub.
