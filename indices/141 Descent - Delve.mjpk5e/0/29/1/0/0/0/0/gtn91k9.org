A Practical Guide to Evil updates twice a week. Pale updates 2.5 times a week. Ave Xia Re whatever, Seaborn, Threadbare, Re:Monarch, Super Minion, RE: Trailer Trash, Tower of Somnus, Cinnamon Bun, The Wandering Inn ... etc are all very popular with readers here, either getting occasional upvoted posts of their own or frequently recommended and upvoted by multiple users in the weekly recommendation threads.

What would it look like if everybody spammed the sub with these, as the sub is spammed with Delve? I think a case could be made for /many/ of them that is at least as strong as Delve's. But we don't want to make this sub /r/litrpg2+some_other_things_the_old_users_liked.

Why doesn't reddituser52, or AccomplishedAd253, or dragfie, or Nick_named_Nick or one of the other Delve proponents not make it it's own subreddit? Why hasn't that even come up? Any reason I can think of is also a reason that it isn't so important that Delve keep causing rifts /here/.

I do agree that there are some particular dynamics which have made Delve weirdly contentious and the model of â€˜gets posted rarely and is ignored' would be fine. But it's not that, it is what it is. I think a big part of the problem is that it has a large non-rational following and there's no Delve discussion anywhere else.
