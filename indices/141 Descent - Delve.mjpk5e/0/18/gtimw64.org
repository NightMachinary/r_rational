Frankly I considered it considerably less qualified as rational fiction when ameliah decided to attack the 3 high bronzes without tallheart present. It was just...well it was the first time a capable character in delve held the idiot ball, I think.

I agree that the comments on some chapters aren't really interesting, and I think that's because the pacing means some chapters simply don't give much fuel for discussion. So a fair compromise might be a monthly or fortnightly discussion thread instead of weekly? That way there's more potential of the chapter having something worth discussing, perhaps.
