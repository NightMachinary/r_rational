Letting it build up helps a lot. I've been backing on patreon every third(ish) month so that I'll at least get blocks of 8 chapters (and then 4 piecemeal) and it helps a lot. I am thinking about walking away for a while at the end of this month and not looking at delve for 6 months or so. I still like the story but it is true that the pacing isn't what I would want.
