Yeah, I think I'm going to try something I've never done yet with a webnovel; let the chapters build up a bit.

I've been starting to loose interest a bit, and recognize that as the same issue most people seem to have: the pacing, which should be solved by just picking it back up later.

I think its just that before it mattered, people didn't bother to respond to the "I don't like it, therefor not rational" comments, but now that the devs are actually considering removing it the ppl (like me) who would normally not say anything are actually saying something.
