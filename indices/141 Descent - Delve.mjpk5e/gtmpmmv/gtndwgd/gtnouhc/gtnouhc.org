  The algorithm is not, I think, entirely honest. For instance, isn't there some kind of vote decay in play? At any rate, Delve's ratio's are abysmal. It is hard to get anything significantly lower (e.g., to 40%) with basically anyone upvoting it.

This looks likely to be biased given your clear disdain for the subject. Does anyone have evidence that upvotes are being given more weight?

  Why not let these people make their own subreddit or post it to the litrpg sub instead? Why do we have to stomach an off-topic weekly discussion, and one bringing in outside users here just for that, when historically we haven't handled things that way?

How is it that skipping over posts such as Delve - which I've done myself for a few months now - seems like such a chore? Relevance is in the eye of the beholder, and it looks like quite a few people like to see it here enough to upvote it. The "outside users" comment also concerns me. Everyone in this subreddit had to start somewhere, with some piece of fiction that interested them, after all.
