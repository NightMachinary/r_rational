You don't think "Examination of Goals and Motives" is covered by the frequent discussions between characters about why they are doing what they are doing and if that is actually the best course toward what they wish to achieve, "Aspiring Rationalism" through the examination of how various people's pasts can cloud or shape their thinking and characters interactions causing them to gain new perspective on how to tackle old mindsets, "Thoughtful Worldbuilding" through the entire economy of sociopolitical setting at multiple levels and "Munchkinry" through Math basically qualfies it as this subreddit?\\
