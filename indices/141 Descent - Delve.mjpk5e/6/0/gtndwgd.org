The algorithm is not, I think, entirely honest. For instance, isn't there some kind of vote decay in play? At any rate, Delve's ratio's are abysmal. It is hard to get anything significantly lower (e.g., to 40%) with basically anyone upvoting it.

  But please - let others who want to discuss the story - especially rational aspects of it - have their space here, too.

Why not let these people make their own subreddit or post it to the litrpg sub instead? Why do we have to stomach an off-topic weekly discussion, and one bringing in outside users here just for that, when historically we haven't handled things that way?
