I've kind of drifted away from Delve, which I'm guessing puts me in the same category as others in this subreddit whom I'm guessing also don't read it, and want to see these posts removed. I don't know, maybe there are some that are hate-reading, then hate-posting?

Anyway, with much respect to [[/u/alexanderwales]], and the tough and often thankless job of moderating that you do, I think that at least some of the reasoning at play behind the consideration to remove Delve posts needs to be examined.

"High" frequency of chapters is overstated. Judging by the topics, Delve continues to update once each week. Other works are not being rapidly buried under new Delve topics. Arguments to remove this story are from a purity of forum perspective - not from usability. Rationality is something subjective, and I certainly had the impression there was a degree of it present in the story concept.

The upvote ratio is a net positive, which I take as evidence that there is considerable interest in the story on this forum, this despite a significant minority of forum-readers that downvote the updates. It seems entirely reasonable to me that those who dislike the story can skip by it, and otherwise continue to use the subreddit unimpeded, just as I do these days. Well, mostly.

Months past, when I was regularly reading the story and posting to the threads, I found it very difficult to enjoyably discuss the work due to the avalanche of negativity present in the discussion threads. Note that the main thread itself tends to have a positive score in the double digits. If those who still enjoy the story are not commenting due to a perception of hostility - as I was - you end up with a handful of low effort threads mixed in with complaints.

I'd ask that those who dislike Delve have some consideration for those who do. There are plenty of other things to chat about, explore, enjoy, and share in this subreddit. If Delve comes up as a recommendation, of course de-recommend it as appropriate. But */please/* - let others who want to discuss the story - especially rational aspects of it - have their space here, too.
