I tried doing some pre-production work on a Delve parody, thinking it would be as easy to do as it is with Worth The Candle. Very, very quickly... within three paragraphs... I realized this was not the case. I can't make it work. It's impossible (for me) to make something interesting and/or funny with the source material.

There are various reasons for this that weren't obvious until I actively bumped into them:

*The Skill System is Bad*

"Bad" defined as "for facilitating storytelling" and "for making an interesting game system".

It's somewhat similar to Diablo 2's system, except every single skill point yields a new skill. The main character's aura trees are designed to obfuscate this - almost everything is a utility skill. Even his attack auras, Heating Unit+Air Conditioner, double as utility skills.

But the illusion shatters once you consider what the optimal combatant skill sets look like - a fire magician would have around 10 active skills and 40 passive skills at level 50. It's not very interesting whether one kills monsters with fire, lasers, or an axe. Certainly not the multi-chapters worth of attention Rain does considering his multipliers.

Another arguable issue with it, is only a few types of skills interact with the greater world. You don't have to study or go on an adventure to learn a spell, you just pick it up off a menu. The most important type of reward characters can get in this world, and they have all the weight and drama of going to wal-mart and buying a burrito for a buck o'five.

You see some of the consequences for this in the official novel - you'll never have a hard list of all the skills in the skill trees (though it should exist and should be finite), you'll never have an in-depth character sheet of a high level side character's skill list. Which I think is kind of a shame - the guy who does /I Hate Being Wed In A Fantasy World/ has these absurdly huge character sheets of all the main characters. They're a mess, but they're a beautiful mess and I love them.

Additionally the skill bloat makes the individual importance of any single skill much less. Again, obfuscated (so far) by Auras having massive weaknesses, thus making it easy to make various "crucial" passive skills. But that can only work until they begin to scale into being good skills, after that point it's putting sprinkles on top of yogurt. This is why it's been so important to keep Rain from gaining levels - to give the skills he has a time to shine and matter, and to give the author time to figure out how he's going to make a complete ~50 skill long build where every skill matters.

The MC's leveling cheat letting him hit any level cap immediately is also an issue. If he lifted his level cap by ~20 levels, he'd double his skill list within a few chapters (by Delve's reckoning) and become a completely different character where it concerns his powers.

*The Core Characters Don't Have Unique Goals*

Rain's core drive in life is to make as many friends as possible. A boring version of Michael Scott. In my own opinion, the worst aspect of the character isn't his drab bog standard liberalism (though it makes it impossible for *me* to write the guy. 'He passes out after two sips of a long island ice tea' and 'he wears ninja turtle pajamas for the whole story' were not a good start to my efforts).... it's that /the guy isn't horny enough/.

I'm not saying he has to be thinking about boobs constantly, just that he'd be a little more human if he had a pulse. The guy is chaste to a cartoonish degree, and I'm not just complaining that he wouldn't hold the horny stance samurai girl's hand or explore if he was deer-sexual when he lived with a deer for months on end - it's about any kind of /desire/.

He has two of them. Make friends, and maximize the power of his aura skills through math. The text says he wants to snuggle with Ameliah, but I don't buy it.

The two other main characters, Lonely Girl and Lonely Deer, are basically the same person as Rain. This makes the core cast... not optimal for doing zany or new things. Make them sit around a campfire and eat potato soup together, and they're 100% happy with the universe.

They could really use a pernicious god giving them quests by edicts from on high, or something.

*In Conclusion, It's A Rather Rigid World*

About any idea I could come up with would be 10,000 times better with a custom setting, instead of being fanfiction. Rain goes into the sewers to kill slimes, screws up, and somehow causes the monsters in there to become The Blob, which wipes out the town? Maybe viable for around 12 pages. Change the idea to an MC who wants to feed everyone and everything to his "slime girlfriend" (the slime isn't a monster girl, it's just a slime. The MC is just a sicko.)? That's an obvious ~200 page horror story right there.

Rain without auras and trying to stretch them out for as many manhattans as he can isn't Rain. Changing anything important and keeping it still be recognizable as Delve is really, really hard.

If you want to write something like Delve, you're much better off making your own dungeon diving and/or tribe-building story.
