I dunno how it compares to Games, but [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]'s protagonist Sylvester is my go-to example of a magnificent bastard of a protagonist. He's a little kid, who's part of a government-sponsored group of terrorists. His speciality is psychological warfare and getting into the heads of enemies as well as allies. He's unabashedly villaneous, too. The only reason I still rooted for him was that the antagonists were /even worse/, and because he cares so much for his friends.
