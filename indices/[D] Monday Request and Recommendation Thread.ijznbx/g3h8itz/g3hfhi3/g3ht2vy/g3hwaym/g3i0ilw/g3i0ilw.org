I think it's because he ends up writing the same Jaune every time, even if the starting premise has Jaune develop differently. Even his other characters start getting a bit same-y across multiple stories. That being said, I really enjoyed his Relic of the Future fic until I stopped reading it about a year ago. It went in a direction I didn't like, but the character relations and hijinks were really fun to read.
