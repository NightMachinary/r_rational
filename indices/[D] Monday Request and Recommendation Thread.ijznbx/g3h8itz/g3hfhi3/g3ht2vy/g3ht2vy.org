You know, I don't know why, but I just can't really enjoy Coeur Al'Aran's stories. His RWBY fanfics aren't /bad/---they're relatively competently written, he handles worldbuilding and characters better than canon RWBY (though that's not a high praise, lol), and they generally /make sense/. But whenever I read them, I always get a feeling like I'm reading a... /flat/ story. Not really boring, per say, but not one I can really get invested into. They always seem kinda disappointing and unimaginative, which is weird, considering that his scenarios and plots can get really varied and original. It /reads/ like canon rehash, even when it isn't. Can't really explain it. Which is why I can't help but kinda feel confused whenever someone recommends Forged Destiny as on the same level (or better) than The Games We Play---the latter seems way /way/ more mind-blowing in terms of worldbuilding, plot, or action.

His purely comedic works are way better than the serious ones, though---/those/, I can enjoy.
