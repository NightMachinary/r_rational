Huh, I'd forgotten about HP Bars.

I'm more thinking about the Cheesing that Jaune uses to bend his class into a combat one, as well as the level system that Raven uses, and the Charisma Stat tricks that the ruling classes utilize. I would defend the ending of the story as at least semi-rational, but the start was shaky yeah.
