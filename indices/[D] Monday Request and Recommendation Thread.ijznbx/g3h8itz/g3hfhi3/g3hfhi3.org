For More RWBY I would go with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] AU where people in the world operate off of RPG mechanics. It's known, and everyone can see titles and states, something that is cheesed and abused to near 'game breaking' levels as the fastest way to gain levels is to kill something at your level or stronger..

Monster, or Human.

Not to mention it's got a whole subtext of class gentrification as the Humans align themselves to their titles, and NPC's (Need Protection Caste) spend their lives locked into the profession floating over their head.

I would call it semi-rational, as the rules of the RPG are followed and can't be broken, however the characters themselves do not operate as rational actors in all situations.
