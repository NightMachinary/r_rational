Not explicitly rational, but this is an interesting and well written manga about a character studying and learning art/oil painting for the purposes of getting accepted into the Art Department at a prestigious university.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it even taught me a lot about appreciating fine art in terms of color, composition, techniques etc. It has rational elements in terms of progression and character motivations.
