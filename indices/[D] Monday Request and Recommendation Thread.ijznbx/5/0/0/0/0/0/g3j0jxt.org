If you're willing to entertain fan fiction, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521][I Woke Up as a Dungeon, Now What]] is my current favorite "true" dungeon core story.

It has several huge spoilers for Worm, in case you haven't read that and are planning to, but doesn't really require much background knowledge so long as you are willing to accept that the main character had a past before becoming a dungeon. Overall, it mostly does its own thing with its own setting and just happens to have the main character of another story as its protagonist, and overall it's pretty decently done.

It does play the "unexpectedly friendly dungeon" trope, but better than most and with a setting that still sets up future conflict once the locals accept her. Essentially, she winds up in an impoverished buffer state between two hostile empires currently in an uneasy truce. Most of the local dungeons (which provide an important ecological and economic role) were wiped out a generation earlier, and now her appearance is both a lifeline and a promise of renewed hostilities as the currently unstable equilibrium is broken.

My only real complaint about the story so far is that the update pace is on the slow side, and the plot hasn't been breakneck either. The characters, world building, and general story development have been pretty spot on though, in my opinion.
