Recently I read Max Gladstone's soft SF Empress of Forever. Overall more positive than negative feelings - definitely /not/ a must read, but I've read way worse. It's pretty much not particularly 'rational' in most ways, but there's a ton of cool space opera stuff. It reminds me a lot of Iain M. Banks' Culture books in overall aesthetics, futurism, etc. The central 'twist', if it can even be called such, was super obvious to me from basically the start of the book, but having a fairly obvious plot didn't ruin the book for me. The plot twist was extremely similar to [[https://web.archive.org/web/20180201103146/http://squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html][one of Scott Alexander's short stories]] which I loved (the story in question, if you read it/have read it, could be construed as spoiler for Empress of Forever, but then again the plot of the book being predictable didn't spoil my enjoyment much.) The best parts of the book are setting and worldbuilding; the characters were fairly flat, and the prose was workmanlike at best.
