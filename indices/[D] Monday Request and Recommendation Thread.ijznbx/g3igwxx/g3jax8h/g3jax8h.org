[[https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-8/hiatus-2/][Strong Female Protagonist]]

It's a Webcomic on Hiatus, but has some complete story arcs that are well worth it. The 'Villain' and 'Hero' are no longer fighting, both of them working to actually fix the world after growing out of the adolescent thought that you can punch things to fix the world.

Some of the Arc's are chilling, with one, you'll know which will more than likely make you cry. The one true superhero of the story, the one who found a way to make a difference.

The one actual superhero, made the horrible, rational choice.
