Original:

My Hero Academia is a fairly textbook Shonen Superhero story, but it's a well executed example of such. It doesn't have much in the way of new ideas, but if you like those there's a lot to reccomend it.

One Punch Man is hilarious if you don't mind a setting not taking itself seriously. The protagonist is good, but the best of it comes in the secondary characters like King.

Fanfic:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/batman-1939-the-dangers-of-being-cold.27163/][Batman 1939]] One of the best DC AUs I've ever seen, or just AUs in general. An excellent series of stories, about batman, that genuinely feel as though they were set in the late thirties. Excellent writing and research.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/spider-liv-olivia-octavius-au-quest.53960/page-3#post-12218583][Spider-Liv]] Excellent Spider-Man fanfic in an AU marvel setting; among others, Olivia Octavia as Spider-Person, here Arachne. Features transhumanism, politics, AI.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/][Impurity]] Worm fanfic. AU Altpower, but well written, and unlike basically every alt-power out there it both knows where it wants to go /and/ that place isn't stations of canon with a new skin.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25633546/chapters/63655201][Administrative Mishap]] Worm/Supergirl. It's a post GM fic, where the only part that survived Contessa's bullets was Queen Administrator, but a queen administrator that's been irrevocably altered by binding so closely with Taylor.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.39011/][Assimilation]] Somewhat self indulgent DC fic, but much better than pretty much everything in the glut of YJ fics. Significantly more rational-aesthetic than most of the stuff here.
