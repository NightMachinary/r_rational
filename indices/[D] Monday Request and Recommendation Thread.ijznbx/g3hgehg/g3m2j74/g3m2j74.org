Interesting! So the story takes place in the setting of the first game? Does Max behave as you would expect from a 300-year-old lich, struggling to connect with even the elderly of the early 21st century, much less kindle a romance with someone 5% her age? Or does she effectively have the mind and voice of a teenage girl?

On a broader note, what did [[/r/rational]] think of LiS / LiS:BtS / LiS2? I broadly enjoyed all three in equal measure, though looking at [[/r/lifeisstrange]] you'd think the second one never came out. I think partly that's because most of the fandom's focus is on the romantic plots/ subplots, which I largely ignored on my playthroughs. Specifically, I found Chloe's character to be rather grating, and so had little interest in her as a romantic partner or friend, and Warren was... ok, but not terribly exciting. Rachel, Finn, and Cassidy likewise didn't do much for me. Instead, I liked the games for their supernatural elements and PNW setting, as well as their extended casts / b-plots. As such, bay over bae was a pretty easy decision for me, and I'd reckon for most here, given this sub's predominating utilitarian inclinations?
