Really?

The aliens are the "Orion Arm Trading Company", and they want to ship out rare metals from the solar system to... elsewhere, in return for gadgets. How is this going to work on a reasonable timescale without FTL?

Also, in chapter 10, they talk about one of the Voyager missions going towards the galactic core, which is ~25K light years from here. And doing that in hundreds of years.

At any rate, human civilization had some means to send macro-scale spacecraft at nearly the speed of light, even though they were not at Kardashev level 2 yet. If you're not doing FTL, that's a whole lotta energy, so something doesn't add up. I don't know, maybe that was a mistake by the author.
