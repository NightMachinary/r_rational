I think it's got to do with the fact that the emotional component, is perfunctory. For as much as I enjoy the rational components in stories (I'm here after all) the emotions and responses in a story have to be as well written as anything.

Coeur isn't bad, but also isn't fantastic with the emotional. It's serviceable with only Jaune getting development, and everyone else spelling out each emotional step as they go. It's communicated why, and how they feel, but the reader doesn't feel it.

I don't know, when he/she gets that part down they'll be a very good author with an editor to clean up the usual issues on web-serials.
