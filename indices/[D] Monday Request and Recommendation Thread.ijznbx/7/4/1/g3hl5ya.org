Hmm I don't know. You are right that it sort of starts that way, but as the story goes on the author blatantly ignores or sidelined the more gamey stuff. For example in the very beginning the characters have hp/aura bars, but later they are just completely forgotten. The story applies its own established rules so inconsistently I think I'd go so far as to say that the story is very irrational. If you can get past that its an enjoyable enough story, but marketing it as even semi rational is just incredibly misleading.
