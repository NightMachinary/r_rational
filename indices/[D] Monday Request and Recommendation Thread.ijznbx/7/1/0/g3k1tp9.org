Seconded. Although while I agree about only rooting for him only because the enemies are worse at the beginning, by the time I got a few arcs in I was so invested in his relationships with the lambs that I got really attached to him. He gets a lot of character development (if you can call it that) in the middle & latter parts of the story as well
