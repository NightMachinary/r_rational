Yes, absolutely, in my case it actually was the first RWBY fic I read. It actually goes way, way of the rails of canon, being first written when the show was just starting, and the world and characters that appear are pretty much those that were mentioned or existed in the first one or two seasons. It is pretty much an AU, I was kind of disappointed when I started watching the show and reading other fanfics and realised the story (and often characters) had not much in common.
