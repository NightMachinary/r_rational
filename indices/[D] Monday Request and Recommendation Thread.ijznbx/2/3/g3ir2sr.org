Rational:

First off the bat would be the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse][Bobiverse]] It has most everything you're looking for and focuses on user of upload / enhanced extension. It gets recommended here a bit, if you've got audible the audiobook versions are fantastic.

I'll second the recommendation already made in the thread for [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]]

Semi-Rational:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1126719.House_of_Suns][House of Suns]] Not sure if this can be rational or not, the timescales and advanced tech make it all very fantasy like. Lightspeed is still the fastest thing, with time being the medium of travel where people are in stasis for thousands of years. AI tech and all of what you mentions is prevalent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity][Trancendent Humanity]] more [[/r/hfy]] than [[/r/rational]]. Still it's got everything you listed. Human's advanced down a different tech tree and benefit from it, along with not fearing the development of AI.

Not so Rational:

The Expanse, Altered Carbon, and Dark Matter TV series all come to mind, listed in order of most rational to least.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/28670924-otherlife-dreams][Otherlife Series]] Massive, massive, massive harem story. Very popcorn that hits on the upload / strong AI angels that eventually spirals into a very Marvel Cinematic Universe like of interconnected (harem) stories all taking place within a 'virtual' universe.
