Chronicles of Fid is a completed trilogy about the world's biggest supervillain, Dr. Fid. It was pretty enjoyable when I read it. Not /that/ rational, and some moments are a bit too ridiculous for the overall serious tone of the story.

One thing I liked is that the main character is pretty smart and actually comes off as an adult. He's able to introspect on his good and bad decisions and starts to actually change himself to better fit his aspirations.
