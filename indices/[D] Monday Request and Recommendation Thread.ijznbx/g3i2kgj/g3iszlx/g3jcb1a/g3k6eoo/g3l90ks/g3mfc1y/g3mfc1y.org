What he said. Everyone at the top found lucky breaks or reality warping items which helped them gain power. What Ryun got wasn't even /that/ powerful compared to what you'll see other people have. (Spoilers) There's a cultivator with an item that gave her the means to fulfill 3 wishes. There's a skill user that has a compass that points at what he desires. At high tiers of power, even physical death isn't always enough to really stop someone, you have to destroy their soul or kill them in other realities. It's a pretty xianxia world, with the requisite levels of power. One thing I really liked is that Ryun and Zach have the qualities for making it to the top of the Infinite Realm, but even with all their advantages they aren't gonna be /that/ special compared to other people at that level. Ivan Kal made a world where people at the top are smart, hardworking, /and/ lucky.
