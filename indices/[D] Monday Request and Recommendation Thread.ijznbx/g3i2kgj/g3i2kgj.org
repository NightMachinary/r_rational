I've been reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends][Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends]] for a while now, and I gotta say, it keeps getting better and better. It's one of the few xianxia I've enjoyed and would recommend. The premise is that there are system apocalypses, 10 years after which the top 10,000 survivors are taken to a higher realm: The Infinite Realm. The story follows the 2 remaining survivors of one of these apocalypses, how they got there, and what they'll do from now on. There is a lot of good worldbuilding, with the author showing how having a litrpg system affects society. The main characters have depth, and while they aren't always rational, they aren't dumb either. They go looking for knowledge and power, and try to exploit the system as much as it allows. At first, one of the characters is much more interesting than the other, but the most recent volume develops the less interesting character a lot, and now both characters are fun to read. The power system is also explored really well, with there being three main pathways to power which are somewhat exclusive and very distinct. Once a month or so, we get a side story from one of the top powers of the Infinite Realm, which both shows how these power pathways pan out over the long term, as well as show the long term story direction.

Another story I've been enjoying is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34670/the-featherlight-transmission][The Featherlight Transmission]]. It's sorta like a biopunk Dresden Files. The world is like the world of Dorohedoro, except the people in power are cyborgs instead of magic users. The main character is a biomancer (basically flesh druid) tasked to find the killer of a recent string of murders. His narration is for the most part really enjoyable, with some jokes making me laugh out loud. I sometimes find the fourth wall breaks a little tedious, but overall really enjoying it so far.
