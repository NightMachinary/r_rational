It would be better to know the characters beforehand, yes. Else their introductions and what they are about in the story might feel a bit abrupt, because the fanfic expects you to know the originals even if you don't know the fanfic adaptations.

That said, Overwatch only has limited amounts of story. At the time this fanfic was written all there was was backstory for each then released character, a bunch of cinematics and maybe a 10 page comic or two that didn't advance anything like a main story.
