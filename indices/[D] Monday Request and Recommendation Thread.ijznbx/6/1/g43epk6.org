If you're looking for completed works, this is not the right place :)

Joking aside, The Metropolitan Man, Friendship is Optimal, and The Waves Arisen are pretty well liked here. A Practical Guide to Evil is almost complete, I think? There's a lot of it currently out and it updates pretty frequently.

The Erogamer seems to be pretty much done from a recent author comment. I personally really liked [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover][The Demon Lord's Lover]], it's a sweet isekai love story that takes the premise of the usual isekai and executes it very well. It's not that rational though, but still very enjoyable and sweet.
