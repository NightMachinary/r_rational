This takes part after the first game, of which I had only the vague idea about having watched a Let's Play a few years ago. So I've no opinion on anything else in the series.

As for mindset, the appeal here for me was the handling of Deep Time in regards to mindset and personal axioms. People change over time yes, but also become more set in their ways. Dependent on the persons, a few hundred years of extra memories isn't something that's going to cause those to drift.

I'd also argue that utilitarian =/= rational. The utilitarian approach can ignore emotions, and personal desires. Saving the Bay is ethical, utilitarian, and perhaps even the right thing to do. That does not make it the rational choice for a character when saving the bay kills the person they are in love with.

Rational characters have their own agendas, agency, and desires. How they go about executing strategies to meet their own goals is the rational approach. It only so happens that most rational characters are also bound by ethics, its very close to utilitarianism in execution but not necessarily goal.
