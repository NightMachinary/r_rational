I've gotta repeat [[/u/whiterosepixel]] 's recommendation of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7950959/novalounge][One Way Trip / Near Light]] a Life Is Strange Fanfiction. Game Knowledge isn't required as most things can be picked up via context.

It's similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]]. In that Time travel branches loops, knowledge, and information is heavily abused to create an optimal outcome as difficult as it is when your save scumming point is bad.

Not to mention getting info from 60,000+ years in the future is cheating a bit, but at the same time it's not since it took quite a bit of effort to send it back.

Not to mention the characters have quite a good romance, and for as much as they go through none of the typical romantic subplot issues come up. They actually trust one another!
