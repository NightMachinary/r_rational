I heard a bit about Dungeon Keeper Ami, heard it's one of the best in the genre. Doesn't Dungeon Keeper Ami involve characters or such from Sailor Moon? At least that's what the first few paragraphs I read a while back suggested. Never watched or was interested in Sailor Moon, and thought my lack of knowledge would affect my enjoyment of Dungeon Keeper Ami.
