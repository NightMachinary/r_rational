I saw that mentioned (here, probably) a while ago, and started it, but didn't finish.

The one thing that bothered me a lot was what exactly was the tech level available to the protagonist? Did humanity have access to FTL or not? That's a pretty big deal in my book. I'm fine with it either way, but it should have been one or the other, instead of vague.

OK, so you've got an alien invasion, and they have FTL. Fine. If you have it, yes, maybe study theirs to see if it works different, is more efficient, or don't if it isn't useful. If you don't have it, then study of FTL is a big deal and must necessarily be a major plot point. However, in Post Human, there were times where it seemed the protagonist did have access to FTL, but that really wasn't clear. For the part that I read, the protag was acting as if she didn't have FTL tech. But didn't seem to be trying too hard to get it. Strange.
