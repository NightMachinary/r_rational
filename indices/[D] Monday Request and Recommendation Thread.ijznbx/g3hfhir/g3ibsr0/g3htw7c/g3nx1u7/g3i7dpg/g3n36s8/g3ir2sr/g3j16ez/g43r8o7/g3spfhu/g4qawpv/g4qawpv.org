Hamilton has a good excuse for removing superintelligence from the picture but keeping the less story-breaking transhuman technologies - the SI just quits human civilization using wormhole tech and expands with unlimited resources on its own somewhere off-screen, with only occasional interactions with the main plot. Also, there's some conceit that you just can't properly run a memorycell in a non-organic body because of quantum. Otherwise I agree.
