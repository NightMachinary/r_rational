[Request] I'm looking for "realistic" sci-fi works that try to portray what life might be like in the future if (strong) AI, life extension/rejuvenation (think SENS), Neuralink, mind uploading, nanomachines and similar developments all pan out successfully and interact with one another.

I'm not necessarily looking for the most gripping storyline, I'm more looking for a somewhat realistic setting to immerse myself in that fleshes out what life may be like if we manage to nudge this world in the direction of a realistic utopia. Reading about SENS life extension and taking it at face value really hammers home that we actually still live under absolutely horrid conditions and when "people" in 200 years will look back on us then I'm quite sure our lives will look like the middle ages look to us now. I need some help imagining what living in that future would actually feel like. Suggestions? :)
