Heir of the Bruce is a long running quest (+5 years!) that updates regularly. I can strongly recommend it as something to archive binge. The QMs focus on the psychology of the characters, instead of their planetary economies, makes for a good read. Some of the usual quest issues pop up, such as implausible levels of luck, but it's handled skillfully enough that I'd say it holds up on its own.

Here is the link to the first thread. A word of warning, in the second and third thread the QM puts commissions of outside perspectives under the Sidestory threadmark, there's about a quarter of the story posted that way, and on my first read through I missed it.
