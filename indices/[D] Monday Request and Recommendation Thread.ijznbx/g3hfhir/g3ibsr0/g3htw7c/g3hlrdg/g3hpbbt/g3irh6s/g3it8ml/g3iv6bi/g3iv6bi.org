I recommend Hugo Huesca's Dungeon Lord series. The MC isn't a dungeon core, his powerset is basically Sauron if Sauron started as a level 1 Dark Lord and also summoned dungeon building imps

It's take on dungeons is OG Dungeon Keeper, with workshops and laboratories that actually function and no respawning minions but paid employees. Also the antagonists aren't adventures farming the dungeon, they want the MC dead and he's willing to go to war in return.

Bunkercore is also good. It's a sci-fi dungeon core that also avoids the whole adventures farming concept in favour of self defence against lethal threats
