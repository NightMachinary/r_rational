I do somewhat agree, they can sometimes feel bland and unexciting. Reading Forged Destiny in particular got progressively harder for me till I just stopped reading it. Not because it was actively bad, but because I wasn't really invested anymore.

I'm personally a fan of the stories when Coeur makes an AU based on RWBY, such as The Unseen Hunt or Arcanum, specially the first one. I also enjoyed Not This Time Fate, but it was the first of his stories that I read, so I might be biased.
