Dante and Blays from The Cycle of Arawn and The Cycle of Galand are really enjoyable to read. Not really a rational story, but fun and enjoyable. Their banter is excellent, and the moments where they get tricked by trying to be too smart are enjoyable too. It's about a kid who discovers necromancer powers, and uses that to go up in society.

Lies of Locke Lamora has Locke and Jean. Fourth book is coming out late next year. Great banter and dialogue, but the story beats felt sort of dubious. It's a fantasy heist series.

Zombie Knight Saga has Garovel and Hector, and pretty much all the other reaper/servant pairs. Although they aren't really a dynamic duo I guess. Really good story and one of my favorites. Really funny at times, with a great magic system and intricate worldbuilding.
