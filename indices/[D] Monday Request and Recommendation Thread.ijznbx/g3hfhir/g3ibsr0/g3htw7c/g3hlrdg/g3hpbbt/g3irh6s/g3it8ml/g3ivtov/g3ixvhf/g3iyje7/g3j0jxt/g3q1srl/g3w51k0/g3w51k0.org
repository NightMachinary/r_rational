I read through all of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] over the last few days, and it's kinda similar. It's about a guy getting isekai'd into a dungeon core, where he decides to be a friendly one (as opposed to an instrument of terror). It is unexpectedly rational, in that both enemies and allies try to make smart decisions and optimize. The worldbuilding and magic system are well done, and are pretty deep. The dungeon and his companions gain power pretty fast, but the enemies they are facing are really powerful, so it never feels like he's getting overpowered.

My only gripe about it is the harem and explicit scenes. Some of the development feels a little off, and compared to the competence of the rest of the novel the explicit scenes feel a little added on. You can of course skim through them, and explicit chapters are labeled well. Overall it's surprisingly good!
