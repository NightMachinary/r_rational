I believe that his earlier "Super Powereds" series was set in the same universe. It's about a group of students attending an extremely competitive school for future superheroes. It was... decent. The best parts were the actual school and training. There was a degree of munchkinry just because students had to push themselves hard to improve and use their powers as well as they could since each year they were competing for an ever more limited number of slots.

There is an overarching plotline, but I found it passable at best. The characters were decent, but nothing amazing.

From a rational perspective, I'm not convinced that the school system makes sense as described, but the moment to moment actions are mostly intelligent ish and thought out from what I can remember.

It used to be a web serial, but has been taken down (temporarily?) for an Amazon release.
