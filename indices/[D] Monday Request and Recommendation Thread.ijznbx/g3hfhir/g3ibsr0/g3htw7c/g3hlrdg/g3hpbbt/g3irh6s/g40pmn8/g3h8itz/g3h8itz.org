I recently finished a complete reread of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/][The Games we Play]], a complete rwby/gamer fanfic. It remains one of the most enjoyable works I've ever read, and it reminds me of my love for [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard][Magnificent Bastard]] protagonists. Do you know of any other web serial/fanfic in that vein?

Alternatively, recommend me your favorite finished works. This thread tends to gather ongoing works, because this is what people currently have in mind, but I think I've read or tried reading most of those by now.

I've read everything in the wiki already.
