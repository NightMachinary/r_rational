That made sense to me, though. It was a big gamble from a terrible starting point that paid off and happened right at the start. It wasn't some incredible long-odds bet wither, it was literally a coinflip of "profit well or die."

It's not something that gets repeated, if that's what you're worried about. After all, the characters have much more to lose afterwards.
