Anybody know any good dungeon management/dungeon core novels/web novels? Of the few I came across, it seems to be an interesting concept, however they all turn out incredibly boring and all do the same thing. They always have the MC being smug and feeling all smart about being the only entity to ever make a pacifistic dungeon or put a town/inn in it, and always get way too emotional and make baffling choices. It's such an interesting concept as well, with freedom of creation that's limited only by imagination. There's a lot of opportunities to munckin the shit out of things, and the most interesting abuse of mechanics I've seen came from Lazy Dungeon Master, which fell flat in every other aspect besides clever ploys.

Would like to see if there are even any good novels for this type. Will accept anything except fanfiction, I never liked fanfiction, especially when I don't even know the source.
