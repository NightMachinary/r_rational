Ehh, but it is realistic. You don't make it to the top without being extremely lucky along with capitalizing on it through skill/intelligence/hard work.

I can often rationalize a good part of luck in such stories as the fact that we're following someone who made it to the top - i.e. an anthropomorphic principle for stories.
