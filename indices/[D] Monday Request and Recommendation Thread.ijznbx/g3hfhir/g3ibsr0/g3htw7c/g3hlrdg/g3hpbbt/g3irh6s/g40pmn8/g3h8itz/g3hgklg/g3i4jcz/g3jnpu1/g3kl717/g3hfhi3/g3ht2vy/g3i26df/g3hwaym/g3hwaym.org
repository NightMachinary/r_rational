Yeah I agree. His comedic stories are much better. That said I do think Not This Time Fate is his best work though. (And I haven't enjoyed A Rabbit Among Wolves. Trying to turn the White Fang comedic is just too dissonant and ruins the comedy for me when hes also trying occasionally juggle in just the most flaccid takes on racism.) That said I did enjoy Professor Arc, White Sheep, Beacon Civil War, and Service With a Smile.
