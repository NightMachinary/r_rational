Anyone have any recommendations for superhero stories? I'm looking for anything with the public "heroes vs villains" setting. They usually aren't super rational, but I've been enjoying them a lot recently.

I've already read a few of the big ones, such as Worm, Super Minion, and the Steelheart book series by Sanderson. Id prefer stories on the longer side or at least completed, but really anything as long as it's good. Additionally fanfics are fine, I've looked at some of the well-regarded Wormfics such as Cenotaph, A Cloudy Path, A Bad Name, and Brocktons Celestial Forge.
