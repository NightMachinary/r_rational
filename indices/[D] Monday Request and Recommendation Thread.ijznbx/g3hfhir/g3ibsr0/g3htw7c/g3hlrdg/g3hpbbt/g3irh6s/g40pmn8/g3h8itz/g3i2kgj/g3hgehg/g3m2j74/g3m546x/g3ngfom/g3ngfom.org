  Interesting! So the story takes place in the setting of the first game? Does Max behave as you would expect from a 300-year-old lich, struggling to connect with even the elderly of the early 21st century, much less kindle a romance with someone 5% her age? Or does she effectively have the mind and voice of a teenage girl?

The Man From Earth from last week's recommendation thread actually does a pretty great job of refuting the idea that an extremely old immortal would be all that different from the average person.
