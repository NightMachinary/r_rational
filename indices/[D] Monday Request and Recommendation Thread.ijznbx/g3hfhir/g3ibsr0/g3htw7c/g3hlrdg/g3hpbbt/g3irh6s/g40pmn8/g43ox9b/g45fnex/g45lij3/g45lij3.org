#+end_quote

The only matching Overwatch fic that I can find is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11918310/1/For-What-It-Could-Be][For What It Could Be]]. The title of the first chapter is "Prologue - The World As It Appears To Be". Is it the one?

Edit: Never mind, it's by Benedict_SC and it's available on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149][AO3]].
