I got halfway through the first thread when I realized that I didn't like that the story felt plodding. Like, I believe that a story is supposed to be the most interesting parts of a person's life shown on screen, where as this just seemed like a more dramatized diary. With the story's construction it feels like finding a Lostech factory and meeting a new friend on the beach are given equal pacing and importance even though one is significantly more important than the other. I know that this is consistent with quests as part of their 'genre', but it's something that consistently turns me off as well.

Does this change during the course of the story? Or is it the case that if I didn't like the first half of thread 1 I probably won't see a difference in thread 2 & 3?
