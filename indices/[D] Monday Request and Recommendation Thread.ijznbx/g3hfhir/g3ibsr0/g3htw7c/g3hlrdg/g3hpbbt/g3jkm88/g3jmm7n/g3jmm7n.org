The pacing does get better, with fewer seemingly irrelevant events getting screen time. IIRC, halfway through thread two the QM starts offering the option to skip over more boring parts of the quest like travel, and I think the third and fourth years of college take up less screen time than year two. However, Alyssa, as both the heir of a large corporation, as well as one of the survivors of said corporations genetic experiments, is a fairly important/useful person for Rhiannon to know.

The pacing doesn't massively pick up, though. The current arc of the quest is Rhiannon's first combat deployment, to give an idea of the sum total progress made.
