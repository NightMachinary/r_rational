I've been looking for more sci-fi, and came across [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]] by J P Koenig (completed).

The story follows a human-turned-AI, Nikola v1.01, as it is tasked with building a new home for humanity following the destruction of Earth. Nikola spends her time on an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1036_Ganymed][1035 Ganymed]], a near-Earth asteroid, working at expanding it and preparing it as Humanity's next home. At 24 chapters, the story is relatively short, more of a novella than a novel, and can be binged in a few hours.

I found it to be a very enjoyable read, with an interesting plot and good world-building. There were parts of it that were a bit dense when describing technology, but they were short and helped develop the story. There isn't much character development, given that the main character is an AI and how short the story is, though the AI Nikola does improve itself as the story progresses.
