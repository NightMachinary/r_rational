1. They're aliens, the value of materials is relative, and so is time. To them it is a good investment of their time, to others it might not be.

2. The Mobius strip allows for FTL travel. FTL engines don't exist, that doesn't mean they can't take advantage of an anomaly that allows for FTL travel. Getting there would have taken hundreds of years, getting back to Earth doesn't. They mention that it takes 6 months for the alien spaceship to travel from the asteroid belt to the anomaly, using normal engines.

3. The Voyager mission would have used an ion engine, which pick up speed over time. They mention using them for other spaceships. In chapter 22, they specifically say “Gerry is now officially *the fastest man-made object ever to cross the solar system. He's at 0.2c*, and will be rocketing past Earth in another six hours or so.” The Voyager missions are also allowed to take time since they're (technically) unmanned here.

Most of your problem seems to be that you skimmed over chapter 16, because the explanation is there

  “I find it unlikely,” said Zia. “If the geometry is correct, than this Mobius strip is forming a band hundreds of light-years in length. Even if they could somehow enter it, and survive it, the journey would take longer than going the ‘long' way.”

  I went back to the gravimetric readings of the milliseconds leading up to the ship vanishing. In particular, I examined what the ship had done with its gravity fields just as it approached. It had a giant bubble gravity field, just like the alien craft I had disassembled had used, far larger than the craft needed. Now I had an inkling as to why it had been so large.

  “They didn't take the long way,” I said. “They bounced off of it, a ricochet that picked up velocity that shouldn't even be possible.”

  “What are you talking about?” demanded Zia.

  “Their gravity bubble, the outer one that we thought was too large. It was exactly opposite the readings of the anomaly. They bounced off of it, and got flung away at a faster-than-light speed.”

  “That would take infinite energy to propel infinite mass,” argued Zia. “That's not possible. Unless... Alcubierre was a lot closer than we thought.”

  We argued the math back and forth for a little while, before we came to an hypothetical understanding. Somehow, they'd picked up a Jupiter-sized amount of energy off of the anomaly, getting flung wildly across space. The amount of energy involved meant that space and time was compressing in front of them in a negative mass, counterbalancing their own increased mass, while space and time expanded behind them to shove them along. This could only end in one of two ways. They would careen into an object at supralight speeds, causing a truly epic explosion, of the sort that could destroy solar systems, or they would get caught by the other end of the Mobius strip. At that end, they would catch the other side of the strip, and it would absorb that acceleration, slowing them down and letting them bounce off gently.
