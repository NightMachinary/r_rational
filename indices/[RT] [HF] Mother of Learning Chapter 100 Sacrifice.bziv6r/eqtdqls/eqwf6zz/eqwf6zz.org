What the others said. And considering the Sovereign Gate is some kind of "attachment" that could work its magic with any primordial, there's no need for it to continue to keep a connection to Panaxeth after the loops were done, since there's a possibility it'll have been moved closer to a different primordial by the time (and if) it activates again.
