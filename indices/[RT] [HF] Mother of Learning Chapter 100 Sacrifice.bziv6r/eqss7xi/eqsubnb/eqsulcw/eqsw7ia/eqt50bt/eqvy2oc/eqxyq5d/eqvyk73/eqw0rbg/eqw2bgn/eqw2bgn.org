  One was that the release of the primordial was tied to the activation of the divine safeguards on its prison. If the safeguards activated before the month was done, regardless of the reason why, Zach was considered to have failed in his mission. Zach's perception did not matter here -- the contract could detect the activation of the safeguards innately, and was apparently tied to them on some intangible level....

   the good news was that the enforcement of that particular clause of the contract depended entirely on Zach's own perception, just like Zorian suspected. Zach was the one who determined whether a violation of the contract had occurred or not. If someone knew about the time loop but Zach never found out about it, the contract would never know either. It pulled information straight from Zach's senses, thoughts, and memories

it says 'that particular clause' refering to people knowing about the time loop. so if zach didn't know ppl knew, then it won't activate. but the panaxeth part is based in the safe guards triggering, zach's perception be damned
