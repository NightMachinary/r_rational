nah, i think the plan involves trapping zach in an illusion where the aranea, zorian, alanic, and xvim die. probably a wraith bomb going off or panaxeth being released (they made sure to mention that people are based on zach's perception, but the contingencies being triggered are /not/. so zach thinking panaxeth was released and killed everyone would work)

zorian specifically worked on getting around mind blank, and zach doesn't know about that. zorian was also practicing making an illusion of cyoria with the aranea a few chs ago....
