  I worried this Staff might be in RRJornak possession.

Dubious. There's no teleport transit between Altazia and Blantyrre. Silverlake would tell RRJornak even Zach/Zorian require an airship to cross the distance initially, relying on Bakora gate afterward. We can safely assume the scepter is still in Violet Eye's possession.

But hey, let's entertain the idea, what's use of 12 charge of teleport staff for battle that happen in a single city? Sure, it'll immensely help the Church contain the wraith bombs, especially if priests capable in containing them is rare among their rank. But what use of it for Zach/Zorian? /Gasp/, we unintentionally found a topic for Saturday Munchkinry Thread!
