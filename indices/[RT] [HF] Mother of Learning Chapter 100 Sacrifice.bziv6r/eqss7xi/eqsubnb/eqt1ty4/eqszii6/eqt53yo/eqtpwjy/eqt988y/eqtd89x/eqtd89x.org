Unfortunately not possible. Even disregarding all of the defences that he would surely have (because if you can get close enough to touch him, there are lots of simpler ways to kill him, so he's bound to have ways to stop that from happening), the staff only works to take you to markers that you've previously set. You would have to travel out to the middle of the ocean manually first, and if that's practical, then it would also be practical for Jornak to travel back.
