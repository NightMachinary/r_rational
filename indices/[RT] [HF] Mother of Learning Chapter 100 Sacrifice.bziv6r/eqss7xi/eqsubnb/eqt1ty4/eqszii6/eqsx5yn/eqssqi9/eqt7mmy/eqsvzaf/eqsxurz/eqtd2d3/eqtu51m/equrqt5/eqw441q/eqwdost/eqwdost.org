If I can butt into the conversation, I don't think a simulacrum ever asked Raynie out. Zorian's interactions with her ended before he learned the simulacrum spell. I think you're confusing the event with when a simulacrum invited Akoja out.

You bring up some good points though, with how Rea was mentioned to have superior hearing before she probably is at a level where she should be able to hear a simulacrum's lack of heartbeat. That said, I can think of two arguments against her noticing it (at this point in time). One is that she only encountered the simulacrum Zorian this chapter, when she was a little freaked out about how highly Zorian was connected, so she might just not have noticed it yet. Two, if she ever worked as some kind of agent against mages, as some cat shifters probably would, it's not unreasonable to think she encountered mages behind silencing wards before, which would prevent any sound from leaking out from their area, and she could simply be assuming simulacrum-Zorian was using something similar for some reason.

I don't think simulacra are controlled purely by magic though, in the way you're describing, to the level of having to puppeteer its body. Both ectoplasmic and golem simulacra has its castor's mind copy attached (as well as being able to share the castor's soul), so whatever body movement tics original-Zorian had should still be reflected in his simulacrum, except maybe for chest movement from breathing. And I would be surprised if the ectoplasmic shell failed to replicate approximately the muscles just under the skin, since the skin is one thing that's duplicated in its entirety, in contrast to the copy's innards.
