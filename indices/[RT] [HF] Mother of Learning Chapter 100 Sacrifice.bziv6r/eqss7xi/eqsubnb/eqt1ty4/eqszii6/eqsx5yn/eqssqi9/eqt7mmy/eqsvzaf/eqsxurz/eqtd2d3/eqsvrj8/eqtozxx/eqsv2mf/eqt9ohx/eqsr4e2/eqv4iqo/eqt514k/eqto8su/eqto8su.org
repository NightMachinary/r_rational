Why do they think there are more bombs in Cyoria? I understand more than one like Zorian said, but the plan is to destroy the town via invasion and Primordial, and the wraiths should only trigger upon Jornak's death (Or tampering, but I find that unlikely to happen during the invasion), and they should take alot of time to make, so shouldn't they just plant the bombs meant for Cyoria in the Capital? The fact that there's one they've found one in the city does prove there is a reason for them to be there, but I feel like it's a waste of resources when you not only plan to win, but also have 2 ways to devastate the city. Plus Wraiths take time to make more Wraiths, so seems like they would be less help than the mercenaries they hired.
