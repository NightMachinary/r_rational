I think it's rather brilliant to use Rea's smelling sense to deduce Zorian's involvement. Keeping cat as pet myself, I think cats are awful sniffer. But repeated exposure from unexpected source will indeed strengthen the suspicion. Bravo. Anyway, including mine, I counted at least three comment questioning how Rea's able to ambush Zorian last chapter. Did the discussion help you refine the logic behind today's chapter, author? Rea knowledge of Zorian's absence from class is what solidify the plot, because smell is rather feeble in its lonesome.

-- Onto the praise for the chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “Look, what do you even expect of me?” Zorian asked Rea, frowning at her slightly. “I don't know where any kidnapped children are being kept. Do you think I would just sit on that information if I knew?”
#+end_quote

For Rea, this basically confirmed Zorian's rather high position in the conspiracy. Zorian's at least the chief among the group's scouts. Brilliant subtlety! We can expect Zorian will have some measure of fame among the cat shifters.

#+begin_quote
  “Success,” simulacrum number one mumbled.
#+end_quote

It's rather dubious for Haslush to catch on previous quote. He's not portrayed as sharp as Rea after all. But this quote, if Haslush heard it, he will start to think Zorian is a great diviner. He might even think Zorian is Mr Kesir's apprentice! How could Haslush not when Zorian can tell the spell is successful when he is virtually separated from the ritual. We can expect, at least, Haslush consulting Zorian in solving cases in the future, if not zealously trying to recruit him to the force. Cool stuff!

-- Criticism

None really. Typo is rather worse than usual, and double delay is painful. But the end product is as excellent as always.

-- Personal note

Aw, Zorian failed at playing down his involvement. While it will net him positive reputation from Rea and Haslush, the ship for Raynie could be threatened. Romance rarely blossom from asymmetric relationship. In today's chapter, Zorian could be seen as savior for Raynie's woe. If I'm Raynie, I would see Zorian with great measure of gratitude and respect. But for romance? She might be reluctant for it. More reluctant than when both of them are virtual stranger.
