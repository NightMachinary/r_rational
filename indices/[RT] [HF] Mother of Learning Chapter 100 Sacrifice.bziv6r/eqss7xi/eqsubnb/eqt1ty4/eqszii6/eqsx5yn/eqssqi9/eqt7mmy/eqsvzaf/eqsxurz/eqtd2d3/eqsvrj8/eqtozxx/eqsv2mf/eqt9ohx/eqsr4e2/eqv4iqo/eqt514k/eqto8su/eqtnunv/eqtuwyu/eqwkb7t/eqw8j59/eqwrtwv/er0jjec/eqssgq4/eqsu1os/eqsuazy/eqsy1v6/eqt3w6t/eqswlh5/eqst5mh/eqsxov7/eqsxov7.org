Shaping is tedious and difficult, and shows results slowly, so it makes sense that a lot of people don't bother with it--I'd compare it to math or science in real life.

What hasn't made sense to me is that the noble families, who have tons of money and desire for strong/useful heirs, don't force their kids to practice shaping before they send them to college.

A few years of practice would give them a huge edge. Xvim sort of explains that shaping is viewed as mostly useless, but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, given that any advanced mage should know you need shaping skills for more complex magic (and it lets you stretch your mana reserves, effectively increasing your mana pool.)

The government should have a similar incentive to have this done (especially as most of them are probably expecting a war.), but instead they just have four years of schooling, starting at 14 or so.

Maybe magic isn't usable until you're older? Zorian did mention that Kirielle likely couldn't do much, when she asked him to teach her, but I ascribed that to him basically blowing her off, as he thought she would get to learn in a few years.

If that's the case, then the current situation makes a lot of sense. Shaping takes a lot of effort and time which you aren't spending learning theory and spells, which are more immediately useful.
