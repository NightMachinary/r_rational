Yeah, new Silverlake is old Silverlake's worst enemy. Knows all her secrets, knows all her treasures and desires them, and is too greedy and heartless not to eventually make a move on them. Also she is a super expert on primordials, which probably, but not definitely, means she really doesn't want it breaking out.

I don't think she'll join them, but spy on the funnel battle to see if there is a chance to Insta-kill her twin? Sure.
