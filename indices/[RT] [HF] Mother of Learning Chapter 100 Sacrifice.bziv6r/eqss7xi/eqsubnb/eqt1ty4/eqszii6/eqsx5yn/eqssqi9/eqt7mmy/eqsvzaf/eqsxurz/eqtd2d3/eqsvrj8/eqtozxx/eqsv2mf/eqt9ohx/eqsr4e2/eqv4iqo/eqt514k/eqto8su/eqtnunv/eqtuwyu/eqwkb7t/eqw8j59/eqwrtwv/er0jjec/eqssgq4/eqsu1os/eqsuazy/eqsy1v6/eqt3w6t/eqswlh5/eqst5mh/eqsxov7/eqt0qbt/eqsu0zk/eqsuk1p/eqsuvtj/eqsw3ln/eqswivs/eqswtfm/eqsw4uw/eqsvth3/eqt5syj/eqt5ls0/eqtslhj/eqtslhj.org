  it's extremely difficult to get your hands on the really effective ones because mages horde everything and you need to sign a lifetime contract to get access to a handful. Zorian signed all of them and so got all the fast tracked more useful ones and practiced them literally faster than everyone else because he could do it with 3 hims at once 3 years ago, and there have been more hims since.

Consider chapter 27, where Zorian went wandering around the countryside: "He did not stop his magical training, but in the absence of any sort of clear goal or a convenient repository of spells like the academy library had been, he defaulted to the most basic of advancement methods -- shaping exercises. It helped that most of the rural mages he met on his journey had some private shaping exercise they were willing to show him... and unlike Xvim, who simply told him the end result he wanted and refused to elaborate, they actually had detailed instructions about what to do and in what order."

How many mages would have the motivation and capability to do that? Would academy students from well-to-do backgrounds want to become footsore and weary in a low-magic environment, traipsing all over the countryside doing odd jobs? Would those with useful talents choose to walk away from the libraries and tutors that would help them to refine those talents, not to mention ignoring the many potential employers? Would concerned parents be happy for their children to go out and risk being eaten by giant salamanders and winter wolves? If everyone tried it, would all those rural mages be so open and willing to share?

And that's just one of dozens of examples of how Zorian's experience was atypical.
