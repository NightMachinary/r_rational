Maybe Haslush knows more than Zorian does about which governments are likely to use blood magic, and assumes that they're Zorian's masters? I'm not sure whether Ulquaan Ibasa does, or whether it's just mind and soul magic.

Or else he just thinks that whoever is behind this, they'll eventually ask a high price of Zorian in exchange for their help. Which is kind of funny when Zorian did it all himself.
