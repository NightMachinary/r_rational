I'm not really that well versed in scent-based abilities of cats to know an answer to that. My opinion is that she would notice the simulacrum is very weird but that she would still assume it was Zorian because he behaves and talks like him, and does have his scent on it. As for the foreign smells (metallic or otherwise), that would arouse her curiosity but wouldn't tell her enough to guess what was /really/ going on.

But that's just my opinion. As I said, I actually knows very little about cat's sense of smell, other than it being a lot keener than that of a human.
