There was a passage where it said - and I might be misremembering - that Zach had a compulsion to hunt down those who knew the details of his contract with angels. But that compulsion ceased after a while. And if I'm not wrong, quite a few people like Alanic are also at least aware that there is a contract in place. So those people need to die or at least appear to die. There is also a similar rule regarding knowledge about the time loop.

I think Zach might not believe what he sees and might investigate afterwards as to what really happened including asking questions to other people and their answers might convince him further. Like Taiven crying about it and Hashlush bringing a letter to Zach (or sth similar) as per the will of Zorian. So I believe a mass illusion including multiple people might sell the lie better.

And I think people will actually die because they are about to engage in the final battle and it would be unbelievable if no body important really died...
