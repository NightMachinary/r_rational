  If shaping skills are is the best chance to success then what you said makes no sense. If shaping skills allow you to easily be a multi mage (I consider 8 years of work easy), then everyone, in a rational system, who wants to improve their magic will be doing them.

Everyone wants to not be poor. Not everyone works hard in school. This is not confusing.

  They are incredibly useful, but for some reason noone else is doing them. AKA not a rational world.

Or everyone /does/ use them, in smaller amounts because they're mind numbingly boring and it's extremely difficult to get your hands on the really effective ones because mages horde everything and you need to sign a lifetime contract to get access to a handful. Zorian signed all of them and so got all the fast tracked more useful ones and practiced them literally faster than everyone else because he could do it with 3 hims at once 3 years ago, and there have been more hims since.

  Honestly, you guys are all acting like Zorian is some genius, like daimon. Have any of you read the early chapters? Everyone he met remarked that he wasn't a genius. Everyone.

He's a hard worker in a very specific scenario where hard work and abusing your abilities is all it takes to succeed, and it's literally designed to do that.
