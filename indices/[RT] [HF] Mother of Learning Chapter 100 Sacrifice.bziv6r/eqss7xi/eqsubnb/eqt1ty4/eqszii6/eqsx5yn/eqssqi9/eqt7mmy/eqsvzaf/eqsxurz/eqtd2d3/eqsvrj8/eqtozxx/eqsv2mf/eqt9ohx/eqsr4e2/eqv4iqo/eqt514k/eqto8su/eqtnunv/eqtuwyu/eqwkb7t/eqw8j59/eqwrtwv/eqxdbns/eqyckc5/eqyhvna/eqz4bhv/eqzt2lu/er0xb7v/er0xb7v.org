  it'd be too easy and probable that there's at least a body rig as well (if not just that)

If the contract was only in their body it would be easy for them to survive by becoming a lich.

  "Don't think for a second that Zach doesn't know about this, either," Silverlake said. "As someone who is laboring under this sort of contract, I can tell you right now that deals with primordials are not that easy to get out of. I already tried to erase my memories to void the contract, and it didn't work. *The pact is branded directly into my soul*, and I am constantly aware of its terms. I can forget the details of how I got it, but not the core contents of it.

Chapter 90 was before they leave the time loop all it have was Zorian's conclusions/suppositions after they meet the primordial.

  "So if I understood you three correctly, the contract is as follows..." Zorian said. "You make a death pact with Panaxeth, swearing that you would either free him within a month or die trying. He then takes your soul and 'incarnates' it in the outside world. That is to say, he creates a brand new copy of your body in the real world, at the start of the month, in effect physically ejecting you out of the time loop. Included in the created body is some kind of kill switch that will kill you if Panaxeth is still imprisoned at the end of the summer festival."
