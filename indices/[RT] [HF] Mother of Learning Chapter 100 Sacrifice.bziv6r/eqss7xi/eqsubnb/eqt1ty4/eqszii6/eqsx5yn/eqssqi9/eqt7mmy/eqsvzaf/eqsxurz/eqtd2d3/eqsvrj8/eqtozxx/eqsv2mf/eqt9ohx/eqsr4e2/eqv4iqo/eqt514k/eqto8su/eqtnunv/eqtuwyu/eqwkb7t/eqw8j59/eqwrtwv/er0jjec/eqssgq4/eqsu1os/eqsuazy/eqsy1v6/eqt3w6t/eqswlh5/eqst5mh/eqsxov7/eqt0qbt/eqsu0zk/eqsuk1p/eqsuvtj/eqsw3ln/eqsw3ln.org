I see them more as a foundation or springboard for the kind of growth rate you can achieve if everything lines up perfectly in your favour (for instance, if you have nigh-infinite resources, few societal obligations, the ability to hunt for forbidden knowledge with no fear of dying, talented mentors, inherent natural talents, etc.)

What made Zorian so strong wasn't getting 8 years to train. It was getting 8 years where he could grow at speeds so reckless the only possible way they could be sustained is if you had a ridiculous cheat code for infinite money and no consequences.

And even then, there's only so far he can go if his fundamentals are weak, and that's where shaping comes in. If Zorian had great shaping skills and none of the tutors, resources, or freedom from consequences he got in the time loop, he'd get really good at the few beginner things he safely learned, and then go learn a professional skill at normal, safe rates. It's not really a strong payoff unless you're already growing ridiculously fast for other reasons.

So, yeah, Zorian isn't this powerful /because/ of shaping, but he wouldn't be this powerful without it, if that makes sense.
