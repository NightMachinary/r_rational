Think of it like maths. Basic math is necessary and everyone does a bit in school. But most jobs don't require that much of it after all so you let go of it to explore your field of interest. You'll study trade or architecture. But if you become a math beast, at the end you'll realize a lot of doors open because having that math background easily gets you to the complicated part of each fields. Don't know business? doesn't matter, you know math, go become a business analyst or a trader. Don't know architecture? doesn't matter, you know math, go become an engineer. Input from experienced masters is still valuable and Zorian gets it but he has the tools to go in depth once he understand the gist of it.

So why is everyone not doing a PhD in Maths? Well a lot of people aren't really interested in it and prefer other fields. Same in the story. The way magic evolved also contributes to how underrated a skill it is. Before it was necessary but as mages started organizing themselves it became less needed which is the current situation
