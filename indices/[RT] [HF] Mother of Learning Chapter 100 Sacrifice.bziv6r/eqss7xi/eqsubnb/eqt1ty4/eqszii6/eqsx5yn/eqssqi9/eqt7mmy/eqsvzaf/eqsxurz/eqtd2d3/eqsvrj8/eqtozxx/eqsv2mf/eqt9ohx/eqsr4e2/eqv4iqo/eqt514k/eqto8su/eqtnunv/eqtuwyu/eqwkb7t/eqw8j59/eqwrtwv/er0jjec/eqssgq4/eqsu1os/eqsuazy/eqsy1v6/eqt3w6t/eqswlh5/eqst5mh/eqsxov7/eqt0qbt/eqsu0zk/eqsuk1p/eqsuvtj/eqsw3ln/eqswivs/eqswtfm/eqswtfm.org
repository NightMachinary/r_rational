Shaping exercises are only a part of his bullshit - it was also the ability to throw himself into dangerous or even suicidal situations and experiments to improve his skill, and essentially infinite resources due to all of it being reset after being spent, and the ability to cultivate one-of-a-kind teachers through repeating loops until he can convince them to teach him.

Shaping exercises are good and powerful, but they're both exponentially more difficult and they're only genuinely, honest to god useful at like a PHD level - before then, they're a party trick, and most people don't need to spend the time ignoring other things they could be learning in favor of practicing shaping. Normal magic is getting a normal college degree, while full on shaping and multimagery is like a PHD that takes 3-4x longer and you might not even have the talent to do it in the first place.
