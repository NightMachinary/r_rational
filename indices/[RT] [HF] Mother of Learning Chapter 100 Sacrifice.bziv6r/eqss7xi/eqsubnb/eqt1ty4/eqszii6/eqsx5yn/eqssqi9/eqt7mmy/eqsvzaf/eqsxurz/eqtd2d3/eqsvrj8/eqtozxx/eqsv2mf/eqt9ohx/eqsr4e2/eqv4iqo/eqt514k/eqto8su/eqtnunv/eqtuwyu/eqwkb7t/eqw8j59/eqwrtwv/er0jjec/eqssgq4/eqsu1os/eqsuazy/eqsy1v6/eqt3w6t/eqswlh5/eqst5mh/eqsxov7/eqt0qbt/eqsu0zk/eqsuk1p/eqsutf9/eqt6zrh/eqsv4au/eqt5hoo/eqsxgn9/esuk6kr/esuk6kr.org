Bit of a necro post, but still the current chapter.

​

*Shaping*:

I did not see anyone mention this, but shaping also consumes mana. Mana is not unlimited and the main reason the magic academy is at that location is because they have near infinite ambient mana due to the mana well.

  Being a mage out there in the periphery was a lot different than being a mage in Cyoria, Zorian mused. Without the massive quantities of ambient mana gushing out of the Hole, conserving mana was actually a noticeable issue -- even shaping exercises tended to deplete his reserves after a couple of hours, whereas back in Cyoria his main limitation had been his patience and existing obligations eating into his free time. That was another reason why Zorian focused on shaping exercises in preference to any actual spellcasting while traveling.

​

So shaping 24/7 is not possible outside of certain areas. Areas in which the cost of living will be higher, prohibiting certain people from doing it. How many people have the funding available to dedicate themselves to such tasks? This means Zorian is in an optimal place to spend the time loop, one in which his expenses are covered (at least his living expenses).

There is also a limit to how much mana you can absorb at once, so even the mana wells likely have limitations on how long you can do shaping. There is also the question of whether it is truly healthy to shape so long. Pushing your mana resolves too far can utterly wreck your shaping skills due to your mana reserve growth.

While shaping exercises are much less mana intensive I wonder what would happen if you strained your mana reserves for so long without being able to magically reset yourself every month.

And that is assuming someone is actually dedicated to their magic.

*Why Mages & the Academy Sucks*

The thing to remember about this world is that it exists under feudalism. Royalty, nobility, the church, shifters, and other factions are constantly jockeying for power. While the King is nominally at the top, that does not mean he is all powerful. He has to gather support and play the different factions against each other.

This is partly why the House system was so effective. Houses get privileges which allowed the Ikosians to gather outsiders into their system. The Houses also teach their own, passing down decades or centuries of experience and tutelage, something many mages are reluctant to give outsiders. Houses are also easier to manage. A dozen or hundred mages have as many goals and needs, a House with them collected will be united and self managing. Easier to manage a dozen houses than thousands of mages. So you end up with a self perpetuating system that creates elite mages AND has convenient centralized goals and leaders. So much easier for a King to manage. You don't even need all the Houses to back you, just enough. They will also help manage each other, preventing them from turning on you.

​

/Then/ /+The Fire Nation Attacked+/ /The Splinter Wars & The Weeping Happened./

The flower of mages was cut down. Much knowledge was likely lost, and the systems that upheld order were broken. It is not a coincidence that so much technology is developing, the existing order is broken and new things are emerging.

Eldemar needs to not only consider how best to counter the other nations, but how to continue maintaining unity and control over itself.

The Mage School was the solution. Mages are force multipliers, and with the Houses broken more power was needed. Standards were lowered, and the process of creating tons of weak mages was started. Raising many weak mages is better than nothing. It is also a good return on investment.

It also serves the purpose of countering the Houses. Many Houses fell, and the power that was once distributed widely is likely far more concentrated now. Having a bunch of weak mages that owe their livelihood to the crown is a good way to counter the now consolidated Houses. These mages are a good short term solution in that they owe much to the Royalty, but are a nightmare for the future. tangent ->>! (Part of what makes them easier to manage now is that they suck, are an existential threat to the Houses and therefore seek sponsorship from the King, and are disunited and lacking resources. But what if they weren't? The Magic Guild is already exerting power (as we see them effecting the legal system). Look at the Cult. They are a mutual cooperative society. If they were out in the open and composed of a larger amount of the mages in the country they would be super powerful. This was a good short term solution but will have far reaching effects on the existing order. There may not be a Royal family in the future, it could just be a mageocracy.)!<

But why weak mages? Partly because of cost, partly because the system is so fucked. Even if the School really pushed shaping, how many kids would actually listen?

Standards had to be dropped anyways, and the number of student makes direct tutelage costly.

The natural counter to a weak curriculum is the Mentor system, but that also has problems. With so many expert mages dead, the remaining can demand much higher pay and benefits. They also have a status raise, due to the lack of remaining expert mages.

How effective do you think that system is? Even Zvim is kinda shitty as a teacher. You need to be dedicated to be a good mage, and many of the students just aren't. And without a complete system ie A House to push and aid them, they will always be a mediocre mage.

So why not just create a mass of weak cost effective mages, and I don't know a special class for the gifted. And there you see the Advanced Class. One which is defeated in its purpose due to the corruption and power of the Houses and Wealthy.

The entire system is screwy. Look at how spells are categorized, there is a lot of political gamesmanship going on.

​

Shaping aside, Zorian had lots of time, an amount of money that no Country could possibly dedicate to any student, the ability to take risks and come back from death, and the ability to learn from different factions without others becoming enemies.

​

Everything comes at a cost. You could dump a load of money on the Magic Academy. But then that money could have been used to develop better guns or artillery. Or on black projects like Necromancy or Mind Control. Or on medicine or healing magic, to counter the threat of another Weeping or just fill the gaps the crippled Church left behind. Or on rebuilding the damage from the Splintering & Weeping. OR on Time Dilation Rooms. Rooms which you can not only reward your supporters but make them better.

​

Any mage you spend money and resources on can still die from stupidity or a gunshot. They could also be disloyal. The King is balancing multiple powers and concerns against each other, it is not as simple as just make the academy better. Because what about the head of the Mage's Guild? He is clearly spending a lot of time on the Cult and his own research. Is he really focusing on the School? Would anyone else you appoint be any better? Flying ships are a threat for the future, what other threats are there the reader has not been exposed to? What projects may doom a nation that overlooks them? The world is changing very quickly, and resources are finite even without the equivalent of the Black Death sweeping through.

​

The point is, the Academy is making fodder not real mages. In a decade or two, I would expect curriculum to get harder once enough fodder is in place, institutions are a bit stabilized and hopefully the crisis has passed. The Houses are tutoring their own anyways, so the only mages really effected are the new class of lower class mages. Which again, do you really want a ton of powerful mages running around without being tied to something you can control?
