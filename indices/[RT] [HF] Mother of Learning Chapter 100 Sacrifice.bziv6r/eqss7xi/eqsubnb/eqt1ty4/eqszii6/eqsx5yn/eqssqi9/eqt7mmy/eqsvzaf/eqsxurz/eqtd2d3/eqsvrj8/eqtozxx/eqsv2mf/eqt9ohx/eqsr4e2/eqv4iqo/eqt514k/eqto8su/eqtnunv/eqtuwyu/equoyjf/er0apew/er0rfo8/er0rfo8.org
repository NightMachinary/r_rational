Shapechanging spells do not normally mimic other people's scent as well. However, there are spells that alter how things smell, generally by wiping it clean. The simulacrums would probably trigger to Rea and other shifters as weird, regardless of the countermeasures used, but the room itself had been thoroughly sterilized of all traces that Zorian was involved. Both in terms of scent and otherwise.
