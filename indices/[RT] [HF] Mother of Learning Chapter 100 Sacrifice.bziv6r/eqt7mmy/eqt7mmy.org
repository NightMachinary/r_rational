We've finally reached the final battle! And so much for Zorian's plans to stay quiet and hidden after it's all over, eh?

It's pretty neat just how many parallels there are between Zorian and Jornak. Both are resentful young men who are incredibly meticulous and crazy-prepared, with their strenghts lying in said plans rather than pure strength. They're both like Batman; When versus someone, it's just a matter of how much time they have to prepare.

Jornak has Zorian's pragmatism and pettiness turned up to eleven, and unlike Zorian whose resentfulness and anger toned down as he progressed, Jornak's just got more and more intense.
