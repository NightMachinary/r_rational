No guarantees about my memory either, but I think the compulsion was only if his mind was read, and the thing about him having to kill everyone who knew was just Silverlake interpreting "otherwise he'll die" as "must". But yeah, we do still need for Zach to think they're all dead.

I'd been assuming there wouldn't /be/ an afterwards. I'd also been assuming the final battle would happen on the night of the summer festival, and I forgot to take into account the change. Now that you mention it, Zorian might not be able to keep up a convincing illusion for 24 hours straight, in which case there's complications like you say. Wait, can he just trade off with simulacrums? They need to sleep, but it doesn't have to be at the same time, right? (Also, I have no idea how tricky it is to fake everyone's reactions like that. The matriarch did see some flaws in his illusion when he was testing, so it might be worth making it last as short as possible.)
