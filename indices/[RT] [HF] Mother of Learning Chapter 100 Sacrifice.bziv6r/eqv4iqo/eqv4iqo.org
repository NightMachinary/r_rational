I'm pretty sure whatever illusion Zorian cooks up is not going to target Zach exclusively. We will probably see Zorian die at the end of the next chapter or the chapter after that (at the end of the final fight).

The thing is if only Zach saw it even if he was under mind blank at the moment it might not be enough to convince him. But with all the telepathic relays around the city Zorian can convince Zach that he and some other key figures who have knowledge of the time loop died (some of them will actually die though).

Once some of the contingencies trigger after his death along with the massive illusion which happens during/after the fight, Zach will no longer need to die. This is all necessary because Zach already knows Zorian was trying to find a way to bypass the rules of his contract so he will already be suspicious that shenanigans might be at play so he will need overwhelming evidence in order to actually believe that they all conveniently died even after they won the war.

This is also why Zorian might actually go to lich route if it is necessary to sell the lie. He doesn't drink/get laid anyway :D and any other pleasure I'm pretty sure he can use self illusions :) not getting laid though because he doesn't know what that feels like...
