I'm fairly confident his plan is to combine his research into getting around mind blank, his practice with Spear of Resolve on editing perceptions of reality, and the magic graffiti he secretly spread around town.

Specifically, he's going to alter Zach's perceptions while he's under mind blank to show Zorian dying. Since Zach has every reason to think Mind Blank is inviolate he'd believe fully honestly that Zorian's dead, and thus the secret of the time loop is left to only him (after some much less harmful memory shenanigans with Xvim, Alanic, etc.), and the contract is fulfilled.

And then, once Zach is freed from the contract, Zorian reveals that he's alive after all, and both of them get to live.
