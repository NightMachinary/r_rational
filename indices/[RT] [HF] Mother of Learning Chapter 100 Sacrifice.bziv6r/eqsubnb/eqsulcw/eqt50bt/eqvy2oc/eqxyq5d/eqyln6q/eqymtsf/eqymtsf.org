  If the safeguards activated before the month was done, regardless of the reason why, Zach was considered to have failed in his mission. *Zach's perception did not matter here* -- the contract could detect the activation of the safeguards innately, and was apparently tied to them on some intangible level. Zorian could not detect this connection on Zach, but the contract claimed it existed, so it probably did.
