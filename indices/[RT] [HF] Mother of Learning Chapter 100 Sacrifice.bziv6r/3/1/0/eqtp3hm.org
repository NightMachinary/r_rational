I doubt any of the main characters will make themselves shifters; it seems a thing that requires a community to maintain. Zorian already has his psychic bloodline eating into hit total mana, but knows enough blood magic to give himself another bloodline on the cheap. Since he's already mastered his psychic one, and would be the progenitor of the other/s, he would be able to train or make a training regimen for his family.

He could found his own noble house on the back of this if he were so inclined. Dimensionalism from tunneler toad and psychic would be useful headstarts into difficult and secretive fields for his family.
