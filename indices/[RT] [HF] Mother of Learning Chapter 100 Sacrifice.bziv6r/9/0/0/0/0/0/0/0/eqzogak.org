I'm pretty sure the cats not being used as cat-sniffers is more related to the fact that they are much more harder to train than dogs and not to physical ability.

Cats clean themselves up (lick?) so they would have as little smell as possible.

anyway random google suggests: Scent

Our canine friends have an amazing sense of smell, and we use their scenting ability in many ways. However, cats have an even better sense of smell and can identify differences between a larger variety of scents

Dogs and cats are crepuscular rather than nocturnal animals. Their eyesight is designed to pick up on the slightest movement in the low light of the twilight hours of dusk and dawn. They can also see ultraviolet light which is invisible to us.

Dogs and cats use their ears to express emotions, and both have remarkable hearing. Even in the wee hours of the night the world is a noisy place for our pets. Dogs have 18 muscles in their ears allowing them to move each ear independently to better detect where a sound is coming from. They can hear frequencies up to around 45,000 hertz.

Cats have an even greater range of movement with 32 muscles that allow them to rotate their ears 180 degrees, and they can hear at higher frequencies than dogs -- up to 100,000 hertz.

Bottom line -- both dogs and cats have amazing senses!
