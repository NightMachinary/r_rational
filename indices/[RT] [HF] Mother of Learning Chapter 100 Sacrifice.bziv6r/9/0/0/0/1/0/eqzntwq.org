They talk via magic/sound illusion (like spear of resolve spoke to the alchemist when they visited the underground at the start of the story).

Yes, I am aware of simulacra attached to golem frame - simulacra controls golem directly, not remote control. I don't think the design is that much more different from combat golems Zorian was creating, just on different scale (the base at least).

Anyways, even if it is directly attached, is it really a exact copy of human skeleton? It should have too much freedom or too little - there are some limitation human body has - like muscles and tendons. Golem is being moved via animation spells, AFAIK, so the freedom range is much large. Also, when a regular human is idle, (like the command to body is - be still), we are still using/balancing muscles, alternating them. shifting from one leg to another, etc. - all those micro movements. The golem can be perfectly still - there's no need to compensate/balance the body for it constantly. Even if some of the stuff can be animated, since it is being by spell, it should be exactly the same and humans are very very good at spotting patterns.

IIRC, the design goals for simulacra golems were survival and upkeep concerns. There might have been some other goals strapped on - but I'm sure the stealth/mimicry of the real human body is not the top priority.
