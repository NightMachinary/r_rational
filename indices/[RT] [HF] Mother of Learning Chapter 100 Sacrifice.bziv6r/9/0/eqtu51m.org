There's a kinda pretty large shortcoming/issue author overlooked. if you think about simulacra, it is just an ectoplasma or some golem. How would that think smell?

It should stand out very easily for Rea or Rayne. Two simulacra beside her or the one near Rea should have no own smell. So they should have noticed that. Any shifter with improved sense of smell (canine/feline based) should be able to identify simulacra.

So what are the chances all those people interacted with original before visiting Rea and carried his smell. (and not the original odorless simulacra).

[[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] - the body odor comes from physical sweat glands. Is it oversight? While it would be possible do strap some add-on which would spread some smell, but any shifter should be able to sniff it out.
