Just little reminder.

Even after time loop collapse The five treasures of Ikosian Emperor still have abilities in real wolrd.

The Crown in posession of QI, a super personal mana battery.

The Dagger is kept in royal treasury have an ability to cut spirits, might be stolen by RRJornak

The Ring in possession of Sulrothum High Priest, granting a person soul perception ability.

The Orb in possession of Zorian, a super large pocket dimension.

The Staff is held by Violet Eye mage dragon, a teleportation device that can teleport a person between recall points. Remember when QI tell Zorian that RRJornak was sending his simulacrum to Koth to build a gate, even for Zorian to reach Koth almost take him a month, 20 days with ship, 15 days by using teleport platform under ideal condition. I worried this Staff might be in RRJornak possession.

When Zach ask about shifter thing I thought it will be Zorian Grey Hunter shifter, glad that it's just a divination-blood magic tracking spell.
