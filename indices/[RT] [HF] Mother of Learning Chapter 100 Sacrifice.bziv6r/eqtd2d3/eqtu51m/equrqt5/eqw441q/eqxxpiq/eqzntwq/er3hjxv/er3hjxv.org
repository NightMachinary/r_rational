  IIRC, the design goals for simulacra golems were survival and upkeep concerns. There might have been some other goals strapped on - but I'm sure the stealth/mimicry of the real human body is not the top priority.

Ah, but that changed in chapter 74; the simulacrums all went on strike until Zorian assigned two of them the full time job of improving their frames. In chapter 79, simulacrum #2 noted that the golem frames now felt indistinguishable from a normal body.
