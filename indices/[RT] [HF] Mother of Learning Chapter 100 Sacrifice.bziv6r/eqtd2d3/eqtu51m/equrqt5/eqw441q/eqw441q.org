you are the author here, but I would argue that shifters and their heightened senses should be very effective against simulacra.

It is not just the sweat/smell. Every living person breathes and shifters should be able to spot breathing patterns very easily, especially if they are making. Also this is supposed to be end-of-summer and usually this is the hottest season - so no sweating should be very noticeable.

Besides smells, the other senses would work very well identifying living body. Polygraphs work by monitoring reactions on very tiny detailed levels. Did the heartbeat accelerated? Maybe some extra sweat/whatever. The shifters with their senses would keep very high attention on the person (to check if they are lying) - the matter is related to the very close relatives. Any shifter worth their cost would try to monitor heart beat and most likely fail to detect it. With large focus with super powerful senses from shifter side the simulacra would trip a LOT of alarms.

I would argue that golem frame helps with mana usage and durability, but there should be a negative impact on stealth. At least at some stages solution to moving golem was pre-record some actions (like move a hand) instead of low level management - but those records, also no need for muscles/whatever of golem to spend energy while being frozen should push simulacra into "uncanny valley" area. Some perfect-still-freezes, repetitive/exactly the same motions - if anyone is paying close attention, there should be some stiff movements to give it out.

It is not that hard to fix too. Zorian would kick himself for not spotting this earlier and he needs to make a mental note to not sent simulacra to interact with shifters. Also he might ask via his simulacra Alanic - is there a way to fool shifters and their senses and have simulacra present at the meeting instead of real body.

At the ritual site he is being in person and the simulacra doing the ritual are less important.

There's alse one random scene previously where simulacra invites Rayne to the date to spike original off. She could have noticed the difference about Zorian, especially since the invitation - she would pay a close attention.

In general, this would undermine usability of simulacra spell by allowing some easy detection on a lot of scenarios. It is too OP, needs nerf :)
