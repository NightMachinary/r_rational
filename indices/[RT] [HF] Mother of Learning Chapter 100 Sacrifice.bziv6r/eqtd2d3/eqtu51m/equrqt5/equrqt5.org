The smell should be there, since Zorian has to create all the simulacrums and they weak clothes and use tools that he made for them... but it would be way fainter than that of the original Zorian, as one of the other comments noted. I think Rea and other scent-capable shifters would know the simulacrums were very weird, but wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that they're fake copies. They mostly behave like real Zorian and know everything he does, they're tangible, and Rea probably never encountered that type of magic before. She'd probably think Zorian was doing something weird to himself, which would add to the mystery but not exactly tell her /what/.
