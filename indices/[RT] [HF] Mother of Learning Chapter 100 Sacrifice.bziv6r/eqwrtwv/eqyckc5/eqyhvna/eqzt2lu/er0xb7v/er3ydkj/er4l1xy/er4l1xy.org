  Silverlake would never take the option to become a lich anyways

I'm not sure of that. Sure she would prefer keep her body and she succesed to gain physical longevity, but she would not want die either. Just see her reaction when Alanic mock the fact that becoming a lich is not true immortality (reference to his belief in afterlife). Also she can't create simulacrum...
