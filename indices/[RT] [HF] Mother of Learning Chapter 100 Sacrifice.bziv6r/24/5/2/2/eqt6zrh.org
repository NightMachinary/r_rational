Do you know you could spend hours and hours focusing on learning certain things and get a job making millions of dollars? Why haven't you done it? Oh you want to read stories, play video games, watch anime, instead of focusing 100% on a subject to become an expert in something thats very valuable.

​

People in this world is much the same. You can either learn the cool spells you want at 1X the speed.

Or you can put all that on hold for years and master shaping for years so that you can learn things at .10 the speed.

In the short term the person learning cool spells at 1x the speed are learning a lot of stuff and able to do cool things. They have picked their specialty and 1x the speed is fine for studying for their specialty. They also spend time hanging with their friends and doing fun things. Plus there are certain shaping spells that are specialty specific they learn so they might be learning things in their specialty at .5 speed or something. This wouldn't help for other branches of magic but they aren't on the "arch mage path." Very few but the most motivated would go with the shaping spells method first. Even fewer would spend their free time studying shaping spells instead of having fun and hanging with their friends. This probably goes doubly so for mages from rich families. How many rich kids do you know that are super motivated hard workers? Yeah... most I know are lazy and have everything handed to them.

Zorian is normal in many ways but:

1. Uniquely motivated. Trapped in time loop means that he has the motivation to work long hours for years to try and get strong enough to get out.\\
2. Not really that social/into romance. Means that he is hyper focused unlike zach who spent years just hanging out with various people.
3. Once he found out more informatin he became even more motivated.
4. Unlimited funds.
5. Willing teachers. Zach taught zorian a lot and with zorians shaping skills he was able to pick up zach's spell library fast. It took zach 50 years to assemble that library. Not because it was hard to learn the spells, but because mages are very secretive.\\
6. Zorian has mind powers which he used to his advantage.
7. Zorian in the end turned his brain into a calculator and greatly improved his memory capabilities.

​

All these things turned zorian from being a normal mage into an incredibly powerful one. He still isn't going to be fighting off zach or the lich in a straight up fight.
