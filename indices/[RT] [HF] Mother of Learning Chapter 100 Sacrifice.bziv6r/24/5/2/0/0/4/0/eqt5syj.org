something else i want to point out: part of what makes zorian so broken is, he and his copies are all expert mind mages. they can research something, condense all the knowledge, and send a memory packet with the cliff notes to original.

yeah, this doesn't work with language or something mega involved, but anything that required lots of research and trial and error? he gets instant answers, pretty much. and has been for a couple years now.
