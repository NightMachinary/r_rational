You can become an amazing human being in real life by focusing. Learn how to build rockets, cars, tunnels just from books. Spend your life learning.

But even focusing 3 years on a single or small topic is too much for many. Improving beyond a certain point in anything is pretty hard and even more so if you basically focus on it fulltime.

There is a reason why most of us will be only mediocre in anything we do.
