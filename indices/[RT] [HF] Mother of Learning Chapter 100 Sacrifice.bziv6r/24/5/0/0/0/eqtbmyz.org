To stretch your analogy further, Zorians' situation would be like you going up to the greatest professors in the world. Hand them a million you got from a lottery ticket and ask them to tutor you for a month for 8 hours a day.

Add in a massive mental capacity that comes with having simulacrums, and the ability record memories and memorize books... Give it a few loops and you'd probably have a somewhat narrow, but exceptionally strong foundation to theory education in the subject.

Don't forget to add in the pressure that if you don't learn it perfectly. You die.
