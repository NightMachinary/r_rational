I get that it wouldn't really be a "zorian" thing to do, but I was really hoping that other people would realize just how powerful zorian is/he would tell them. Im a sucker for those kind of things.

ps. Zorian is too powerful. Kinda makes no sense. You can't master that many forms of magic only within 8 years. It is literally impossible.

double ps. Zorian is too powerful to let live after the invasion. The angels or someone else will kill him when they realize exactly how powerful he is.

Edit: I dont want to reply to everyone, but consider like the royal family. They have unlimited money. Access to all the illegal magic. Access to the best tutors, best mages in the country. Are any them near zorian level?

Is there anyone in the entire world, save for the lich who can match zorian's incredible breadth and depth?
