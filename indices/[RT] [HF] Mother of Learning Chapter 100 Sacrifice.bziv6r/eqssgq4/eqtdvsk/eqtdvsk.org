  consider like the royal family. They have unlimited money. Access to all the illegal magic. Access to the best tutors, best mages in the country. Are any them near zorian level?

There is no way that the royal family has that amount of free time. Any of them with a work ethic will be expected to spend most of their time governing. Sure, they'll have a magic education, but none of them will be archmages.
