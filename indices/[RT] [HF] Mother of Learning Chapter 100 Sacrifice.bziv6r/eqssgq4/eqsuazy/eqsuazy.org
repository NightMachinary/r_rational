Zorian died dozens of times, spent far more money than he would have seen in his entire normal life, and engaged in a lot of morally/legally dubious behavior in those 8 years, not to mention all the time spent in Time Chambers. He was also powerfully motivated the whole time he was in the loop.

He was also born with a rare and powerful innate ability. I don't think it is that far fetched.
