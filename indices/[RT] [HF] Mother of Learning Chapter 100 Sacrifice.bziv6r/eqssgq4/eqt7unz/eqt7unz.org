  Zorian is too powerful. Kinda makes no sense. You can't master that many forms of magic only within 8 years. It is literally impossible.

I kinda sad people point to shaping exercise as the main cause for Zorian awesomeness. It contributes, but it's not that. It's the loop. Receiving feedback for whatever you do is immense boon and Sovereign Gate gives more than ample amount of that. Without immediate feedback provided, the cutting edge mage can only do guesswork to advance their skill. Guesswork costs resources that can't be recouped, opportunity that might only happen once in a lifetime, and above all, time. Both time that spent on deliberate consideration on where your resources should be allocated, and time that was sunk for failed enterprise. Outside time loop, the skill advancement is several magnitude slower!

There's also a bonus of existential threat to keep him motivated.

  Is there anyone in the entire world, save for the lich who can match zorian's incredible breadth and depth?
#+end_quote

There must be. We haven't seen Hsan at all. And Quatach Ichl is still a better archmage than Zorian. I think he's vastly superior!

  Zorian is too powerful to let live after the invasion. The angels or someone else will kill him when they realize exactly how powerful he is.
#+end_quote

I really don't like this train of thought. It's silly and forced. This is one reason why I dislike Metropolitan Man (fanfic by Alexander Wales). If Zorian is a menace, sure. But if he isn't, letting a sleeping dragon sleep is more rational course of action. And why angels want to kill him for his exceptional skills? Your thought process must be an esoteric one if not outright flawed to think the angel wish the world deprived of slightly skilled human.
