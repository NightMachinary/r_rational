I don't think that the angels would worry too much about Zorian's skills, which are above average for mortals, but hardly a threat on the divine radar.

However, they might be concerned about his knowledge of the Sovereign Gate. Zach's contract was quite insistent about keeping that secret. If he couldn't find a way to beat the invasion without sharing it, he was never supposed to return to the real world. And it makes sense to stop people from using the Gate, since we know that Panaxeth has partially subverted it. Having the knowledge become widespread, with all the governments in the world fighting for the next 400 years to collect the Key and mark a Controller of their choice...yeah, there's no way that that could end well.
