honestly, its a combination of things. One big thing is that a lot of this knowledge is forbidden. Gates might be difficult to learn, but I think a bigger reason why most people don't use gates is because they don't know how.

Zorian not only gets to steal knowledge from people with impunity due to being mind mage/time loop wiping out consequences, he also partnered with several extremely powerful/intelligent mages towards the end of the time loop to do intense research. Other than the extreme expertise of Xvim, Alanic, Silverlake, etc, theres also the government scientists he coopted, and all the aranea he worked with. Zorian learns through his simulacrums, as well as giving himself mind modifications to be smarter, as well as natural higher-processing abilities as a natural mind mage.

All those things plus being able to spend those years studying under intense pressure (end of the world), with nigh-unlimited resources and no physical risks no matter how crazy his experiments, it makes sense that if anyone were to become that skilled in 8 years, itd be zorian.
