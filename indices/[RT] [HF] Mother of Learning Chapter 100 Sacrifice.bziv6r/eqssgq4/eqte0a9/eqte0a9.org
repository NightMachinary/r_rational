  The angels or someone else will kill him when they realize exactly how powerful he is.

But, the angels are not coming down to kill Quatach-Ichl, are they? They seem to be only concerned with the Primordials. Besides if they would not have allowed someone that powerful to live, then why do the whole business with pseudo-time-travel-training? Their contract was basically 'we give you an incredible opportunity to learn and be powerful, you just have to prevent the primordial summoning'.

So if we leave out the angels, there are not a lot of people that can kill him aside from his fellow time traveler and Quatach-Ichl. Maybe concentrated effort of government and archmages will do.
