[Aside from being an innate mind mage, I am indeed pretty average] - [I know what you're thinking, and yes -- my rapid growth as a mage is *all due to the time loop*. *It doesn't just give time*, you know. It also gave me *nigh-limitless resources*, *access to restricted materials* and *plenty of normally unobtainable experience*. *It also put me under enormous pressure, keeping me constantly motivated in a way I otherwise wouldn't be*. I honestly think anyone could do what I did, if put in the same position. Well, provided they didn't just break under the pressure...]

Zorian admit that his high capabilies are due to the Time Loop. *The time loop lets him consider some things that most mages wouldn't and makes some things possible that otherwise wouldn't be* - his potential for *growth is huge*, even taking his inherent limitations (such as relatively low mana reserves) into account.

Also consider his natural mind magic abilities, Zorian stole vast amount knowledge, training regimens, and any infomation he deemed worth from defeated foes, for examples he obtain knowledge for soul magic from Sudomir.

Zorian avarege magnitude (8/10) also help him learning and do shaping exercise far more faster than most people, people with higher magnitude like Zach (25) are outright incapable do finenese focussed spell, Zach had a decades honing his shaping and can cast every type of magic including medical magic but Zorian can better than him with only few years learn shaping exercise. While Zach shaping has stop increasing in certain point, Zorian can hone his shaping much more higher.
