Although I also entertain the thought that Zorian's growth speed is improbably fast, you are mistaken. He had far more than 8 years after all - his time in Black Rooms alone is more than 2 years. But most importantly, he's one of the very few people, possibly even the only one in existence, that can use simulacrums for training like he's Naruto - normal people, even if they can cast the spell, don't get the simulacrums' memories back when those dispel. That could have multiplied his effective training time by several degrees!
