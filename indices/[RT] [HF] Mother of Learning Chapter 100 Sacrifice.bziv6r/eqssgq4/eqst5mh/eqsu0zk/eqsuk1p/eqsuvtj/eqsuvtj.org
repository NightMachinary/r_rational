If shaping skills are is the best chance to success then what you said makes no sense. If shaping skills allow you to easily be a multi mage (I consider 8 years of work easy), then everyone, in a rational system, who wants to improve their magic will be doing them.

However the fact that shaping exercises aren't very popular means either:

1. They aren't that useful. Meaning zorian isn't this powerful because of shaping

or

1. They are incredibly useful, but for some reason noone else is doing them. AKA not a rational world.

Honestly, you guys are all acting like Zorian is some genius, like daimon. Have any of you read the early chapters? Everyone he met remarked that he wasn't a genius. Everyone.
