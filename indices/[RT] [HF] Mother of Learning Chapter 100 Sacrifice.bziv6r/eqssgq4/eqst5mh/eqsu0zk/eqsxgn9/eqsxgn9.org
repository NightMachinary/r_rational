Shaping is tough to learn and takes dedication. It way easier to learn spell formulas, however this leads to specialisation and an inability of mages to perform more than 1 or 2 roles. On the other hand economically the market is flooded with lots of mages that can do specific things, can't move jobs easily. This means overall more magic can be done but there is very little overlap in domains - similar to how our economy of skills functions. We're at a point where cross-disciplinary skills are becoming or are important and eventually that will happen in Eldemar too but it's a long ways off.

Most mages don't have the money to be able to focus on shaping and becoming an archmage. Where's the money in that?
