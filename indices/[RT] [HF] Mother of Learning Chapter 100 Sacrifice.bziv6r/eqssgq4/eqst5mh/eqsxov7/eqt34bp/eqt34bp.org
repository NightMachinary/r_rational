I'm a math and physics major. Most people I meet outside of these majors either think these types of subjects are too boring, difficult, or even useless. Surprising though it may be, "when am I ever going to use this?" is the canonical response to struggling with math or science. And yet STEM degrees are very powerful tools for success, meanwhile they don't require genius. All that's needed is a lot of hard work. And I'd say the work is likely way more interesting than shaping exercises.

For these reasons, it's entirely believable to me that hardly anyone invests the time to learn shaping when in the real world, math departments are among the most underpopulated on most campus. And even then, most students who pass though math departments do so just to meet one or two graduation requirements for statistics or are engineers who only take through differential equations or linear algebra, which is hardly anything; stopping before real analysis means they don't really have any sense of what math beyond calculation feels like.
