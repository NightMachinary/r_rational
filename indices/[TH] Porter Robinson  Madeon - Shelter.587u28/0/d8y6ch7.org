From the video's description: Shelter tells the story of Rin, a 17-year-old girl who lives her life inside of a futuristic simulation completely by herself in infinite, beautiful loneliness. Each day, Rin awakens in virtual reality and uses a tablet which controls the simulation to create a new, different, beautiful world for herself. Until one day, everything changes, and Rin comes to learn the true origins behind her life inside a simulation.

The letter that flashes on screen for a moment:

  To Rin

  From : Dad

  There was just so little time left after you were born.

  I don't know how much love I managed to pour into raising you after your mother died...

  But your smile kept me going. (^{_^{)}}

  I would like to have come with you, but I couldn't.

  I wanted you to forget everything and move on... I knew you'd be alright.

  But you'll get lonely, and remember.

  I know you'll grow strong, and read this letter some day.

  I really wish we could have spent more time together. I'm sorry.

  You were so young back then, too young to understand what they meant. So let me repeat...

  My final words to you.

  凛へ

  From : 父

  キミが生まれてから、あまりにも時間がなさすぎた。

  お母さんがなくなってからキミにどれだけの愛情をそそげただろうか・・・。

  父さんは元気なキミをみて勇気づけられたよ(^{_^{)}}

  本当は一緒に行ければよかったんだけど、それは出来なかった。

  全部忘れて進んで欲しいと思ったんだ・・・ キミなら大丈夫だって。

  さびしさを知ってしまって、思い出すだろう。

  キミが強くなってこの文を読んでくれると信じて。

  もっとたくさんの思い出を作れればよよかったね。 ごめんよ。

  小さい時はよくわからなかったと思うけど、今ならきっと。

  あの日の言葉をもう一度。

I'm a fan of Madeon and glad to see such an interesting and touching music video made.
