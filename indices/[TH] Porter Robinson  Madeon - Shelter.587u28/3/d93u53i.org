It's a nice video, but how is it rational?

To summarize the plot: The girl is alone in a world she remakes for herself every day. She gets lonely but eventually remembers how she came to be there (super-science father sent her away in an escape pod during the apocalypse). She comes to the conclusion that she shouldn't forget again because the memories make her stronger.

However: The girl is not shown using rationalist methods to discover her situation or come to these conclusions. One day she starts to remember things, and /stuff just happens to her/. Furthermore, she isn't shown using her newfound knowledge to actually do anything. For example, she doesn't try to verify her situation or even figure out if there are any other survivors.

This is a story in which things happen to the protagonist, but the protagonist isn't seen taking any actions towards driving the plot. I don't think it belongs in this sub.
