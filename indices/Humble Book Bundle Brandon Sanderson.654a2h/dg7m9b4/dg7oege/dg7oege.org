Sanderson's Laws of Magic:

1. An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.
2. The limitations of a magic system are more interesting than its capabilities. What the magic can't do is more interesting than what it can.
3. A brilliant magic system for a book is less often one with a thousand different powers and abilities -- and is more often a magic system with relatively few powers that the author has considered in depth.
