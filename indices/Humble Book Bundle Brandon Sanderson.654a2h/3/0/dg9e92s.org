Brandon Sanderson is amazing. His books are better. The characters are deep, all with their own motives, and the worlds that he builds just make sense. His magic systems are gamed pretty well by his world's inhabitants, and their full features are mostly explained in an appendix at the end of each of his books. I started with his stormlight archives series, and have started his mistborn series. Both contain epic fantasy plots that don't involve the idiot ball. All in all, I'd highly recommend them to anyone.
