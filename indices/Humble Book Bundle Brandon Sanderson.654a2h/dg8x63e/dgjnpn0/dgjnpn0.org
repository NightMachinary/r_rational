  about well-defined magic systems with rules, right? Sufficiently Analyzed Magic type stuff?

See above regarding Sanderson's laws.

If you are old enough to have read/heard of the wheel of time; he's the guy Robert Jordan hired to write his last two books after he knew he'd die before he would finish. This speaks to characterization and writing skill.

In Mistborn Sanderson makes an evil empire and then takes three books [[#s][minor spoiler book 1]] to show how the evil emperor [[#s][bigger spoiler for the series]] i.e. he was bad but not just trying to be evil.

Elantris is among other things about the rediscovery of a magic system after it's catastrophic loss through dedicated practice and a "that's funny" moment.

Perfect State is a Trans-humanist nightmare/dream on a level with Friendship is optimal, though it doesn't make that much sense at the second level if you ask me.

There's a lot of shorts here and a lot of filler. That said Snapshot, Legion, Emperors Soul, and Perfect State alone are worth 15 if you ask me. The only full length Novels I see are Elantris and Warbreaker.

If you like the fantasy here you'll probably like these and end up reading the rest of Sanderson's Canon [[#s][spoiler explaining how most of Sanderson's fantasy is in the same universe]] the excepted stories are SF shorts.
