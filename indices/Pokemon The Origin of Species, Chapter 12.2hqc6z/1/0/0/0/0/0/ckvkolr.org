First off, thank you very much for writing all that out. You get an upvote, which I normally don't do in my own threads. This is exactly the kind of criticism I look for, because it's what helps me improve as a writer and make better stories. It was a post similar to this that made me utterly revamp the last interlude.

I definitely see how I can be doing a better job making Red's goal more central to the story. He doesn't want to become a Ranger, he wants to become a Professor, which means learning as much as he can about pokemon.

I think weaving that into the story takes time though, since it's hard to make nothing but exploring how pokemon work every chapter consistently entertaining to anyone not /way too interested in pokemon seriously I have problems/. But part of that might just be due to the choices I made at the start of it all.

To begin with, I wanted the story to still reflect the recognizable "Pokemon journey," rather than just have Red stuck in a lab with the occasional expeditions out. Besides disliking the "Quest hub" feel that would have, I like the opportunities traveling provides to organically meet new characters and have new experiences.

Second, I wanted there to be other characters with Red, both because it makes sense in a realistic pokemon world and to provide companionship. Blue's goal is to become Champion. That means doing the general route that mirrors the pokemon games. Leaf's goal is more academic, like Red's, but less defined for a particular reason. I may be mistaken in keeping that reason hidden for now, but it's another one that will not become central to the story right away.

What all that amounts to is that, as all long-term goals, they require, for lack of a better word, "walking" (and later biking). Which means not staying too long in one place to deal with local and consistent plots or challenges, but dealing with the ones that traveling trainers would face. I see it as my job to make that walking as close to as interesting and exciting as actually experiencing it would be as I can (taking into account that it's in the pokemon world, where walking from one town to the other can be a life threatening experience).

I'm as excited to get to "the good stuff" as any readers are, but I don't want to rush through the foundation of their character development, group dynamics and experience as trainers to get there. I'm actually going to start picking the pace up temporally in the next chapter, so that each one doesn't span just a few hours at a time, but I don't know if that'll really solve the issues you pointed out.

I can promise to keep working on them though, and finding better ways to make the chapter-to-chapter plots more interesting without sacrificing those things. I'm definitely not saying it can't be done: I'm just not sure yet that I'm a good enough writer to do it :P

On the interludes though, I know they're going to be hit-or-miss for people, and that's one area that I'm okay with there being a genuine difference of preference on. There's just too much of the world and story that I want to tell to stick with Red's perspective, and I think the foundations of things have to be set up now to be meaningful later, rather than just springing them on the readers, or having them weakly referenced by some vague foreshadowing. I know that slows down the pace of the "main story," but I'm okay with that, and the best I can do is try to make both the main story and the interludes as compelling as I can so that neither detracts from the other.

  The biggest misstep in this chapter was you made me care about what would happen to the bureaucrat far more than the ninja, which one would think would be impossible.

Ha! I actually was hoping for that :) It would have been far too easy to side with Janine for being the world's equivalent to Batman. I wanted people to care enough about Kamal to think she might actually be in the wrong. Not sure how to take it being seen as a misstep, other than that I just failed to make it clear enough in my writing.
