Also, that you aren't a fan of pokemon arguably makes your perspective even more important on certain things, as you're less likely to just enjoy it for nostalgia or just because it's pokemon. I actually wonder often as I write how much of what I'm writing will be understandable to someone that doesn't know more than the very basics of the world/concept.
