So I added and rewrote some bits to the end of chapter 1 and the middle of chapter 4 to focus on Red's goals a bit better. I also added a few minor lines throughout the rest of the story to keep it relevant, and edited a scene in chapter 5 and 8 to make Leaf's goals/journey more focused, but these are the main two things I added, and I'm curious to know what you think:

End of chapter 1:

  They arrive at the PC, and Professor Oak begins setting up their accounts. "Really?" Leaf looks interested rather than skeptical, which is a nice change of pace. Most people outside the lab don't tend to take him seriously, but then, she is the daughter of a professor herself. "What will your lab be focused on?"

  "I want to study the origin of pokemon species."

  "Which ones?"

  "All of them."

  Now she looks skeptical. "All of them? You mean..."

  Red tries to ignore Blue's smirk. "Yeah. I want to know where they all came from. What makes them so different from each other, and what makes us so different from them."

  The girl gives a low whistle. "You and the rest of the world. You don't dream small, do you?"

  Red smiles. "Where's the fun in that?"

  "None at all, I say," Professor Oak says as he registers Blue's Trainer ID to the network.

  Leaf smiles back. "Well, I'd be happy to hear about your theories on pokemon types."

  "And I'll be happy to help prove them wrong---through battles," Blue says with a grin, and spins his pokeball on his finger again.

Mid chapter 4:

  The sun continues to inch along the sky, and eventually Blue excuses himself to duck behind some trees. While he's gone, Leaf turns to Red. "So what does it take to become a Professor in Kanto?"

  Red raises a hand and ticks a finger up one at a time as he speaks. "First, to become a registered Pokemon Researcher, I need to contribute twenty new articles on pokemon from my observations and experiences with mine. I can submit them through the pokedex, but I have to wait for them to be peer reviewed."

  "Can they be on any pokemon?"

  Red nods. "One article on twenty or twenty on one or anything in between. I just need to discover or verify something new. Second, to become a Pokemon Instructor, I need to by verifying ten results from other people's research with my own pokemon, after contributing at least an additional thirty articles. Third, I can apply to become an Associate Professor to work in the lab under Professor Oak, and to qualify for that I need to submit a hundred articles and verify thirty of others'. And finally, once I'm an Associate Professor, I can become a full Professor by disproving ten theories that have already been established."

  Leaf gives a low whistle. "I can't quite remember what it's like in Unova, but that sounds like a lot of work."

  "Yeah, but I can start making money for articles I contribute once I'm a Researcher, so it's incrementally rewarding long before I reach the end."

  "Still, you'll have to catch a lot of pokemon. More than Gym Leaders have, even."

  "Or spend a lot o time with the a couple dozen, yeah. If I discover a new specie that would put me on the fast track, so let me know if you spot any."

  She grins. "For a cut of the research funds, sure."
