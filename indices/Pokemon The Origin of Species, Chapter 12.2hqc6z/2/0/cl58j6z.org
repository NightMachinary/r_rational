No problem at all, I appreciate the feedback!

I specifically took the time to build Kamal's character because I knew how easy it would be to side with and romanticize the vigilante. I wanted to show that a) the people she's targeting are not necessarily demons, and b) that she might actually be wrong to do what she's doing.

That said, if Janine herself comes off as uninteresting and the chapter as a whole is dull, then I definitely failed overall. I'll try to adjust the chapter when I get around to future edits and hopefully improve that :)
