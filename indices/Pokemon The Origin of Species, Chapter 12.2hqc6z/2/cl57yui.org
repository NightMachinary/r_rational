It took me quite a bit longer to finish this chapter than the previous ones. It's probably my least favorite chapter so far, I'm sorry to say.

One of the main reasons I love reading Pokemon: The Origin of Species, is the manner in which it addresses practical matters such as food, funds, sleep. The combination of outlandish lore and a focus on familiar concrete things keeps the story fresh and makes the world feel "lived in". This chapter felt a lot more cartoonish.

Apart from Kamal I found it difficult to care about any of the characters. I thought Janine especially lacked personality. As a result of this your treatment of vigilante justice felt rather bland too.

I have just devoured all five seasons of Boston Legal and loved Alan Shore's (the protagonist's) attempts to take the law into his own hands, because the mixture of moral indignation, hedonism, vulnerability, fearlessness, etc. that drive and characterize him makes these acts interesting. Vigilantism is the subject of many excellent stories (I also love Death Note, for example), but because it features in so many stories, I think it can quite easily become dull.

Looking forward to the next chapter!
