You're welcome. I called it a misstep because somehow I don't think Kamal will be important to the plot ever again, or at least, never as important as Janine.

Edit -- further thoughts on the plotting:

I guess the problem you really have is that Red is wrong character for the setting. He's properly curious about and awed by many of the pokemon, but the pokemon themselves are not inherently mysterious. They aren't some alien race which mankind barely comprends, but ordinary domesticated functions of society, and every other person has an encyclopedia about them in their back pocket. Since the protagonists have no enemies, they have no time limit, which is something that text can do much better than games.

I said I wouldn't tell you how to write, but if I was undertaking Rational! Pokemon I would set up some kind of pokemon-only epidemic (scientists and disease are natural enemies) or writing about some kind of rescue shelter for abused or injured pokemon.

Maybe your root problem is not deviating from the original setting enough to more elegantly support the story you /really/ want to tell.
