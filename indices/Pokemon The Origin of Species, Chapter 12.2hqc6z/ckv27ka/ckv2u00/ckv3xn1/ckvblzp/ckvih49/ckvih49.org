You misunderstand me (warning: far too many words about imaginary things below).

/Worm/ was gripping from the first few chapters because Taylor had multiple threats, and more importantly, multiple/kinds/ of threat. She had to avoid getting roasted by Lung of course, but she also had to protect her status as a double-agent from both the heroes /and/ the villains, keep her doings a secret from her dad, evade Emma and Sophia, deal with Rachel, stay in school, and manage her developing feelings for a certain person. All of these were distinct challenges for Taylor, and their immediate mixture keeps the tension high until the many side characters and other events get their own hooks into the reader.

Taylor had several objectives from the get-go in /Worm/, and many ways to fail -- and oh did she fail. It wasn't the size of the fights which created a looming sense of /this can't possibly last much longer/, but the understanding that she was juggling too much and something was going to collapse somewhere and knock everything else out of whack. Taylor's life was falling apart *long before Leviathan*.

Now, I get that your protagonists are much younger, but you still have problems with pacing. You're trying to emulate a webserial, but you're still writing it like a regular novel. The story's current pace would just fine if it were a complete work... but it isn't. The party is roaming around looking for +dragons to slay+ pokemon to catch, which is great in a game but kinda arbitrary in a written work.

This isn't a tabletop campaign, but sometimes it feels like one, /and that is not a good thing./

You know what was your most compelling scene by far (for me)? *Red almost losing his pokedex to the spider*. That was the first time I was engaged with the text, when I suddenly felt a character /had something at stake/ and would do anything to protect it. That was when I was reading because I wanted to find out what would happen next and not just indulging the novelty of Rational!Pokemon.

Then you cut away to an interlude which has nothing at all to do with the protagonists.

The big problem is that you are creating a monthly serial which is not yet quite interesting enough to hold attention through the interim. The solution is not to have interludes which hint at *The Plot*, but to make that happen to the characters. The biggest misstep in this chapter was you made me care about what would happen to the bureaucrat far more than the ninja, which one would think would be impossible. The problem with trying to use these interludes for foreshadowing is that the /actual protagonists/ have no idea what is happening and no capability to act on it.

Harry-James-Potter-Evans-Verres' ambition was to use magic and science to +conquer+ optimize the wizarding and muggle worlds (and the rest of the universe). Taylor wanted to be a hero in a world where the only other person who even approaches actual heroism is freakin' Skynet.

What does Red want? To become a Ranger? That's cool, I guess.

HJPEV had an absurd, spectacular goal, and made an enemy or friend of a character within a few lines of meeting them. Taylor had a very realistic goal, except that every single element of the setting was stacked against her. /Worm/ could have breakaway interludes because its characters already had massive problems to tackle, and indeed, sometimes it /needed/ a break. /HPMOR/ didn't need to have large-scale foreshadowing because it was a fanfic lampooning an existing storyline with plenty of its own creativity to add. /P:TOoS/ has the creativity but but not the storyline; the foreshadowing but not the struggle.

I don't know what the solution is, and I can only judge what you have written, not tell you what to write.

I'm not sure when this turned into a review, but I hope you understand what I'm getting at. Don't you dare stop writing, but try to step away from the conspiracy diagrams and plot notes and battle plans and scene drafts from time to time and take more distant view.
