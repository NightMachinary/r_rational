Yep, that's exactly what I have to work out: what exactly qualifies someone as a Pokemon Professor worthy of their own lab, and to mention specific things Red wants to research with his own lab.

And don't worry, the games and anime are pretty useless as source material or reference: they provide the bare minimum world building, and much of it is contradictory between mediums or blatantly illogical. Your criticisms are valuable as a reader reading a story, and being familiar with the particulars of Pokemon wouldn't change any of that.
