So I've been doing some thinking about your points as I began writing the latest chapter, and I realized what Red's story is missing in these early stages: a concrete idea of what "become a pokemon professor" requires.

"Become a Champion" is straightforward. Collect 8 badges, beat the Elite Four, and bam, suddenly you have more political clout and public adoration than anyone but other champions. The goal is easy to imagine wanting, and the steps, if a bit gamey, are easily understood.

"Become a Professor" by contrast is missing all that. So I definitely need to do a better job establishing it, which means a bit of editing and expanding in a couple of previous chapters, not to mention tailoring future chapters to tighten Red's focus.

But first I wanted to get some feedback from you: do you think I've homed in on a major issue, or am I off the mark in my diagnosis and prescription?
