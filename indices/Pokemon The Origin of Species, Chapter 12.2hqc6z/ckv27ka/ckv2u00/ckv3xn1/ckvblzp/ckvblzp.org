I think it depends how you define "real stakes." Red's story is very much a small scale one at the moment, but that doesn't mean the stakes aren't real, it just limits their boundaries.

Is Red or company going to be psychically maimed or lose an arm sometime in the next few chapters? Probably not, no.

Is Red and company going to miss out on opportunities to catch pokemon, fail to save people, or lose their own pokemon? Maybe.

Worm did an amazing job escalating the plot and characters from Tier 1 to a Tier 3 story. It's a model and progression that I use a lot when constructing tabletop RPG campaigns. If I've done my job right, no stages of the story are uninteresting or boring, even if they're not all as exciting as, say, a Zapdos attack.
