There was some creative license going on with introducing Zardeenah. Honestly I thought that too. On the other hand Tash and Aslan both interfered in the series, and things were transfered between worlds various times. Also she did offer up the magical rings that allow you to world hop as an offering so it wasn't just "hey remember that one time..."
