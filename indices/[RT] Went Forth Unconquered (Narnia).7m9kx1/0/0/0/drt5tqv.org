To me, it seems arbitrary for Zardeenah to be suddenly hearing Susan in England now, when she's never displayed any power before in England. Nor, frankly, has she anywhere in the series. Given Tash's sudden appearance in /Last Battle/, I could pardon Zardeenah's appearing somewhere in the Narnian world, but she's still almost an OC.

Then, Zardeenah helps Susan with a flashy miracle of teleporting a bow and arrows from dead, frozen Narnia; even Aslan hardly ever does anything so flashy. This's explained by her being "faithful far beyond death" - to Susan, who performed Zardeenah's rites only once, and in her reign was always a faithful servant of Aslan.

Finally, Susan goes off adventuring with the magic rings. I can easily see that. That'd be a good start to a story. But the story I see on the page isn't that.
