I guess I didn't buy "Susan only spent time in England for her siblings, and now that they're dead she can resume adventuring" thing at all. The point isn't that the places are made up; it's that it makes no sense to me for Susan to never use the rings while the other siblings were alive if she wanted to do anything like this.
