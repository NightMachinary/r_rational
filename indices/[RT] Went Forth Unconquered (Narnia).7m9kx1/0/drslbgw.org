The first half of this got my hopes up for a good Susan exposition story. Alas, it falls flat shortly afterwards.

On one hand, yes, Susan is a character treated very unfairly by the Author, and I like her fanfics much more. This short story aims in the right direction, but in the end the main plot point seems arbitrary. A couple pot shots at Narnia's limited world-building does not a good story make.
