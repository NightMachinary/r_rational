I'm craving some SCP content. Were there any interesting new objects lately? Preferably long-form. Also, are there any Tales/Canon Hubs with storylines comparable in quality to /There Is No Antimemetics Division/? [[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-cool-war-hub][/The Cool War/]] was pretty fun, but I'd tried a few others, and either the individual stories weren't written very well, or they were meandering and disjointed, not following a coherent plot.
