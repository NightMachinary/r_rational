starship troopers sucks op. heinlein is probably the most significant conservative writer - this was of course from a different era, where being a conservative indicated different policies than it does nowadays. this is somewhat the issue with your request - there's not really such a thing as a traditionalist conservative mindset, because the ideology of conservatives is a moving target that has historically changed very constantly. for instance, during heinlein's time, the republican party - and conservative ideology in general - was the dominant ideology among people with college degrees (although not necessarily across all degrees, if that makes sense). during this period, conservative policy was synonymous with very traditional liberal, laissez faire policy. over time, with the rise of neoliberalism and the general movement and positioning of conservative parties as the xenophobic party, this has changed. much can actually be written about this - its a pretty complex phenomenon but its pretty interesting, at least in my opinion, and it is of course the case that certain traits have remained an element of conservative ideology (militarism of course being the biggest one). ultimately, what im getting at is that it is very hard to give demonstrations of things written by what we would consider now to be conservatives because the definition of conservative ideology has shifted massively over the last century. in particular, one of the biggest issues with this from the point of view of sci fi writers is that heinlein is somewhat unique in that era of sci fi writers as being one of the very few writers who never saw any actual combat - most of the ones who did had a considerably different view point on society at large - and most of the remainder of sci fi writers were academics of the arts who were less inclined towards conservatism. if you really want to find conservative writers of scifi, though, you can probably look up people associated with the sad puppies - although im not really sure why you would want to read what they write.
