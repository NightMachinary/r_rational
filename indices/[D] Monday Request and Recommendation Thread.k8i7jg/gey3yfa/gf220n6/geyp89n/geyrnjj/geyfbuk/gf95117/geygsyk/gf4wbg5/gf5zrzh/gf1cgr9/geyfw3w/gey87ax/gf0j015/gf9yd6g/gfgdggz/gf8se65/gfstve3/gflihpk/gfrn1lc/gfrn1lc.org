Hard de-rec from me on this one. It is one of the rare fanfics that I would call outright parasites. It is a story that cannot stand on its own. To be more specific, not a single scene (not even story arc, scene!) can be read and enjoyed unless you know the source material like the back of your hand. As long as you do, it can be somewhat enjoyable in a mediocre popcorn fic way, but the moment the crossover moves to any setting you don't know it becomes painfully obvious.
