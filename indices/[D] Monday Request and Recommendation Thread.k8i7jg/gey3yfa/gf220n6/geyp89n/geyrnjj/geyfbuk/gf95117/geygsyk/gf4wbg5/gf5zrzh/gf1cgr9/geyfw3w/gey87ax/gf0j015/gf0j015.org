I'm looking for recommendations for any "human reincarnated into non-human thing" stories, where there is heavy featuring of humans interacting with the MC and their reactions to whatever he is which normally doesn't act intelligent acting intelligent.

Some of my favorites I enjoyed so far are: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13577472/1/A-Backwards-Grin][a backwards grin]], [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/cold-comfort-pokemon-si.68980/][cold comfort]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/page-591#post-71291967][I woke up as a dungeon now what?]], Shade touched (RR, not an isekai but still has the human interaction I want), Kumo desuga nanika?, and a whole lot more I can't remember atm actually.

Anything people enjoyed along this vein is appreciated!
