Thinking of typical stories it seems harder to be conservative since the stories tend to be about changing the status quo, so you'd have to have a hero's journey that starts with the status quo of progressive race mixing and then the conservative hero splits the populations into their own ethnostates or something.

Harder to do something like that than classic hero's journey.

Orson Scott Card is a pretty conservative author so probably the Ender series

But I dunno about rational, hard to find
