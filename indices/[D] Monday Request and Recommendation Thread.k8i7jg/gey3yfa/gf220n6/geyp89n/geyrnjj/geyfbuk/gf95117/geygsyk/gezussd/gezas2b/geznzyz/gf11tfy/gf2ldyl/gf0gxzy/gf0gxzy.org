I know that the definition of conservative has shifted considerably over the years, so has the definition of progressive.

Specifically, I was requesting traditionalist conservative literature, a specific strand of conservatism that has a more clear definition, albeit not a universal one.

I've been considering reading books associated with Sad Puppies, although I don't expect it to be very worthwhile since it's literature meant to make a metafictional point rather than being rational.
