I completely agree. Keep in mind that 99% of conservatives have never been in the military let alone seen combat. It's definitely a utopian military ethos that doesn't hold up to reality, but the vast majority of people will never experience the reality.

I probably am overstating the influence, but I do think the book is a great representation of the ideology.

Edit: 99% is an over exaggeration, apparently 7.3% of Americans have served/are serving [[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-percentage-of-americans-have-served-in-the-military/]]
