[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends][Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends]] has three systems, one of which is cultivation. All the systems are really well balanced imo and consistent up to the top. The worldbuilding is also nice. Of the two protagonists, one of them is less interesting at first, but gets better later on. Reads a bit flat due to author's second language being English, but it's still much better than translated stuff. There is some good subversion of tropes too which hinge on how powers work.

I've also heard good things about The Path Unending, which is a xianxia that started as a quest on SV and then migrated to Royalroad.
