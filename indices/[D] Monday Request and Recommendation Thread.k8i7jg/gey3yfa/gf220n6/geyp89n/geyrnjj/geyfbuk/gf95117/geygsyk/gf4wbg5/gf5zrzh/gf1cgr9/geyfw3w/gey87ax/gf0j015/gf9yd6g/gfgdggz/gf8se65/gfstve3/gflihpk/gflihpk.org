Just caught up on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/][Kill Them All]], a gritty OP Gamer/Worm meandering multicross that's apparently nearing completion. I found it enjoyable in terms of deconstruction, power escalation and munchkinry. Some of the powers (like skill book absorption) seemed underutilized, so there's possibly an idiot ball or two to criticize, but it was a fun read.
