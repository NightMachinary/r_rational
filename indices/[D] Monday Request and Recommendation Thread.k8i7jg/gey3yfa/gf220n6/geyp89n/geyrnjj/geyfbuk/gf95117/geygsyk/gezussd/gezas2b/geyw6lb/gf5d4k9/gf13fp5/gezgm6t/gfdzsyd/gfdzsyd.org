*Cross-Time Engineer* is kinda an example, a typical "modern advanced person stranfed in the Medieval Age", story, but the author is well versed in technology and history for once. The titular character is a somewhat conservative and mostly rational (he approaches all problems like an engineer, but also struggles with his temper). The series is kind of a Red Pill but tries to be Rational as well (plus heaps of old school action like a 80's era movie).

The relationship this book has with conservatism is interesting. It explores 20th century conservatism, 12th century conservatism and how the two differ, and also the question how conservative a person really /remains/ once they have royal powers and no one to answer to except possibly God.

For example, the protagonist over the course of the book becomes a near Feminist, but also strongly anti-LGBT.

As for just about every other conservative trope: be it religion, the role of the state, race, gender, sex, capitalism vs socialism etc, the protag faces problems that invalidate BOTH Conservative and Liberal ideas, and the plot explores the complexity of human character and culture.

To give you one example, the protagonist is kind of a douche in most things, but is also extremely against rape in any form. The co-protagonist is the absolute embodiment of Lawful Good hero....except also a rapist.

The series is not necessarily very good, but it is extremely entertaining, and often thought provoking, especially if you, like me, disagree with a lot of Conservative ideas.
