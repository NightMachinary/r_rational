Yeah the reason why Heinlein is notable is because, of the authors writing military sci-fi during the period, he was one of the few who hadn't ever seen combat and that colored his view of militarism and war. In a lot of ways, he bought into military propaganda and never saw any realities that would change that viewpoint. That's why stuff like the Forever War are much better imo.
