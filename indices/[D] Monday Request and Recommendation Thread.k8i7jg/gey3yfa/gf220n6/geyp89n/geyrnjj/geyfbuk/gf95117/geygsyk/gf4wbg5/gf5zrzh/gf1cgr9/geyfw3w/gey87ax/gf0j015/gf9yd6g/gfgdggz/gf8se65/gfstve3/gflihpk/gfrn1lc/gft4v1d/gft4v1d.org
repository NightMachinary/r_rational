Yeah, I can see that point. The story often dumps lore references without explaining it much. I'm not sure I'd have liked it without being highly familiar with Worm. I was unfamiliar with many of the other settings and enjoyed it regardless, but since they are adventures bookended with the more familiar Worm setting it was enough to know a lot about the general kind of story. The setting switching aspect was interesting to me -- Taylor's universe is one form of gritty superhero end of the world drama, but very different from any random supernatural horror, comic book dystopia, etc.
