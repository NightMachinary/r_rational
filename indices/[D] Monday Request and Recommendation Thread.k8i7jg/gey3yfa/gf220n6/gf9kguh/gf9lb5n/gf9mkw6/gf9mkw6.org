I'm at 1500. I agree that it's terrible, but I love the Chinese idioms and the comedy. The translators are also great on their own. I just ignore/ skim the progression/ cultivation stuff and treat each arc as an overblown mythology-style clown fiesta. I can't recommend anyone read to where I did, but I really think that those first 70 chapters or so are worth reading.
