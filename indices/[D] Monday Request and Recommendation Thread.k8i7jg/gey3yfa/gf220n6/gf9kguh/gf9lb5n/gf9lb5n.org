LoHP is terrible. To be precise, it's /repetitive/ to an insane degree; you saw the first 70 chapters or so - you saw everything. The world itself seems to be shaped in levels for the protagonist, each a repeat of a previous stage, just with higher average cultivation level. I persisted for a bit further than 900 chapters, and dropped.

One of my wishes is that someone writes a rational fic for/inspired by LoHP, because the premise is rather fun.
