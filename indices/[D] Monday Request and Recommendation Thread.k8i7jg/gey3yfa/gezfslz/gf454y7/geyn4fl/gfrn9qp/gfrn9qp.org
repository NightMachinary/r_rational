The 2019 videogame /Control/ is basically SCP in videogame form. The general writing and worldbuilding are pretty neat and definitely worthwhile, and it's got a lot of great aesthetic stuff going on (especially if you have a PC with a raytracing-capable videocard - but even if not, it looks pretty good). There're lots of great aesthetics and cool stuff in the game's world, told mostly via found documentation and audio logs and most noticeably live action videos embedded into the game world. The central storyline is decent and interesting. That all said, the game's actual gameplay is somewhat tedious and bad third person shooter stuff that is not closely tied into the good parts of the game that are worth experiencing, so that's ... not great, sadly.

The main game is pretty short - the main game is maybe ~15ish hours, with some additional expansion/DLC content and optional missions beyond that.
