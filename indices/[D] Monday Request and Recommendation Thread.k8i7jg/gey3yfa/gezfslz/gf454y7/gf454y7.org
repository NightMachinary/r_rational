If you're not asking this because [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOxarwd3eTs][SCP: Overlord]] came out recently, you should definitely go watch that (and potentially the rest of the SCP content on the guy's channel)

It's a live action movie of an MTF taskforce investigating an anomalous cult. It's really well done. The MTF members are just as competent-yet-overwhelmed as you'd imagine them being in real life.

Edit: Also, not a direct work, but Susanna Clarke's new book [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0865TSTWM][Piranesi]] gave me real SCP vibes.
