Norwegian Wood is my all-time second favourite book, and several of his other books rank high in my complete list. I like his prose more than any other author I've read, especially with how he writes emotion; Murakami's at his best for me when he's writing solitude in a character without being melodramatic.

I don't think his books would fall into the purview of rational fiction - not because the characters act in obviously stupid ways or the plot isn't well-structured (they're not), but because his books are rarely more about the plot than the characters and writing itself (The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle comes to mind as sort of an exception, but even there the story shares focus with character). He's also a huge proponent of surrealism and magical realism, so depending on how you reconcile that with rational writing, you may love it or be frustrated with it.

I highly recommend his books. It's hard to view them from an [[/r/rational]] perspective when the focus is heavily strange characters and emotion, but I love rational fiction, generally dislike dumb writing and characters, and I love Murakami's books.
