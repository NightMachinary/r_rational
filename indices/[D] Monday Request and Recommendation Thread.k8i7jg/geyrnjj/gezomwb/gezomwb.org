It's not fictional or necessarily rationalist, and it's not a game with perfect information (because there are dice rolls), but here's a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I&ab_channel=TheBritishMuseum][great video]] about an ancient Babylonian board game for which anthropologists have reconstructed core gameplay and several variations. My buddy and I drew a board on a piece of paper and played with chess pawns, it's pretty fun. Also, Tom Scott is a champ.

EDIT: Ok, rereading your comment this really doesn't fit as it's quite a simple game. The video is so cool that I'm going to leave it here though.
