I'd second the recommendation for Book 1, but recommend against going any further. Book 1 has a tight storyline and clear world building that ties back to the protagonist's struggle with the concept of free will. Book 2 onward loses the time pressure, expands the world building in ways that make the framing device feel pointless, and slows the pace to an absolute crawl, even if you include the text updates.
