This isn't rational, maybe even not rational adjacent, but maybe give Chrysalis a try? The MC reincarnates into an ant monster, and the world building and story can be interesting, even if the characters do have idiot balls at times. The MC always stays an ant monster too, no becoming a human, breaking out of VR reality as a human, or ascending to be a human-esque God/Administrator here.

One of the better novels in the sorely empty monster reincarnation genre. Nothing really scratches the itch quite like Kumo Desu.

Everybody Also Loves Large Chests also features a chest mimic MC, but it can be...a bit explicit. Very explicit. And gore. And a mix of the two. The ending is pretty terrible but it's a decent monster MC novel, if you can disregard these negatives.
