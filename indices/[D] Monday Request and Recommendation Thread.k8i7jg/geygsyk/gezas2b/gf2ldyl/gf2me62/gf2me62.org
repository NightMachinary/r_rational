No I would say that starship troopers is an example of what people who have never seen combat think about military ethos. It is more or less precisely the novel for conservatives who never enrolled in the military or who only ever served on a ship that patrolled safe waters and forms a very skewed image of the war based on that. You're also massively overstating the influence of starship troopers lmao. It's not nearly so important.
