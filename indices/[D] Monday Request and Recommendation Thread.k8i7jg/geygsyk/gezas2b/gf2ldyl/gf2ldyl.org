I agree with your points, but I believe they are all reasons why Starship Troopers is "great". It's the conservative military utopia book. The book encapsulates a huge number of conservative ideologies and themes, coming from someone who is very representative of the people who believe them.

It's also a book of modern military ideals for USA militaries: the themes and ideologies espoused in the book are essentially what our militaries dream of being and what they tell everyone they are. It's the most typified "military ethos" book I've ever read in my life, and I think it's essential reading for trying to understand "military" conservativism. I don't know if it's fiction shaping reality or following it but military leaders and politicians "believe" the themes in Starship Troopers to a large extent. Things are changing within military leadership, probably due to leaders who don't know peace, but I expect this book to continue to dominate how politicians at least view the military for a very long time. Also if we bring back the draft for something other than WW3 this book will be why.
