You seem to be using the terms interchangeably but it should be noted that conservative and right wing do not mean the same thing. (in politics) All conservatives are right wing but not all right wingers are conservatives.

That said, even after the 70's when he stopped swinging and got more staid and curmudgeon-y and hypocritical, I doubt Heinlein would describe himself as conservative. Libertarian, yes. Right wing, maybe. Conservative, never. Heinlein prided himself on being an iconoclast author, someone who made you challenge tightly held, unexamined beliefs; iconclasm is the literal opposite of conservatism.

(I did a paper on Heinlein in university, and I wanted to put that to use)
