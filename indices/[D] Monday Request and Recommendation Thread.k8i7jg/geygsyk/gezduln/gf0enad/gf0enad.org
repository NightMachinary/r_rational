Ayn Rand is only reviled as a countermeasure to her insane cult following that continues to worship her work as the cornerstone of humanity's future to this very day. They have a whole Institute and everything.

I myself fell victim after marathoning her works as a sheltered teenager.

The only way to combat this kind of memetic hazard is to spread awareness.
