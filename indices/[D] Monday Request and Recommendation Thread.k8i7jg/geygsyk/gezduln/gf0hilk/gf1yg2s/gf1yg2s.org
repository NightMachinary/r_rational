Honestly, I usually respond with recs for the whole group...I did get the sense somehow that you wanted rational works, but I don't think those really exist. Most rational stuff is as anti-conservative as you can get, not in the sense of being left-leaning but in the sense of doing radical transhumanist things that would completely destroy all traditional institutions. Practical Guide to Evil might be the most conservative / least transhuman and a conservative work it's not.
