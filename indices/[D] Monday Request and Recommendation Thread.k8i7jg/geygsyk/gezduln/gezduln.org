Interesting question, and obviously there's a lot of conservative literature out there, but I get the sense that the generation or two coming up hasn't been exposed to what was common and recommended when I was in school. Recommendations were a little less partisan awhile back, and I was exposed to a pretty wide variety of conservative writing.

G. K. Chesterton is an amazing writer who thinks almost nothing like I do, and not just politically. I like reading him because his books read like missives from an alien intelligence. I spent a lot of time with The Man Who Was Thursday during the pandemic. If you like altered states of consciousness, trot out your alterer of choice for this read, because it's pretty trippy. The Father Brown stories are more bite-sized but still pretty out there. Chesterton's Fence is a great thought experiment / rational observation that is fundamentally conservative.

If you like modern novels or the genre of literary fiction at all,Michel Houellebecq (French author, you can read in translation) is pretty good. He's critical of the meaninglessness of the modern continental order. A little like Chuck Palahniuk (Fight Club, Choke), but more realistic and better. And French. Try The Elementary Particles.

Ayn Rand is probably a somewhat underrated author, (Bring on the hate!) if only because she's so widely reviled. If you make your way through Atlas Shrugged (yeah, go ahead and skip the big speech at the end), it will kind of stick with you. I really think you don't have to agree with someone to get something from engaging with them, and Rand is, at the very least, an interesting example of getting your worldview over in fiction. The Fountainhead is a decent read, I taught that side-by-side with a pretty readable book by Jack London (a socialist) and my students liked Fountainhead a lot more, she's a certain kind of accessible.

Edmund Burke is the original anti-Jacobin or conservative thinker, and if you're moving into this area intellectually, I'd say Reflections on the Revolution in France is required reading. It's a little dense for the modern reader, but it's just an amazing piece of writing and a well-articulated argument for incremental reform over revolutions. He also defends Representative government, which is certainly relevant to conversations people are having today.

I've been thinking lately that the conservatives aren't conservative anymore, nor are the liberals all that liberal. There's something to be said for these values in their original articulation, and maybe even a conservatism to a defense of the liberal order in the modern context. So I think I'm more receptive to these thinkers than I was five or six years ago as the overton window shifts. Regardless, reading only books by people you more or less agree with, or who think like you, is unwise. A por diet precedes a poor constitution.
