Can second the rec on the novels- I have the first three (don't know about the translation however) and they're pretty good. Heightens the feeling of a protagonist who is very socially aware and chooses his words carefully.

I'd say there's something firmly right-wing modernist about it all. The only hint of traditional religion is in techniques. All the scenery is firmly form-follows-function, with a hint of urban violence lurking in the corner. Its probably why I didn't enjoy the parts after Enrollment, where these things were more in the backgroud, as much- its more or less accepted that if one is to protect those he loves, he has to be a little ruthless, even to the point of thuggishness. At its core it seems to be a story of overachievers who, arming themselves with a fundamentally scientific ethos, maneuver through amoral loyalties- clans, military obedience, the law and its subversion- to attain some measure of ordinary peace against the enemies that constantly threaten their security and their friends.
