Yes, the incest jokes was one of the reasons I hesitate to call it conservative. Though in a sense the fan service is itself pretty conservative- the school uniform is unusually modest for anime, Tatsuya disappoints every harem protagonist ever by literally saying "According to current dress codes, I think your outfit is a little too provocative" to the less modest nurse, and Erika gets as embarassed over barely showing the tops of cleavage in a perfectly normal shirt as a typical harem heroine would get embarassed from being seen naked.
