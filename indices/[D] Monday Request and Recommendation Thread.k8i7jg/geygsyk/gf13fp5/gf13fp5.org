This rec is to answer your request and should not be interpreted as actually endorsing the series:

The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43803-sword-of-truth][Sword of Truth series]] by Terry Goodkind is probably an archetypal conservative fantasy series. It is derivative(Ayn Rand/objectivism), it is preachy, it is heavy handed, it unsubtly addresses present day events(e.g. book 5 from 1999 features a Bill and Hillary Clinton stand-in who go on to doom their nation by not funding defense and subsequently opening its borders to foreign invaders), and lastly, it displays weird sexual hangups and female characters(e.g. literal magic dominatrices who are enslaved to the MC, also the primary female character has an innate magic that kills men if she orgasms).

I read these books as a teenager and it was a major contributing factor for why I went on to become an insufferable, self-righteous twat for a few years. Good times.
