What are some works centered around a distinctly traditionalist conservative mindset?

By that I mean the broad mindset that solidarity with ingroups, loyalty to traditional institutions, transcendental moral order, and political acknowledgment of inherent inequalities between categories of people are all good things.

Mind you, I'm not looking for a wank either in favor or against conservatism. I'm looking for works that explore this conservative mindset in a rational way. It's obviously a topic that'd be extremely difficult for an author to handle neutrally. If it has a noticeable bias, I'd prefer the bias be pro-tradition rather than anti-tradition since I'm already very familiar with literature that's anti-.

It doesn't have to include all the traits I mentioned, but it should be eminently what someone would consider socially right-wing.

It also doesn't have to represent any specific historical or existing ideology/institution or category of traditionalist ideology. It could be Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Buddhist, Indigenous, some mixture of these worldview's traits, or something mostly fictional.

There are non-rational works which I'd consider as having brushed up against what I'm talking about, or at least appealing to subconscious aspects of a traditionalist mindset. Warhammer 40k being an example, even if the franchise has wavered from satirizing the mindset to playing it somewhat straight, depending on whose handling the lore.

The book Starship Troopers is a better example (which WH40K and a lot of sci-fi take heavy influence from), even if the majority of people are only familiar with the movie which only superficially resembles the source material. The Book of the New Sun is an understated example. Of course, none of these works mentioned are rationalist fiction.
