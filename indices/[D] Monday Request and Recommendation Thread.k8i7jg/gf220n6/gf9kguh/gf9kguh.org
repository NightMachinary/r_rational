Library of Heaven's Path is a fun if undeniably bad translated Chinese xanxia novel. The points in favour of it are that the translation is excellent, the Chinese cultural mindset really comes through, and it's occasionally very funny if you enjoy the particular sort of humour. Points against are that it is very long, very slow, pretty shallow, repetitive, and quite sexist (although not as bad as these Chinese novels can get).

I'm not sure if it'll feel to you like the novel is fundamentally about teaching or if it just seems like window dressing, but I would suggest at least checking it out. It drags for a while before picks up again, but the very start might be interesting even if you don't read much further.
