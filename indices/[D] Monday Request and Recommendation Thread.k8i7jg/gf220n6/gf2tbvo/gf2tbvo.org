Humble Life of a Skill Trainer is all about teaching other people skills, to the extent that the main (physical) conflict is usually solved by the protagonist's friends/family while he is focused more on the mysteries behind the system.

The Demon Lord's Lover has a protagonist who is a mentor and teacher to the current generation of heroes, and he falls in love with the current Demon Lord. Really sweet, with some impressively deep worldbuilding.

Great Teacher Onizuka? lol.
