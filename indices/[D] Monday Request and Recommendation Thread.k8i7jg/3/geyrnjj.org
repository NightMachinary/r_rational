Rationalist content about deeply strategic board games, real or fictional?

Ideally games similar to the board game niche that chess/shogi/go/etc. occupy. Abstract board games with perfect information that take place on a polygonal grid, not games of chance but of position. The complexity should be close to or exceeding chess/go.
