Have you read Player of Games by Iain Banks? It's a story set in a futuristic post-scarcity civilization where people don't tend to have jobs, but often just specialised occupations/ hobbies. The protagonist is a dedicated player of games, one of the best among the literal trillions of humans in the culture. It's a great novel, and a decent stepping off point into The Culture series.
