Not too much to go on here, so I'll cast a wide net and hope at least one of them hits what you're looking for.

The Dragonriders of Pern is a decent enough series in the science fiction / fantasy boundary. Dragons do not have human forms, and there's no overarching villain plot or whatever, but the writing is solid and some of the characters are quite good. Also has some solid songs, albeit not quite on tolkiens level imo.

You've almost certainly read the hobbit, but every so often I come across someone who somehow has not and is looking for a story featuring something it describes so I recommend it just to be safe. Again, dragons do not have human forms.

Eragon series starts out fairly solid, although in some ways its rather recognizably fantasy!star wars. Quality declines as the series progresses but I don't regret starting it. Dragons do not have human forms.

Moving into the realm of anime, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is great. Comedy focused anime, but contains dragons, dragons have human forms, quality is very high.

In terms of fanfic, Embers by Vathara is an excellent ATLA fanfic with dragons taking a central role, both Dragons themselves (who have human forms) and the dragon-blooded descendants. It has really amazing worldbuilding and excellent overall writing, but suffers a bit from not being able to fully shed the fact that it began life as a for the want of a nail fic, and thus has to somewhat balance the fact that the stuff prior to the PoD occurred with the fact that some of the actions make less sense when taking into account the AU it's in. This is usually done fine, but there are a few moments when you really notice it.

Harry is a Dragon (And that's Okay) by Saphroneth is an enjoyable Harry Potter fanfic. Saphroneth is an solid author in general, but the fanfic is rather long so ymmv on if that's a plus or a minus!

Next up are works I recommend that contain dragons as a major factor of the setting or plot, but the dragons are not what the story is about, or are only what it is about for some of the plotlines. I'll expand upon them if you're interested in this but this is more of JIC since I suspect the above are more what you're looking for.
