I wouldn't go quite that far, but as descriptors go it's accurate enough. I think it probably would have been better served being significantly shorter, as while I did appreciate it for what it was that didn't translate into continued enthusiasm a couple hundred thousand words into it. I don't regret reading it at all, but I also don't regret not finishing it.
