Looking for cultivation novels similar to cradle. English authors would be preferred since the translations make the reading experience miserable. To add on my request transmigration/reincarnation novels would be preferred since it's always fun to read how would a modern person act in xianxia/wuxia environment. Arrogant young master is dead but it's one of my favorites of this sh genre.
