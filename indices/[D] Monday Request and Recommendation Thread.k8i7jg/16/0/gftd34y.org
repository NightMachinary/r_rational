- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/][/Let Me In 2/]] --- has exploration of vampire psychology. The main character is a vampire's "boyfriend", rather than the vampire herself. Be also mindful that it's not a lighthearted adventure story.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/][/Blood and Chaos/]] --- was a Buffy munchkining self-insert; was pretty good while it lasted (on hiatus now).

- [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/k8i7jg/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gftff28/][/A Journey of Black and Red/]] --- +there was a story about a female protagonist that gets turned into a vampire in chapter 1 or 0. It was a web original and I think was recommended here before, though I can't find the title. Anyway, if was+ mostly rational, even though some developments seemed somewhat convoluted and for-the-sake-of-the-plot. For the part that I've read, the main characters behaved more or less congruent with their personality. Although I think the author's leash on the main character (to prevent her from acting too evil and scare away readers) was showing from time to time. Vampires themselves had some idiosyncratic irrational traits, but vampires remained consistently withing those described setting laws.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WdCvGDpM9k][/Vampires: Biology and Evolution/]] --- a fictional whitepaper / presentation for a human experimentation project.

- (spoilers, somewhat) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][/Blood Crest/]] may have its Harry Potter gradually turning into one. It's a good de- / reconstruction fanfic. Mainly rational, although not without flaws.

- Interview with the Vampire ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_with_the_Vampire][book]] | [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_with_the_Vampire_(film)][film)]] --- features a whole cast of vampire characters, all of them well-developed. The characters behave consistent with their nature, but the story's also not about munchkining; and they are not infallible and make mistakes. So just give it a try and see if it works for you. The adaptation has a decent cast and is well-made, in my opinion.
