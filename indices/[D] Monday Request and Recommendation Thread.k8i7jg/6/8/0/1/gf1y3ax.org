If what you mean is that, if you see flaws in a philosophy, you should tell people about those flaws so that they can see them for themselves, then sure. Pretty much the same as any other thinker. I mean, what philosopher doesn't have an institute (or 10). That said, yeah, that institute seems to have a lot of money to throw around. I think Rand made more sense to people when there was a big bad communist state across the ocean, but, eh, the pendulum could swing the other way again.
