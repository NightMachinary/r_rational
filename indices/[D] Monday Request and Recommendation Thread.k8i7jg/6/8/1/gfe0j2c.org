I would not count Ayn Rand as conservative at all. Her actual ideas and writings completely dismantle Conservative ideas. She was adamantly against tradition, religion, family values, and the military. She was more Libertarian that Libertarians.

The only thing that she had in common with some Conservatives is her economic views.
