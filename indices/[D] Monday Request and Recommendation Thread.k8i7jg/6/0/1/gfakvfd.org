I don't see it as rational (especially as the story progresses), but I enjoyed it a lot. The novels are better than the anime IMO. (Yen Press has them, and the fan translation is good for the first 8 volumes or so.) It's also a weird mix of traditional values and a freethinking mindset. Libertarian, with an aversion to sexual immodesty. (Also starts with mild pre-incest themes that get progressively more pronounced.)
