This recommendation is tentative, because there are problems with seeing it as conservative, but: The first arc (7 episodes) of [[https://www.crunchyroll.com/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school][/The Irregular at Magic High School/]] has significant conservative-modernist overtones. Themes of anti-terrorism, class war and individual envy involving a literally French-named radical organization, and with a competent, non-egalitarian, hard-working, prudent and inspiring main character. The arc works fine as a self-contained story, and it really is one of the most remarkably effective right-wing-ish aesthetics I've seen, though it doesn't continue that way much after. Its also fairly rational in its description and use of the magic systems. Highly recommended, but mostly for the first 7 episodes.

/Crest of the Stars/ had an excellent pro-monarchist aesthetic at times, though I doubt the author is actually pro-monarchy- it just fit the story. Its a slow but sometimes profound meditation on human cruelty.

/Psycho-Pass/'s Kogami sort-of fits, though his choice of politics isn't really clear. In the movie (which was great) he describes the offer to work with an anarcho-communist (?) group as "a fate worse than death." Manly, classically literate and a cop, it sort-of fits, though not clearly.

Russell Kirk, godfather of American conservatism, wrote /Old House of Fear/, a gothic horror. An attorney takes a job for property on a secluded island and finds radical communists using it for some unknown purpose...It was surprisingly well-written for such a largely influential political thinker.
