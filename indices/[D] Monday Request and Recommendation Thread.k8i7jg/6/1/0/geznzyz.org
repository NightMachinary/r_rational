For anyone interested in how conservative ideology has changed over time, I recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reactionary_Mind][The Reactionary Mind]] by Corey Robin. It can be a bit opaque at times as it's a very academic work and assumes some knowledge of political theory and history, but there's a lot of good information and analysis there. As a liberal progressive myself, I picked it up to try to get a sense of the mindset across the aisle. I don't really know if it worked, but I learned a lot.
