thanks for answering:

- Iron Prince: will check it out.
- Dungeon Crawler Carl: dropped a while back but was very fun, should try to pick it up again.
- Seaborn ( Temporary Haitus): I'm caught up but it felt pretty meh to me.
- Elemental Arena (Probably the closest to rational on the list): I think it's also on hiatus.
