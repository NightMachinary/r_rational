[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RSDP4ZT?ref_=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_tkin&binding=kindle_edition][The red lands]] : I found this on RR but it is hosted independently on the author's [[https://onlinewebnovel.com/index-for-new/][site]]. I liked it, Isekai'd orphan in a feudal world where everything is out to get you. I believe the first 150 or so chapters focus on the MC's rise and development of his power station/base/settlement before he goes out to travel the world.

It has some decent progression elements (albeit with some luck involved) with a very archaic power system in the world. It's a guilty pleasure re-read of mine.
