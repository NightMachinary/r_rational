I liked [[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-s-c-plastics-hub][S and C Plastics]], but it is a bunch of separate stories with only a few longer arcs so you may dislike it for being disjoint.

My favorite tightly written story is [[http://www.scpwiki.com/new-age-hub][New Age]]. It has a definitive narrative. Also one of the cooler reality bender portrayals (powerful enough to be a threat, but precisely limited in a rational way). And I hardly ever see it recommended, so I recommend it when I can.

Rats Nests was a good grimdark set of tales, but disjoint.

Apotheosis was decent, some parts disjoint, but it had a solid narrative arc through some of them. I like it for the anti-grim dark... the Foundation might like to portray themselves as the only option for humanities survival, but it seems like there are alternatives of mankind could embrace the weirdness.
