Always happy to see you update :)

So, let me see if I get this right. Flicker starts speedtest at time 0, and speedtest ends at time 1, which is how far away the earth is from the moon. Due to timey wimey, you only get one chance to affect the outcome, because by the time light finishes a round trip speedtest is over. The options available to the seer are either blindly interfere in speedtest, so that you have a say in what the outcome is, or choose from the natural deck of speedtest outcomes. The wanderer, obviously chooses to try and fuck with Flicker, and it works better than she planned because she hit natural limits and it messed with her timing (and also because she was more confident over her control than she had a right to be). Which, I mean, considering she survived dumping ~300000 kg of mass energy is still saying something. If I'm working my intuitions right.

After looking at the orders of magnitude energy wikipedia page, 10^{21-23} joules is right in line with geological events like earthquakes and volcanos, so that provides a good meterstick for how surprisingly effective lithobraking would really be.
