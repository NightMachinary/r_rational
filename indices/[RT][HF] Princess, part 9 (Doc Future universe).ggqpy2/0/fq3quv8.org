Chapter done, finally. Lots of physics drama, and the true reason why Flicker's first trip to the Moon turned out the way it did. Some foreshadowing for Fall and a few puzzles as well. Probably another 2 chapters to finish up Princess, no I'm not good at keeping stories from expanding, why do you ask? Thanks to all my readers for being patient through a period of slow writing. Enjoy. 8-)
