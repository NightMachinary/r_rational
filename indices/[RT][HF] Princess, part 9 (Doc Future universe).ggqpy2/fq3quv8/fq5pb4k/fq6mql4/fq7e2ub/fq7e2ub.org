I think it might have been a little too much on the physics front. In some places it read more like a word problem than a story, and the part about the probability manipulator felt tacked on and under-explained. I enjoyed the potential there and I know that you were constrained by the fact that this is a prequel, but a little more development would have been good.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the chapter and I'm delighted to see you're still working on it. It simply didn't measure up to the awesomeness that was Flicker taking that interdimensional trickster to prison.
