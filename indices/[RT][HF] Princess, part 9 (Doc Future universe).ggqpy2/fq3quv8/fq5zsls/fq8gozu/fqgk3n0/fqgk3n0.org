Glad to see this up! I love this story and setting.

I do have a slight quibble with one point though:

While length contraction will make the moon /act/ like a pancake, delay from lightspeed measurements (which include Flicker's gravitational sense, right?) will have it still /look like/ a sphere (i.e, still cover a disc, though not a uniform density, anymore, IIRC, nor the right distances). There used to be a few animations of this sort of thing on the web, and 3+1-d raytracers out there that would allow you to simulate this sort of thing, but I can't seem to find them at the moment.

EDIT: Ah, I found one. [[https://www.spacetimetravel.org/fussball/fussball.html]]
