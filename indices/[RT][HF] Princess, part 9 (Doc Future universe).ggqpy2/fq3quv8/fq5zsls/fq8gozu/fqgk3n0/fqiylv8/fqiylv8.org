Glad you like it, and thanks for the link. Flicker's ability to see using spacetime curvature is not limited to the speed of light because it already exists in the space she is running through--she doesn't have to wait for it to propagate like she would with light bouncing off objects. Her sense is only subject to lightspeed delays from changes--but the Moon isn't moving or spinning significantly compared to Flicker. It /is/ getting more massive in her frame as she accelerates, but that is proportional to change in gamma rather than gamma, so is relatively small and shouldn't change the shape, just the 'brightness'. That said, I did give up trying to estimate some higher order effects, and it's been decades since my last grad school discussion with a General Relativist. I do remember a ray tracer/simulator that showed how a teapot would look as you zoomed by, but that was years ago, and I was unable to locate it again.

Edit: That 'seeing existing curvature using GR' is one of the main reasons it works better when Flicker is moving, because otherwise she has no direct way to distinguish between curvature caused by a close small mass and a far away large mass other than the tiny bit of parallax from her body. When she moves, they change at different rates. It works similarly to how someone might tilt their head back and forth to try to get a better estimate of the distance of an object partially obscured by tree branches.
