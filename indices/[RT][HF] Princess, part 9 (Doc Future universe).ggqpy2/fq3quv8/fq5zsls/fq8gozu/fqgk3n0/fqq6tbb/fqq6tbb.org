Wait. Why was this her first trip to the Moon? The various warning messages should have clued them in to the fact that she'd get a bunch of weird data just by going to the Moon and back, so why didn't they separate it into two trips?

The first trip would be "jump, circuit the Moon slowly while checking the alarms, jump back" and the second being Speedtest proper.
