Thanks! And pretty close. Speedtest starts at time X, and finishes after time X+1 but before X+2, and may or may not be the 'risky' version. The attacker already knows what happens if they don't interfere: Flicker gets back, exact details unclear. Same if they show up before X-1 or Flicker doesn't choose risky. They know she might--it's possible, because it's what she wants to do. But it's not causally connected to the worldline where the attacker shows up at X until X+1, which is too late to change. And the attacker already needs to use prediction to find X, won't have time to make another one after they show up, and cannot see the conditional future given 'predict X, show up on Earth at X, and attack' if they actually want to do it, because Flicker turned it into a Schr√∂dinger's cat problem by relying on plasma noise to decide whether to choose risky. There are some other nuances, but they are spoilers for the next chapter 8-)
