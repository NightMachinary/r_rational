#+begin_quote
  Each of SCP-536's dials alters the value of one of the fundamental physical constants within the chamber. The dials control, respectively, the speed of light 'c', the gravitational constant 'G', Planck's constant 'h', the fundamental charge 'e', and two other constants represented by the Greek letters lambda and theta (/Memo: After testing, Foundation researchers have concluded that these two constants represent the coupling constants for the weak and strong interactions, respectively. See testing logs SCP-536-‚ñà‚ñà and ‚ñà‚ñà/). All constants are measured on their respective dials in modern SI units, with the exception of the dimensionless lambda and theta.
