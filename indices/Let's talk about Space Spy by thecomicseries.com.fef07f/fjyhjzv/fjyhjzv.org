I read through this when it was mentioned recently (the another thread mentioned in another comment, and plausibly prompting this post as well?):\\
My favourite part is 'The evolution of cultures' (c89), followed by 'Evolution of war' (c407), followed by 'Evolution of fiction Part 1'.

Occasionally in the overall fiction I have a bad-ad-hoc-theory impression (SMBC/BAHfest), as though an idea is latched onto which sounds fun even though implausible to be true. At other times, I found myself thinking 'this is fun to imagine taken to this extreme, but I can imagine reasons that would practically force things to not develop in this direction' (like HPMOR (I think?) eating-others'-young instead of decreasing reproduction). The cases that I know enough to get this impression from make me suspect that the ones I don't get the impression from are produced from the same approach, but with me not knowing enough to get the same impression from them directly.

In my favourite part (mentione above), I find the start implausible, the ending not-obviously-suspect-but-to-be-taken-with-a-large-grain-of-salt-anyway, and the (same) ending /delightful/.
