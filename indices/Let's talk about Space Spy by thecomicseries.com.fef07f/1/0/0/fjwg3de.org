I don't know about /features./ I think an argument can be made that they're not bugs, since the romance and other character stuff is superfluous to the main goal of the comic (exploring all the wacky alien species). But I also don't think a shallow romance is any better than just not having one at all. It's at best neutral and at worst a boring distraction from the fun alien stuff. If I were editing the comic I'd probably cut it entirely and replace it with a few hundred pages about the main guy figuring out which vegetables are safe to eat.
