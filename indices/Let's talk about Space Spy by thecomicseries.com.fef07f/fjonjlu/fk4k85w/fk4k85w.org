I think the bad art quality is good because it lowers expectations and makes it more enjoyable overall.

The same story with better quality art would be let down by other aspects more, the quirkiness wouldn't sell well.

Amazing art could probably work, but I think there's a big section between amazing art and that quality where it would be worse.

Maybe I'm wrong

As for your spoiler tags I thought the subversion was good, and if it was paint by numbers it was just so the subversion was better, in both of your points.
