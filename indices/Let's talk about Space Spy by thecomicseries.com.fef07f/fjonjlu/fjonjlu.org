I mentioned this in another thread--the parts I thought were most fun were the "figuring out which vegetables are safe to eat" bit and the punchline of the "alien countercultures" page. The part where the good guys are trying to get the backlicker to say specific words was also pretty funny. Overall the strong points of the comic are the humor and creative worldbuilding.

I think the main things that could be improved (besides the art) are that the dialogue is stilted, most of the characters don't really have distinct "voices," and their personalities and motivations are pretty shallow. The love triangle/romance arc in particular was really paint-by-numbers except for the ending, and the plot thread about the real spy ended anticlimactically. For the most part the characters feel like little more than vehicles to introduce the next wacky alien design. And maybe that's okay, since the wacky alien designs are kind of the point.

There's an interesting blend of rationality and irrationality in that the comic goes into depth about the evopsych reasons behind the weird alien behaviors (which is the kind of intense dissection that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] readers tend to enjoy), but the fact that the aliens behave so perfectly consistently with their species' "backstories" is itself kind of irrational. Like, humans have our own baked-in evolutionary impulses, but a "rational" human wouldn't adhere to them to the extent the various aliens do, especially when it comes to the gender relations stuff. It often feels like each alien species' respective analogue of a human "redpiller" is writing their own chapter. This is probably because the alien cultures had to be at least somewhat simplified or each planet would have had to be its own entire comic.
