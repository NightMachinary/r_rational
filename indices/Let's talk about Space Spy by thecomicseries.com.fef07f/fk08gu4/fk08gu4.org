I'm not sure it's rat-fic at all. I'm only halfway through it, and it's certainly an entertaining parody of all things evopsy (like how it's used post-facto to justify one thing and also its opposite), but it focuses on stupid characters doing stupid things for what they think are good reasons because of cultural dissonance, for the most part, and that's not very rational nor rationalist.
