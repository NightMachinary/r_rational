  The love triangle/romance arc in particular was really paint-by-numbers except for the ending, and the plot thread about the real spy ended anticlimactically.

I'm pretty sure these were features, rather than bugs.

As far as the redpiller stuff, I sort of took it as a sort of universal satire-- it satirizes alien cultures in the same way it satirizes human cultures, and in doing so meta-satirizes human culture because all satire and all sci-fi are written by humans, so our reactions to the "alien" cultures are really just reactions to human cultures in disguise.
