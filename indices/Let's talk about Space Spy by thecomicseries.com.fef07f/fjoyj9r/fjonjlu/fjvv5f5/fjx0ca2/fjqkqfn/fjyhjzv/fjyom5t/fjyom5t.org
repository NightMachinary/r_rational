It is very much not hard sci-fi. It takes the pop version of evolutionary psychology and evolution in general (especially as it relates to sex and gender) and pushes it up to eleven. It also has a serious and straight forward air when it comes to no viewpoint exposition that could make an uninformed person actually believe that any of that stuff is in any way plausible. Whoever reads this should take anything said in it as interesting commentary on society using not quite proven scientific theories as style and flavor.
