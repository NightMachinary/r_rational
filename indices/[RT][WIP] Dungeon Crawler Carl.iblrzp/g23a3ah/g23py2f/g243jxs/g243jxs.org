I found that pretty believable. For months after my father died I found myself getting angry at small things for no particular reason. Carl just lost literally everyone he's ever known aside from his cat and is being forced to participate in a snuff-film reality TV show. The impressive part is the fact that he's holding it together as well as he is.
