I'm wondering if the angst is entirely his own. He kinda goes nuts for a little bit when Zev first shows up and doesn't understand where the extreme anger is coming from. I took that as there being some unknown agent or something in the environment having done something to him.

Maybe a suppression/amplification to the hidden Wisdom stat whenever he's visited by an admin or brought on a show?
