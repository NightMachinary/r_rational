You're right, I suppose, but the other choices /are/ relevant because each player has a unique build that could have utilized them. So while it's impossible for the author to list off that information, Carl and Donut both have the insight that the in-story list provided while the readers do not.

And yeah, part of the general lack of information is due to Carl / Donut's lack of information, but the game mechanics specifically could be better fleshed out, if the author were aiming for [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I mean, there was no good reason for the list to be thousands long. It could have been 3 long and provided the same context, but without Carl and Donut getting massive amounts of background information that we as readers were left out of.

It just strikes me as a deus ex in the chamber at best, anti-rational worldbuilding at worst.
