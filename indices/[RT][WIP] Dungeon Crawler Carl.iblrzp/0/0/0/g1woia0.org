Hm...not sure I agree. For example (some of these may reference Patreon chapters, I'm not sure):

1. They discover that bosses have weaknesses and they plan accordingly, such as using the ramp and spike strips against the Ball of Swine.
2. Carl figures out out to give Katia a literal ton of mass to work with despite there not being any equipment with anything like that amount
3. They build barriers to block off the doors of the trains in order to funnel their enemies into a killbox.
4. They come up with a specific playbook of combat tactics instead of always going ad hoc
5. Careful planning during race and class selection.
6. Carl's handling of Grimaldi and meta-handling of the producers of /Vengeance of the Daughter/

It takes a while for the rules of the dungeon to be completely revealed, but I think Carl and Donut work with those rules in a sensible fashion once they know about them.
