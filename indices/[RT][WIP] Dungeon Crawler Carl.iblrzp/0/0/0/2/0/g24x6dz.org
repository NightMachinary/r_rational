I know, right? When he got the early achievement for having 10 tons of stuff in his inventory I knew that there were wonderful shenanigans in the future.

  Thanks for those points. Let me be clear - I don't want to gate-keep, but I do want to discuss rational storytelling.

Agreed. But, of course, there's the rub...what exactly do we mean by that? DCC is definitely not rational/ist/ because it's not trying to teach the science of psychology of logical thinking, math, etc. Is it ration/al/? Let's run the list:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

This one is met. Donut is a child who became sapient shortly after entering the dungeon after a lifetime of being a show cat. As a result, she has problems consistent with that -- impetuousness, etc -- but I think it's fair to say she's intelligent. Carl is an everyman (i.e. not a MENSA member etc) but he is definitely smart about how he approaches problems in the dungeon.

- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

This one is met. They both want to survive the dungeon. Additionally, Donut wants popularity and enjoys having control of her surroundings for the first time. Ergo, she negotiates with shopkeepers, plays to the crowd on the TV shows, etc. Carl wants to save the other humans so he puts himself at great risk to help the Meadow Lark group, the staff and residents of a retirement home.

  Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

The story is ongoing but the individual encounters involve intelligent solutions. The ramp / bunker / spike strips used to kill the Ball O' Swine being a prime example.

- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

There are clear rules. The rules expand as new encounters happen and new elements are added, but that's no different from any other novel. Authors typically don't start with a giant infodump on page 1 that says "Here are the precise rules of every spell that will be used in this story." The universe looks like it does for very sensible reasons based on interstellar politics and economics.

The one part of the worldbuilding that could be questioned is "Why is Borant mining a populated planet instead of the asteroid belt?" That isn't touched on but there are plenty of standard responses:

- Kill off young civilizations before they become threats
- In a galactic society containing quintillions (sextillions? more?) of intelligent beings, some of them are going to be cruel. Modern Europe and America still has a small number of people who enjoy dog fighting, so why shouldn't the future galaxy?
- You get the same amount of minerals either way but if you do the planet thing then you also make a gazillion space bucks off the reality show. If you don't care about non-galactic-citizen species then why not?
- etc
