  I'm going to juke point away from Carl to say that there is a big difference between small / foreshadowed rule expositions and throwing new rules in to immediately affect the plot in a major way.

Is there an example of such a thing in DCC? Chapter 4 is the setting exposition chapter. One of th every first things we're told is that it's a reality show run by an AI and that there will be loot, some of which may come from viewers who really like you. Pretty much everything meta-gamey falls out from that. Specific spells are introduced as Carl and Donut level up; their mechanics are explained up front and then remain constant thereafter.

The closest thing I can think of is on the third floor where it's revealed that the AI may have 'fudged a roll' in Carl/Donut's favor but that was set up in advance when Carl was called the AI's bitch and told that it often happens that the AI for a given season will have a 'pet' Crawler that it both rewards and torments above the norm.
