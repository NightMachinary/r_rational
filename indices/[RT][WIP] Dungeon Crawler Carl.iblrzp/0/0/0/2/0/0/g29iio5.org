I love your points here and I for one would be happy to see Carl in this sub more, despite being on the fence about giving the story a Rational genre tag.

  There are clear rules. The rules expand as new encounters happen and new elements are added, but that's no different from any other novel. Authors typically don't start with a giant infodump on page 1 that says "Here are the precise rules of every spell that will be used in this story."

I'm going to juke point away from Carl to say that there is a *big* difference between small / foreshadowed rule expositions and throwing new rules in to immediately affect the plot in a major way.

WtC: Exclusions Zones? Foreshadowed from like the first chapter. Masterful use of an established rule to cause major meta shenanigans later on.

PGtE: Pulling a sword out of a stone to get a free resurrection? Literally what reason would anyone have to believe this to be a thing prior to it happening?
