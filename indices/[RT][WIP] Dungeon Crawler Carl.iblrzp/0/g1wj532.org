Earth is destroyed! (Well, all the buildings and everyone who is inside them.)

Aliens are going to strip-mine the Earth, but first they're going to run the 13 million surviving humans through a reality TV show consisting of a dungeon crawl. Carl is unfortunate to go in with no shoes, no pants (he does have boxers -- it's not that kind of dungeon!), and a cat.

There's a nice mix of understated humor, action, and character development. This is currently my favorite story on the internet, ranking above Worth the Candle.
