Disrecommend. It's not a ratfic - as a bigger world revealed it's becoming clear it's inconsistent . The story becoming progressively worse later. Beginning is good and fun but second half is mostly angst for angst sake, moralizing and blaming evil galactic society for conspiring against protagonist.
