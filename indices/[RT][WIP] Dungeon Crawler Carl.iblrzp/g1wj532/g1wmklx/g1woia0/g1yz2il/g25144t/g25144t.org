True, but that's easily justifiable by the anthropic principle. The hundreds of thousands of other Crawlers still alive simply aren't the ones who get stories told about them, and obviously for each of the top ten there was going to be /something/ special that put them there.

It would have been possible to tell an interesting story about how Lucia Mar used her dogs and her viciousness to claw her way to the top, but the story would have had much less humour, much less problem solving, and even more gore than it does. It certainly would have been interesting to tell a story from Hekla's point of view, leading the Daughters, coping with her split from her husband, etc, and seeing how she was loaded up with magical gear to make her a powerful shield maiden. But I'm fine with getting a story about the guy who's running on clever tricks, shiny feet, and a hyperactive talking cat.
