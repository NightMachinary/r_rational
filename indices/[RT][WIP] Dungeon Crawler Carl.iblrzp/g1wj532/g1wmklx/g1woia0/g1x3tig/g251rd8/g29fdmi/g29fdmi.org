Because it's the equivalent of God poking your eyes out for looking at the sun. God exists. Your eyes exist. Poking happens. You can deus ex a reason that the poking won't happen, or use luck as a justification, maybe God's having an off day, but there's a lack of rationality applied there unless we get into the whys and the hows.

Backlogic in this case would be knowing more about the "interests behind them" and their rationale behind acting, so they could be predicted or predictions could be discussed intelligently by readers. We got a bit of that for Grimaldi iirc, but not enough in my opinion for Carl to do what Carl did and have any significant justification beyond wind in the plot sails.

I'm not going to argue that Carl did not act intelligently in this choice. I *am* arguing that Carl's choices here were not something that we as readers were given enough insight into to be able to discuss rationally beyond 'It worked'.

A one-path-forward storyline is not rational by definition, just because there is only one path forward and the main character follows it.

There were other options for Carl that we could not rationally speculate on because we do not have enough information to do so.
