The "too many choices to list" seemed actually really realistic to me, very indicative of the real world. With only 8 days to choose, literally going through thousands of choices would waste several days. That may not be enjoyable for the optimizer in us, but it's certainly realistic. Sometimes the optimal choice is to take advice and not get bogged down in details.

The deus was a little far fetched, but didn't annoy me because we know so little of the world or system anyways. Who knows how rare that actually is.
