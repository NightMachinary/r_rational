No it has not been a problem, to my knowledge, in DCC. It is a problem elsewhere, and could be a problem here if the author drops the ball. I juke'd it away from Carl there for a moment: It is occurring to me that too much of Rational as a genre and (ungenre'd) intelligent writing are identical. DCC is intelligently written. The world follows rational(enough) tenets. But the story itself is not disposed to rational discussion and therefore doesn't get the Rational genre tag for me.

I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that if the author doesn't give the readers a runway-volume of information to discuss their work in a rational way, then it does not deserve a Rational genre tag.

And to consolidate posts, because I was a twit and posted in a way that opened up a few threads between us, Carl's story can't be placed in the Rational genre in my mind because its story lacks that runway. Almost by definition, because it's a fast paced death game with massive structural changes each 'floor' the characters descend.

DCC moves by the introduction of *new* reader-unknown content vastly more so than the analysis of *old* reader-known content. That /skew/ in the storytelling is what I'm hung up on. The Rational genre tag, in my mind, requires a skew towards analysis of reader-known content over new content, or at least a greater volume of analysis. And DCC is a little too far in the story for me to believe that this will change.

There are other facets of the Rational genre, I'm not going to go nuts and claim this is the end all and be all, but explaining this one facet is why I bothered to write out this post.
