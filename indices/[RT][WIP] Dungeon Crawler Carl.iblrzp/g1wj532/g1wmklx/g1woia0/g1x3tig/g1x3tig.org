I love the story, but it's one of those things that only pushes rationality because the author is withholding information. Since we don't know the game mechanics, we can't rationally discuss the game.

But I've said similar things about PGtE and that does well here.

2.The author Deus'd this in with the book won from a roulette carousel; +the only thought on Carl's part was following the book's instructions to disguise the idea as his own+ Edit: I misremembered. Carl was clever here, but the book is anti-rational shenanigans.

5.In-story issue here, there were too many choices for the author to list. We got to see like 5 classes, and the races were essentially chosen arbitrarily after blowing the rest off as not worth discussing.

6.This is an interesting point, mainly because there was only communication from Carl. He could have been correct in not seizing victory, but he could have killed Grimaldi. Logically, he could have killed Grimaldi, and should have for the greater comparative rewards. He didn't, because he thought that he would somehow be screwed out of his victory because 'That's what happens'. And I'd argue that it makes sense, but only in the context of an already illogical world: I.E. A world where looking at the sun blinds you, because God pokes out your eyes, not because of bright sunlight. Everyone knows God's gonna poke your eyes out if you look at the sun, or the gameshow is going to screw you over, but it doesn't really have good backlogic.
