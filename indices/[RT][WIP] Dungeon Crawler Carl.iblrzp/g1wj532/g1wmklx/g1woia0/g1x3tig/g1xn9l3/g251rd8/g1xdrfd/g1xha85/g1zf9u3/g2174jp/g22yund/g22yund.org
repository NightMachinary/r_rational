Shrug. My bar for what I consider rational is pretty low. As long as the setting is self-consistent, the implications of how magic/technology would affect society are followed through on, problem solving tools aren't conveniently forgotten about, the plot has no holes, the characters' behavior follows understandable motivations and the central characters (protagonists, companions, antagonists) are decently intelligent it works for me.
