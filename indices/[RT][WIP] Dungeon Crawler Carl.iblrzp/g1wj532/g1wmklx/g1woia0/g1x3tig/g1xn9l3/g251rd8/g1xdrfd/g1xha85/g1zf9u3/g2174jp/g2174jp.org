I'd argue that if the author doesn't tell the readers the rules (or provide enough mechanical information), then the story can't be discussed rationally and therefore isn't rational in practice.

But I recognize this as an actual argument I have with this sub. Like I said in my previous comment, PGtE doesn't qualify as ratfic in my mind. Pretty much for this exact reason: Cat just randomly recognizes 'rules' as existing, and uses those rules to her advantage, when the readers have no reason to believe those rules are in place or exist prior to her actions.
