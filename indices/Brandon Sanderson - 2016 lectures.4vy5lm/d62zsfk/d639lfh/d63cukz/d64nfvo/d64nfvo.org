They were much less well written. Far less revisions, weaker plots. It's hardly too unexpected. Alloy of Law, the book where the broken windows theory came in, was written while taking a break from Memory of Light within a four month period, and he rushed its release date so he could make sure to release something in 2011 so it didn't go through his usual revision schedules, and it was a thriller, and he wrote two other books at the same time.

I remember reading somewhere that he did research with a gun professional to ensure accuracy. So, the guns and ammo stuff is probably accurate and well written. That's the sort of tone the book has. He probably didn't do much to research sociology.
