I'll be completely honest: I have listened to very little of his specific advice on writing. It could be that he's full of all kinds of useful wisdom that just doesn't show up in his own work. I poured about sixty hours of my life into the five-ish books of his that I read, and regretted it, and made the decision not to throw good time after bad, but it's indeed possible that the lectures themselves are good. I'm taking a risk, making a gamble, by assuming that [amateurish writing] --> [unhelpful advice], and that could be the wrong call.

For instance, I'm personally pretty bad at certain kinds of gymnastics which I can teach and explain quite well, and this might be an analogous situation.

What would you say are a couple of his more useful and interesting points? The only one I know of is his bit about how magic as a solution to the character's problems is effective only to the degree that the magic has been clearly defined and explained prior.
