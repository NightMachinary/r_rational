And I think you're willfully interpreting me in the worst possible light, when there is a spectrum of explanations that fit the facts equally well.

Do you honestly think there's /no/ value in responding to someone's "here's an author's advice on writing" with a statement of "don't listen to that author's advice; they're not good at writing!"? Like, *maybe I should've done it as a top-level response to the thread, instead of as a counterpoint to booljayj in particular*? But I mean, this subreddit is /about/ how to write, in the end. I post my criticisms of Sanderson because I think steering readers and writers away from his works is an actual instrumental good.

Writers who are superior to Brandon Sanderson by at least a factor of two in their creation of solid plots and realistic characters who behave in believable ways that less frequently break the characteristics of rational fiction on the sidebar:

- Orson Scott Card (who has loads of advice on how to write, too)
- Gary Paulsen
- John Irving
- Frank Herbert
- Robert Jordan
- George R.R. Martin
- George Orwell
- Dan Vyleta
- Catherine Ryan Hyde
- Bryce Courtenay
- Lois Lowry
- Michael Crichton
- Timothy Zahn
- Arthur C. Clarke
- Chuck Palahniuk (before he went insane)
- Alan Moore
- Robert Kirkman
- Michael Dante diMartino
- Robert Graves
- William Golding
- Sam Shepard

... those are off the top of my head. If people are interested in further recommendations, I'll happily provide.
