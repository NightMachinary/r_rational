The post I linked to goes:

"Sanderson's a Bad Writer."

"Clarify what you mean by that?"

"Sure. [several paragraphs of clarification]"

I /didn't/ say he was a bad author and then not follow up. There was a /ton/ of information and context there, plainly visible. Like, I'm not sure how to react to my current model of the situation, which is that all of this criticism from you came about because you didn't glance three lines down the page? If I'm understanding you correctly, I don't think I can say "this is my fault; I did it wrong."
