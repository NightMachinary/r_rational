Then do that instead. Don't say " Brandon is a bad author" with nothing to follow up with that. Suggest something better. The way you came off initially makes you sound like a salty standard Fanboy hater. If you're insisting it's more than that then give people more information and more context than a link to a post from a month ago.

The post you linked to individually at the start was merely an expression of your opinion that Brandon Sanderson is a bad writer.
