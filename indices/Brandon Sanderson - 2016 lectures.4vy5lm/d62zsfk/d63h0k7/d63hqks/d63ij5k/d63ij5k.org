Let me backtrack a little and clarify my point. My point was that you don't like Brandon so much that you're posting it even when the individual themselves didn't actually discuss Brandon's quality.

Which has all the Hallmarks of the classic Fanboy hate. If you ever feel inclined in the future 2 post about Brandon's qualities how about instead of calling Brandon a bad writer you suggest writers you think are superior outside of yourself.

Side note I do enjoy your Animorphs series
