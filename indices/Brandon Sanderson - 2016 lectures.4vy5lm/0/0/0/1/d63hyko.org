I mean, booljayj didn't ask me /anything,/ to be fair. I jumped in with an unsolicited opinion, which is why I qualified by saying "I upvoted you, too" ... that was me signaling that I knew I was butting in and wasn't trying to start fights or nuthin'. In general, I like there to exist a balance of opinion, so that third parties can weigh both sides, and me being on one side of this issue doesn't mean I want the other side unheard or underweighted. It's just my personal feeling that junior writers looking to improve their craft should very much avoid trying to emulate Sanderson and not lend any credence to his musings on the concept of writing.

Also, I don't think the basis of my criticisms of Sanderson's writing is really an "opinion" domain. Like, opinions are for matters of taste, but the /source/ of my opinion is a question of fact, about which you're making predictions/suppositions. In fact, I don't hate the author, and based on my exposure to ~5 books that he's written, am simply stating /my/ claim that it's objectively low-quality on basically any metric that a reader, writer, critic, or teacher might offer. If you're interested in proving me wrong in the court of public opinion, then name a metric and start posting quotes. I'd be happy to respond on the level of, y'know, /actually discussing the writing/ instead of on the level of casting vague aspersions.
