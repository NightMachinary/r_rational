Okay if that's your point why don't you premise that at the first post and your response to someone recommending his advice? Your initial post just seemed like you hated Brandon and you were pointing that out not that you're trying to steer people away from him.

Alright well since we're not going to delete this chain of comments and I still disagree with your premise why don't we take it somewhere different. Do you have anything specific about his advice or lectures that you think is bad? I've listened to quite a few of his lectures and his advice I think is well thought through and gives a good starting point for any rational writer.
