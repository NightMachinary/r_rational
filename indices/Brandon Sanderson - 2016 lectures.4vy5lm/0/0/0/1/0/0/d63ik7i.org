I note that you're quite ... strident? ... about this. Like, I seem to have triggered you in some way, and I regret that (though not enough to back off of what I think is a true point, or to refrain from defending myself).

I disagree with your claim, though, which seems to cash out to "unsolicited opinions are bad and unwelcome here." Like, I guess if you want reddit threads to be echo chambers, where no one is allowed to disagree with OP? Or if you want them to be relentlessly topic-focused and monotone, so that each thread answers one and exactly one question?

As far as "looking like a jerk," well---that's not the same thing as /being/ a jerk. Basically, I think the crime I'm guilty of here boils down to "having a contrary or unpopular opinion." I mean, your reaction to me at least /feels/ like I've personally offended you, or something. You're not reacting with the sort of dispassionate irritation that I'd imagine coming from, say, a moderator who thinks I'm unproductively off-topic.

And given that I posted what amounts to a one-word /link/ to a separate thread, clearly labeled as an OPINION, I think I went about chiming in fairly innocuously, until you started grumping back. Wasn't a derailment of anything raymestalez was trying to do, and seemed like a pretty low-cost, low-hostility way to weigh in with the opposite opinion. And I /do/ think that getting that opposite opinion into the mix is extremely important---from my perspective, at least, there's a real danger of junior writers attempting to improve their craft by trying to learn from Brandon Sanderson, and ending up mediocre (or worse) as a result.

As a final note, *the write-up I linked to /is/ about rationality---*explicitly.** The whole point of the spoiler-tagged Elantris rant is that /reality doesn't work like that./ Just look in the rules for this subreddit. Rule number one is "Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it,'" and in the cited example, 'the plot required' that an entire culture collectively hold an idiot ball for like a hundred years so that his Mary Sue character could get a cool moment. That criticism is extremely germane to discussions of rationality in fiction.

I note that /now/ this /has/ grown to the point of being a large distraction from the original point of the thread. If you'd prefer to continue in private messages rather than here, I'm down.
