I think if you went and listened to a lecture or two, you would find him being agreeable to the standard tenets of rational writing. Since you asked here's a few of the ones that stuck out to me- his suggestions on character creations and writing methods. Brandon takes the architect approach where he designs everything and in the lecture he discusses that. From what I understand though is that he does a top-down approach where he says this is where I want the story to go now how do I create characters and the world that takes the characters there? He also discusses grr Martin's writing style which is more organic and more of a growing system which lends itself two non-rational writing.

Another point that he made that was particular rational is that in the world the character needs to do their thing because that's what they do. Like sure have the main character go on the quest and save the world but make sure that that fits in the character that they're doing that because that's who the character is and that's what they want to do.

His discussions on character creation are really good though and he discusses other writing styles which is from bottom-up perspective where you create your cast of characters and you put them in situations and you see how they inside their personalities would work through that. If there are any lectures you might want to check out, i suggest checking out the character creation ones as that's what I've watched most recently and can vouch for its quality.

If you watch any of the lectures and find any problems with the rationality of any writing produced with those methods and advice let me know.
