I don't care to prove you wrong as I don't enjoy Brandon's books personally either but I don't think he's objectively bad either. It's just not worth discussing to me. Even with what you said posting your opinion still doesn't fit this context and doesn't change that fact. You shouldn't be posting it because it's not relevant. I don't care whether or not you like to share your opinion and keep balanced views. When you share your opinion like this in such an unsolicited manner which doesn't fit the context it makes you look like a jerk. And that's what I'm saying. It's not a discussion of Brandon's quality it's the fact that you feel so inclined in your hatred of his writing to post it whenever it's not relevant.

If your point was to discuss Brandon's rationality that's different and requires a different write up than the one you linked to.

Additionally if your point was to actually spread more of your opinion perhaps a different top-level post would have been better than replying to someone asking about Brandon's rationality as a writer. Which I haven't seen anything to make me question significantly his rational writing.

Edit I made a lot of edits. Also I'm using speech to text and not at my PC so my grammar may be off sorry.
