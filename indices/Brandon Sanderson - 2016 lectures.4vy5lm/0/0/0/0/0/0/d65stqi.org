I can comprehend your points. You read the book a long time ago and don't or didn't want to remember all the details but your central argument is strong, I didn't address all of your points to your satisfaction.

I disagree with you though and think you're wrong. It looks a lot more like you treat arguments as replaceable soldiers than that you have a strong central point. You challenging me to some sort of public duel or debate to be voted on likewise didn't seem like a reasonable causal process.
