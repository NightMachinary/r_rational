Yes, I note he repeats a 'fact' which we discussed, he agreed was wrong, a century of time when people were doing nothing. His ideals of why the story are irrational are fact insensitive. What actually happened in the books has minimal impact on his opinions.

That's obviously a bit awkward for a discussion on foreshadowing and one on how engrossing the world is. That's a very fact dependent discussion.

I definitely like how Brandon's books tend to tie the magic system into the world and science and the weather and people. There's very strong visual imagery in all of that. That would be something I'd enjoy seeing more in worlds, a pervasive impact of magic on technology, nature, and culture. It's a fairly standard thing for magic to have it be a rare thing that a few experts use which is sad for most of the populace.
