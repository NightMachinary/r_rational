That's a fair point, but I think that if he came up with a different description it would be obvious what he was referring to (let's make one up: Smashed gaslights) It would be even more jarring because you know exactly what he is referring to (broken windows) while making a rather pointless change in words. So in reality you are totally correct that a different society would be VERY unlikely to come up with that term, but changing it for the sake of changing it would be even more immersion breaking for me.
