Haven't read enough Vinge. Gaiman alternates between rational and deliberately irrational characters/plots, so a blanket recommendation would be bad in this context. Only Kipling I've read is jungle-related, and there was definitely a swarm of idiot balls rolling around.

Note that this is /specifically/ a list of writers who create /rational characters and plots,/ or at least do so 2x better than Sanderson. I'd agree with you in a heartbeat if you wanted to put those guys on a list of better writers generally, but this is a narrower subset.
