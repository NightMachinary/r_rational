I'm not sure what you mean by "irrational" or "hate" in your comment here. My criticism of Sanderson's writing is based entirely on its content and style and quality, all things I can cite in specific (and did, in the post quoted). And I don't hate the person himself, nor do I actually hate the writing so much as groan over people going rah rah rah when I think their lives would be improved by exposure to better authors (of which there are so, so, so very many).

Essentially, my "hate" of "Brandon" (since you're on a first-name basis, I guess?) boils down to a very slight moral outrage that someone is getting far more love and exposure and acclaim than their work deserves. It's the exact same grumps I have for how much money Zack Snyder made with Batman V Superman.
