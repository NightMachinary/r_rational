  So I would really only back if I know that it's not going to end as depressingly as last time.

Heh. That's fair. In retrospect I'm actually quite surprised at how those stories came out...I don't generally write downer endings, so for two of them to happen was really a black swan. Although, it's debatable whether Pay Attention was a downer ending -- I deliberately left it ambiguous. So, call it 1.5 downer endings.
