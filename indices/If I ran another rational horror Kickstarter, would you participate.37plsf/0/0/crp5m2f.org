Aha. Thanks for letting me know. In case it matters, Baby Blues was psychological horror, not a gore fest. Very little happened on camera that was objectionable, it was what you figures out about the setting.

That said, would you pitch in on something else? Perhaps a rational superhero story? If you read either of the Change Storms books, that should give you an idea what I'm talking about. If you join my [[http://bit.do/dks-list][mailing list]] there's a link to the latest one, free download. It should have come down a couple days ago but hasn't yet, so grab it if you want it. (It's cool to grab it whether or not you would Kickstart me.)
