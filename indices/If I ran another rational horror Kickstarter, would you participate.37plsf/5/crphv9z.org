I'm definitely willing to back you again (up to $20) since you delivered in terms of quality plotting and writing with 'Baby Blues'.

Don't forget to post an update to your past campaign to let your past backers know if they would like to back you again. Don't worry about feeling as if you are pestering them. Most of them backed you the first time because they thought you had potential and it sounds like you more than delivered on that front.

I recommend reading this [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1pm2c6/some_resources_for_starting_your_own_kickstarter/][great post]] which has some handy links for further advice on how to best run a Kickstarter even if you already have experience under your belt.
