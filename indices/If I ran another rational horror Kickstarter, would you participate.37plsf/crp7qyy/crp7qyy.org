I contributed last time and would again. Baby Blues was definitely my favorite story -- I appreciated that the characters (and even society) acted rationally and still inexorably ended up in a dystopia. Pay Attention had a rational monster, but it was very isolated and felt realistically defeatable with a bit more individual effort: hence, not as "horrific".
