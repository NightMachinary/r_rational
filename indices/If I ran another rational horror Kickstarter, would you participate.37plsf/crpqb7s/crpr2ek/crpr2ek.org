Yes. Three ways:

1. [[http://bit.do/books-dks][Buy them on Amazon, $2.99 each]]
2. [[http://bit.do/ku-free-trial][Sign up for the Kindle Unlimited program]] and borrow them. KU is $10/month and works like a library -- you borrow as many books as you want, read them, return them, get more. All of mine are in KU.
3. [[http://bit.do/dks-list][Join my mailing list.]] Just about everything I write goes on Amazon in the KU program, but /before/ it goes there I send it the mailing list as a limited-time free download.\\

Right now Baby Blues is only available on Amazon, but the second book in the Change Storms series (rational superhero deconstruction) is available to list members. It will go away soon though--probably tomorrow--so grab it now.

EDIT: The stories for the Kickstarter will /not/ go to the list. It's not fair to ask one group to fund them and then give them away for free to another group.
