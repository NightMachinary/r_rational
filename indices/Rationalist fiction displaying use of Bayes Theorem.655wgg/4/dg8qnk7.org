I seem to recall datapacrat having a fic with heavy usage of bayes theorem. I'm having a bit of trouble navigating his website, but I remember it was about an SI being revived from cryostasis into a female bunny body, and then exploring the exceptionally weird world that the singularity (and subsequent apocalypse) caused.

Can I have some help finding it [[/u/datapacrat]]?

edit: it's the one you were posting on SB that eventually got removed by the mods.
