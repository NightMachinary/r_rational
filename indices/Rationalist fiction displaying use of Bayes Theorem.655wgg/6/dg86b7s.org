Seems like linking this website here would be relevant:

  #+begin_quote
    Of the many works of fiction that are published, very few involve mathematics or mathematicians. However, people who like mathematics (or are mathematicians ourselves) may especially enjoy reading those few that do. [..] mathematicians should be interested in these works of "mathematical fiction" even if we do not enjoy them because they both affect and reflect the non-mathematician's view of this subject.

    Therefore, the list at this site is collected both for your pleasure and professional interest. If you happen to know of any other examples, please let me know. [..]

    Notes: Since it is not especially significant to the purposes of this list, I am not differentiating between fiction which refers to actual mathematics and literature in which the mathematics itself is fictional. [..]
