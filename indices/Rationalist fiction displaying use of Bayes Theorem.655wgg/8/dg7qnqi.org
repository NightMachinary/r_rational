generally you can't rely exclusively on bayes theorem to be rational any more than you can predict the stock market through the movements of quarks. that being said, just knowing that your thoughts and decisions need to obey the math to be rational helps. there are a bunch of skills involved, it's not as simple as reciting the formal axiom and leaving it at that.
