I mean that you're probably not going to find any rat fics where characters explicitly rely on bayes theorem all that much. You might find examples where a character explicitly studied the math, but I can't think of any examples besides HPMOR. Bayes theorem is intractable on most real world problems and I would say most realistic fictional world problems too. Humans don't have the time or brain power to rely on bayes for everything. Oftentimes just knowing that the rational characters' thinking and decision making has to obey the math (at least when they are being rational) helps a lot even when the characters themselves aren't explicitly using bayes theorem.

Tldr: it's really hard to find examples of bayes theorem being explicitly invoked and applied by characters in rational fic for the above reasons.

That being said if you want recommendations that your instructor might like...

If he's into sci-fi I would recommend reading "Three Worlds Collide" first. It's a greatly underappreciated masterpiece, and it is much shorter than HPMOR and by the same author. Plus its better than HPMOR on average (though HPMOR is better at its best) Also "the Vulcan your Vulcan Would Sound Like if he Wasn't Made of Straw". Don't remember the author for that one.

HPMOR is quite a time commitment and the protagonist is kinda a jerk in the beginning (plus the first four chapters aren't quite as well written as the rest) so some people might find it a bit off-putting. And HPMOR is pretty heavy reading too.

If he's still interested after reading TWC, he's probably going to like HPMOR too. Probably should use daystar's improved version of the first four chapters though for the best reading experience. TBH I think EY should have gotten daystar's permission to replace his original version of the first four chapters with daystar's.
