If you want rationalist fiction where the protagonist actually /uses/ bayes theorem regularly, then I think you're out of luck. HPMOR is the only one I know which actually uses the phrase with some regularity, and if Harry Potter actually used the formula more often basically the entire plot could be avoided.
