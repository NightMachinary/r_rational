Yes. One of the types has telekinesis replacing hands. The second has highly dexterous wings that can substitute for thands. The third has malleable depressions in the "hooves" that are soft and can basically shapeshift slightly to take the place of hands. (But that one definitely struggles the most with high dexterity activities. Mostly the telekinesis ones do most of that work.)
