Just off the top of my head:

1. The society creates technology using biomass, extruding it like a 3D printer. Think Earth insects.
2. The society is in a symbiotic relationship with another entity with a manual dexterity analogue.
3. The society has learned to work around limitations on manual dexterity, creating precision tools and proxies much as humans have learned to work around limited working memory. i.e., they used to be bad at it, but now are not in specialized contexts because of bootstrapping
4. The society exists in an alien medium, like a sun or a waveform. Technology might be based on encoding or creating localized effects.
5. The most boring would be something like telekinesis, which seems like it would have few interesting second-order effects.
