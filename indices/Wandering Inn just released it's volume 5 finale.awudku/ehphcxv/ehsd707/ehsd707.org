It's very slice of life in the beginning. It's also a pretty much a day to day telling of Erin's life in this new world. The ups, downs and all the meh in between. Which I actually appreciate. If you prefer time jumps to skip through the boring fluff, this is not the story for you. You will have to read through all of it. I don't know when I truly got hooked but I recently finished the current arc and can't wait for the next part.
