I feel like interlude (The chapter after the finale) is a nice little bow to tie everything together, it lets you know all the threads that happened throughout the story aren't forgotten. It hints that there's a lot of things coming in the future, but doesn't end on a cliff hanger. The author also said they're taking long (For them, it's less than a month) break before they continue, if that impacts you at all.
