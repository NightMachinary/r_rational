Not sure where it first picks up, but I have a sense of where I at least personally found it start to lose energy. The first couple of books are pretty decent slice-of-life fare. After that it kind of slides downhill into an ever expanding cast of characters. It is a balancing act. Early on you don't have any world building done. Later on you have perhaps a little too much spread unevenly across too large a cast.
