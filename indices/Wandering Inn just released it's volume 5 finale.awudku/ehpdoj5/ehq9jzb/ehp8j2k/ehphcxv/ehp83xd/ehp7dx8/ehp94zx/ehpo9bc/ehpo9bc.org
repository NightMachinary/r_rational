One of the earliest chapter has people act squeamish around Ryoka when they find out she's refusing to level up because she's one of those weird people who think you can only level so many times. Skip ahead 2 books and Klbkch has never heard of this idea and neither has seemingly anyone else. Erin goes from outwitting stupid monsters with traps to trouncing world famous adventurers without any explanation.

And well...

Is this a normal person or very influential and powerful one? Are they needlessly confrontational or a subtle manipulator? Are they a racist xenophobe or exceptionally open minded?

The answer is probably yes.

This is a somewhat difficult accusation because you can always claim character development but inevitably seems to be the *same* character development every time. Its always a fun sort of development don't get me wrong but it's sort of like seeing an anime constantly going "Masaka?!" It never quite stops being amusing but it does become predictable.
