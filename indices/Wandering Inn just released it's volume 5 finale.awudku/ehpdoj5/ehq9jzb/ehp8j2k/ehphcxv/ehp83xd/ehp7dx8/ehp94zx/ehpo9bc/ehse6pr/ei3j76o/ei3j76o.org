Yeah. That's not what was in the text originally. I'm not sure if you don't remember or if the author went back to edit it. You're right that Ryoka doesn't care about levels becoming more difficult to obtain but Klbkch doesn't even consider the possibility. He believes that levels get harder to obtain once you get older and the idea that it could be otherwise is a shocking discovery. Earlier there are people who specifically note that people who don't take levels because they think there's a cap are a thing and that they are considered pariahs. Ryoka gets accused of being one.

Wandering Inn is not terribly consistent most of the time. It's very obviously being written one story arc at a time.
