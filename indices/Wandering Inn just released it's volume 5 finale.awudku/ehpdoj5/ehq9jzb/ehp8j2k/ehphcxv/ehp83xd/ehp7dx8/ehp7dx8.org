I recall a particularly jarring set of retcons surrounding the idea of a level cap where people were initially complaining about level cap cultist but had never heard of the idea in later chapters. This was just the most visible change to accommodate the protagonists being unprecedented geniuses. It seems the rules and personalities of people often switch around to make whoever is the POV seem competent (as in you can make more accurate predictions about the world by questioning "what would make X look badass" than what has been directly stated in previous chapters). It's amusing in places ( I fondly remember the chatroom interlude) but it's no WTC.
