A certain horned adventurer? I'm not sure I know who you're referring to otherwise. My memory's not great and I binged this pretty into it's writing so it's possible I've forgotten that detail.

As for the protagonists being geniuses I might've just forgotten details of the previous volumes since 5 focuses so heavy on Erin, I feel like most of the protagonists are protagonists because they're exceptional, as compared to say the some of the Heroes that get introduced around the Clown arc, and the other people from earth that the Lady finds and keeps.

The worst I can really think of is how a blind guy kinda stumbled into the system and ended up getting a good shake of things completely by chance, but the direction he took it in helped make it sit better with me.
