What? I was always under the impression Ryoka didn't level because it felt like something was trying to control her. I think she theorized there might be a cap but I never ascribed that as a reason she would not level period. Also she theorized that levels stack in terms of difficulty. Someone already level 30 in one class will find it difficult to level something else from level 1. Not a game changer but important. It's why Klbkch was worried about his own classes. He used to be mostly Slayer but after several resurrections over the years, Slayer got lower and he picked up other classes which made progression in Slayer harder.
