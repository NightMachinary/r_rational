  Is it irrational to be intellectually uncurious?
#+end_quote

I would say rather that being incurious tends to undermine the capacity to behave rationally. Acting rationally requires a certain amount of knowledge and understanding, and if you're so incurious that you never bother learning how things work, it's going to be hard to act rationally. Instead, your actions will essentially be guesswork, which is a fairly good descriptor for how Erin behaves in the story. She makes it work because she has some good intuitions (and because she has some fairly blatant plot armor), but mostly she's kind of bumbling about.
