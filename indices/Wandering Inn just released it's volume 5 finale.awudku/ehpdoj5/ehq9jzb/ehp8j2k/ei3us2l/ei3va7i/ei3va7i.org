Erin Solstice, the main character, is a truly and remarkably irrational and intellectually uncurious character, who takes no substantive steps towards learning more about the world that she's in or finding a way back home to earth. She doesn't even read any books. Examples are endless. I'd compare her a lot to Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece, which makes her a very fun and unpredictable character to follow, but she is not a rational actor in any sense.

Ryoka pretends at rationality with her actions (refusing to start the arms race), but anyone with sense could see, after the phone call at the end of volume 1, that things are now far beyond that. The fact that she continues to work as a [Runner] with the knowledge she has is a joke and a complete waste of potential, whose only redeeming value is her relationship with the powerful, mystical characters of the world that she meets.
