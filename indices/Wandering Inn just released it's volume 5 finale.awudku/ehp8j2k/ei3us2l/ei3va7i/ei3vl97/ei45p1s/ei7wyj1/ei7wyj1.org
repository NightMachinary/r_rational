  1) In those circumstances, yes.

That's fair.

  2) Ryoka's values swerve towards maximizing her self benefit and the benefits of her friends, without starting Innworld War 1. This would be most rationally accomplished by becoming wealthy and powerful without becoming an arms dealer in the process. This can be easily accomplished by numerous innovative, but unharmful innovations she possesses the knowledge of, such as penicillin and matches, and ice cream. Instead, however, she does nothing on this front. Note how Erin, the half-idiot, is doing ten times more than Ryoka in this regard.

  I suppose her true desire is to be as unimportant as possible. Which makes sense, but botches her potential as a character.

That's also fair and I especially agree with the last part. It explains her behaviors/decisions as rational as a character but then this value direction makes the work as a whole less rational because a character with those values exists. Thanks for explaining.
