1) In those circumstances, yes.

2) Ryoka's values swerve towards maximizing her self benefit and the benefits of her friends, without starting Innworld War 1. This would be most rationally accomplished by becoming wealthy and powerful without becoming an arms dealer in the process. This can be easily accomplished by numerous innovative, but unharmful inventions she possesses the knowledge of, such as penicillin and matches and ice cream. Instead, however, she does nothing on this front. Note how Erin, the half-idiot, is doing ten times more than Ryoka in this regard.

I suppose her true desire is to be as unimportant as possible. Which makes sense, but botches her potential as a character.
