Meh. That story was about cultural issues and irrational stupidity (but I repeat myself). The "alien" part was also iffy, as they were apparently genetically compatible. It was "sci-fi" only because it had a single mention of a spacecraft and a strange, though not really alien, culture. Could just as easy have been about a shipwreck in ancient China and footbinding. And, for some reason, rape.

Not impressed. What's the point in yet another idiotball cultural differences short story? That was a horrible example of alien "contact" going wrong. OP's linked story was much better, with people dealing with physical differences rationally, and something genuinely new to say about it.
