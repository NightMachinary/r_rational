I agree, that was really not the best of examples to use.. But I wished the Op's story would have focused more on their cultural differences, alien sociopsychological implications of intimacy. I genuinely enjoyed it and would have loved to have seen them explored in greater detail. And yeah, it was refreshing to see the whole affair being handled rationally - so many stories do not get it right.

It's a bit of a personal bias of mine against aliens that comes across human-ish. Alien depictions of aliens are just so fascinating to read. Say like Yudkowsky did on Three Worlds Collide.
