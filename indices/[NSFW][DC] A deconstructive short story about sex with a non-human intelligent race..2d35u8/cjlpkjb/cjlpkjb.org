Hmm. this story is getting several degrees removed from what I would counsider directly rational. But it resonates somewhat with me.

You see my desire as a transhumanist is to see a world in which persons can wear bodies and sexualities as you or I would wear a set of clothes. In fact, in spite of the danger and the dedrigation of what we might call the continuity of conciousness, I find the idea of a world in which beings can wear alien personalities and mindsets seductive as well.

At any rate, the linked fanfic deals with two beings with reletively human minds overcoming differences in their relatively alien bodies (which are still both relatively humanoid anyway, among the vast diversity of lifeforms). The issues with comprimising greater difficulties between species might be worth looking into. Of course, many authors have tackled this problem on the scale of interplanetary relations, but it is fewer that go so far as to bring the questions to the bedroom...
