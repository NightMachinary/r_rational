Very nice. Wins bonus points for a non-mammalian character.

Refreshing to see such a story without someone holding the sexual idiotball. Adults acting like adults about sex, instead of charactertures out of a '90s RomCom, is rare in fiction, full stop.

I think this fully qualifies as rational fiction. Thanks for sharing.
