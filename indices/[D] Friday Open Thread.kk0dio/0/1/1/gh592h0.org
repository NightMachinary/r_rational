I checked the comments, and it was legit linked 11 times by 7 different people, with 8 out of those 11 comments being recommendations. Huh.

Edit: I think this is due to my sample of comments: it's the /last/ 160k comments, not random ones. /The Simulacrum/ was rather actively discussed 9-12 months ago, apparently. If I were to fetch all comments, it would probably be much lower on the list.
