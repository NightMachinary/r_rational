I fetched an entirely arbitrary 160.000 comments from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and calculated the number of works linked in the Monday Request and Recommendation Thread.

The results are in:

^{*} ^{There's} ^{no} ^{work} ^{with} ^{such} ^{a} ^{name} ^{that} ^{I} ^{am} ^{aware} ^{of.}

If you count mentions in /italics/ (which are commonly used to denote titles), the winners are /Worth the Candle/, /Young Wizards/, /A Wand for Skitter/, /He Who Fights With Monsters/, and /A Fire Upon the Deep/.

If anyone wants, I can link a Colab Notebook to replicate the results.
