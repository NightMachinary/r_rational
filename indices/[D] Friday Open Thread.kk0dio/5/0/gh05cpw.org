That's one of my all-time favorite fanfics, and I hope that the author continues it. I love the author's P. G. Wodehouse inspired style of comedy, and the level of detail put into the period setting is truly excellent.

Since it is a comedy, I wouldn't necessarily qualify it as rational. None of the characters carry the idiot ball, but they do make some foolish (and sometimes funny) mistakes because it's naturally in-character for them to do so. On the other hand, the story does meet most of the requirements on the sidebar. I would say the story has "intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources", "makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear", has "satisfying intelligent solution to its problems", and "the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures."

The story would also qualify as a deconstruction of tropes. Hermione and the other characters break the mold for what time-travelers typically try to change in the past. Most other time travel fics focus on stopping one particular evil-doer rather than less glamorous, farther-reaching utilitarian goals that would save millions of lives over time.
