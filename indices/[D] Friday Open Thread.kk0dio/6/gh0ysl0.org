Does anybody know a rationality community in Germany, better even in the south-west of it (Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg). I mean the non-fiction version, more like LessWrong. And not just online, but where people meet in real-life (outside of pandemics). Because I really would like to get into contact with people which are like-minded in this way - have never met one personally.

I don't have any social network accounts so I can't search there (efficiently).

Thought to check out this /meetup/ platform, but it is apparently only for marketing purposes. There is also some sort of tiny political party which stands for rationality according to self-description, but politics and rationality don't fit for me.
