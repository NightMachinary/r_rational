Has anybody here ever read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][In the Bleak Midwinter]]? It's a Harry Potter Fanfiction told from the perspective of Tom Riddle Sr (Voldemort's father) who is confronted by a time-travelling Hermione with his baby son. I think it would classify as rational, but I'm not exactly an expert with the genre.
