You could really solve that by simply adding a timer, really. Imposter wins unless all tasks are performed in a certain time.

Also, I'm not even sure this IS the optimal strategy. What would I do as the Imposter if my opponents did the ball thing? Answer: trigger one of the game-ending sabotages (Oxygen or Reactor) that necessarily require them to split between two stations. Either they hesitate too much and lose to the sabotage, or coordinate poorly and someone ends up alone.
