One significant hurdle is the lack of communication capability between each player during play (since you can only chat during meetings) which makes it a lot harder to coordinate where to go together. Another compounding issue I can think of is imposter sabotage, which would be likely to derail plans (you could forcibly split the party by locking doors, and reactor sabotage requires 2 people simultaneously pressing two buttons to fix).

That said, I suppose with enough planning and precommitment you could certain concoct a system that's theoretically foolproof against deception and would ensure victory. Such a system would need to specify contingencies for the expected behaviors for each type of sabotage)
