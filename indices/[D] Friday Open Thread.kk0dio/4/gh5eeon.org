I played Among Us today for the first time, and it left me wondering...

There's no deadline to doing your tasks. So the games' Nash equilibrium should be "everybody bundles up into a tight ball and slowly does their tasks". Whoever walks away from the ball is either killed or ejected, being suspicious. It seems like a foolproof way for the crewmates to win, regardless of the other mechanics in play.

Why doesn't everybody do this?
