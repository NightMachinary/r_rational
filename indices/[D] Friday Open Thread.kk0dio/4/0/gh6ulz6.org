Because it's boring as hell. Sure, if your only goal is to win as crewmate, you would do this every time and win. But spending 20 minutes in a ball alternately doing tasks or watching other people do tasks for a guaranteed victory as crewmate or loss as impostor would mean you end up playing Among Us a total of 3 times and then never again. The goal of playing is to have fun, not to win the most consistently.

And yes, ideally some aspect of the game design would prevent the most boring strategy from being the best one for winning the majority of the time, but that probably comes with compromises somewhere else, and people don't do the "optimal" strategy anyways so it's barely worth it. Or maybe the dev just hasn't thought of or managed to implement a good method of prevention.

(Minor nitpick, you don't want everyone in a tight ball, because that could disguise the impostor killing someone. You'd want everyone close enough to see each other but far enough away that the small jump the impostor does when killing someone is noticeable. You'd also need to keep everyone moving while watching one person do tasks to prevent the impostors from sabotaging)
