Short story. With friends, we sometimes play a variant of Among Us - we intentionally agree to keep the voice chat on all the time, the imposter declares themselves at the beginning, has reduced visibility, and has to wait at the starting point until their first kill count cools down. No meetings, no sabotages and no reporting dead bodies. In other words, the game turns from mystery to slasher horror, with a single raving axe murderer running around trying to kill everyone while they desperately carry out their tasks and shout at each other information about the killer's location.

One game, being the imposter/murderer, I tried something. Everyone has to go to Electrical at some point for sure, I thought. So I simply camped there. Sure as hell, I scored two or three kills in a row. It took a while before the others connected the dots - "wait, is he ALWAYS in Electrical?". At that point, their best strategy would have been to rush me, relying on my cooldown to be too slow to kill them all before at least some finished their tasks, but of course it was super hard to coordinate. I ended up winning the game.

We all laughed and then added a new rule that no one should do that /ever again/, and that was that, because games are supposed to be fun.
