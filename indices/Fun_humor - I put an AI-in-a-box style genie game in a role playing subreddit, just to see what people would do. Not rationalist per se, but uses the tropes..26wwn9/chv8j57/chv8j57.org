I'm mostly just going for "fun" rather than "educational" with the genie's behavior, but so far a surprising number of people have (accidentally or not) gone with the strategy of making a wish which modifies the Genie's utility function so that it /wants/ to be nice, rather than actually specifying a wish.

The rest end up destroying everything, except where dumb luck prevails. One person tried to banish the genie into nothingness but accidentally created an afterlife instead. Only one wire-head, but he seems to be okay with this.
