Well, part of the definitions problem is that in pinning down our definition we're framing the whole conversation that follows. That's why LessWrong tends to taboo words instead of making a new definition for them. So with that said, let me try to start a discussion without using that words at all.

- /Hunger Games/ is one of the biggest new franchises, and at the forefront of this new trend in young adult fiction. But it doesn't really have all that much to do with science fiction, since the futuristic setting is the backdrop of the novel rather than a motivating factor behind the characters. The first novel is a critique of our media culture, which I'd argue that the second and third are critiques of revolutionary politics and hero worship. /Science and technology are not being critiqued./ The "bad guys" aren't bad because they have the technology, they have the technology because they're in a position of power. /Hunger Games/ is not a cautionary tale about science, it's a cautionary tale about celebrity. I'd say we could do with more of that, rather than less.

- /Divergent/ is another one of the big new franchises, and it's not about science or technology either - it's about conformity, and the lesson seems to be about how great it is to be an individual. The world doesn't even really seem to be all that bad before the plot gets going. (As a caveat, I've only read the first book because the writing wasn't that strong, so maybe this changes in the next two books.) Again, not terribly optimistic about the future, but it's not bashing on progress.

Is what people have a problem with perceived pessimism about the future? Or is it a perception that these works of fiction are saying that progress leads in bad directions? I almost feel like some people are seeing cautionary tales as predictions about the future.
