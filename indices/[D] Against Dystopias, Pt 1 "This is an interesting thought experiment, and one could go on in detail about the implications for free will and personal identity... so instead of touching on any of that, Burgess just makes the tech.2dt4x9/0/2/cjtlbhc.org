I apologize for kicking this off. My original perspective that made me post the article was a little sideways to Scott's: most dystopian literature doesn't actually address current-day social problems, which is its supposed purpose.

So instead of rehashes of /Jennifer Government/ or /Snow Crash/ these days, we get a lot of rehashes of themes about fascism (/The Hunger Games/), mostly. /Snowpiercer/ and /Elysium/ are about as close as our current crop of dystopian books and films ever actually come to directly addressing present-day issues.

And if dystopias aren't for critiquing society or providing a cogent warning, then what makes them "more literary" and more worth publishing or writing than any other part of genre fiction? Why don't we consider, say, /Brave New World/ to be about the same mindless lulz as /Twilight/?

I bring up /Brave New World/ especially because the same author eventually wrote a spiritual successor, /Island/, in which the exact same "technologies" are used on the side of Good (well, a kind of Good, if you like Buddhist ideas) -- but nobody ever reads that one.
