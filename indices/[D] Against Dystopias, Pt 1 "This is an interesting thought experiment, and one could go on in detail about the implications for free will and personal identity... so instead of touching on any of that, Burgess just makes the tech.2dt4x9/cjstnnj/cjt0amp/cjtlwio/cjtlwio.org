[[http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2dpt7g/no_dystopian_scifi_isnt_bad_for_society_we_need/cjsm1v9][Also this]]: a lot of so-called dystopias actually represent extremely myopic fears.

Or in other words, a whole lot of dystopias seem to be written by USAsian libertarians; meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, the new, hip way to suffer horrifically is to have your central government break down and become unable to protect you from roving bands of thugs.
