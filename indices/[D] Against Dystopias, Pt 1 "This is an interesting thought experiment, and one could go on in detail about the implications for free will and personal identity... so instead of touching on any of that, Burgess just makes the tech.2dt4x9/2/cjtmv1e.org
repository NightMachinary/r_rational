It irks me that people keep defining and redefining their terms without any actual agreement. Dystopias are */a failure state for society/*. You can have a science fictional dystopia that's not caused by the science fictional elements. In fact, you can have a dystopia where the science fictional elements are what break you out of the dystopia (Cory Doctrow does this a lot).

The big problem, to the extent there is one, is that dystopian fiction very rarely examines /why there's a dystopia/. You don't end up in a dystopia because someone invented a way to patent genomes, you end up there because someone decided to actually implement this plan. Far too often, dystopian novels are all about this terrible society that doesn't even get a proper defense - it's a society that's run by Card-Carrying Villains. I'd argue that a lot of authors don't put that much thought into their worldbuilding (I'm looking at you, /Hunger Games/), which only exacerbates the problem.

*tl;dr*: Half the time, shit sucks and they have nifty technology, which is different from shit sucking /because/ they have nifty technology. Dystopia means too many things to too many people for us to have a discussion using that word.
