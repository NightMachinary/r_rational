Agreed on divergent. I went to see the movie for relationship credit and almost had a meltdown about a subsistence culture when they had /neural induction circuitry/ and *hand held gauss-pistols,* which if effectively used would give humanity colonies through-out the solar system. I haven't decided if I'll go back to the series because [[#s][Divergence series spoiler?]]
