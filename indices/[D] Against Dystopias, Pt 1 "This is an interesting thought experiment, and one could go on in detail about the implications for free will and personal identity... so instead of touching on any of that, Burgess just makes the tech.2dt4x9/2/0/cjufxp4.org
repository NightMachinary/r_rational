  it's a society that's run by Card-Carrying Villains.

This dates back to /1984/, which was an explicit Author Tract against Stalinism. Now, admittedly, /Stalin really was that evil/ (as in, Godwin's Law doesn't apply to discussing Stalin), but the whole difference between /1984/ and real life is that in real life, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopiaIsHard][Dystopia is Hard]] -- Stalinism flopped down dead the instant Stalin himself died. Even North Korea, the world's longest-lasting totalitarian hell-state, is actually on the verge of collapse quite regularly and barely keeps itself afloat at all, despite massive amounts of aid from various freer countries.

  I'd argue that a lot of authors don't put that much thought into their worldbuilding (I'm looking at you, Hunger Games), which only exacerbates the problem.

And which makes such stories, IMHO, extremely uninteresting.
