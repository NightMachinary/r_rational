First off, this was fun to read.

I feel like this critique can be leveled at a lot of literature and is right along the lines of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/][Generalizing from Fictional Evidence.]]

Every story simplifies the world. Every author plays games with your attention. /A Clockwork Orange/ doesn't present its audience with the horrifying counter-factual of life in prison. An even worse selection bias is that the hero usually wins, no matter how many risks he or she takes in order to maintain his or her principles.

Stories lie. Stories lie so the author can grind some ideological axe. Stories lie because author's are lazy, because fiction follows different rules from real life. Dystopias give the hero something large and grand to struggle against. The Dystopia has to take away classical music or personal names for the same reason that Orcs are ugly. It's a shortcut to tell you who the bad guys and the good guys are, so you turn off your moral questioning of whether the hero's actions are morally justified and you know who to cheer for in the Us vs. Them morality play. The citizens of the dystopia are convenient [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons][faceless goons]].

And that's just how stories are. We like those stories. We like the certainty, the clear moral lessons. We like it when someone takes the big confusing world we live in and simplifies it down so that it's really easy to understand. And it's lazy writing and lazy reading, but laziness feels really good. People don't read /Gravity's Rainbow/ because it doesn't simplify things enough, because it doesn't tell you what character you're supposed to cheer for and you're not sure when it's all over what lesson you were supposed to learn. It's too much like life, too complicated.
