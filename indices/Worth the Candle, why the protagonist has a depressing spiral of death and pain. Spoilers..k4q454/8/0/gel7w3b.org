Both of the exclusions were because Juniper found a comfortable exploit, soul magic to boost skills, and reliably used it. His numbers go up very quickly, he just doesn't optimize much outside his fairly narrow niche.

His numbers actually go up even faster with trainers, so it's not like this would increase the amount of time he spends doing things in story.

Out of story, I think people would be fine with him gaining fun new magics and exploring them more, people tend to enjoy new lore things, just his obsession about Arthur is a big part of his character, so he is willfully not taking the smart route, so it works in story.
