In my view, Amaryllis is the protagonist and Juniper is a mostly ordinary teenager from Bumblefuck, Kansas who was given god-tier ability to improve himself and his companions. Juniper is in the story to provide a relatable character for Amaryllis to explain things to. I'll agree that Juniper does do a poor job of optimizing things, but given his age, inexperience, and inadequacy of training, that's not surprising at all. Amaryllis does her best to keep him on track, and she's obviously doing a decent job of it given that they're effectively running three countries now and even the dragons don't want to fight with them anymore.
