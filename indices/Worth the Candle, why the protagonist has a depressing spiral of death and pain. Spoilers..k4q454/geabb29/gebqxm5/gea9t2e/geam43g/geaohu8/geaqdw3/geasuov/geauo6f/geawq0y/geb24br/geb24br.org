He didn't get athletics, so he didn't get all of the skills, and my point about the various skills having benefits above the cap remains. He could try to get his other skills up, but does not. Plus, he faced the issue that it was harder to train a skill up each time, so he should have raised them more.

Him using the same tactic each time is probably why soul magic got excluded. If he had found some clever trick with other skills he would likely be stronger now.

The world building document doesn't describe them in enough depth to say whether the others have spells, and he didn't learn any more blood magic powers with levels. The skill levels just give him greater skill, not specific abilities. It is weird, but the game layer is weird.
