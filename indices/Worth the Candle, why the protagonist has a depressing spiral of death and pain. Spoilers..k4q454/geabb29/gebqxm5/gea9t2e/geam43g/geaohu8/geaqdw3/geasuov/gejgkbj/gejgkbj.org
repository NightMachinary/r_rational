  He is also a dm, not a player, so him not being very good at playing is no surprise.

I agree, but as someone who's recently started actually playing D&D after many years of only playing a computer RPG, in table tops the goal often /isn't/ to win so much as to /be a character/. Losing is fine as long as it's in character, and that takes some mental shifting to internalize after a lot of goal based single player stat-builder "not-really-/role-playing/" games.

So in that sense "good play" isn't about him doing all the side quests to get power before pressing forward, but about being his character and playing out how he as his character would act. It feels like kind of a weak argument as I write it out, especially since Aerb appears to be his real life rather than a story that he can enjoy even if his current character dies--it'd make much more sense as an explanation if he came to this world as that species that reincarnates when they die..
