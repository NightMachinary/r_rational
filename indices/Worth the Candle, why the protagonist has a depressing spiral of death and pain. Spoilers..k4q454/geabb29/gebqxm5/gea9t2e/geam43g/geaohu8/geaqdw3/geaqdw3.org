He didn't even get skills like repair up past the cap, and I really doubt that repairmen or women are so committed to their work that for a million no one would take him past the cap. Till recently it would be really useful as well since he could dump all his skill points into one super skill.

This isn't necessarily a flaw in the story. It's about a depressed teen who is obsessed with finding uther and ignores everything else in favour of that if they can. He is also a dm, not a player, so him not being very good at playing is no surprise.

So yeah, I am doubtful the actual explanation is that this is all too hard and it was resolved off screen and shown to be impossible because AWales doesn't like to show dead paths. More likely the explanation is that juniper is a bad gamer and isn't very good at planning and gaming.

On the other issue, we don't know if still magic or gold magic or water magic has spells, because juniper has never asked an expert about it.

It would take one line to cover this issue, it wouldn't break the wordcount.

Sure, and if she can do it once, she can probably do it again. Valencia and Amary would be up for it, grak probably wouldn't, and raven might be up for it. The locus would hate it, bethel would be up for it but he shouldn't do it with her, fenn would have loved it.

He has an excuse anyway, of wanting down time.
