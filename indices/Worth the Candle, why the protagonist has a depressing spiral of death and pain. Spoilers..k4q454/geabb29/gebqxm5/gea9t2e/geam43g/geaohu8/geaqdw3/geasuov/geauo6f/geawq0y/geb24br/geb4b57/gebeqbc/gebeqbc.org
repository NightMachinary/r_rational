Makes sense. In that situation it would not be useful, as you said, since he was relying on soul scalpism.

Still, I suspect raising skills above the 20 cap would be useful outside, as skills are useful, and he does face situations where he is short on resources. As such, since he doesn't raise skills above 20 generally, I suspect he doesn't try to find good trainers.

  I'm not sure what to tell you for whether water magic has spells. It's given a very clear outline for what it does. Macrohydrokinesis. Maybe it can do more at higher levels, maybe it just gets more precision, but there's no reason to suspect water magic has some additional abilities tacked on to it that nobody seems to ever mention despite their knowledge of it.

Weather is an extremely broad subject, and there's a lot of very complicated things he could be doing, like summoning water tornadoes or storms or lightning.

Likewise, telekinesis is a very broad subject, with a lot of potential variants, and we don't know if the gold entity can offer buffs to people or variations on powers for especially good service.

  There's a whole world building document that gives a decent explanation of all the major magics plus water magic. There's the textual descriptions of the magic when he gets it and all the times he uses it. I'm not sure what more you could want. He has water magic in the 20s at least, which is roughly equivalent to being a graduate student. It would be incredibly weird to get to that level of skill without knowing something so basic about the magic. It would be like going into your third year of graduate school for computer science but not knowing that computers run on electricity.

  For blood magic, he only can get to 35. Reimer explained why he doesn't automatically get spells on skill increase. Maybe he did learn some of the other blood magic spells in the weeks of time he's had between screen time, and that will get brought up when it's relevant.

And the same could be true of other magics, that there are unique abilities and spells and such that a skilled practitioner can learn. Trainers are useful for this.

If he was feeling anti social, he could have sent his pet thief to steal some magic books to learn from.
