  If he had tried and failed that would be one thing, but he didn't really try. He didn't even ask his mother what spells are common for water mages.

AWales really doesn't like writing out things that turn into dead ends. There are a million things that the group as a whole can do, but entire chapters of "we tried X thing for Y reason, but it didn't do all that much because of Z" would not be good story telling. Juniper tried to unlock a ton of magics super early on, but we were only informed that he did try when it was relevant during his actual learning of the magic. The word count of the story is already obscene, it really doesn't need even more words detailing all the things that won't work and won't affect the plot.

Water magic does not have spells, just like gold magic doesn't and arguably still magic doesn't. It's a single ability that is applied in a variety of ways.

  You can make explanations after the fact of why he didn't do it, but it wasn't mentioned in story so it apparently wasn't even a plan.

Disagree heavily here. One of the most common complaints this story gets is that it spends too long talking about things. Adding in even more talking and planning for things that won't go anywhere would be actively bad. There are going to be lots of plans that we may get a full explanation for during the payoff, or maybe we will only see the payoff, but are never going to be fully detailed as they're happening.

  Amary managed to raise her relationship with pure mental effort, and as grak mentioned, he does go on the rounds regularly to spend time with everyone and often gets loyalty ups.

She did that exactly once.

Spending downtime between missions checking on people is a lot different from spending weeks in a time chamber with the express intent of grinding loyalty.
