I'm not going to answer all of these, nor do I think they're even wrong, but a few points:

  1. He doesn't tend to break the level 20 cap of skills, despite being a rich guy with access to skilled trainers.
  2. He doesn't tend to increase the number of techniques of magic he knows, despite being a rich guy with access to skilled trainers.
#+end_quote

The most valuable skills he could do this with, his magics, are illegal to receive or give training in to people who arent vetted by the associated Athenaeum. Maybe they could convince an Athenaeum to give some training to this guy who somehow became incredibly proficient in the magic that they supposedly have a monopoly on, but probably not, and it would take a while. The penalty for teaching magic to someone unlicensed is death, so they aren't going to find illegal teachers, not good ones anyway, and the Athenaeum would be hesitant at best to give very valuable teaching to someone they don't know.

Aside from that, it gives some strategic advantage away. Joon being absurdly proficient at magic is pretty valuable information, and the specific magics he knows and at what proficiency is also pretty valuable. The group would be handing whatever Athenaeum they contacted a good bit of information for relatively little gain, considering how fast he gains skill levels when using the magic.

For the magics he actually could get legal instruction on: he tried to get instruction on vibration magic from Oberlin but was shut down, and not too long after that Sound and Silence had some staffing problems and probably can't spare their most educated members.

For gem and water magic, he would just need a teacher, but those are also two of his least valuable magics. And they /did/ try to hire a really good water magic teacher, but the DM shut that down and gave them someone who wasn't a particularly good teacher.

#+begin_quote

  1. He doesn't seek alternative ways to boost his stats, such as entads or rare locations or people or biological modification.
#+end_quote

He did get some biological modifications, this batch in fact, but with decent PHY his body has fairly few areas that existing magic could meaningfully improve.

#+begin_quote

  1. He doesn't exploit the time chambers they have access to for training and relationship grinding.
#+end_quote

Relationship grinding doesn't really work. They went over this, spending significant time with someone with the specific intent of raising their loyalty doesn't really endear them to him, and means any action he takes is tainted by his motivation for extrinsic rewards.

They /do/ use time chambers for increasing skills, but the level 20 cap on amateur training means there isn't all that much point anymore, since he gets skills to 20 in a handful of hours anyways.
