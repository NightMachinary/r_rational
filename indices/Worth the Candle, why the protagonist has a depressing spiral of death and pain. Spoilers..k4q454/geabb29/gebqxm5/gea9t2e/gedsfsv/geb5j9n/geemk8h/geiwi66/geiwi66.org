Reading most of the comments, I think there is an under-discussed aspect going on here: I think the author has made it fairly clear, via text and subtext, that the numbers game characteristic of litRPGs and related genres is actually a crutch to avoid more interesting narrative elements.

You can see this in broad strokes by comparing how stat heavy the early chapters are compared to how narrative heavy the later ones are. When was the last time that we saw an "Affliction" bold text announcement, right? When was the last time that the character sheet was presented? On a narrative level (for us reading WtC, not the narrative in the story), I think the reason that soul magic got the ax was because it was the last significant RPG GUI still in the story.

I love this because while I enjoy the litRPG genre in the abstract, I actually have a hard time finishing stories because I always get bored after the fiftieth discussion about, eg, whether to use experience points to boost one handed metal sword critical hit chance by 5% or whatever. When the story becomes a literal optimization problem, I always lose interest.

I think if WtC spent lots of time talking about Juniper getting incrementally better at every available skill and exactly how that increases his probability of success, or if there were tons of discussion about the perfectly optimal combination of experience point distribution, without ever tying it back to an interesting narrative, I would have stopped reading.

For me, the introduction focusing so heavily on RPG mechanics worked well because it was a very efficient way to build the world for us. The world was huge and mysterious and confusing, but the character sheet quantified Juniper's status and progress in a neat way. And, of course, the RPG elements form the basis for all of the cool magic. But after getting sufficiently immersed in Aerb, I don't really want to keep hearing about whether Jun's knife throwing skill is at 17 or 18. I want a brief discussion of how he's been training his skills, and then I want to see him throw knives real good, which is basically what happens and I love it.

Instead of continued attention on stats and skill trees, I think the story is right to redirect the attention to the more important thing Jun needs to work on: growing as a person and making connections with people in ways he couldn't before. The quest keeping track of how many companions he's had sex with gets at this in a really clever way. His progress begins in simplified, quantified RPG land with x/7 popping up as it happens. But he quickly gets annoyed at this and at this point in the story, it would be completely absurd for him to care about the counter at all. He's developed deep, intimate relationships with everyone in his party and the RPG component that initially spurred him on is vestigial.

I think this point applies more broadly and actually dovetails into what others have been saying: the GM is going to keep escalating things no matter how hard Jun grinds and focusing excessively on optimizing the RPG elements is really just ignoring all of the beautiful depth the world has beyond them.

It's basically Goodhart's law applied to world building. Grinding skills was good to a point, but to achieve his goals, Jun needs to move beyond that and work on deeper problems. I have mixed feelings about rushing to the endgame, which seems to be what's happening, but I don't think the story would be improved if it were interrupted to show Jun optimizing his character sheet at the eleventh hour when the whole time we've been learning that his real problems are not solvable like that and on a meta note, that a story can't be (satisfyingly) solved by the protagonist hitting the max level.

But I think if you expect the story to stay true to its litRPG roots, the lack of explicit skill point optimization in the later parts of the story might be irksome.
