He explicitly noted it was a reasonable expectation.

#+begin_quote
  Having so much power, even if it was only momentary, scared me simply because it meant that any reasonable DM would start throwing all kinds of terrible shit at me, things to test my new powers, then after that, things to circumvent them.

In addition, he had been offloading sleep to tuung, so enemy spies would know he could sleep but was trying to avoid it.

There were several red flags.

1. He worried that the DM would circumvent his powers.

2. The castle provided protection for Amaryllis, but not them, and they were left alone. It didn't necessarily provide protection for Amaryllis, they could declare her a fugitive or remove her access maybe.

3. A group of Penndraigs entered, who were protected by the golems. He didn't leave at this point.

4. They escalated to use of an entad in public. He was willing to draw a sword and threaten a prince, but not use one of his more sneaky magics. (aka, fuck the political consequences, and ignore the fact that he is a mage)

5. They refused to back down when pushed, and Juniper refused to follow through with his threat.

There were many, many red flags. He also had many solutions to solve it- run away, use still magic or air magic or passion magic to disable the pipe, ask them to let him use the entad.

I would think I was an idiot if I fell for that in a game and accept my nerf with grace.
