  The sleep thing doesn't mean anything. Amaryllis regularly dumps sleep on the Tuung. The leap from he is avoiding sleep to sleep is his weakness is a huge one. Besides they don't have any significant spies considering Valencia's vetting.

The Penndrags are the family with numerous entads, access to powerful revision mages and exotic magics. We see this later with the utterly bullshit meta-entad sword, and have seen it repeatedly through the story with Amaryllis' many items. They have repeatedly worried about spying entads. They should expect some surprises. Assuming your rivals are dumb is a bad assumption.

And yeah, Amary stopped using that entad, and Juniper started using it on people who weren't constantly behind a ward. This was a fairly open and non secretive act. A spy could find it with just their eyes.

1. This is a very meta campaign. They have no grounding to stand on denying the DM metagaming. They metagame massively.

2. Do we know that she can't be locked out of the succession? Or that they have no way of circumventing orders? They have access to the golems, I would assume they have ways to bypass security. Plus my other point remains, golems provide anti protection for Juniper and co.

3. There are other rooms in the castle, and they could barricade doors if needed.

4. Threatening a prince with assault and drawing a weapon is not diplomatic. At that point you've already escalated things.

5. Many people, me included, see it as an unreasonable call.

People make mistakes and things go wrong, but this was a fuck up on a level that many feel he was being really, really stupid. He wanted party leadership before because he can metagame and predict threats, as he did in the soul prison with the golems. He realized the threat, predicted that the entad was the equivalent of a loaded gun, and let them fire it at him. If he assumed he was unstoppable it was really stupid.

And this wasn't a disorganized group of idiots like the Doris', this is part of an organized faction of entad holders and mage owners. Expecting them to play fair and letting them attack him is stupid. This is on him. The DM played fair, he had many warnings, he got fucked over because he made bad choices and made a threat he didn't carry through on. Him being dishonest made him lose.

  Despite all of this, they still after the fact decide to work in the system as diplomatically as possible. They don't significantly adjust their approach as a result of this fiasco, and I agree with them that they didn't need to.

Hyacinth after this immediately tried to use diplomacy to get them alone and then summoned Shia LaBeouf, they really should have re-evaluated their approach.

I didn't suggest they randomly attack people. Blood god Doris didn't threaten them with an unknown entad.
