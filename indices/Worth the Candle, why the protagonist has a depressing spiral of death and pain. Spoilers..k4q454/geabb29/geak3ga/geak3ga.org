1. He tends to grind up to the unskilled training cap and stop, even if he has the stats to go higher, because he doesn't tend to get trainers.

2. He can learn extremely quickly, and can buy access to time chambers. He could cap out his skills with access to trainers, along with learning spells that trained mages know.

3. They don't really go on quests to find things, juniper sticks to the main plot and immediate emergencies.

4. He has multiple times faced issues because he has social conflicts with people on his own. Notably, there are ways for him to lead without losing the benefits of others, such as seeking out communication entads, or making a radio. They mostly relied on the house for that and made no effort to find an alternative.

5. He has used the tuung to achieve large worldbuilding feats, but not to gather personal power. Likewise with anglycynn, he has taken what amary rightfully owns, but nothing more.

6. Spending a lot of time with people let's him learn about them and boost his loyalty. As such, spending time with them chatting or watching anime or such in a time chamber makes him materially more powerful and let's him destress.

7. There are other time chambers they can rent.

He has had lots of downtime, and again, they have access to time chambers to grind stuff.
