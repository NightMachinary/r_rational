I agree, his social failures are often a good part of the story and lead to good drama. Not recognizing that other people have higher charisma and should be party faces is a flaw, and one that can lead to good storylines.

My comments on the story were not meant to say it was a bad story, just to note how juniper's issues were self inflicted and easily solvable.

Grak is a depressed dwarf who hates themselves. They have their concerns but I am unsure how valuable they are. Valencia, say, is a way to stop the hells from torturing trillions. The sheer utility is worth some consideration, and that's something he hasn't really thought about a lot- one of his companions could die, or he could die because he isn't utilizing all the resources at his disposal. He has his worries about mind alteration, but he has never really considered in story "if I do this, I will be materially more powerful and less likely to have companions die." And vague concerns about backfires aren't enough to negate a need for that talk.

He is very into rushing the endgame and very against side quests. It's quite an issue, especially since he tends to not train things like bow very well as you said and so he needs cheats to survive. Being able to kill at a distance is very useful.
