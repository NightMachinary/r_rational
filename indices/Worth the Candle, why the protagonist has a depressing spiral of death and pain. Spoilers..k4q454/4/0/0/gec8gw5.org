Not sure if they're playing by the same rules, but Uther once lamented in /Degenerate Cycles/ about how his reality always spurred a call to action every time he tried to take a break. A protagonist taking it easy makes for a dull narrative. Some shit would inevitably happen, the world would face a new threat only he could solve. And there were always consequences for inaction.
