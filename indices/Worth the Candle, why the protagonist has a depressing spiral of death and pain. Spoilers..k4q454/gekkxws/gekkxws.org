Even if I agreed on every point, I think I disagree with the overall premise of the post. For two reasons:

1.) I don't think that people work like that. There are a lot of ways, big and small, that we could optimize our lives for a particular criteria. Using money as an example (the closest IRL analog to a person's power level), there are things that you and I could be doing right now to either earn money or raise our earning potential. We're not doing that though, because at some point we value something more than seeing our numbers go up.

Even super charitable people who donate all their money to saving lives, they all draw the line /somewhere/. Juniper has been the target of two(?) exclusions so far, so it's not as if he's making /zero/ effort to game the system. What we see in-story is simply where he draws the line.

2.) I don't think that munchkining is all the story wants to be about. I can imagine a story where Joon does try to min-max everything. Like many other Gamer!Fictions, it soon gets tedious to read without a driving conflict. Which-- I guess that you could do min-maxing off screen and come back to introduce the next interesting thing or whatever, but that seems to be status quo already? I don't remember the scenes for grinding ink magic, star magic nor water magic.

I /do/ remember Joon using his resources to acquire star and water magic tutors, but I /only/ remember those because they were both enmeshed in layers of plot.
