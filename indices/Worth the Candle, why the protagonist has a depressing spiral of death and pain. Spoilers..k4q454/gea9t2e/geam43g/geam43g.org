He has access to a secret government organization of black power and a wife with control of a state, a reputation as the next saviour and a massive amount of wealth. Convincing someone to be corrupt for him is a solvable problem, and one that I would really expect him to follow. It's not like he needs an extreme expert. He doesn't know a lot of long hanging fruit. If he had tried and failed that would be one thing, but he didn't really try. He didn't even ask his mother what spells are common for water mages.

You can make explanations after the fact of why he didn't do it, but it wasn't mentioned in story so it apparently wasn't even a plan.

I dunno if the mods improved his stats or if they were sidegrades or fluff upgrades. We shall I guess.

Amary managed to raise her relationship with pure mental effort, and as grak mentioned, he does go on the rounds regularly to spend time with everyone and often gets loyalty ups. Relationship grinding does work fairly well. It feels bad to him because of the extrinsic rewards, but he does regularly go on the rounds and get boosted relationships.
