  He doesn't know what the higher level virtues are so he doesn't know if they have useful applications, and he has several needs. Essentialism, still magic, sword work, unarmed, armor. The more he can dump into them the better he can do. He could also raise up other magics if they were needed for a particular purpose.

If he has the time to dump points into /all/ of those, he has time to put points into essentialism and then take the skills from other souls instead. He has enough points already in non-combat skills that it really isn't an issue

  As he noted he almost lost the sword duel because he didn't have enough sword skill. If he could dump more into that he could have done better, because onion had higher attributes. As such, again, I suspect that juniper is pretty bad at planning out his advancement.

He didn't dump all his skills into the skills he used to fight Onion, he drew from souls, and he was capped at 300 anyways going in to the fight. More points in the other skills wouldn't have helped, because he didn't really use them.

  Do you have evidence we know what those magics do pretty well? That there aren't spells or tricks that a skilled expert could teach?

There's a whole world building document that gives a decent explanation of all the major magics plus water magic. There's the textual descriptions of the magic when he gets it and all the times he uses it. I'm not sure what more you could want. He has water magic in the 20s at least, which is roughly equivalent to being a graduate student. It would be /incredibly/ weird to get to that level of skill without knowing something so basic about the magic. It would be like going into your third year of graduate school for computer science but not knowing that computers run on electricity.
