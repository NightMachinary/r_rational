He posted this in the early birds chat when that batch came out

  You should assume that he did and the virtues weren't particularly applicable to the fight/plot (either more applicable to traditional track and field stuff, or superceded by other virtues such as the ability to fight without fatigue).

  (Honestly, writing virtues was my least favorite part of this batch, and I think that for some readers it probably just makes their eyes glaze over, especially the second section, which basically comes mid-fight, which is one of the reasons that I elected not to make a bunch of new ones for Athletics. Rifles was the other one that was arguable, given that he was using something that could reasonably have been considered one with maybe a different form factor, or which he could potentially have decided on using a borrowed rifle entad with if it were good enough, but it's one of those things that would have just taken up space on the page for no good reason, and you can assume that things I find sufficiently boring are being left out.)

Admittedly, that wasn't public information, so it's hard to fault you for not knowing it.

I'm not sure what to tell you for whether water magic has spells. It's given a very clear outline for what it does. Macrohydrokinesis. Maybe it can do more at higher levels, maybe it just gets more precision, but there's no reason to suspect water magic has some additional abilities tacked on to it that nobody seems to ever mention despite their knowledge of it. Basically the same for gold magic, it's tactile telekinesis plus some stuff related to finding and marking gold. They're really simple.

For blood magic, he only can get to 35. Reimer explained why he doesn't automatically get spells on skill increase. Maybe he did learn some of the other blood magic spells in the weeks of time he's had between screen time, and that will get brought up when it's relevant.
