  He didn't even get skills like repair up past the cap, and I really doubt that repairmen or women are so committed to their work that for a million no one would take him past the cap.

The reason I didn't mention the non-magic skills is because they aren't nearly as valuable, and are much less valuable to train. For the skills that aren't ever going to be needed too urgently, it doesn't matter if they aren't at their caps because he can level them pretty fast in the course of using them. The more he needs that skill, the higher it will be. And then it might not matter at all that he doesn't have it at cap, because he got the opportunity to spend a long time doing productive things using that skills, as happened in the story:

  I had put a ton of work into our plans, leveling almost all of my non-combat skills up to their caps, and getting new virtues in the process.

Chapter 220.

As for the soul stuff, he only needs enough points to get soul magic to 80 or so, at which point he can take skills from the souls of others. It's not all that urgent to get every skill as high as it can go for soul magic.

  On the other issue, we don't know if still magic or gold magic or water magic has spells, because juniper has never asked an expert about it.

We know what those magics do pretty well. There's no reason to suspect that these magics have discrete spells to unlock when every use we see is an application of a relatively simple base ability. Water magic can move water around on a large scale with a handful of factors governing the extent. Gold magic is somewhat low precision, high strength telekinesis at very short range. Still magic stops things from changing, though as I said still magic is a little more arguable. There's no reason to spend time asking about things that should be readily apparent at this point.
