Yeah, he is rushing and neglecting the assets his team can bring (with Fenn, you can win. When you've got Grak, you don't go back). I'd like to touch on their primary problem: the metagame, or narrative as they call it in the story.

These fictional universes have their own rules and fundamental laws. As an illustration, I present to you the Dragon Ball fan-fiction /Reincarnated as Yamcha/. The story they wrote takes the Dragon Ball canon as something literal and that makes sense, so in the end New Yamcha ends up ultimately being as relevant as a background fern regardless of his effort. I hate where they went with it - it makes that whole universe and story feel like its carved in stone and dead.

It isn't how shounen stories work. They're self-insert wish fulfillment stories. That are there to entertain the audience, and respond quickly to their reactions. Training effectiveness is based completely on how entertaining and novel the method used is, [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42HNvl0e26I][as well as how much the audience likes you.]] The very first thing New Yamcha should have done was cling to Bulma's leg, because his life depends on it, and then gone around doing entertaining hero stuff, so he could hijack the MC slot Steve Urkel style. Then there might have been Super Space Werewolves instead of monkeys as the ultimate fightin' race or whatever. Maybe if he didn't allow things to escalate, it could have remained a lighthearted adventure story with gags instead of a wrestlin' show.

So. Back to Worth the Candle.

According to Table Top rules, a good DM will strive to make his players happy. They'll accommodate the interests of the table and let them have the freedom to have fun. A bad DM is dictatorial - you will do these chores I set up for you and you'll like it.

In a perfect world, Joon would be able to relax, maximize the skills that cultivate strength (that's mainly the crafting abilities on his sheet. I'm sure you've had tons of fun imagining all the things Woodworking can do. Like create those teachers you were talking about.) all while running a sandwich shop. If he doesn't seek violence, he won't suffer violence... buuuut the DM gave him a dozen apocalypses and a time counter and Joon knows he's under a Joon-class DM so probably assumes he has less time to work with than he thinks.

He did abuse his crafting skill Essentialism and burn through various skills - easy come, easy go. The DM might be less likely to ban skills if the player were actually personally invested in them. You could argue he indulged Joon's antics with Essentialism for as long as he did solely due to that. A more energetic Joon might have combined it with Livestock and created an army of super intelligent cows or exploited other synergies as it seemed designed to do... but I'm pretty sure we're all in agreement that Woodworking is broken. At a minimum you can use it to make more companions each with their own cheat. You can literally write a hundred very different Worth the Candle spinoffs with this magic genie alone.

TLDR: Yeah, I personally would have tried to hide in a hole and cultivate even if the world got swallowed up in the meantime. Every cultivator knows cultivating = winning, while going outside makes you doomed to be yamcha-esque canon fodder for the MC.
