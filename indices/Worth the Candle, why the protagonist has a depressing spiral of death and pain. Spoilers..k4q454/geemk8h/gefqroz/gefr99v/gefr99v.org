I think the arbitrary npc not running the exact counter to Juniper's setup arbitrarily is a reasonable expectation. I really don't think Juniper messed up there. In hindsight he should have chopped off his head, but I really don't think there was any reasonable way of expecting ahead of time for things to turn out the way they did. People gave Juniper a lot of shit for that scene and I think it's pretty unfair. It's just bad GMing. I'd be rightly pissed if I was in an actual tabletop and that happened to me. Its the kind of thing that turns players into murderhobos.

The argument for Amaryllis screwing up is more reasonable, but I really don't think anyone on team Juniper made any unforced errors in that arc.
