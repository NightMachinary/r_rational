To some extent sure because he expects the GM to be a bastard, kind of like Juniper himself sometimes was. He thinks about this immediately after being captured:

#+begin_quote
  Obviously being stripped down and chained up was making me angry, but more than that, it was the position I'd been put in with Yarrow, unable to act without being castigated as the aggressor, but punished for letting him do as he pleased. If I'd known what the pipe was going to do, I'd have fucking cut off his head and dealt with the consequences, but I was in the dark. It was frustrating, and pretty clearly all part of whatever stupid fucking plan the Dungeon Master had. Sleep was one of my few weaknesses, so here it was, brought out at the first moment it was available. What pissed me off the most was that there was no way they could have known that sleep was my biggest weakness.

The sleep thing doesn't mean anything. Amaryllis regularly dumps sleep on the Tuung. The leap from he is avoiding sleep to sleep is his weakness is a huge one. Besides they don't have any significant spies considering Valencia's vetting.

1. Yes he was. Doesn't change the fact that what the GM did was metagame bullshit. An exclusion would have been more honest and less railroady.
2. No they couldn't. Its based on bloodline, they have no way of denying her the castle's protections.
3. Sure they could abandon Amaryllis and leave the castle, but I don't exactly think that's the obvious or correct choice at this point.
4. Him not cutting the prince's head off was him being diplomatic. Was his response optimal? No. Was it strictly speaking a mistake? Thats up for debate.
5. He made the fairly reasonable call that he was strong as fuck and it was extremely unlikely (without meta knowledge) that they would be a threat to him. His team had him, who at that point was immune to every conventional threat except void, Solace the last Druid, Pallida a thousands of years old thief, and Raven Masters, a thousands of years old former companion of Uther. Expecting the political consequences of killing these two random bozos to be worse than anything they might be able to do to him is extremely reasonable.

Just because something does go wrong, doesn't mean the wrong choice was made. For all Juniper knew, Yarrow was just a stubborn dick who wanted to tell a dumb joke and didn't like being bullied. Even Raven didn't consider Yarrow a threat at the time.

#+begin_quote
  “He saw it as a threat,” replied Raven. “It was a pipe, nothing that would suggest an attack, but Juniper saw it as one. Either the threat was a bluff, or Juniper decided against the attack at the last moment, but Yarrow lit the pipe, and it put everyone but me, Yarrow, and Zinnia to sleep."

Here are Juniper's thoughts on the matter after the fact.

#+begin_quote
  “Except nothing will have changed,” I replied. “We can play within the system and still get fucked. You know why I got knocked out by that entad? It's because I thought we'd be fine. I thought if they were dumb enough to attack me, I would fight back with everything I had, and at least I would have followed the rules, at least I could say, after the fact, that I hadn't breached trust. Trying to do it that way got me fuck all. I'm done being reactive.”
#+end_quote

Despite all of this, they still after the fact decide to work in the system as diplomatically as possible. They don't significantly adjust their approach as a result of this fiasco, and I agree with them that they didn't need to. After all the diplomatic approach paid dividends with Doris Finch, and if they had treated her the same way you suggest they should have treated Yarrow it would have been a bloody battle that they might have lost. Instead they have a powerful ally.
