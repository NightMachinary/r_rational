This is spot on, and I'd extend it to say that his lack of /normal/ power progression likely bears a large part of the blame for the exclusions he's been causing. If a level 100 character is basically invincible and defeats Mome'Rath, that's only to be expected. If a level 15 player munchkins their way into level 100 stats and does it, that's breaking the game and therefore a reason to change the rules. (That is at least partly the DM's fault for throwing far too high CR enemies at him, but Juniper's refusal to settle for anything but immediate and total victory, and his reluctance to let temporary boosts wear off naturally, isn't playing well with that tendency.)
