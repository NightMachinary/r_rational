Fundamentally I think there is a misunderstanding here. If the GM was like Reimer, I'd agree. The numbers would be all that mattered. The GM is not like Reimer though, they are like Juniper. Ultimately the GM is not trying to kill Juniper, he is trying to tell an interesting story/make an interesting game. That's why you get bullshit like a random barely relevant npc having the exact counter to Juniper's op 100 still magic cheese. It ultimately doesn't matter how much he games the numbers, the GM isn't going to let him get away with no challenge. The only way Juniper could end up having no chance is if he puts himself into the situation with adequate warning about the threat level. (For example the Onion fight was an out of depth encounter and not at all necessary. Juniper just pushed for it anyway.)

If the party wanted they could spend decades preparing for Fel Seed, but in the Juniper perspective that's a boring waste of time and the GM would tend to agree. Ultimately in a tabletop game its not the numbers that determine your success/failure, its the GM. (Within reasonable limits of course like I mentioned before with the Onion fight.)
