I think the fact that Juniper is weak in social skills, to the point that he has a large blind spot for that whole area, is a core part of the story. His history on earth is one of messing up relationships, that and his escapism through worldbuilding are his two defining qualities. So, yes, sometimes his social failures are frustrating, but I think they're actually a relatively strong part of the story. More specifically, I think he's right not to try to game loyalty. This has been lampshaded well with Grak, who is reasonably highly suspicious on the whole loyalty mechanic, and it seems like pushing on that mechanic could backfire. Perhaps one area where he could have made more of an effort is with the locus, who gets consistently sidelined.

I agree with you in that Juniper falls down on basic gaming skills. He's actually a halfway decent exploiter or munchkin, he's found quite a few holes in the system and found out how to string them together, and he's strong in the area of usefully deploying magic items. He almost completely ignored the early quests, though, for some reason, which is poor strategy, and made him overly dependent on cheats, which has resulted in major issues and a put-out-the-fire mentality. I'm not actually even sure what the latest endgame rush is supposed to accomplish, as a purely practical matter that kind of approach never works in games where you don't have mastery that comes from playing through the game multiple times. You can't speedrun on your first playthrough. It's sad to see him go through quests that should have been done levels and levels ago, that's really just a waste He also systematically undervalues any skill that isn't magic. Consider how much use he's gotten out of swords alone, highly useful skills like bows were treated like. It's fine that he's not a gamer, but most of his problems do seem to stem from making a giant rush for the endgame. Admittedly the DM escalates quite quickly, but Juniper's inability to play along, to play the game qua game, is a major source of problems.
