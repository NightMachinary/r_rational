I think it was clear you like the story. I mostly agree with the assessment. I also think there are Watsonian reasons for your issues, though that's not really an excuse for them. I think Wales is just ready to pack it in, but also recognizes that thee planted flags need to be triggered before the story can end. That's why we're seeing an endgame rush. That said, my personal prediction is that Juniper will die in the attempt and be sent to the hells, if there's no hell arc that's a huge untripped flag Star magic is also a dimensional magic which seems it might be able to take a foreground position in a hell arc. Also Juniper dying would be strong from a Campbellian perspective, going to the underworld and returning seems like it would be appropiate.
