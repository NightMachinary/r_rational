Yeah, all of that is true. I could write a short book on how game elements are often misused and how often conflict isn't properly set up. We all know the reason June is a bit bad at this and burns through skills and equipment so quickly is so that there is /variety/ in the violence that happens.

But he's seriously not an SSS class progamer, which I think is the main thrust of the sentiment here. Going into a hole controlled by a belligerent force was suicidal; the DM was nice that he only killed Fenn during that snafu. And of course he carried the biggest idiot ball on the planet when he read the Spirit Magic book and leveled up.

I understand he had to be completely stupid in that situation to create a scene that reflects on terminal values and trump up his physical reliance and emotional dependence on Raven, but it was something no one in their right mind would have done in his situation. "I didn't think the game would fuck me over like that", he says, after dozens of instances of cruel bullshit that came out of nowhere with far less warning than this, and we ponder if maybe he had a stroke and thought he was playing Candyland instead of /Joon's Happy Fun Time With Apocalypses/.

Of course, he deserves all the bad things that happen to him because he was mean to Maddie, who is a good girl. And is completely dependent on the DM fudging his rolls for him - how irresponsible. At this point I'm rooting for Fel Seed.
