I can't say I've fully 100% retained every detail of the story, so sorry for inaccuracies, but:

1) My understanding is that you get relatively negligible XP for training, especially as you level a skill. You need to engage in actual combat, complete quests, that sort of thing to really level the skills. When he was lower level he did, in fact, grind like you suggest.

2) Hasn't he trained all the useful skills he has access to? What else would he learn that's worth the tradeoff in time?

3) Do they know actually know a way of finding those things and choose not to? I think the best way of finding unknown rare things is generally going to be through quests which they do plenty of.

4) I feel like Amaryllis and Valencia do /a lot/ of that to the point where Amaryllis almost feels like the main character a lot of the time. Juniper is mostly the active one when his decision on whether to project overwhelming force is the main deciding factor in the situation, which make a lot of sense to me.

5) IIRC he's taken tons of entads from Anglycynn and they use the Tuung to achieve very impressive feats. I'm not exactly sure what else they could be doing with their power.

6) What is there about the loyalty mechanic that is exploitable? Loyalty points seem to only be assigned when genuine insight and character development happen, there's not really an "improve relationship" button to grind. Are you thinking about how he could have altered souls before? Cause that's pretty opposed to his ethical views and I'm not sure it would even work.

7) I guess he could spend more time in the time chamber, but being locked up in a time chamber with someone for a long time could easily back fire, and you're getting at most a loyalty bonus. As for training see point 1. Also it got taken away as an option for him unexpectantly, since using the chamber involves being inside Bethel.

The world very much does not feel like a clicker game to me, at least not at the level Juniper is at. I don't think there really are simple ways of grinding, and he's often operating under some extreme time pressure.
