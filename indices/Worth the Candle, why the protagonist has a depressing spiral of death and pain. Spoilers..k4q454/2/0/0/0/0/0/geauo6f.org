He doesn't know what the higher level virtues are so he doesn't know if they have useful applications, and he has several needs. Essentialism, still magic, sword work, unarmed, armor. The more he can dump into them the better he can do. He could also raise up other magics if they were needed for a particular purpose.

As he noted he almost lost the sword duel because he didn't have enough sword skill. If he could dump more into that he could have done better, because onion had higher attributes. As such, again, I suspect that juniper is pretty bad at planning out his advancement.

Do you have evidence we know what those magics do pretty well? That there aren't spells or tricks that a skilled expert could teach?
