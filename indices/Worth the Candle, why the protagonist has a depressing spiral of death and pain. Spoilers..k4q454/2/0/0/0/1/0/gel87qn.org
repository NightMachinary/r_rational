The goal is to be an interesting character who the other players like and who you like and to together have consenting fun.

One of my suggestions was to have him time chamber more time with Amary and Valencia, so that sort of stuff was included in my suggestion.

Roleplays are a collaborative sport, and you need to work with others to make it fun for everyone. Juniper isn't great at that as a player either. That often means pushing through emotional pain. If people like you as a character they like seeing you go through hard times and come out the otherside better. Him avoiding his home town was a flaw in him as a player as well.
