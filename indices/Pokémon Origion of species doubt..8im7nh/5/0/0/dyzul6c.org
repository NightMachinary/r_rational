Sure, but nobody wants to read a story where the protagonists have to spend a year and a half slowly domesticating a feral Pokemon before it starts to listen to them in battle.

Though it would be an interesting alteration to the world. People wouldn't catch wild Pokemon any more, they'd have to buy them from domesticators. Only rare Pokemon would be worth capturing, to then sell to those same domesticators.

But in the end, Origin of Species is more about justifying canon with the least changes possible (Wild Pokemon can be used within days of capture) than radically changing it.
