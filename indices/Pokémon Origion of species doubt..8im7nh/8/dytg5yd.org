The Pokeballs have programs that mentally condition basic commands and an attachment to their trainer. It really only works on Pokemon who are amenable or neutral, if they have reason to dislike you beyond the basic "got beat up and snatched out of the wild" you have to work on that yourself.

I think DayStarEld has made it clear that in this world kids are regarded as miniature adults by the time they are of age to get a Pokemon licence. Their culture and education makes this possible. Also a prosperous society with a low population helps. Part of the reason for that low population is that Pokemon are very dangerous, which introduces a significant selection pressure on humanity. Dumb kids, or even smart kids by our world's standards tend to get smooshed by Onyx, eviscerated by Shiftry, or poisoned by Beedrill, while strategically brilliant kids go on to become (one presumes) reproductively successful Champions.

Not that that's how intelligence is usually inherited, but it's not like Pokemon evolution makes any sense, so why not?
