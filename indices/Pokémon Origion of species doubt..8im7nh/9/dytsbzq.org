  The main characters age is between 11 - 14 , but they still no about hypothesis testing, Bayes theorem and advanced statistical and mathematical model , should I think that this is the nature of the world or there is any other explanation.

They read Giovanni's blog, which seems to be their equivalent of LessWrong and the like. The real question is how they understand it so well, and how they're so smart in general. Rationalist fiction always has smart main characters, so you just kind of have to accept that when it's about kids. Just like you're accepting that can carry around powerful magical creatures in tiny balls.

  Another doubt is I did not fully understand that why a Pok√©mon listen to its trainers after getting caught, like are they brain washed in the poke ball ?

Partially, but it's also important to remember pokemon aren't human. Beating them up is a way to establish dominance, so that helps get them to listen to you. You can train them without using pokeballs, but it's much more labor-intensive.
