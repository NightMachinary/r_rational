My interpretation is that they're not /quite/ human. Like, similar evolutionary lines and all, but they've had to contend with seemingly-mystical monsters of absurd power, and somehow they havent been driven to extinction. in such a world, even if genetically they're identical to humans, society is gonna ask a hell of a lot more from you at a younger age. I'd imagine that Red, Blue, and Leaf have basically spent all their time from a very young age studying this stuff, and yeah, maybe people's brains do develop faster due to the selective pressure of pokemon. i'd point to the old lady in pewter city who was talking about how when she was young, pokeball technology wasnt really a thing, or was in its infancy. like, the way people talk about the stormbringers is the way they used to talk about a particularly angry kangaskhan

alternatively, daystar wanted the characters to have this level of cognition, and also wanted to mirror how in the games you start your journey as a preteen, and so he decided to just be like fuck it, it's part of the story's conceit
