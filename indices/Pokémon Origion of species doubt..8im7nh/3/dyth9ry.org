Some people like to imagine how awesome it would be if Mon were real. All the cool things they could do, how the world would be different, etc, etc.

I'd like to think that in such a universe, people would dream about a place where common animals couldn't breathe fire, summon storms, rewrite reality, or win a game of chicken with oncoming cars. A world where humans were at the apex of nature, a place where they could conceive of deities in their own image instead of God being a goat stuck in a fence.

The kids are more advanced mentally due to evolutionary pressures. Sure, you COULD coddle your kids from a young age, but likely this would result in them being torn apart by a squirrel or eaten by a motile plant when they set off into the world. Those kids don't last long. Teaching them the fundamentals of raising Mon and sensing them out into the world early with friends is probably the best way to prepare them for life in a world full of Mon. It probably hearkens back to their ancestors who learned to domesticate or at least befriend Mon, because the ones that didn't were either killed off by the creatures or conquered by those who tamed them.
