Just to be clear, children aren't given dangerous objects and their full freedom in our culture. But in other cultures children are regarded as small adults and were traditionally given, or were allowed to make, fires, knives, and other weapons, and were given all the freedoms of an adult. Check out /Don't Sleep, There are Snakes/ for some perspective on this, it may shift your idea of "normal" for children to regard it only as normal for our own culture.
