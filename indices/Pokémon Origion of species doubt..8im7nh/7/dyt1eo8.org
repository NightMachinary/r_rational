I feel like the age thing can be forgiven as an artifact of canon. It's like how, in real life, nobody would give 11 years olds objects capable of incredible destruction, but HPMOR is still rational because in Harry Potter you go to Hogwarts at 11, so you can't fault a rational author for keeping that in the fic.

For me it's the same with Origin of Species; normal 11 year olds are nowhere near mature or smart enough to handle wandering around a continent full of magical beasts by themselves, but in Pokemon kids leave to become trainers at 11. So I actually find it more believable for the main characters to act 'too mature', then to read a story about what would actually happen if actual 11 years old went out on an adventure. I just like to believe that humans in the Pokemon world just evolved to mature a lot faster. It's the author's way of keeping one of the stations of canon (the age trainers leave on their adventures), while still making the work readable and rational; I don't think many people on his sub would be interested in reading an actual 11 year olds point of view, and I think even more people would find it even more contrived if the characters acted like normal eleven year olds and then still pulled off all the clever stuff they do.
