but I feel like treating children as small adults and giving them weapons is different from giving children wands and then also giving them the ability to poison/kill dozens of people (cuz in HPMOR transfiguration is that dangerous), or giving them control over what could be incredibly destructive creatures, like Pokemon.

Still you do have a point. I remember being shocked when I read that, back in the day, the age of typical Aboriginal Walkabout was 10-16, not just 16 on the dot. Our ideas of how children should behave are firmly rooted in culture.
