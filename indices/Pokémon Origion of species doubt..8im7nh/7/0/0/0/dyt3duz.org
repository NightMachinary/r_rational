If you treat children as adults, and you let adults have WMD, then children will have WMD. QED.

Children are highly sensitive to expectations. If all children were required to do advanced math, many or most would be able to. If they were required to get jobs and earn a living, many or most would be able to. After 10-12, children don't have really glaring cognitive deficits like they do up to that point. In cultures where they're treated like adults, they more or less also act like adults in most meaningful ways.

Note that I'm not saying that we should treat children as adults. Frankly, I don't think we treat adults very well. But I think they should have more autonomy then they do now. Two generations ago in the US children could walk freely. Now they're trapped inside their homes.
