  Another doubt is I did not fully understand that why a Pokémon listen to its trainers after getting caught, like are they brain washed in the poke ball ?

I believe that that is the canonical Pokémon answer. Kids capture wild animals, trap them in a tiny ball until they develop Stockholm Syndrome, then use them for glorified dog fighting.
