in addition to the answers about why it might be realistic because X, Y, Z, I'll add that I actually am just fine reading stories with a conceit like "yeah, these kids are pretty smart, so what?" without much justification. Because I like rational fiction, I like reading stories about highly intelligent people with lots of agency talking about bayes theorem and the experimental method, so I just accept that yeah, the characters will do those things even if it needs to be a bit unrealistic to make that story happen.

"unrealistically smart/mature characters" just isn't in the same bucket for me as being internally inconsistent or having unrealistic travel times or whatever. Although I do think it's great when a story goes an extra mile to justify why its characters are the way they are in an elegant way.
