I might be biased because I have teaching experience in a extra-curricular k-12 robotics program, but basically every day I volunteer with the program I receive strong evidence that the vast majority of people underestimate the intellectual capacity of younger people.

I've seen students in the 12-15 year range excel beyond many adults in programming, mechanical engineering, business development, and programming. The only difference is the students are in an environment conducive to testing and developing their skills in a way that they find rewarding and entertaining.

I have no doubt that the 14 year old student I had the pleasure of working with who developed the team's award winning artificial intelligence system would theoretically have the intellectual capacity to succeed in many of the environments we see younger protagonists in, especially if forced to do so by some situation.

--------------

I think the thing that makes a protagonist different than some NPC in these cases is the motivation and determination to utilize their mind effectively and not just give up.

The protagonists I enjoy reading about are intelligent - yes - but I believe the vast majority of people are more intelligent and have much greater mental capacity than they give themselves credit for. Successful protagonists just have the mental discipline to think through problems - something people often fail to do in real life just as well.

(Who here knows they have problems in their life they could fix, but refuse to put forth the effort required to actually come up with a solution? Only then to further put it out of their mind, guilty with the knowledge that they /could/ come up with a solution, but unwilling to define with certainty the reasons stopping them because then they /know/ they'd tear those reasons apart and that would mean they'd have to actually /do/ something about the problems?)

I'd say, too, the additional environmental pressures are a significant factor.

--------------

All that said, intelligence, knowledge, and experience are difficult to work with for writers. I have read that the origin of knowledge we learn is frequently more difficult to retain than the knowledge itself, and perhaps this is why it is often easy to accidentally give a character knowledge they should not have. Sometimes it's easy to make a character reach a solution that is based off of rational logic, but some of the steps require known information canonically unknown to the character. Raw intelligence cannot simply brute force its way forward at all times.

/That/ said, rational fiction authors generally do a much better job om average than most simply because I believe they do spend their time validating the logical steps each character makes during their decision making process - a constant ongoing "sanity check" of sorts.

--------------

As a post-note I think it just comes down to ability to actualize intellectual ability. It's not as if rational thought is some magic ability bestowed upon individuals reaching the society-designated age of majority. It's the emotional and situational situations that prevent people from reaching their potential. This is generally excusable for younger people because their physiological and brain-chemistry changes make it more difficult. There is ample real-world precedence for people being forced to move past these issues due to various favors, however. Likewise the vast majority of adults struggle with emotions and situations limiting them from using their mind to its fullest extent as well.
