I can't say anything about the knowledge side, but on the emotional strength side, their world is at war with wild Pokemons. Children grow up fast in these kind of environments.

Ok a bit about the knowledge side too: the 2 protagonists are "special", with mind related powers. They also grew up with a real scientist.
