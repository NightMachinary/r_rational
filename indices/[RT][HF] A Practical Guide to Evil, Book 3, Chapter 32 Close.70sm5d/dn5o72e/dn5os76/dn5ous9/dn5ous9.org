I'm still of the opinion that Robber is already named. The Goblins to all outside appearances don't /have/ names but their entire society is built upon secrecy and opacity. If he were named he wouldn't likely tell anyone or be noticed by anyone by the very nature of the name.

Also, all people who're named are unprecedented or unique in some way. Robber is a /male/ leader of his people who spat in the faces of the matriarchs and commands respect from all his mixed-gender underlings(minions).
