Au contraire.

  That was how he'd been talked into going south, anyhow, but he'd wondered why Archer had acquiesced and asked her as much. She'd been sent as a fae expert on loan from Refuge, not a soldier to be used in the Squire's wars.

  “Eh, just staying with the army would have been boring,” she'd replied. “Hakram's not even around to spar with anymore.”...

  ...“That seems like a thin motivation,” he'd said.

  “The idea of screwing over Sahelian does give me the good kind of shivers,” the woman had admitted. “And, well...”

  /Ah/, he'd thought. He could understand the unspoken reason as well. As a boy he'd sometimes wondered why his father did not lead the Calamities. He was the most powerful among them, after all, capable of wiping a city off the face of Creation in a single night. He'd always liked Uncle Amadeus, but like did not usually enter the equation when it came to villains. The strongest held command, that was the natural order. Now, though? He'd learned better. Masego could probably kill Catherine, if he truly put his mind to it. Two days of preparation required at least, but it was doable even with the power she'd gained in Arcadia. He didn't want to, though, and not just because taking up her burdens would be atrociously inconvenient to his research.

  She had a way about her, that... It was hard to explain. Sometimes he thought of it as akin to the way smaller celestial orbs circled around larger ones, but that ignored some fundamental aspects of it. It was warm and nice and almost addictive, being part of the family around Catherine Foundling. That heady sense of belonging, the way that when she talked you believed there was nothing you couldn't do. Apprentice did not enjoy ‘adventures', as a rule, but he believed his life would be lesser if he'd not followed Squire on them. And so he did not ask any further questions of Archer, because neither of them would be comfortable with where that conversation would take them. Some things were best left unsaid, and in the end he was not inclined to bare much of himself to this stranger. For all that it was nigh impossible to get the woman to shut up, Masego still knew next to nothing about her or what she was capable of. This was not, he thought, a coincidence.
