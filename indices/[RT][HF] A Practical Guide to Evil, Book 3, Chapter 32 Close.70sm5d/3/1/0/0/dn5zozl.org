There are other factors too.

He was the only [possibly] non-named in the room when Catherine got turned into a zombie, and he had no real good reason to be so close to a pretty clear Pivoting moment besides being Named.

He constantly gets into /noticeable/ shenanigans that people keep /retelling/ afterwards - e.g. that time he rode an explosive mule to Liese gates, whole thing with being a Special Tribune, he composes memorable songs that whole legion keeps singing afterwards, etc. To me it seems like that is one of the things primarily Named do. It's also interesting that I don't think we had a single chapter from his perspective since he became Special Tribune, which would seem like a pretty decent bet on when he might have gotten a proto-Name in order to have it by Liese.

It's not 100%, but I would be willing to put money on it.
