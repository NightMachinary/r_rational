It doesn't have to be robber, there are other potentials.

If we look at how they match:\\
Black = Squire\\
Ranger = Archer\\
Warlock = Hierophant\\
Captain = Adjudant\\
Assasin = Thief?\\
Scribe = Thief?

Thief was hired as informant, but takes part in combat at times, if she counts as Scribe, then robber can join as assasin. If thief is assasin, then its more likely that Juniper/Ratface/ someone else takes up the mantle.

Also, we still have Killian's impending ascesion coming up, though i'm not sure how being fae interacts with names
