The Thief isn't the Assassin, hence the different title, but in broad strokes it works out.

Cat is the juggernaut who breaks what won't bend, Ranger is basically Archer on steroids, Hierophant is Warlock with a different slant, Adjutant makes the logistics work and Thief is the one who skulks around in situations where throwing Cat at the problem doesn't solve it.
