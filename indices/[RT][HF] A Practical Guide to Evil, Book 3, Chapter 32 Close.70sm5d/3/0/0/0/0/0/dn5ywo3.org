Thief /so/ doesn't fit as assassin. She doesn't murder people much that we have seen, their personalities don't allign in any way (she even said so herself) and most importantly she isn't a villain. Robber fits Assassin role /much/ better. Thief seems like a pretty clear Scribe to me - a neutral-ish name responsible for a large spy network serving the leader directly and not affiliated with the other teammates, that leader found on an adventure in a city they visited. Wherever Scribe ever took the field with Black isn't currently known, so it's not clear if combat is even a factor.

As for Killian...in The Girl Who Climbed The Tower there is a line about "Love ends with the kiss of the knife". Take that as you will.
