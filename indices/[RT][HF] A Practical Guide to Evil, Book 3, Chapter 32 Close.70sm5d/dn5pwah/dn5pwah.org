RIP the Queen of Summer. It's weird; I actually kinda liked her from her brief appearance onscreen. Ranger's obviously got her ways of countering having the Entire Sun dropped directly on her, so I don't thing Summer's getting out of this one.

I guess Cat's out of Winter's bag now!

There were actually a lot of cool things this chapter: Masego being a fucking eyeless weirdo, Masego breaking the rules of magic (and getting magically trumped twice in the space of two chapters, which is honestly kinda neat), our little band of 5 (4 and 1?) getting their official name/prophecy.

EDIT: Oh, and going by the dialogue of both fae monarchs it sounds like they're getting a little tired of following their stories. I don't remember if it was said explicitly, but it sounds like the Queen was kind of hoping that they'd be able to break free of the stories.
