Yeah, I liked the Queen a lot. And Ranger seems deranged (/oh snap/). I'll be rooting for the fae here once Cat gets away.

(Of course the Queen chose her appearance and behaviour to make this kind of impact, and Ranger's behaviour is likely a good way to counter this kind of deception, but still. Cute!)
