Missed a brilliant opportunity of Cat snarking "The Woe? More like 'The WHOA!', am I right!?"

But, uh, I suppose narrowly escaping what is effectively a god and losing several hundred troops in a second kinda takes the wind out of anyone's sails.

Speaking of which, was it only a few hundred who died? Or was that only the legion casualties? I'm thinking there were many more deaths from the other factions allied with Cat.

This seems to only refer to the legionaries. But at the end we read:

#+begin_quote
  The Deoraithe, the legionaries. Nothing left but ashes. She had not protected them.
#+end_quote

Previously in the chapter, it's mentioned that the Deoraithe were given the other portal for evacuation, but specifically it says:

#+begin_quote
  I gave Duchess Kegan leave to use that one to *get her people out at her own leisure*, getting the Legions through the one at behind the palisades.
#+end_quote

To me this implies that the Deoraithe probably had many others left behind and covered in fire too, including, perhaps, Kegan herself. If Kegan dies, her friend/aide Adair (in the "Commanders" interlude) would likely take command - and he clearly doesn't think well or much of Cat. I doubt the death of his friend and ruler would improve his perception - the tenuous alliance could fall apart. Or if it's the other way around, Kegan may think this was a plot of Cat's and be enraged at the death of her old friend (and what she likely feels was a narrow escape for herself).

Also Winter might also have faced the brunt of Summer's sun:

  I looked west, to the hill, and saw the silhouette had yet to move. The Prince of Nightfall followed my gaze, single eye narrowing.

  *“If she is not gone by dawn tomorrow,* I will have my due,” he said.
#+end_quote

Sounds like the Prince of Nightfall was planning on hanging around until the next day, and while the remaining Winter troops might have left with the other Winter royal commanding the force, some could have also stayed and fried with him. Do we know the names of the other two Winter royals, the one who died and the one who lived, by the way?

Lots of good conversation on who make up "The Woe." I wonder what Ranger meant by the title being "too broad." Perhaps Thief, being a hero, and Archer, being... neutral?... don't fit well enough for an Evil team?
