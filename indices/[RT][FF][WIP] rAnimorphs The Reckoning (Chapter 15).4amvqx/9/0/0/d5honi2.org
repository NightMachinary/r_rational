Was reading through old threads and just had a thought after reading this comment - you say that Marco considered using scars instead of powers of two to mark his 'versions'. Was something like small tattoos considered? (i'm talking like tiny dots - I'd assume they'd heal pretty quickly). Heck, does morphing keep tattoos?
