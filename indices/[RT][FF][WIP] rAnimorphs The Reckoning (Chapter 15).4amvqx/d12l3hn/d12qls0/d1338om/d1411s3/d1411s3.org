- They don't really know to what extent the rest of the Earth is infested. We know that this is the spear head of the invasion, and they have /some/ evidence for that, but no where near enough to be confident that wherever Tobias heads will be safe.

- Tobias also runs some risk of being captured by not-military-infesting Yeerks. There needs to be a very solid reason to massively increase the impact of that risk by putting the device in danger as well.

- The (both typically overcautious and reasonably sane sides of the) military reaction will view the Animorphs & friends as a large, if a little less pressing, threat. Perfect imitation, just like the Yeerks, is a huge security hole in all current military and political systems. Giving the military the device and sufficient knowledge immediately completely undercuts the Animorphs ability to keep themselves relevant long enough to prove their worth and amenability to cooperation.

- Handing over the device means handing over the primary means to effectively combat the Yeerks. The semi-reasonable teenagers are completely out of their depths, sure, but trusting the massive bureaucracy with an unexpected threat that must be handled quickly and correctly doesn't sound like a clear path to victory either. Best to keep the cards that would enable you to still have a chance close to your vest.

- If the military controls the device they won't, after the implications hit, just be using it in the fight against the Yeerks.

--------------

For this to go well, Tobias should emulate Elfangor. Presenting himself as a stranded alien general with only a handful of surviving guerrillas willing to help puts the Animorphs and the war in a much better position than the truth.
