Haha, all right then. I decided to just lurk after reading it but your pleas and my nostalgic love for the series has pushed me into commenting.

The multiple back-and-forth people-acquiring has me a little lost. Right now I'm handling it the way I do for stories with time-travelling or other complex scenarios - where I'm aware that the author has put a lot more thought into it than I have/am willing to. I'm glossing over the details and focusing more on how the narrative uses it.

Is there much to be gained in discussing plans with a not-very-different past self, when all the objections and points that the 'copy' can raise, you can+probably already have thought of? It doesn't seem worth it, especially with the cost of psychological trauma from watching yourself beg for life.

Which brings up another point: the existential crisis of morph death is slightly unrelatable to me. It's a little better here then last chapter with Jake, when my view is "No harm no foul, Jake Prime isn't coming back, so agonizing over being a copy isn't the best course of action especially with an alien war to win." With Marco 2, I sort of get it, but the scene where he dies... maybe wasn't visceral enough? I'm still relating more to Macro Prime's mindset, where obviously knew this would happen, and it didn't seem to impact him that greatly if he's planning to do it again.

And if I understand your morphing rules correctly, if you get trapped as a nothlit of a morph-capable person, you can still morph? Which is what fakeJake is? Then can't Marco just become a nothlit of himself instead of murdering his copy? Then he'd have two brains in one head all the time, and subsequent self-morphs will result in a doubling of minds each time.

...As I typed that, I realized that the prime brain dies in Z-space somewhere... lol, congratulations, you've made me stop being lazy while reading and actually think through the rules. Oh, I guess this is your mechanic instead of miracle demorph-healing... where you have to commit suicide each time and let an older copy take over... Now that's dark... and I feel dumb, that's what you meant by version control. Huh, I should have realized this with the Jake chapter. Maybe I was too busy thinking "hey, this is different from canon!" to realize the implications of what happened with Jake.

Haha, I guess you can take my rambling as feedback if you want, I had to type out half a dozen paragraphs and organize my thoughts because it wasn't clear to me at first. Might be a failing of my own, and not of the story, to be fair, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.

I just went back to reread and that whole portion gave me problems.

"Six days" - From the point Marco 2 was copied? "One for the memory..." - What memory? "three of us, where right now there were only two" - Why a new copy tomorrow? Is the plan to do it every five days? "My idea. Me---the Marco in between." - Wha...? Who? In between what? Aren't there only two of you?

I know you want concrete suggestions, but never having written anything myself, I don't have anything that I feel would be constructive. I think my complaints so far sound like I'm saying "Just spell everything out for me-!"... but no, that would be really crude.
