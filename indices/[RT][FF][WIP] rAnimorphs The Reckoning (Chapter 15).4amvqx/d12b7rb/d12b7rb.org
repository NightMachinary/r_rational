I love Marco; he and Jake are, to me, the two best thinkers in the entire group, with Cassie on the way, but lacking the detachment both seem to show at their best. Creating and extinguishing cloned consciousnesses of yourself, essentially doubling your brain power, a multiplication that will only get greater as your perspective shifts and the clone's doesn't, allowing both of you to look from different angles... brutally efficient.
