By the way, this is 20 days late, but I'm pretty sure you're still having the feedback problem, so here goes my stab at it.

Have you tried going, I don't know, wilder? I get the feeling that what you write is sort of what I expect, not in terms of making predictions, but in a way that makes your writing feel like the opposite of dissonance. I'm not sure what I'm getting at, but I suspect I'm just saying your minimum quality is too high for me to be able to point out any flaws. I'm not sure if anyone else agrees at all with this, but if so, it means criticisms from readers might not be accessible to you. Pointing out how to be less awful is easy, pointing out how to be more awesome is not.

So maybe you should try to experiment more? Try to write in styles or with characters you're not comfortable with, and see what sticks. Or don't. I have honestly no idea what I'm saying.
