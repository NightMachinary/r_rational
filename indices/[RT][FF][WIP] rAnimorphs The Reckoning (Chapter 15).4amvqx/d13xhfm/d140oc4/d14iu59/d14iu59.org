On this line of thinking, what happens in your universe with these following situations:

- Someone /without/ earplugs is infested while in human/HB/Andalite morph and then is forced to demorph? Does the Yeerk reattach to the new brain while the morph occurs around it? Or, do the artificial Yeerk neurons prevent/interfere with control of a morph? That's some pretty amazing immunity if so.

- Someone /with/ earplugs is infested while in human/HB/Andalite morph and then is forced to demorph? Does this kill the Yeerk, or are the earplugs successfully bypassed?

- On the question of whether earplugs are retained by morphing - if they were, shouldn't they interfere with the artificial neurons needed to control the morph? Would it have been possible to revive Jake2 then by re-inserting earplugs instead of burning off the tissue?

I've specified human/HB/Andalite morph here as those are the species we've seen infested so far.
