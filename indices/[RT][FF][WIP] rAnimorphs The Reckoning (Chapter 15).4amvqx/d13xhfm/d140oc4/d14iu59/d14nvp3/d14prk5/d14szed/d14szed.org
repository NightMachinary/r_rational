It seems to me that the Yeerk is literally incapable of having any influence over the demorphing process, in this case. The morphing tech is tied to and controlled by the original body (and the emulator tech running that body's algorithm, while it's in stasis). That's how come Esplin/V3 can control Alloran's morphing and demorphing---he's fused with the true body, and therefore can manipulate the tech present in the brain and get himself emulated, etc.

If a Yeerk infests a morph, though, it's insulated from the control layer---it just /can't access/ the part of the morphing tech that decides when to demorph, because that's out in Z-space and beyond their touch. Indeed, while I haven't thought this through all the way, it's possible that a Yeerk inside a morph can't even access the morpher's memories and personality, but instead can only touch the animal underneath and the "blank Yeerk" conduit. They're much more cut off than they would be otherwise, and entirely at the whim of the morpher. The only exception I can think of is that the Yeerk might be able to cause the body so much physical pain or emotional turmoil that it could blackmail the morpher, or prevent them from mustering sufficient focus, i.e. "I can torture you enough in the 45ish seconds before I really start to die/disappear that I can prevent you from disappearing me in the first place."
