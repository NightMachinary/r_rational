Feedback so far:

- I know that visceral self-preservation isn't something you can control, but I still feel Marco is a bit, um, too fatalistic about the whole 'being a copy' thing. I'd expect him to think of counter-arguments to his own complaints, like how being reset is basically equivalent to taking a drug that gives you two-hours-long amnesia.

- Also, self-morphing! Version control! Asymmetric self-mind-reading! Forcibly extracting secrets from traumatized andalites who have no idea what's going on! \o/

- "Cassie's sitting this one out"... Ouch. Ouch.

- Wikipedia saves the world! Again! Remember to donate money to Wikipedia, people.

- What did Marco morph? It has feathers and scales? Did they mix DNAs to make it?

- The yeerks are recruiting PMCs now? Makes sense, they're almost as mobile and much less supervised than national militaries. Crap, they're going fast.

- Wait, so Chapman stays a principal, but Tidwell becomes a mercenary? Huh. Also, eeeeee, Illim and Tidwell! I think V3 namedropped Aftran as some sort of password, too. Not sure what it means for the future, but I do hope we're going to see pacifist yeerks.

- Psychological torture! Dramatic five seconds countdowns! Man, this really is Animorph. Also, Jake's offer to Illim is the same Elfangor does to Loren's yeerk in Andalites Chronicles. Well, except for the part where Elfangor lies and kills the yeerk anyway, because it's that sort of kid book.

- I kind want to know what Illim said to Tidwell to persuade him to let him go. Is there as chance we'll get alternate yeerk/host POVs in the future? Also, what happened to the yeerk that was previously in the cylinder? Did they squash him? Did they have a spare, empty cylinder?

- It looks like Jake's default position is now standing around like an officer with his hands behind his back. I wonder what /that/ looks like.

- "Its name is Illim" Yeah, but what was the name of the yeerk you took out of the cylinder to fit Illim inside? Anyway, good to know you guys still have a conscience. Not sure it'll do you any good if you're still planning to blow their pool up.

- Jake screwed up again. I like that it's because of a stupid reason "I didn't know what to do with him and I was pressed for time" instead of something overly dramatic like "I knew deep inside myself that it was wrong but I was overwhelmed by the dark side". As long he doesn't make an habit of it.

- And now the Animorphs are actually called Animorphs. And Marco comes up with the name in basically the same awkward forced way he did in canon. Yaaaay!
