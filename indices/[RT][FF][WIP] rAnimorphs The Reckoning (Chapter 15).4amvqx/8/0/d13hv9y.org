Thank you super much for the feedback.

I think that future Marco morphs will be much more mentally prepared/resigned/fatalistic about it, given that they'll have the memory of this first time and know that a) Marco Prime isn't screwing around and b) Marco Prime isn't taking it lightly, either.

Marco was morphed into [[#s][spoiler]]

Re: getting various minor canon characters in, I don't actually have a mechanism that explains why Tidwell isn't one of the teachers for the school except that then he wouldn't have been a part of the convoy, and I figured either way there was a valid reader complaint ("This character is basically Tidwell; why'd you create an OC?" vs. "Why'd you change Tidwell's backstory when you could've just created an OC?"), so I just went with the option I liked better.

I think it's getting more and more likely that we'll see other Yeerk/host POVs than just Esplin. My thoughts on what happened to the other Yeerk is that Jake murdered it JUST NOW (just before going to the shack) so that they could have an empty stasis cylinder. The previous Yeerk had already been acquired and "didn't work," and they had no particular reason to keep it around.

Re: conscience, yeah. I imagined a scenario where Jake promised to return Illim to the pool, and then ... well ...

Thanks again for your thoughts. Very very much appreciated.
