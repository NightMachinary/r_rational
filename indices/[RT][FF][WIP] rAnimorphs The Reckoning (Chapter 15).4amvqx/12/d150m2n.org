So I am only up to chapter 11 at the moment, and I am /really/ enjoying it so far, but something came up while I was reading.

What is Jake's brain doing when Marco is morphed into Jake. Not Jake's actual brain but the body that Marco is inhabiting, what is that brain doing? You mention that the animal brains have some instinctual effect on the "mind" of someone who is morphed into the animal, but does a human brain, with all it's neural connections, have some of that persons consciousness floating around?

Does that make morphing into another human any different from Yeerk takeover? I mean it's a copy of the human, and not the original--but it's still real, and probably terrifying, for the copy.

Just a random thought I had, and if you address this in future chapters, or if I straight up missed it earlier then let me know.
