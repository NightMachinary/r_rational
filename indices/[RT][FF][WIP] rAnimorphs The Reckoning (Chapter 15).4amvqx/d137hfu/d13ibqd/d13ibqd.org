Thank you very much for taking the time to write out your thoughts. Super appreciated!

What I imagined Marco figuring re: past selves was something like "Okay, I've been looking at this plan from the inside for the last few days, and talking myself into thinking it's good and glossing over the flaws. What I'd really like is to share it with somebody who's got a healthy dose of skepticism and an outside perspective, but Jake's been talking it through WITH me and I don't trust Erek or Ax and I don't respect Cassie or Rachel or Garrett as rational thinkers. Hmmm. Man. You know who I /do/ trust? Myself. Like, if I /wasn't/ already primed/anchored on the plan as it currently exists ..."

I think Marco's view on "murdering" his past self was basically "this sucks, and it is a price I'm willing to pay; I'm willing to wake up as the copy, and die, but this first time took me sort of by surprise, and I'm not going to flinch away from the horror of it or gloss over it; I'm going to stay with him/me through the whole thing, and listen to the fear, and take the abuse, because if I'm willing to murder myself then I should at least admit that's what I'm doing and ACTUALLY HANDLE it, rather than plugging my ears and going 'lalalalalala'."

... yeah, you lose morphing power when you go nothlit (you also lose earplugs; Jake no longer has them, and is as vulnerable as Garrett). They used the blue box to give Jake2 his morphing power back (and he immediately used it to reacquire himself, which was a subtle detail from the previous chapter---when Garrett was going to go Yeerk and infest Jake2, Jake2 was actually in his new morph armor (as evidenced by his use of private thought speak in human form), just in case Garrett turned out to be untrustworthy or something else went disastrously wrong).

Marco thought up the numbers scheme (because he's read Ender's Game, of course) to differentiate self-morphs. Then he counted doubles up to the first one he couldn't just immediately figure in his head, and memorized it. Then he spent a day thinking about that answer, so that the number would get encoded into long term memory/become a part of the physical structure of his brain. Then he had Rachel acquire him and morph him, and he acquired himself back, storing the copy. The plan is for him to memorize a new power of two every week, and reacquire himself every week. I haven't yet decided whether he's bugging everyone else to do this, too, or is quietly doing it on his own, with Rachel's uncritical unthinking help. Basically, he doesn't want amnesia lasting more than a week, if he has to do what Jake did and refresh his body.

"The Marco in between" was in reference to the fact that there were, at that point, two copies (his original morph armor, and his new, "now I know what's going on" updated saved version). Once Marco Prime does another save-game, there'll be three.

Thanks again for your thoughts. I'm extremely grateful.
