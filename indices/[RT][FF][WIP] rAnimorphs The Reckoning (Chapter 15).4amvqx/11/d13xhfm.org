Animorphs was a staple of my childhood. This is a touch of nostalgia. I am in love with this fanfic - never stop writing it. (This is a short and uninformative review, I know, but maybe I'll get around to writing longer feedback for a future chapter).

Question: does the yeerk-killing tech that Elfangor gave the animorphs work while you're in morph, and does Jake still have it? (And is it triggered voluntarily?) I've been thinking about this and can't quite settle on an answer. My guess is that since it "blends sufficiently well with the body's hardware to be preserved during the morphing process" (as Elfangor said), then it gets brought into stasis with your original body, so it doesn't automatically work in morph - unless you acquire yourself from someone else, in which case you would presumably acquire the device (again, "sufficiently blended") and be able to morph it. If that's the case, then Jake still has the device implanted in himself, even when he morphs into himself - but they were going to put Garrett into his head as a yeerk, which would kill Garrett unless the device was either voluntary or not present at all - but there is no reason for it be voluntary, since the yeerk could stop it if it got control in time .... And this is where I get stuck in my reasoning.
