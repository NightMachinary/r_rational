My curiosity in the case of a morpher-without-earplugs was how a Yeerk experiences/controls the demorphing process in the situation where a morph is infested instead of the original body.

That would be a really fucked up way to deal with morphs. Insert earplugs and break the z-space connection.

Perhaps that would work well with V3's clone bodies?
