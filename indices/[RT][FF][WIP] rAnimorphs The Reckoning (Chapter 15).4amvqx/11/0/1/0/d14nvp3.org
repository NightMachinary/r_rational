In both of the cases above, the earplugs are irrelevant (because they're off in Z-space with the rest of the original body). If for some reason a Yeerk infested a morph and then forced that morph to demorph, it would be signing its own death warrant as it got disintegrated.

As far as them being used to revive Jake2---maybe? I've been thinking of them as more of a simple gateway that notices stuff passing through it and then zaps that stuff, but I /did/ have Ax jerry-rig one of the earplugs to burn Yeerks out of that random family...
