All right. Questions time! Don't necessarily have to be answered, but perhaps could provide interesting plot points in the future. Your call, TK17!

- Marco is making a backup copy every week or so. Does each backup copy overwrite the previous one?

- How many backup copies could Marco feasibly create? Is there a limit?

- How does Marco differentiate between backups when he morphs them? Would/could there ever be a plot point where Marco or someone else morphs the wrong/way-too-early backup, creating a similar situation to Jake2?

- Would/could there be a plot point where Marco morphs successively older backups (chronologically younger versions of himself) in order to bounce an idea off each one to observe the shift in perspective/morals over time?

- With Marco about to do some serious abuse on poor Elfangor's brain, how much will he actually recall from the experience? Andalites are capable of much more advanced thinking than humans, so once Marco demorphs, will he be able to remember the specific thought processes or just the results of whatever problem he gets the Andalite superbrain to solve?

- I bloody love the YPM. We're about to see Illim (YESSSSSS), what about Aftran?

- In canon and in other fanfics, the idea of morphing Yeerk, while taboo, is necessary for the Animorphs to empathize with why the Yeerks do what they do. Do you plan on making it impossible to morph Yeerk, or will they have to find a clever workaround?
