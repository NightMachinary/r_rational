Context: mfwsakmmfos is a fanfiction by Earthscorpion, crossing over NGE and DBZ, with Gendo as a low class, yes, killer monkey man from outer space.

Now, the reason that I'm asking this question is this post:[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7532109/]] From the recent 'why rational!fic is inheritly bad thread. In it, Earthscorpion claims that since his fic fits all the requirements of a rational!fic, the classification is meaningless. Thoughts?
