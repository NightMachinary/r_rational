I removed this in the interests of A) keeping discussion confined to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5jvd89/d_outsider_viewpoint_why_rational_fiction_is/][this thread]], B) helping some of the worst tribalism to die down, and C) because this submission is not rational fiction and there's a limit on how many discussions we want on the front page of this subreddit at one time.
