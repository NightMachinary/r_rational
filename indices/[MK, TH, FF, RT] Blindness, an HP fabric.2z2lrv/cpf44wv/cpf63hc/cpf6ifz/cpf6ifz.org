The redemption I see is that even going by canon, there is a reason he is unique. It has never ever happened before, so unlike munchkin eleven year olds who happen to bootstrap godpowers with sheer gumption despite many thousands of years of /people not doing that/, in this case the lack of precedent is internally consistent.

Enough so at least that I can run with it as an axiom of the setting and see how it plays out.

It is also true that I have a high tolerance to Mary Sue-ism and think that overpowered characters can be an exceptionally good way to explore a fictional setting.
