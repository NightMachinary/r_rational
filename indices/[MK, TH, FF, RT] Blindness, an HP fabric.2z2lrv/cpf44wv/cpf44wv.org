This is difficult to call truly rational, as the lead character is overpowered and has a number of things go belief-stretchingly well for them, but the overall themes are of understanding magic through science and experimentation, deciding what to do with power, and somewhat about consequences of actions.

It is well written in the sense that it is readable at minimum.

Not a wholehearted endorsement, but pretty good.

Story is WIP, forgot that tag. And it is a fanfic, not fabric. Auto complete fte.
