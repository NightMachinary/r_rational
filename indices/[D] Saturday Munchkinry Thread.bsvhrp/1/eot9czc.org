Through the ages, there has been a powerful spell so costly that it was cast only by people of great means, and only in times of great need. The spell pulls in a person from another world, one suited for a specific task identified within the customization of the spell. It was a person from another world who brought the Midnight Prince low, a person from another world who pushed back the Benthic Horde, and a person from another world who saved this one from a fracture beyond time and space. The spell offers no guarantees, and in fact, has been cast twice after a first failure of the otherworlder, and its methods of accomplishing the needed tasks are often unorthodox and surprising, but it's been a tool of last resort for millennia.

Seven years ago, new agricultural techniques allowed one of the necessary reagents to be grown and harvested at a small fraction of the previous cost. At the same time, better mining techniques have allowed the opening of a mine which gathers the requisite ores at a small fraction of the previous cost. And lastly, flourishing education initiatives have meant that the requisite technical aspects are available at (yes, you guessed it) a fraction of the previous cost.

The end result is that this spell which summons the (unexpected) perfect person for the task can now be cast for approximately the price of a used car.

--------------

You get pulled to another world. You are summarily informed of the above, and told that your task is to prepare society for the influx of people from other worlds, which has already begun. Further, you're tasked with finding as many possible exploits that this spell makes available, as well as guarding society against those exploits where they would have negative effects.

For the purposes of this discussion, the world contains no useful magic whatsoever besides the summoning spell itself, which can draw from hundreds of worlds with varying technology levels, Earth being one of the most advanced.

For the purposes of this discussion, the person pulled in by the spell will be chosen using a combined metric of non-notoriety (how little their world changes in the next 1000 days given their absence) and efficacy (how likely they are to complete the task in the next 1000 days). The spell won't select people it deems "important" at all, though a low level of notability is acceptable, if no one less notable is available.

For the purposes of this discussion, the spell uses a strictly defined language to select tasks, one which doesn't allow for nesting, conditionals, adjective stacking, or much abstraction. Generally speaking, you can specify a verb and a noun, with not much else, though the noun /can/ be an individual if their full name is known and identifies them uniquely, or if the spell applies to everyone with that name (you cannot specify who gets summoned).
