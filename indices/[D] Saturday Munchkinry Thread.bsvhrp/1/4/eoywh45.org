Exploit: "Make me lots of money" is a thing that can be summoned up.

So is "Win the next election", and won't it be fun when multiple parties do this and all come up with super charismatic candidates who couldn't govern their way out of a paper bag?

They'll need better agricultural techniques to deal with the sudden population boom from people being summoned (and then the second population boom nine months after some bored teenage guy thinks "girlfriend-summoning spell" - that's a task that can be identified with one verb and the teenager's own name).

Then you need to bring legal structures into place to give a legal identity - and a degree of self-determination - to people who are all new, and her by no fault of their own. They must be looked after and cared for.

Also, measures must be put in place to handle rampant unemployment, when companies decide that summoning up a 'perfect employee' is so much easier than putting out an advert and doing interviews...
