The perceived devaluation is mystically attached to the physical object that you touch. Your power does not magically devalue that specific object /in general/ when seen thereafter.

However, suppose you bought a beautiful expensive handbag from a famous brand, and then the next day you see an extremely disgusting handbag on the floor, one that must be owned by some total scum who has done who knows what unspeakable things to the handbag, and then you realize the handbag is the same brand as the handbag you bought yesterday. Would you still treat your handbag to be as valuable as before, knowing now that its the preferred brand for various scum of the Earth?

So depending on the item, the perceived devaluation of single item may then non-magically reduce the perceived value of similar items. Items that depend on brand image or art pieces are especially vulnerable. Items that serve actual non-aesthetic uses like steel girders or drinking water may not be affected at all, since seeing the most disgusting creature in the world drinking a disgusting puddle of water won't make you stop drinking water forever, just not from that disgusting puddle.

  If you hold and orange and then peel it, do the slices of orange remain devalued? If you blend the orange slice into a smoothie is the smoothie itself devalued, and is it devalued by the same amount or proportionally less by volume, mass, etc? By merely existing, are you slowly causing people to become disgusted by the air around them?

Yes to all questions but the last. If you have reduced the perceived value of an orange by 10, the smoothie of that orange has its perceived value also reduced by 10 (minus the amount of orange that didn't make it into the smoothie). If you make a large smoothie of two oranges, one whose perceived value is decreased by 10 and the other you have never touched, the total perceived value of the large smoothie is still reduced by 10. But if the smoothie is perfectly mixed, and you divide the smoothie into two cups, the 1-orange-sized smoothie in each cup has its perceived value only reduced by 5.

If the mixing is improper, i.e., if you just glue a devalued orange to an untouched orange, then a viewer will perceive the devalued orange part of the glued-oranges as having less value than the untouched orange part. This also means you can hide the perceived value decrease by putting a shell around the devalued object. Cover a devalued object with paint you have not touched, and its perceived value has no magical reduction as long as the paint covers up the object. If the paint is scraped off the viewer will once again see the inside object with magically reduced perceived value. (And by clarifying this point I just realized you can make lots of money simply by devaluing items before buying then selling them after painting them.)

Gases can also have their perceived value reduced, but the magic works by sight. That means invisible gases, like those in normal air, can't have their perceived value reduced, because the viewer doesn't see the gases there.

There are other limits on the devaluation: If you touch an object bigger than you, you only devalue a you-sized portion of the object centered around the places you touch. So no devaluing the entire planet or entire atmosphere. And no matter how much you devalue an object, there's a limit to how much disgust a person can feel. You can't give people brain damage from feeling too much disgust, though you can make them freak out by surrounding them with utterly disgusting things and preventing them from escaping.

  In any case, I believe it would practical to live a (relatively) normal life somewhere in the far north where it is common to wear layers of clothing year-round. Simply put on a morphsuit and bundle up on top. The morphsuit is disgusting, but does not make the clothes disgusting. As long as the morphsuit is covered, you blend in just fine.

Yes that would work. Though it would probably be much easier to get a job you can do at home without ever meeting people face-to-face, like writing computer programs or doing youtube videos and so on. (Because the perceived devaluation does not work through screens.)

  As for profit, it would be as simple as keeping a variety of containers with various devalued substances within, such as cash, precious metals, and so on prepared in advance. Whenever you need what you want, simply display and offer to take what they have off their hands.

Might not work for cash (seeing a disgusting credit card won't make you throw your own credit card away), but the general idea is sound. "Carry around expensive easily devalued objects and make people throw theirs away" would work on several objects. Though you might not want to do this too often, otherwise people will start thinking of you as that weird guy who keeps carrying disgusting things around.
