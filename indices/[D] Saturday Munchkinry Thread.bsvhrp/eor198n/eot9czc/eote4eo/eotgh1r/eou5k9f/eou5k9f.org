  For the purposes of this discussion, the spell uses a strictly defined language to select tasks, one which doesn't allow for nesting, conditionals, adjective stacking, or much abstraction. Generally speaking, you can specify a verb and a noun, with not much else,

I have a feeling, that even though the spell cannot specify conditionals, there are still conditionals implicit in the summoning. For example, when the spell was invoked to summon a person who was uniquely suited to the task of defeating the Midnight Prince, the spell presumably said something along the lines of "<Summon person who can - spell identifier> <defeat - verb> <Midnight Prince - noun>". But under what conditions can this person defeat the Midnight Prince? In one on one combat? In army vs army warfare with the two being generals? In the event where the person is using his own technology, which is not brought along with the summoning spell?

If the conditions under which the summoned person can defeat the Midnight Prince are random, you would expect the summoning spell to fail almost all the time, since it would repeatedly summon various masters who can defeat the Midnight Prince, but only under certain niche conditions.

Since the summoning spell is well-known for succeeding instead of failing, one can conclude that something about the summoning spell is able to read the state of the world, and summon a person who has a great chance of succeeding at the task under the conditions presented by the state of the world.

If this is so, then even though conditions may not be specified in a spell, conditions can still be specified by changing the state of the world. If you want to summon a person who can defeat the Midnight Prince and be very resistant to heat, you could cast the summoning spell to summon the person in the middle of a burning building. If the spell can adapt to the dynamic armies of the Midnight Prince, surely it can adapt to a little fire.

To take this one step further, you can design an elaborate series of puzzle rooms, and summon a person in the start, and that person will be one that can both defeat the Midnight Prince and solve all these puzzles to get out and then find the Midnight Prince. Make more than one path in the maze of puzzle rooms, and you just specified an "OR" in the summoning spell: the person can either solve the puzzles on one path, or the puzzles on the other path. Add fake puzzle rooms that kill you when you solve them, and you just specified a "NOT" in the summoning spell: summon the person who can NOT solve this puzzle.

Since IF A THEN B is equal to NOT A OR B, you effectively have all the logical operations you need to specify conditionals in a summoning spell.

Now replace the various puzzles with problems that you actually want to solve, whether they are just paperwork for the summoned person to do before you let them go to the next room, or battle strategies that will only open up the next room if the battle is won.

Of course, the summoning spell may not be able to detect all these manipulations, so much experimentation is necessary. But by the end of it, you will understand far more about how to specify conditions in the summoning spell, and so be able to more accurately summon people that you want.

EDIT: Just realized my NOT room construction is flawed, but I'm confident there's a way to do it.
