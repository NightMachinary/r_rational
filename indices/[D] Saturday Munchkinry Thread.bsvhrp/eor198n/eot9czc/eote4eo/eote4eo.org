One big moral problem here is that human trafficking is now incredibly easy. For tasks like being a hero, it's completely believable that a pool of people exists that both have the talent/skills needed and would be happy to do such things, and the high costs mean that any summoning will have oversight, but with lowered costs that goes out the window.

For reference, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dp3cb/how_much_did_slaves_in_america_cost_in_todays/][this AskHistorians post]] says a skilled slave, adjusting for inflation, was around $50k, and a followup links a source on modern black market prices that still puts children above the used-car threshold.

Consider as well that being taken to another world entirely is going to absolutely remove any safety net/known figures of trusted authority, and you have the recipe for a global crisis. At a very minimum, criminal organizations and other such unethical groups will be abusing the spell for slave labor/sex trafficking.

How to combat this, then? We have no other useful magic, so that won't be able to detect the ritual; still, other modern techniques could be applicable here. The three main ingredients absolutely must be controlled, requiring governmental oversight for any summonings that are performed. Also, public awareness campaigns/posters advertising help to any such people are absolutely necessary, both to help them and to find any illicit summonings.

In general, assuming that the cat is out of the bag and summonings can't be banned altogether, accountability and prevention at the level of actual casting are the biggest areas that must be targeted, because once you have the perfect person for a task, likely that perfection will include being able to slip past anyone trying to keep watch and prevent whatever harmful task is their goal.
