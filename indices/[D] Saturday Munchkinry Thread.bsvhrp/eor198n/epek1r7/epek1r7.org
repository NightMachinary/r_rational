Darth Sidious is clever, and must have some plan to use Skywalker or win over his loyalty.

For instance, I'd expect an evil patron to have created a file of blackmail material^{1.} Depending on how things play out, he could try to win Skywalker to his side, or he could just disgrace Skywalker at some maximally useful point.

Figuring out his plan and combating it seems hard, and just leads to a regress of "Haha! I out thought you!"

So fuck that. Promote Skywalker into a project that's important, urgent, and far from Corsont. Maybe the Gungans need someone to help run their disaster-relief after a solar flare took out their Eastern hemisphere.

This gives Skywalker a feeling of being useful, moves him out of Palpatine's influence, and should generally keep him too busy to get pulled into various political maneuvers.

^{1} Skywalker might not even know or have done anything wrong. Palpatine just needed to engineer a situation with bad optics
