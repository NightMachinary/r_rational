First, it is obvious that Skywalker plays a key role in some Sith plot, as there would be no reason otherwise for Darth Sidious to have been his patron for years. Even if Skywalker has not personally fallen to the dark side, he has still been working closely with Sidious for years, and so Sidious knows Skywalker too well.

So first and most importantly, you must convince Skywalker into voluntary self-imprisonment within the Jedi temple. Tell him that years of unguarded contact with Sidious has let Sidious learn how to manipulate him with ease, and that any action he takes could be furthering the cause of the Sith. Tell him also, that his very presence as an active force in the Republic will endanger everyone he cares about, as Darth Sidious knows who he cares about, and will gladly involve them in dangerous Sith plots to manipulate Skywalker further. Therefore it is unfortunate, but Skywalker must retire to the Jedi temple until Darth Sidious is defeated.

The next step is capturing a clone and analyzing him. The clones are clearly part of a Sith plot, since Sidious couldn't possibly have strengthened the armies of the republic out of goodwill. Interrogate the clone. Scan him with the Force, with X-rays, with every method imaginable, to find out what Sidious has done with the clone army. With luck, you may uncover the Sith plot without anyone noticing. Otherwise, you have to go to the clone army creation facilities and force the creators to tell you. The latter plan is significantly more risky, as Sidious would definitely be looking closely at those facilities.

If you find evidence that Palpatine has rigged the clone army creation facilities, you can then reveal it to the public, and denounce the Chancellor as a tyrant forcing the clones to obey him even if its against their will. Systematically reduce the powers of the Chancellor and get others to vote against him on every issue until he is removed from his position, then the Jedi can freely strike at him.
