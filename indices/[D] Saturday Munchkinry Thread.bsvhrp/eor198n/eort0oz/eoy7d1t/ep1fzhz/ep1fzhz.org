  Let's start by talking with Master Yoda.

I agree with most of what you propose, but... What makes you think that you can contact Master Yoda securely? If Anakin's story is true, he's surrounded by the troops that the Chancellor arranged for the Jedi to get, and, if the governing structure of the Republic, and computer systems of the Jedi Order have both been compromised (and the latter is certainly the case, with Kamino having been deleted from the Jedi database), then how can you trust your communication systems?

But yes, I agree that Windu didn't take the best options available; I /still/ think that Palpatine had all-but-won at that point. About the only things that the Jedi had going for them at that point were: that they had a reputation as war heroes, that they could make a big deal out of Palpatine refusing to surrender power, and that Palpatine needed them to act against him /first/, or he wouldn't be able to justify eliminating them.

The only other thing to be careful of, is that you have to handle Skywalker /very gently/. If you manage to turn him fully against Palpatine, /he/ might attack the Chancellor and justify triggering Order 66 and the founding of the Empire.
