Here's the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0efr3g9fW8][scene in question]], to set the stage. Looking at this again with a critical eye, Windu's actions are simply baffling.

Just imagine, a young Jedi, but the most promising Jedi ever in history, 'The Chosen One', casually walks up to you and tells you that the chancellor is a Sith Lord (as if it's just a minor problem, nothing you need to be called about immediately), and that he 'Knows the ways of the force and has been trained to use the dark side'... ?!?!?!

Anakin, I sense your confusion, and my mind is positively /brimming/ with questions right now as well. Firstly, how could Palpatine be a Sith Lord without the Jedi Council sensing it immediately?

Maybe he's clouding your senses?

He would have to be an extremely powerful Sith to cloud the senses of even Master Yoda. But let's suppose that's possible. How do you know that he's a Sith Lord?

Um, well I overheard it while he was talking.

Anakin, you had just told me that the chancellor of the Republic is an incredibly powerful Sith Lord with no hesitation whatsoever. When I asked you how you knew it, you started off by stalling with 'well' and 'um'. Your sudden hesitation makes me think you just lied to me. Aside from which, you want me to believe that the ultra-powerful Sith Lord who has successfully hidden from the Jedi council is sloppy enough to reveal his true nature to other people in the presence of potential eavesdroppers? Nope, I'm not buying it. You're in on this somehow and you're covering it up, and poorly. But look, if what you said earlier is true, you may have just saved the Republic. I don't care if you're in on this somehow, I just want to get to the bottom of this. Try again. How do you know that Palpatine is a Sith Lord?

Search your feelings master Windu. You'll see that I'm telling the truth.

Anakin, no. You /just/ told me that an ultra-powerful Sith Lord is clouding my feelings. Now you're asking me to trust those feelings. Think about it. Right now, our only option is to think logically. Whatever you think you know from your Jedi senses, disregard it. Let your feelings go away, and for now just act on the basis of factual information and logical conclusions built upon it. Again, how do you know that Palpatine is a Sith Lord?

Okay, he just told me a story. We were sitting at the opera talking in private and he revealed that he had some knowledge of the dark side. He told me a Sith legend about a Darth Plagueis the Wise, a Sith Lord who could use the force to create life and prevent death. He then said that Plagueis taught his apprentice everything he knew, and then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. The way he told it, it sounded like Chancellor Palpatine was implying that he was the apprentice.

Alright, I'm still skeptical, but that sounds closer to the truth. Still though, why would an incredibly powerful Sith Lord reveal that to a Jedi, let alone "The Chosen One", the Jedi who is to bring balance to the force? Presumably, if he's telling you something like that, he's expecting you'll work with him rather than against him. What did he offer you?

He didn't offer me anything. I think he was just...

Bullshit Anakin. You've told me that he successfully hid himself from the Jedi council but then revealed himself to the Chosen One. He wants you in his pocket, and he knew you well enough to determine that it was safe to tell you that story. Since you've lied to me, it seems most likely he succeeded. But I know you're not a bad person, Anakin. I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't be happy about a Sith Lord becoming powerful enough to rule the Republic as an emperor. He's obviously offering you /something/ incredibly important to get you on his side. What is it?

Okay, he implied that he would teach me how to prevent death.

Alright, I can kind of believe that. Still, it doesn't seem like an even trade. Learn how to prevent death, but help a Sith Lord become even more powerful. I'm not quite buying it. Unless he's claiming he'll teach you how to prevent all death, everywhere, forever? Is that it?

I don't think so. It didn't sound like he was talking about anything that powerful.

Then what's the secret that you aren't you telling me? Who are you trying to keep from dying?

/sigh/ Padme. I want to save Padme from dying.

Okay. Why exactly do you think Senator Amidala is going to die?

I've had dreams, visions of Padme dying in childbirth.

Oh. Hmm. That's a lot to take in. But okay, so you're going to be a dad, Padme will be the mother of your children. You're having visions of her dying, and you're willing to do anything to save her. Alright, this is fairly manageable. Remember how we just talked about Jedi senses? Don't trust them. Palpatine could easily be giving you visions of Padme dying and then exploiting them. Isn't it odd that he specifically offered to help you learn how to prevent death? He has to know about your visions at the very least, and if he's clouding all of our senses, it seems rather likely that he's inventing the visions as well.

I don't think so. I trust my visions.

Anakin. Think logically. There is no good reason to trust Jedi senses right now. You're being deceived.

Master Windu, I understand, but I've had visions like this in the past that were very accurate.

Anakin, that doesn't matter. Did you sense that Palpatine was a Sith?

No, but the visions are too real. There's no way they could be made-up.

Anakin. Look, you've already acknowledged it. Palpatine is clouding your senses too, and you've admitted that you couldn't tell. There's really only two choices - one, if you really believe he's a Sith Lord then you can't trust your own senses because he's manipulating them perfectly and seemingly knows about your visions, or two, Palpatine isn't actually a Sith Lord and he's just trying to manipulate you into thinking that he is. In the first case, Palpatine is offering you a solution to a problem that may well be fabricated. In the second case, he's offering you a solution that he's not actually capable of providing. Either way, siding with Palpatine is a bad choice. See my point?

Well... okay. Fine, you're right. But there's still a chance that the visions could actually be real and he may be my only way to save Padme.

Anakin. Think logically. If Palpatine is a Sith Lord, then he must have been giving General Grievous commands this whole time. If what you're telling me is correct, then he's been secretly running both sides of the galactic civil war the whole time to maneuver himself into the position of chancellor and to acquire emergency powers. This is the kind of person that you're going to trust when he says he can help you save Padme if you'll help him?

Okay, okay, I get it. He cannot be trusted, my senses cannot be trusted either. What am I supposed to trust then, the Jedi council?

Facts, verifiable facts. And logic to connect them together.

Okay. So what do we do?

Let's contact the council and tell them what we know. If Palpatine is really powerful enough to cloud the senses of the entire Jedi council, we'll most likely need several Jedi masters to have a chance of taking him down. Let's start by talking with Master Yoda.
