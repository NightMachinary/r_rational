All right, here are my own thoughts:

Sidious's first weakness is that he's now acting alone. Sith keep one apprentice, and one only, and Dooku was just killed by Skywalker. No one in the Republic would have been brought into the Separatist side of the scheme, and no one within the Separatists would be clued into the Republic side.

His second weakness is the perception of democratic norms. Everyone is expecting him to hand power back at the end of the war (which has just ended). He's vulnerable to pressure on that front.

His third weakness is that Sith foresight isn't perfect. Now that the Jedi know who they're fighting, they can probably turn the tables and block him the way he's been blocking them.

Step one is to take a moment and /plan/. Palpatine has set all of this up, so you don't want to blunder into any of the traps he's undoubtedly set. Right now, he's the democratically-elected leader of the Republic, newly rescued from the Separatists, and has led the Republic to victory. Yes, you're an order of war heroes, but you're also scattered and depleted from the war, while he's at the heart of his strength.

Step two is to contact your allies in the Senate, as securely and discreetly as possible. Get them to start putting pressure on Palpatine to return the power that he was given to the Senate. At the same time, announce a party for the heroic troops returning home: clones, Jedi, and all. Play up the fact that the Jedi won this war (under the Chancellor's leadership, of course).

Step three is to try to isolate the Chancellor from his resources, specifically Skywalker and the armies. Send Skywalker out in a very fast ship, with the task of informing the rest of the Jedi Council of the treachery: in person, as communications might be intercepted. Give him assurances that you won't move against Palpatine until he gets back. Send someone else, someone very intelligent, to Camino, to find out how the armies might have been compromised. Gather evidence that Palpatine was the leader of the Separatists.

Step four: just before the party, leak the Camino information. Through your Senate allies, demand a full examination of the clone troops, for their own health. Use this window to get the Jedi home, while leaving the troops off-planet. Increase pressure on Palpatine to resign.

Step five: When the examination of the troops is done, hold the party, and publicly accuse the Chancellor of treason, presenting the evidence you've gathered about his having created the clone army and that he's been leading the Separatists. Do so in public, in front of as many witnesses as possible.

Step six: *DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ARREST THE CHANCELLOR*. Let the Senate call for a vote of no-confidence, based on the evidence you've presented. Let him be stripped of his power. In an ironic twist, have the clones blockade the planet to prevent his escape.

Step seven: when the normal authorities fail to arrest him because he's a Sith Lord and can electrocute him, /then/ offer your services. Send the whole freaking Order after him. He's got the most recognizable face in the galaxy; he shouldn't be too hard to find.

Step eight: Victory!
