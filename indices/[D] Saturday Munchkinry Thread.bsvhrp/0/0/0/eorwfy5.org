Alternative plan that might work even better: assign teams of Jedi as bodyguards for every Senator, with the most powerful team guarding the Chancellor. Cite the separatist threat, and claim that the separatists may wish to assassinate the members of the Republic council, so they all need Jedi bodyguards 24/7.

If, it turns out that Skywalker was lying or mistaken, the Chancellor should welcome this extra layer of security. Otherwise, Darth Sidious will find it really really hard to control his various Sith plots while a team of powerful Jedi are watching him 24/7.
