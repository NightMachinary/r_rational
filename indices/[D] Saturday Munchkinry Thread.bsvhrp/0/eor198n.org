I'd like to reverse-Munchkin Emperor Palpatine (circa Episode III).

He has:

- Nearly-full control of the bureaucratic mechanisms of the Republic, due to being the Chancellor and having been given emergency powers to deal with the Separatists,
- A clone army which has been programmed with secret orders which only he knows the extent of,
- Total control over the Separatists and their droid army,
- A mole in the Jedi Council, who will side with him instead of the Jedi in any dispute, as he is, for all intents and purposes, holding that mole's wife hostage,
- The full knowledge of the Sith (from Darth Plagueis) and the Jedi Order (from Count Dooku), and
- The ability to "foresee" the future, and to block the Jedi from doing the same.

You are Mace Windu. You have just been informed by Skywalker that Palpatine is also Darth Sidious, leader of the Separatists. You have reason to suspect Skywalker's loyalties (as Palpatine had been his patron for years), but no definitive confirmation that he is a mole. Whether or not this is the case, Skywalker has told you Palpatine knows that he was coming here to tell you.

You do not /know/ that Sidious has implanted secret orders in the clones, but you have figured out that he is the one who commissioned the clone army in the first place, so taking precautions for such an event would be wise.

You're also smart enough to figure out that any direct attack, if unsuccessful, will be portrayed as an assassination attempt and used to turn the public against the Jedi.

Master Windu, Jedi Master, tactical genius, accomplished rationalist, and all-around badass: what do you do?
