For counter-inteligence: the basic bad-guy blackmail pitch sounds like "Oh no! There's a video of you doing X! If it gets out, your friends will turn against you and your reputation will be destroyed! Join me, and I can save you!"

Step 0 - that most orgs should do - is to have a standard briefing where you explain this tactic. Then set an org policy that you can trade in your security clearance for a "get out of jail free" card. Disclosing your fuckup will still get you fired, but it means you will have a life after

I want a step past that, to catch anyone who falls through the cracks. To do this I need to create common knowledge among the Jedi that (1) there's a faction who can protect you and (2) aren't the evil opposition.

Having a real opposition is hard an messy. So I'd find someone loyal and negotiate a performance.

Maybe Master Whosit and I have a very public blowup, with Master Whosit accusing me of being a war mongering bastard who has lost any sense of the true meaning of the force. Master Whosit leaves for the outer rim to meditate (and act as my spy master).

6 months later, one of Master Whosit's former padwans is assigned to a very secret mission. There are a couple explosions, and then I - very conspicuously - order the whole thing classified, and give the impression that there was a grand disaster that would be hugely embarrassing to the Jedi, and punish anyone who looks into it.

I'm make a show of getting ready to drum the padwan out of the Jedi / do various other horrible things. Then Master Whosit swoops on and pulls me into a private meeting.

(The "meeting" will actually involve us catching up and talking, but we can fuck up the room with lightsabers to create an appropriate number of rumors when the cleaning staff comes by)

I leave looking embarrassed, and Master Whosit conspicuously takes his padwan with him and leaves, and then the matter drops.

The upshot is that, when Palpatine makes his blackmail play, "Everyone Knows" that there's a third option, who aren't the Sith, and hopefully will go to them, rather than the dark side.
