  Go to strictly in-person auctions, touch the antiques to devalue them and buy them up for next to nothing, then resell them online for significant profit as the online purchasers will not be subject to the disgust until their delivery arrives.

Wouldn't the purchasers be very angry and think you sent the wrong item or put up misleading photos/descriptions? It's similar to if you put up a blind date photo of yourself: when the other person meets you, they will think you horribly misled them. You could use services that don't allow purchasers to complain about defective items, but then you could just send them shoddy copies without needing your curse at all.

  Earn money on the stock market by shorting companies and then using their products in Times Square or a similar public location to make people disgusted with them.

The more I think about it the more I like this idea. Physically touching expensive items one by one to manipulate their values is much much slower than manipulating the value of entire companies. Public displays can reach large fractions of a local company's customer base, allowing you to utterly wreck them and make yourself filthy rich in the process. Delightfully evil and effective.

  Improve public health by carrying around lots of different types of alcohol, cigarettes,

This could work as well, you could wreck the local branches of alcohol/cigarette companies.

Not sure it would work for drugs and weapons and bombs though, since you might be mistaken for a criminal and arrested.
