Nice. Building on your "paint shell" idea, you could make a veeeeery tidy profit as a flipper on various things, houses would probably take too long to get enough you-sized portions devalued unless you specifically just focused on the first room a buyer walks into and leaving them so disgusted they refuse to look at it any further.

Alternatively, by walking around barefoot on lots for sale for several hours per day, you can eventually make the land so unappealing to anyone that you can buy it at a pittance, after which all you need to do is remove and replace the topsoil.

Another fun career would be to work as a hypnosis aversion therapist or whatnot, by simply showing them the thing they don't want to do anymore. Smoker wants to quit? Make his favorite brand of cigs look utterly disgusting. The kind but potentially dangerous (in unintended consequences) method would be to let them keep the devalued item as a "totem" in case they ever slip up. The profitable method would be to only show it to them during your sessions to keep them coming when their perception of its value eventually normalizes.
