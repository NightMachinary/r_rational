Big question: is the devaluation mystically attached to the physical object, or does it cause a devaluation of that specific object /in general/ when seen thereafter? Because that's a significant difference in terms of munchkinry. To what degree of transformation does an objection remain devalued? If you hold and orange and then peel it, do the slices of orange remain devalued? If you blend the orange slice into a smoothie is the smoothie itself devalued, and is it devalued by the same amount or proportionally less by volume, mass, etc? By merely existing, are you slowly causing people to become disgusted by the air around them?

In any case, I believe it would practical to live a (relatively) normal life somewhere in the far north where it is common to wear layers of clothing year-round. Simply put on a morphsuit and bundle up on top. The morphsuit is disgusting, but does not make the clothes disgusting. As long as the morphsuit is covered, you blend in just fine.

As for profit, it would be as simple as keeping a variety of containers with various devalued substances within, such as cash, precious metals, and so on prepared in advance. Whenever you need what you want, simply display and offer to take what they have off their hands.
