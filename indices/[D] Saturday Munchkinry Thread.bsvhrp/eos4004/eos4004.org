You have been cursed with perceived devaluation: everything you touch (including yourself) has its perceived value permanently decreased the longer you touch it, until people feel utterly disgusted by it. The devaluation effect is rather quick: 1 minute of touching is enough to make people throw out gold bars/priceless family heirlooms/famous art pieces/etc. in disgust.

This curse only affects sight, so items that you touch still sound/feel/taste/smell the same. People feel utterly disgusted when they see you, but feel nothing in particular when talking to you by phone or by any medium that does not let them see you. This curse does not work through cameras. This curse also requires actual skin contact: touching an item through gloves does not devalue the item.

Is there any way to use this curse to benefit you?
