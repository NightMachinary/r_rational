My immediate thought is that if slavery is on the decline or largely eliminated, it will almost immediately make a comeback, especially sexual slavery. The cost isn't negligible, but given the description of the spell it seems like it would pull in people who are especially suited for being slaves both physically and mentally, it would still be common. Combine that with the fact that these people would be literally in another world, with no resources whatsoever and no knowledge, they would be basically helpless unless a very strong governing body stomped on slavery hard.

Oh, can we assume that the language of the world is either magically transferred into our head or some similar shenanigans making it so that everyone pulled into the world doesn't have to spend weeks to months learning enough to establish basic communication?

A scientific revolution would happen pretty quickly, given that engineers and scientists from Earth could be pulled in to complete R&D projects more quickly and otherwise advance a more primitive society into one closer to Earth's level. It would be hard to predict the precise effects of that without knowing more.

Trained mercenaries could be summoned in, people willing to fight without the incentive of actually caring about who they fight for. Depending on the material cost of the spell, you could possibly slowly funnel weapons armor and food into a covert location in your enemy's country, then summon a ton of people to fight. This would give extremely little warning to the defenders, as the majority of the army that is in the enemy's territory didn't exist until a day ago. Hiding a warehouse of goods is easier than hiding those same goods plus a bunch of people that don't like to stay couped up for weeks.

A lot of governance would likely be replaced by summoned people, because their competence in a given task could be ensured by a rather objective spell rather than whatever candidate selection technique you're using to sample from a much smaller and less qualified population of candidates. Generals, advisors, people who need good technical and theoretical knowledge and where a deep understanding of the current world they're in isn't super relevant. Given the constraints of the spell you couldn't pull the best of the best in these positions, since they would tend to be well known and influential, but you could pull people who did well in whatever training program they attended or who have achieved success but not huge success. It would ensure a base level of competence for high level positions that is hard to determine ahead of time.

I'm not sure what I would be able to do to prepare a society for these huge changes, but these are the changes I would anticipate happening.
