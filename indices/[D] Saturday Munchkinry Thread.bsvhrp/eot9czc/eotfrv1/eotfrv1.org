So they've summoned you as some version of "the perfect person to plan to help our world the most using more summons" and you're the most likely to complete this within 1000 days.

Here's the steps of my plan:

1. I don't know what I don't know or the specifics of most things. Give me summons of the best planners/advisors for: social engineering, politics, engineering, agriculture, and "the planner for the most useful field I haven't requested so far" until I think they are getting too niche. At this point you don't really need researchers or revolutionary thinkers, you will just be bringing already discovered science up to the modern age into this world.

2. Long term planning with these new advisors, and summoning them advisors as needed.

3. Further reduce summoning costs if needed, we are going to use waves of summons for each major tech level of each field to advance them to modern levels. Once the current workers have their field up to their comfort level you summon the next level up and have them modernize their field and so on.

4. Summon already skilled and motivated workers for each tech level you are reaching for to rapidly tech as planned above.

5. Once you reach the highest tech levels abuse the summons to get the best and brightest from all the world's that didn't have good opportunities in their world's. Set up a super university where these great minds can get educated then collaborate with each other to advance science. "Give me the person who would advance science most if given a free education" or even weaker wording since the spell will automatically avoid people who will revolutionize their own world's.

At some point you might have to conquer the world and set society moving towards utopian ideals, for efficiency's sake.
