  Can this magical water be cracked into hydrogen and oxygen?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure yet. On first thought I'm going with no, but I can change my mind. Oh, and this would be within a high fantasy setting but with a lot of magitech. Also a lot of science and physics knowledge from the isekai'd people, though most of it will be inapplicable in this plane.

  Can plants take in liquid water via the roots and emit gaseous water via transpiration?

Yes, living beings can interact with water or vapor in the usual ways as part of the metaphysics, which I won't go into. Suffice it to say that all living things have a quality which allows water within them to act normally.
