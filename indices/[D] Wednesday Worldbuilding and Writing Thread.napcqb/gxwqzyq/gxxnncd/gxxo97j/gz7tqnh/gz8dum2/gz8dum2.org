The idea that water that's been converted naturally inside a living being is made 'nonmagical' is actually a great idea, I'll keep it in mind.

As to the greenhouses idea, I don't think that would be necessary for them to do in this world, as I've pictured it. Vapor would rise in small quantities all the time, its true, but 90% of it would be emitted from keramos in the span of a few weeks in the peak of Rise season. Same with water, some would always be falling, but 90 percent of it would rain within the peak of fall season. Both are very dangerous, as you can imagine; a few weeks of torrential downpour(in the dark), and a few weeks of incredible humidity and little or no visibility.
