I would expect devices like this to become ubiquitous in every civil and criminal trial. The accuracy in both yes/no mode and with open-ended questions is better than the accuracy of the US justice system, which has an [[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-many-people-are-wrongly-convicted-researchers-do-the-math][estimated false conviction rate of 4.1%]]. With this device, juries would only be needed to decide if the defendant and witnesses are mentally competent enough to understand and remember the truth, and to ensure their questions and answers were phrased so as to leave no ambiguity about the truth.

This would likely also be used in interrogations of captured soldiers, spies, and terrorists. Interrogators could ask open-ended questions like "Tell me everything you don't want me to know", and use torture or "enhanced interrogation techniques" to force responses until the prisoner truthfully can answer 'yes' to "Have you told me everything you didn't want me to know?" There would obviously be a variety of other, similar questions, to ensure the prisoner has provided a thorough and detailed accounting of names, dates, plans, passwords, etc.

These devices may also be used by organized crime, guerilla, or paramilitary forces. People may be kidnapped and forced to give information like their bank account details, bank vault access information, details on government projects (like naming every person assigned to an investigation, and providing their addresses if known), etc. It probably would also be used in loyalty tests - every so often, every member of the organization has to swear that they haven't leaked any information to the authorities, plan to never do so, and don't know of or suspect anyone else of having done so.

This is obviously going to pose an enormous threat, and a substantial amount of effort would probably go into ensuring that people do not know things that would be risky to know. People involved in investigations of organized crime would likely only know each other by pseudonyms, and know nothing of each other's personal lives. The same would likely be true of organized crime, terrorist organizations, spy networks, etc.

In more sophisticated organizations, this might even be combined with a dead man's switch arrangement where each person needs to occasionally go to a personal lie detector combined with a speech-to-text encoder and truthfully state "I haven't been compromised and I remain loyal to [person/organization]". These devices could be rigged with explosives and anti-tampering mechanisms, while failure to return and make the required statement on time could also cause it to detonate. A random number sequence in the device would need to be sent on time to confirm that you're still loyal, so a missed checkup would result in any future meetup plans that involved you being canceled. Thus, if you catch one person, you've only caught one person. The rest of the organization continues functioning.

Lie detection would probably also make its way into politics and news. We would finally have an objective measure of whether or not someone is telling the truth, so it would be feasible for countries to require news organizations to tell the truth, and there would likely be substantial democratic pressure to make that happen. Politicians would probably also end up needing to tell the truth from time to time, e.g. while swearing their oath of office, while testifying, and possibly while debating each other.

Overall, this technology will probably favor dictatorships. It will provide a perfect loyalty test for dictators, and in some cases regime forces might go door-to-door asking people to affirm their loyalty to the dictator. In democracies, it could be used to make sure politicians are telling the truth, but the thorny issue is that it must only be the truth as they perceive it. People who are gullible, biased, and have been heavily propagandized may create an echo chamber of disinformation where no one is lying, but no one is actually telling the truth either.
