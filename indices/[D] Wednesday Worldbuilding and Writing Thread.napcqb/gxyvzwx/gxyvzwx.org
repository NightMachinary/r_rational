How would a world change if a *PERFECT LIE DETECTOR* was invented?

Some rules:

1. The plans of the detector are freely available online, not patented, and it is relatively easy and cheap to make (on the level of about 1000$ in off the shelf parts)
2. The Detector does not "know" what is the *objective* truth/falsehood, only if the person wearing it is telling (what is to them) a falsehood on purpose. Simply, its not a truth oracle, but a Catch-A-Liar detector.
3. The Detector is 99.9999% effective to detect lies in case of YES/NO questions, and 99% effective when discovering lies in open-ended questions. (ie: it can be confused to inconclusiveness if the lie is extremely long and logically convoluted, but only if the liar is also confused by their own lie, or deeply insane).
4. The detector is an electronic crown that plugs into a smartphone-like device. When it detects a brain pattern representing a lie in the making, it emits a loud beep and red light, as well as a pattern diagram of the lie. However, to make a full detection, it is necessary for the person to at least attempt to say the lie.
5. The pattern diagram can be used to derive what part of the lie was the actual falsehood (Example: "I did not kill MY wife" vs "I did not KILL my wife" vs "I did not kill my WIFE".), but the accuracy here is <60%, or even <30% if the person is autistic, has a mental disorder or is a child.

For the sake of the argument, lets say that before anyone stops it or bans it, the plan on how to DIY the Detector is spread all over the known Internet, and countless companies churn out their Detectors. You could buy a cheap but effective one of ebay, or a slightly nicer looking model of the shelf at the local mall.

How does society change? Politics? Economy? Culture?
