Thinking of a setting with fucky gravity, which is expressed mostly by fucky water. Feedback welcome.

This is a high fantasy setting with a lot of magitech. Also decent scientific knowledge imported by isekai'd planars, though the vast majority of it will be inapplicable in the current plane due to something I'm calling technological entropy.

--------------

The center of our existence is an inscrutable hollow sphere known as Keramos, several dozen times the size of mother Gaea, our homeworld from our plane of origin. In this plane there is no sun in the distance, no planets or stars, not space as we know it, empty and dark and and infinite, but instead a grey expanse of non-visible nothing extending into a long finity.

Keramos is made of massive black beams of inviolate black material, woven around each other like a round, black basket. Around it are millions of rocks and glowing comets of all shapes and sizes orbit, as well as all life on this plane; including over a dozen extraplanar originated sophont races in a state of constant war with one another. Over millions of years rock and dirt has calcified around the beams by some kind of intentional process, closing or severely narrowing most gaps between the lattices. The few gaps that remain are known by all as golem spawns and avoided at all costs, as those monstrous facsimiles of life are absolutely inimical to it.

The exception is the two massive apertures at the two poles, which are always either "exhaling" steam from its core or "inhaling" water into it. All life on Keramos pivots around these two processes, which waxes gradually over about 2 months, maintaining peak output for only a few weeks--whereupon over 80% of all affected matter is exchanged--before waning over another 2 months, and then reversing course. Separately, these two processes are know as the "Rise" season and the "Fall" season. Together, they are known as "the cycle", and are considered to make up 1 year.

Little else is known about Keramos, built by unknown creators for an inscrutable purpose. What is known is its strange effect on water and gravity of this cosmology as compared to our home plane, detailed below.

* *I. WATER AND GRAVITY*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: i.-water-and-gravity
  :END:
In any of its states, water outside a living being does not interact with any gravity other than that of Keramos, the hollow sphere.\\
-As a liquid it will always fall towards Keramos.\\
-As a gas it will always rise away from Keramos, unless attracted by the gravity well of a mass of bright ice.\\
-As a solid it will just float aimlessly and not react to any gravity well, not even Keramos, with one exception, that of other masses of solid ice. It also projects its own pseudo-gravity well which strongly affects other masses of solid or gaseous water in a manner almost reminiscent of magnetism. For the purposes of Newtonian physics, ice does retain mass in accordance to its distance from the Keramos gravity well and react accordingly in action and reactoin.\\
-Plasma has never been replicated and so can't be studied, but there are theories that it happens inside the Keramos core...

* *II. WATER AND LIGHT*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ii.-water-and-light
  :END:
Water reacts strangely with light, absorbing it and producing it. Since there is no star, all light on this plane produced by these processes.\\
-Liquid water behaves the most like water from our own plane, and is transparent or opaque in accordance to its composition as one would expect.\\
-Gas is mostly reflective to light, and but only in a diffuse way. The reflected light becomes 'soft' and loses its blue tinge. In sufficient concentrations the vapor itself will appear as a smoke-like grey mass. Note: the color is almost identical to what passes for "space" in this plane. Make of that what you will.\\
-Solid water produces light, glowing in a off white, vaguely blue hue. The brightness varies according to many minor factors in mostly unknown ways, and one major factor, the rise and fall seasons. The brightest peak for ice luminescence coincides with the peak of Rise season, when Keramos is expelling steam. The nadir coincides conversely, when Keramos is attracting ice during the rise season. In effect, Keramos has 2 days a year, where "noon" is never very bright, and night is never fully dark.\\
-Plasma...

* *III. WATER AND THE 4 STATES*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: iii.-water-and-the-4-states
  :END:
Finally, water outside the body will transition its state not according to temperature or any other familiar factor, but as a condition of its mass in relation to Keramos(or more precisely, its gravity well) and, in the case of ice, its own luminescence.\\
-Liquid is either the end or the beginning of the cycle, depending on how one views it. Once water liquefies it is unchangeable to any other state even at absolute zero(0 K) or at 10,000°C, except in the heart of Keramos by some unknown mechanism.\\
-Gas only occurs in the heart of Keramos and will solidify into tiny ice crystals at a set distance away from it. If it is stuck somehow(eg. in a human's lungs) it will condense normally and transition back to liquid state(though never freeze).\\
-Solid water only occurs during the rise season, when vapor rising freely from Keramos is far enough away from its gravity well of origin and solidifies. This distance varies so its particulars are unknown. As ice, it will attract ice of smaller mass and be attracted by ice of greater mass. This reaction is very energetic initially(at low mass) and causes considerable heat from collisions, which is one of the theories as to how ice becomes luminescent(a problem with this theory is that even after it reaches a temperature equilibrium, which varies according to mass but is usually a bit over 0°C, the ice mass will continue to gain brightness). At a diameter of several km(though this too varies unpredictably) the ice reduces several-fold its attraction of smaller massed ice, and it also starts to weakly repel ice above a certain mass threshold, though it will still join together if it collides somehow. Finally, as ice loses its luminescence it will start shedding mass(melting) and start falling in orbit, until it eventually dissolves completely, invariably in the fall season.\\
-As to plasma, over the centuries the episteklos have calculated that more mass leaves Keramos than returns it every year. The famed episteklos Orpheus, acclaimed as an immortal Epistanax while still living(!), has created an intricate model where, within the heart of Keramos, plasma is used to create matter every cycle as if by mytosis, ex nihilo...
