  Once water liquefies it is unchangeable to any other state even at absolute zero(0 K) or at 10,000Â°C, except in the heart of Keramos by some unknown mechanism.

Your original post suggests that the only way to get gaseous water is by letting it complete the cycle within Keramos. Yet if plant matter and other living creatures can transmute liquid water to gaseous water, any magic or industry which requires gaseous water will be accompanied by large greenhouses to cultivate plants (which emit gaseous water) and capture their emissions for use. Thus, we can exploit transpiration. And to a lesser extent, the moisture emitted in the breath of humans and other animals.

If magical water in any form can be cracked into hydrogen and oxygen, you can burn hydrogen and oxygen together to create gaseous water once more. Perhaps this "burnt" water is nonmagical? Or perhaps you don't have hydrogen and oxygen as elements, and water itself is an elementary form of matter.
