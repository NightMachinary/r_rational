I recommend the 3 star and lower ratings on novelupdates. They are often quite helpful. [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/genjitsushugi-yuusha-no-oukoku-saikenki/][Link]]

To quote from my own review from long ago:

- The MC's luck has reached the counter-stop. Every plan goes off perfectly, he randomly stumbles upon or predicts all potential issues early enough to avert them.

- Everyone important / intelligent believes him immediately. And becomes a subservient follower immediately.

- There is a harem drawing nearer and nearer. He still resists (for unclear reasons and typical MC thickheadedness), but everyone else already accepts it. It seems forced, as everyone else is in a monogamous relationship. At least there are some actual, if unconvincing, reasons for the girls to want to marry him.
