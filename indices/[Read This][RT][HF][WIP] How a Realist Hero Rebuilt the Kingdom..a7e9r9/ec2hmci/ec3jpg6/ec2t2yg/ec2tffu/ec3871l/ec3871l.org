Have you tried Japanese light literature and normal literature? It's not light novels, but it has works such as */The Twelve Kingdoms/* (十二国記), */Seirei no Moribito/* (精霊の守り人) (unfortunately this is not fully translated), */Kemono no Sōja/* (獣の奏者), and */Kamisu Reina/* (神栖麗奈). They might not fit here, but you might finally escape the wish-fulfillment and harem of mainstream light novels. I'd personally recommend the */Boogiepop Series/* which is currently being translated, and my most tentative recommendation for this sub is */Rokka no Yuusha/* (六花の勇者) which is a mystery, fantasy series.
