Playing For Keeps [[https://scribl.com/books/PAF06/playing-for-keeps][(available as a free audiobook here)]] is a nice standalone supers novel that definitely fits the bill.

Many stories in the long running [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40686-wild-cards][Wild Cards universe]] fit this to varying degrees.

Similarly, several stories from the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/499216.Temps][Temps anthologies]].

The Paper Magician Trilogy and the classic Anime series Read Or Die are great examples of epic battles with paper-kinesis.

The Alcatraz Smedry series fits, the entire cast has curses that they twist to their advantage, but it is very much not a serious story.

In general though, "quirky way to use a weak power" is generally more of a fun trope to give power-ups to a character when the time is right, rather than enough of a hook to build an entire story around unless it happens right at the start, and even then that still makes the story "random powerup causes life altering changes."
