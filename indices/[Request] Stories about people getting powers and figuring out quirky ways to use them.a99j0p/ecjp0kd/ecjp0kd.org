The Wandering Inn

It's not always highly rational, and sometimes it is but only if you reread the story with details in mind that weren't revealed until the middle of book 5, but it does have the elements you're looking for, in the parts that follow certain characters.

For example a certain group of goblins tend to always gain subpar classes/levels/skills but they make the most of them in a world that is literally out to hunt them down. (They get trappers instead of hunters, stirrers and fire starters instead of cooks... A recent example of using a weak ability in quirky ways - a goblin gets a spell which sets your own weapon on fire. The fire is non magical other than the part where it keeps a metal weapon burning for a few minutes even without fuel. It can destroy wooden weapons like clubs because they catch on fire, and heats up the metal ones to the point where you have to drop them, but the fire doesn't spread fast enough to do anything significant to a target the weapon hits. The goblins usually just use it to build campfires quickly in the evening until one day they use it to help get away from an army that's been chasing and harrying them (won't spoil how))
