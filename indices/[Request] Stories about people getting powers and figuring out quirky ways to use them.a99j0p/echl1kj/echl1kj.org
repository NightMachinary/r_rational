Some keywords to look for: Optimization, min/maxing, and munchkin. Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to reliably find stories like these, but it's more common in stories that have "hard magic" systems and coherent rules.

Brandon Sanderson does a bit of this here and there, but it's not generally his primary focus.

There's some pretty good munchkinry in *The Tutorial is Too Hard*, mostly in terms of exploiting the progression systems. Some of it gets pretty dark, like deliberately hurting himself in a safe zone that heals people rapidly in order to grind his pain resistance and damage resistance skills.

*Threadbare* has a whole bunch of munckining, especially toward the end. Huge recommendation for this if you like game-like universes.

You might also enjoy my *Arcane Ascension* books. The main character spends a lot of time researching how magic works, and he definitely uses his abilities in some non-standard ways. It's a world building heavy story, though, and you shouldn't expect optimization to be the main focus.
