I tried to do that with my ChangeStorms series. You can pick up Induction, the first novel, for free over on [[http://Patreon.com/davidstorrs][my Patreon]]. The summary is that superpowers act like a plague -- getting them will probably kill you or leave you horribly mutilated, but once you have them you are now a source of infection. The normals have banded together to protect themselves against supers. Part of that defense lies in forming the Special Response Division and requiring all supers to join. Our protagonist, a 40-something female psychologist, refuses to join and is therefore drafted with an explosive collar on her neck. Day 1: Fight two miles of animated highway. Her power? The ability to straighten thread.
