Last weekend, I watched some murder mystery movies.

- *Clue (1985)* is a parody of its genre, but still a pretty good mystery on its own right. Jokes are hilarious and the acting is great. Would recommend.

- *Murder by Death (1976)* is also a parody and similar to Clue, just slightly lower in quality. Even though the jokes are little outdated, I really liked Sydney Wang.

- *Knives Out (2019)*. Now this one is a must-watch. With all the satires, parodies and deconstructions of the genre, you would think whodunnit murder-mystery had already become a dead genre and you're right. But this movie alone almost revives the genre (I'm being hyperbolic here). It hits the ups and downs of story beats just right, has some well-timed twists and most importantly, the story is intricately plotted. Overall, I think this is right up [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s alley. Also from what I've read online, it seems to take a little [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense][Artistic License]] in law, but that is a very minor thing and nothing to upset the audience.
