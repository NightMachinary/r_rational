Also, the search parameters for *Previous automated recommendation threads* is spotty. The link doesn't search the Monday threads properly. The past few weeks' threads won't top the search results.

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=%22%5BD%5D+Monday+Request+and+Recommendation+Thread%22&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all]["[D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread"]] seems to work better as a search query.

Reported a Monday thread before but reports on the auto-mod might've gotten filtered.
