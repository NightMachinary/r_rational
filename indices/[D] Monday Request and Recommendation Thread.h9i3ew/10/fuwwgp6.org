Here's what I've been currently reading, with some notes on each. Many of these were previously recommended here.

I've mostly been reading almost exclusively LitRPG recently... there's probably something wrong with me.

*/Part 1: Must Read/* - actively following updates

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer][Azarinth Healer]] - It's a standard numbers-go-up power fantasy, but I've really enjoyed it. The protag has resisted getting involved in local politics, but seems headed there anyway, and is on a looming collision course with many of the existing power structures. There was a very satisfying breakthrough in just the last couple chapters, and another is on the way soon.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] - updates are often posted here in [[/r/rational]]. Interesting overarching plot, a bad guy who might not actually be too bad a guy, and heartwarming relationships between some of the characters.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]] - Just the right level of farcical which I continue to find very amusing.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights With Monsters]] - It could sort of be argued that the protag is turning into a Mary Sue, but he and his team have really earned their progress. Interesting plot with the protag plausibly involved in world-shaking conflict with gods and monsters from beyond reality.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21844/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension][I am going to die in this game-like dimension]] - I found some the updates (especially after hub 2) to invoke a real sense of wonder and discovery for me. Most authors are content to overlay magic over existing physics, but in this case, the fundamental nature of reality is quite different.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days - ASOIAF]] - this has been updating sporadically in the last year or so. Nearing the conclusion, which should be pretty epic.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26149/skybound][Skybound]] - The author is quite capable of creating quite epic scenes (of battle and otherwise). Only updates about once a month though.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red][A Journey of Black and Red]] - Initially came across this through a crossover with Azarinth Healer, and then started from the beginning. It's been fun so far. The protag is starting to really come into her own at this point.
