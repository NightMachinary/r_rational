Surprised to see Azarinth Healer cited as must read. I normally hate seeing things described as "bad writing", because it's super vague and almost certainly just means "this is not highbrow fiction and I don't like it". Yet Azarinth healer was the first time I really read something and thought "this is just bad writing".

The standard of punctuation and grammar is just really poor for the first 100 chapters. It's frequently impossible to tell who is talking or taking an action, character thoughts are jammed right into unrelated paragraphs, and it's too often confusing.

I don't want to sound too harsh, as i do still enjoy the series overall, but I wouldn't highly recommend it even for the parts it does well.
