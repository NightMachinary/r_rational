Seconding the rec for Wake Of The Ravager. It's a dumb adolescent power fantasy but like the best possible version of that. The protagonist lucks into a bunch of overpowered abilities but doesn't rest on his laurels and instead continues to proactively work towards becoming more powerful, including experimenting, with some failed experiments shown. And the author introduces new story/setting/character/power elements at an incredible pace, very rarely goofing up and dropping them.

In the same light, if lighthearted/violence/planning is an itch you want scratched, I'd also recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/threadmarks][I Just Love Killing]] (Worm alt-power / Rick And Morty Crossover / Taylor gets advice from an alien assassin instead of having an actual power). It's incomplete and on hiatus, but the author shows up every year or so to update it, and it doesn't end somewhere unsatisfying.

For more LitRPG, I'd recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur The Dragon]], a parody of the genre. It starts out very well done and funny, but slowly gets bogged down in longer buildups to less interesting jokes. But it doesn't hang any huge plot threads over the reader's head, so I'd still recommend reading as far as you get before getting sick of it.
