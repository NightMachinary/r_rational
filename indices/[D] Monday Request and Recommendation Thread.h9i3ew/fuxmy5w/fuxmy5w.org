I got the itch.io [[https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality][Bunble for Racial Justice and Equality]], which has approximately 1,700 games (available for approximately 12 more hours from the time of this post). Does anyone have recommendations for what's worth playing in there? Some of it is assets, or game manuals, or tools, none of which I care all that much about, and I'm sure a lot of the games are utter garbage, but the top 10% of the bundle would still be 170 games, which is /still/ too many for me to look through, let alone play. Help/curation would be appreciated.
