Oxenfree: Teenagers on a haunted island. Ghosts and time travel. Has one of the most unique dialogue mechanics I've seen yet where you can interrupt the other person with your thoughts, or stay quiet whenever you like. Make sure you replay it!

Night in the Woods: About a kid coming home to her dying small town after dropping out of college. It's about growing up, or refusing to, friends and family, and mysteries. Every character looking like an antropomorphized animal might be off-putting at first, but I recommend keeping at it.

2064: Read Only Memories is a cyberpunk point&click with a charming cast. Really should get around to finishing it soon.

Super Hexagon is a timewaster rhythm game with a kickass soundtrack that demands insane reflexes.

Pyre is the only released Supergiant game I haven't played yet. It's a mix of a sports game with a visual novel in a fantasy setting. I was not a fan of the gameplay of the sports part, but the novel parts were amazing. Definitely wanna go back and finish this too.
