- *Pyre* is a game from Supergiant. 'Nuff said.

- 

  - On a more serious note, it's a visual novel plus some fantasy basketball. The visual novel takes the spotlight, it's around nineteen hours long while the "gameplay" part is two hours sprinkled between those nineteen.

- 

  - Choices Matter™---and they /actually/ matter, at least in the last few hours. There are stakes, and there's no "golden ending" (even though some endings are obviously better than others).

- 

  - Visual design and music are outstanding, the story is intriguing, and characters are well-developed, with clear motivations and goals (even though some of them are rather clichéd). The writing is also top-notch. Par for the course for Supergiant, really.

- *Celeste*: amazing but tough platformer. I'm biased here because I'm a huge fan of precision platformers, but I found this game to be my personal GOTY 2018. Both gameplay and design are very enticing.

- *Minit* is a cute game with a unique gimmick: you only have 60 seconds. After that, you die and respawn keeping only the items you find along the way. It's pretty hard to describe, but I recommend giving it a try no matter if my description sounded fun or not---you'll know if you like it in under five minutes.

- *Nuclear Throne* is a fast-paced, tough-as-nails rogue-lite. I'm pretty good at /The Binding of Isaac/, but couldn't complete this game even once in 10+ hours. Play at your own discretion. If you haven't played TBoI or /Enter the Gungeon/ (both are not in the bundle as far as I know), you probably should try them out first, and only then give /Nuclear Throne/ a shot.

- *Night in the Woods*: if you've ever watched /BoJack Horseman/, this is it, but for and about teenagers (another comparison that comes to mind is /Life Is Strange/ if that wasn't a total cringefest). Also, there are mysteries. The writing is quite decent, and the art style is pleasant.

- *OneShot* is hard to describe without spoilers, but if you've played /Undertale/, this is it minus the toxic fandom (also, with a focus on puzzles instead of the deconstruction of the RPG genre).

- *The Hex* is a game from the same creator as /Pony Island/ with the same gimmick of heavily playing with meta. I personally liked it much less than /Pony Island/, but many people seem to enjoy it.

* Honorable (?) mention:

- *Highway Blossoms* is a kinetic novel (meaning it has no paths, you just read) about cute anime lesbians in American Midwest. I liked it, but it is definitely not everyone's cup of tea.

Many of the games from the bundle are on Steam, so if any catch your fancy, you can try checking out the reviews there.
