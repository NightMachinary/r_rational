I've slaughtered time with Hyperspace Dogfights: Mission-based Luftrausers with a Binding of Isaac-esque upgrade system. Lots of flashing colors but it hasn't caused eye-strain for me yet.

Bleed and Bleed 2 are very fun also. Newgrounds-ish action platformers with pretty good levels and bosses. Multi-jumps, a sword that deflects bullets and bullet time make it pretty fun to play, and it has some replay value in letting you unlock characters and weapons by playing harder versions of the levels.

All three are action-y, with minimal story in Bleed's case. I'm not sure about any RPGs or Visual Novels on offer. Quality sway is extremely high with the amount of stuff in this bundle, and at least some of the games are unfinished.

Would love to see what people with good filters can highlight from the whole thing.

Edit: I've seen some of No Delivery played. I recommend checking it out if you enjoy weird RPGs.
