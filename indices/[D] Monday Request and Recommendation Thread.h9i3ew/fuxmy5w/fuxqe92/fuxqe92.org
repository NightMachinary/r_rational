These are all games that I've played and enjoyed to some degree:

- If you enjoy platforming, Celeste is /very/ good.
- A Short Hike is a cute and relaxing adventure game about climbing a mountain to receive a call.
- Spring Falls is a relaxing classic-style puzzle game (discrete, turn-based, has undo, gradually introduces new mechanics) where you must erode a mountain to water flowers.
- Puzzle Puppers is a slightly-unpolished classic-style puzzle game, where you must feed very long rainbow corgis.
- Mu Cartographer is a really interesting "You find yourself in control of an alien machine" sort of puzzle/exploration game. It's really interesting, and I have something of a soft spot for games like this, but it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea.
- Particle Mace is a 2D top down action spaceship game (a la asteroids), wherein you must destroy things through irresponsible tractor beam usage, rather than shooting.

There's also a bunch of TTRPGs included. I haven't played any of them, but Troika! and Lancer both looked really neat.

- Troika! is a way out-there "science-fantasy" game, with a really strong aesthetic sense. It reminds me a lot of Caves of Qud, and also, a little of WTC in that the world is just sort of a bunch of stuff all munged together.
- Lancer is about being a mech pilot, among other things.

Here are some bonus meta resources for other people looking for the same things you are:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/itchioJusticeBundle/][There's a subreddit]] dedicated to the bundle, and sorting through it.
- Someone's also gone and built [[https://randombundlegame.com/browse][a website]] which provides a more comprehensive search over all the games.
- There's also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/itchioJusticeBundle/comments/h93fmk/spreadsheet_update_with_batch_7/][a spreadsheet]] if that's more your jam.
