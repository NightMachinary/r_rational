Are you familiar with Ars Magica, published by Atlas Games? This is a game that has gone through several editions, and has a clear, coherent view of various schemes of magic.

The main book covers the Order of Hermes - they have five Techniques - verbs to describe - Creo/Intellego/Muto/Perdo/Rego - or Create/Understand/Change/Destroy/Control. Then there ten Forms - nouns which are what's being manipulated: Animal, Aquam, Aurum, Corpus, Herbam, Ignem, Imaginem, Mentem, Terram, and Vim. Vim is magic itself, so to end a spell, you'd cast a Perdo Vim spell. To control someone's mind is Rego Mentem. To launch a fireball is Creo Ignem.

Permanently changing something - such as magical healing - costs vis, basically concentrated magic. Securing supplies of vis is an important part of the game. But the scheme has quirks - There's no spell to translate languages. You can cast a spell on a foreign speaker and understand what he's saying, but you can't translate a document if no one in your group can read it. The game calls out specific things that magic just can't do.

Finally, and what really made this interesting, is that there are other magical traditions - some are extinct, some are neutral and some are enemies of the Order. They have their own limits and can do things that Hermetics cannot. With considerable effort it is possible to understand their magic and take it as your own, or simply do magical research to break new ground.
