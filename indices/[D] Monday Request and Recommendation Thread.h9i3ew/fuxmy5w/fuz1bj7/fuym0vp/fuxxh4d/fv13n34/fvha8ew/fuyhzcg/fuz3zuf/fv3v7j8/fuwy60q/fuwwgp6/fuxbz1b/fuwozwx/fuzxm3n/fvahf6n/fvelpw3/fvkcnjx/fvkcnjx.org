I would enjoy something like that too, though just to say I have seen alternate history SI's that MIGHT kind of fit this. The concept is usually a character that gets inserted into a famous person from history and then tries to achieve a goal (improving society, securing objectives, advancing technology), it's been a while since I've read these kinds of stories but I remember some great ones if you're interested I can try to find a couple.
