There's been a few people posting in previous weeks that they're jonesing for another [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]], and I've finally run across something similar!

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32291/jank][Jank]] is a series of vignettes set in VRMMOs, mostly focused around the intersection of that full-body experience combined with the inevitable (title drop) jank of a system programmed by humans.

The stories are largely unrelated to each other (aside from Legend, which has two parts); each is more of a completely isolated story. The update schedule is pretty erratic as well.

That being said, I found what's currently there to be very satisfying (particularly God Mode), and highly recommend giving it some of your time. The short story format is particularly well suited to web serials that might disappear at any moment, after all.
