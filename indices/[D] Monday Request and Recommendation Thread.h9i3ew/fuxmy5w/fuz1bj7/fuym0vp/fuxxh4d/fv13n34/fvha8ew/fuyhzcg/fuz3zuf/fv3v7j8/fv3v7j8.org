I recently read [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]]. It is very good as a rational fiction. I'm still digesting how much I like it, but I think it's a comfortable top 5 of rational fiction. It's been recommended here before, and I'm glad I took those recommendations.

It does require a fairly extensive understanding of canon though.
