Oh, thank goodness. I'll give it another go.

  Are there any that aren't power fantasy sops and have some semblance of narrative and character development?

Eh, that's tough.

Jason from He Who Fights With Monsters starts out with some bone-headed moves, nearly dies a lot, and then gets a number of lucky breaks right away. Things even out after that, and he starts working hard to improve. Some of the secondary characters (or at least one of them) do see some character growth as time goes on.

In Purple Days, Joffrey starts out as a complete asshat as in canon, and changes... pretty much completely as the loops accumulate. I think it is earned though.
