*/Part 2: Catching up slowly/*

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30636/the-patchwork-realms-arrival][Patchwork Realms]] - Such a good boi!

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-breath-of-fire-iii.787978/][Companion Chronicles]] - Just started this recently. Gets into the ethics of post-scarcity people getting involved with other worlds.

*/Part 3: Stalled out but may continue/*

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With This Ring]] - Mr Zoat has seen his share of controversy, so I don't blame people for disliking it. Just haven't been too interested in it since moving to QQ. As far as epic goes, few things can top the "Stars, Crossed" arc, and I don't even like Grayven all that much.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena][The Elemental Arena]] - on hiatus until current real-life calms down. Overall, it seems to me the time is a little too compressed, in that the entire series of events has taken place in like a day or two. I'd expect anyone, no matter how mentally tough, would be a gibbering mess at this point.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Largs Chests]] - not sure why exactly I stopped reading it around "Moonlighting".

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles][Metaworld Chronicles]] - It is decent, I can't find any fault in it, but just lost interest.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design][Grand Design]] - Interesting premise. Billed as hard SF, I can't get over how the inciting incident was described. I'm fine with spraying all of human civilization with hard gamma, but really, that is ionizing radiation, and the infrastructure would also be badly damaged. I may have to head-canon it as "subspace radiation" or something. I may still continue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]] - I've only gotten to Chapter 7. Some of the mistakes may by the protags have really bothered me. Yes, I know, they're just kids.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24203/homicidal-aliens-are-invading-and-all-i-got-is][Homicidal Aliens are Invading and All I Got is This Stat Menu]] - I started reading after the indefinite hiatus, so I knew it wasn't going to have a satisfying conclusion. It is a decent LitRPG... I don't know.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26116/the-eighth-warden][The Eighth Warden]] - Stalled out at the end of Book 1. We've only seen small hints of the overarching plot so far, book 1 was mostly harem building. The protag is nearly perfect personality-wise... so not a lot of room for character growth.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26734/eight][Eight]] - It is nice, with cute animals and children, but didn't really hold my attention. Didn't see much of an overarching plot beyond survival so far.

There's another one... I don't remember the title. The protag is named K-something, and starts out in a goblin-infested valley which is the tutorial level. Dying means starting over, and it had an unusual progression system. There was an overarching plot line involving the player / protag's sanity, but I didn't find it very interesting. No real sense of stakes to me.

*/Part 5: Drop everything to read/*

Yes, of course I'm reading all the updates to Worth the Candle when they come out.
