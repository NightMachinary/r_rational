The story did start meandering after a bit, it's true. The Lost Logia plot essentially got delayed, since the protagonist can "freeze" a plane in time relative to her and does so to the MGLN universe so she can come back when she's strong enough to deal with it.

The author acknowledged that after a while and some crazy rolls the story changed from what it was intended to be. I still quite enjoyed it, but there is a moderate tonal shift.
