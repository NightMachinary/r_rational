I think your point about the default 10 year timescale being too long to work like this is a good one. It can be done, but generally works much better on a shorter timescale, or the MC switching between worlds at-will.

MTG Planeswalkers are a good example of the latter, and the majority of stories I've seen making use of it don't touch anything related to the MTG lore at all beyond the basics of Planeswalking and the magic system. They're generally worth checking out, though standard the trash-to-good stories ratio probably applies.

A Planeswalker story I've very much enjoyed is the quest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/ignition-mtg-multicross-planeswalker-pc.26099/][Ignition]], where the main character becomes a Planeswalker at the end of the prologue. The settings she goes to (and is from) are fictional settings, but changed radically enough that knowing the settings is not only completely unrequired, but liable to lead you astray if you rely on canon knowledge. Spoiler: The MC becomes pretty OP as a result of a few absolutely insane dicerolls on particularly critical checks* (The rolls happened in thread and can still be viewed - no fake rolls here.) There's still stakes, but she's generally at least a medium-leagues threat to all her available settings.

*The most egregious example being an occasion relatively early on. The players got an opportunity where one of the options was schmuck bait. They swallowed the bait, which was almost guaranteed to lose them the opportunity, but then rolled a nat 100 followed by a confirmation roll with a 1/4 pass rate IIRC.
