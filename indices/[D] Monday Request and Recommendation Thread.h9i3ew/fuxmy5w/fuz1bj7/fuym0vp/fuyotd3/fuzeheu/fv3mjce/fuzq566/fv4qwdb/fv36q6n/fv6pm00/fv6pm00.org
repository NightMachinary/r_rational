If all you're looking for is world-hopping, I'd highly recommend the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Gate_Cycle][Death's Gate Cycle]] - the Earth was magically split into four elemental planes plus a labyrinth, and the fairly epic seven book series traverses all of them.

It's only marginally rational; at the very least I don't remember getting mad at any characters for holding the idiot ball, but it's been like twenty years.
