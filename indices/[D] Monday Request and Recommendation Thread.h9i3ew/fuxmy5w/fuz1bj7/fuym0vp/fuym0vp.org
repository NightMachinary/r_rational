I've been getting into jumpchains lately (protagonist hopping between fictional realities), and I have to say... they're not that good. Since it's such a niche genre, there's not many recommended, and those that are read like bullet point lists. The only ones I've found that I've enjoyed are [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-breath-of-fire-iii.787978/][Companion Chronicles]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/][Nowhere Land]].

I think there are three main problems with the genre:

First, it's small, so there's statistically a much lower chance of finding a good story.

Second, each "jump document" usually makes the character (far) above average for the world they go to, and it just keeps malking then more powerful as the story progresses. Overpowered protagonists are hard to write well, and the authors of these stories are usually fail at that.

Thirdly, the format specifies that the MC spends ten whole years in each fandom before moving on - this is longer than where most stories get to, results in an unrealistic lack character growth when the protagonist leaves the world much like they were when they started, and basically just turns the story into a sequence of isolated self-insert fanfics with a recurring main (or cast of) character(s).

I /have/ read good(ish) stories with the fandom-dimension-hopping concept, though. See: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][Sleeping with the Girls]], [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/bond-breaker-si-multiverse-cross.5951/][Bond Breaker]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.404479/][Factory Isolation]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/easy-mode-gamer-multicross-si.491065/][Easy Mode]]. They circumvent my third gripe by not being constrained by "jumpchain" rules, allowing for less time spent in each fandom and the ability to travel between the worlds. They also get by my second by either simply not giving the character overpowered powers (former two) or by challenging them in ways such that their powers aren't so overpowered in the circumstance, or by shifting the tone of the story (latter two).

So, anyone have any recommendations for good fandom-hopping styled stories?
