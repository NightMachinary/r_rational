Bolding things I've enjoyed that I've only heard about because of the bundle.

- Celeste - Hard air-dash platformer. Probably the best pure platformer. Main game difficulty curve starts harder than the start of Super Meat Boy and ends easier than the end of Super Meat Boy, if that's a useful comparison for you.

- Anodyne - Oldschool Zelda, but it's a journey into the uncomfortable parts of your mind. The combat is might be too tough for a lot of people, and the first dungeon is kind of dull, otherwise this would be an easy recommendation to everyone.

- Tonight We Riot - Beat em up where you play as a crowd. Kind of reminiscent of Pikmin? Pretty challenging, but not punishingly so. It starts out pretty bleakly realistic, but by world two it becomes more of a cartoon. It's nice to play as the good guys.

- *Golf Peaks* - Minigolf as a puzzle game. Very clever.

- *Cardinal Chains* - A great abstract puzzle game, nearly as good as Hex Cells. The name and marketing copy really don't sell the game very well, so try the tutorial or trailer instead.

- Nuclear Throne - Action game with quick death and big explosions. It's a Vlambeer game, that's what you get. Though it's not quite the screen shake explosionfest that Luftrausers was, they apparently have a little restraint.

- Minit - Cute exploration/adventure thing where you only have 60 seconds to live, so you have to explore and make progress in short bursts.

- Hive Time - Bee colony simulator. I had an enjoyable couple of hours playing it, but it doesn't really have anything that'd make me want to play more than that. If learning a cute sim game (and it is /very/ cute) sounds like fun, I'd recommend it.

- Super Hexagon - Abstract action game that's actually too hard for me. It is still very well-designed though, as you'd expect from Terry Cavanagh.

And games I've heard good things about but haven't played yet: Octodad, Oxenfree, Starseed Pilgrim, Lenna's Inception, Night In The Woods
