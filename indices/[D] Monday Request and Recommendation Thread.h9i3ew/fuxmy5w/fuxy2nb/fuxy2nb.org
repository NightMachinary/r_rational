Wow, that is a lot of games. You'll melt your Internet router downloading them all.

I can only recommend one:

Sky Rogue is a arcade-physics flying game, reminiscent of Crimson Skies. As soon as I unlocked the heavy fighter, I didn't bother with any other planes. My loadout is typically:

- "heavy" micro missles (air and ground)
- vulkan gun (ships and ground targets)
- medium range air-to-air
- guided bomb

I still haven't finished the final level. Be sure to save up as much money as possible to buy repairs.

I had my eye on Helium Rain a while back, but never bought it.

I've only ever even heard of:

- Octodad & sequel
- Super Hexagon
- Oxenfree
- 2064: Read Only Memories

I've got so many games from previous bundles in my collections that I'll likely not get around to playing... so I'll pass on this one to avoid clogging up my library.
