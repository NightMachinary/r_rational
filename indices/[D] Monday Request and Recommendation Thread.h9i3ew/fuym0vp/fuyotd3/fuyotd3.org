There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.682117/#post-50859034][Conference Call]], which is about a psychic link that spontaneously forms across dimensions between Roxy Lalonde, Zorian Kazinski, Ino Yamanaka, and Kid Win. It's a Homestuck/Mother of Learning/Naruto/Worm multicross, if you couldn't tell. It's not quite fandom hopping but it might scratch that itch. It's good, but it's unfinished and been dead for a year so I assume it'll stay dead.
