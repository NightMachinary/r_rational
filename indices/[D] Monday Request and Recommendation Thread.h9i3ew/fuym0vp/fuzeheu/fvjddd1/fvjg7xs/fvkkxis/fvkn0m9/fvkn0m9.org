There wasn't a risk of a magical compulsion though? If she'd gone through with the whole capital-C Companion thing there would be, but they explicitly didn't do that. Instead Sigurd was invited along to see if they were compatible as a lowercase-c companion and summonable - which ended up happening. IIRC Astra also agreed that it was fine before they went with that plan.

Also, a previous dream interlude showed a Companion (possible Sigurd) trying to bond with her and just bouncing off of her soul. Jade's dreams being prophetic, this is further evidence that it wasn't a danger.
