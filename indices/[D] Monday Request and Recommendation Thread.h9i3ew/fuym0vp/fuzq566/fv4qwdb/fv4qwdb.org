This is one of my favourite subgenres! In (old) published fiction, I can think of:\\
- The Mode series by Piers Anthony - amazing depiction of jumping through many dimensions. Loved it for this, though I always had issues with the way it depicted gender, and other problematic themes.

- The Lives of Christopher Chant (and to a lesser extent the wider Chrestomanci series) by Diana Wynne Jones deals with jumping through worlds in the multiverse. Intended for younger audiences but still an excellent series and I have no reservations recommending it.

- Also by Diana Wynne Jones, the Homeward Bounders is all about travelling from world to world.

- Nice Princes of Amber by Roger Zelazny (part of the Chronicles of Amber) has an amazing scene early on where the main character jumps through dimensions, although the series slows down drastically after its strong start. The series picks up again in the later books with more dimensional travel but you have to get through a long slow patch first, unfortunately.

- The Myth Adventures series by Robert Asprin. A comedy series about a man from a stereotypical medieval fantasy world who accidentally becomes an inter-dimensional traveller. I love it.

- The Pendragon series as mentioned is another one. I enjoyed it, though each book in the series tends to focus on a single world at a time, whereas I'm more a fan of the rapid-fire dimension hops.
