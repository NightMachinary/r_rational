The biggest sticking point was Sigurd.

I literally cannot phantom why you'd ever take the risk. Astra made valid points against, because of the risks involved, and I felt like the thread just went "no, bad AI! don't tell us what to do!" and went for it anyway.

As far as I'm concerned, there was nothing to gain since we didn't even know what a Companion brought to the table for us, and there was a real risk of there being a compulsion to be "good" probably included. Jade already has all the tools to become, given time, the most broken Divine Magical Princess to ever grace the multiverse at that point, and you're telling me it's worth risking for a pet shapeshifter?\\

Also, the whole dialogue between Astra and Jade born out of this was utter rubbish. The thread decided to stand up to the one person who has been uplifting Jade since the beginning and the worst was that their arguments were completely out of whack. They were just talking at each other.

In the end, everything worked out. Hindsight is 20/20 though.

There were a couple of other similar instances that made it frustrating for me to read, though this was the biggest by far.
