I'm torn on Ignition, I really enjoyed the start but somewhere around the magical lyical nonaha arc it got really meandering and the story seems to have gotten lost. The lost logia side plot really felt like just yet another ridiculous thing thrown in.

Overall it started strong but lost focus around that point and stopped being enjoyable (from my perspective) to read.

Which is a huge shame, there are too few really good plainswalker fictions, plainswalker and D&D are some of my favorite universes to read about.
