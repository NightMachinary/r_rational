There's a similar mini-genre of fandom hopping fics using planeswalkers from MTG as the main gimmick, which tend to have similar issues. My favorites are probably [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/well-traveled-worm-planeswalker-taylor.377626/][well travelled]], starring taylor hebert, which is currently on its 4th jump, and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-saga-of-many-planes-planeswalker-hinata-mtg-crossover.336114/][a saga of many planes]] starring hinata hyuga in westeros, which died immediately into its second setting, but had a satisfying conclusion imo.
