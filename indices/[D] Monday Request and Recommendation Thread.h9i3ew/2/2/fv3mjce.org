I had a similar problem with finding good jumpchains after reading Nowhere Land. I didn't end up finding any I liked, but I eventually found a dimension-hopping Worm/Gamer fic called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/][Kill them all]]. It's not exactly high literature, but it's fun enough. It starts off as a revenge-fueled murder fantasy, as the story starts with the MC's (Taylor's) father getting murdered in front of her. Eventually she mellows out a little after unlocking a planeswalking power. The catch with Taylor's planeswalking is that the dimensions she hops to are almost always apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic. Think alien invasions, hordes of monsters, deadly plagues, and other awful nonsense.

Currently, the universes traveled to include Fallout (presumably), Silent Hill, Attack on Titan, Resident Evil (movieverse), The Road, Independence Day, Hellsing Ultimate, and the MCU.

Planeswalking seems to have given the MC a bit of perspective, and she's started using her powers to solve societal problems in ways that don't involve excessive amounts of murder, like registering patents where the royalties are funneled into disaster relief charities. Well, she still seems to do a fair bit of murder too, but she's really cut back on it.
