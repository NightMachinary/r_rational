Any RTS power fantasy? Usually we have isekai that are classic RPG power fantasy. You upgrade your stats, maybe a couple of companions and then the author is unable to maintain proper power levels and it degenerates.

I want stuff where we have distinct enemy factions and the protagonist upgrading and building fortifications and armies. Stuff like world of Prime or Daniel Black ( besides his strange sexual themes).

Does this exist as a genre? Do you know any books in it?
