I'm up to Ch. 21 of [[https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto][The Apothecary Diaries]] manga, which doesn't quite rise to the level of Fair Play Whodunnit, alas, but possesses the standout quality of "characters think at all" and "characters try to solve cognitive problems at all". What other manga have this quality to the same level as Apothecary Diaries?

Also, those of you who are trying to read literally every piece of fiction I ever write should be informed that [[https://glowfic.com/posts/3866][team tyler's van]] exists and will almost surely remain forever incomplete, at least for this Age of the world.
