  Haroun wonders how Bella's world gets by without the ability to directly tell how much Skill people have acquired.  How can anybody tell which academies are best?  How do guilds distinguish masters from apprentices?  Are there specialized guilds that do things like testing the cutting power of swords before they're sold?  It seems like you'd have to invest a lot more effort in that sort of thing if there weren't guilds certifying that people have acquired all necessary Skills to their required levels.  And wouldn't that tend to skew the incentives toward manufacturing goods with high immediate performance and less long-term durability?  Do hospitals spend tons of time and paperwork measuring which healers get the best patient outcomes, and wouldn't that give healers an incentive to only accept patients with better prognoses?  It's not like Bella's people can directly measure anyone's skill level at the trickier healing spells, and anytime a patient dies the healer could just claim they had an especially tricky case.  How do you verify that educators actually have the Social Skills for Teaching, rather than just being good at persuading people to believe they understood something?  How do you even figure out which Teaching Skills are the good ones - the ones that taught the greatest heroes - if there aren't any Skills?  Why don't their academies just degenerate into a lot of people airily waving their hands and pretending to teach things while actually uttering nonsense?  Bella's culture must have all kinds of fascinating adaptations to a reality where competence, fundamentally, cannot be /measured/ except in special cases...

This has to be one of the most---hm, how to put it---/Eliezer/ paragraphs I've ever read.

Was there any side-channel chat between you and Alicorn while writing the glowfic or is what's on the page the complete record of your communication?
