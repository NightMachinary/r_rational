You want "dungeon core" stuff. Can't name anything specifically because I'm not really a fan of the genre though, sorry.

Personally, I'm holding out for a grand strategy multiplayer power fantasy. Log Horizon sort of works, but unfortunately it's based off a fictional MMORPG. I just want to see "I got Isekai'd into Victoria 2, and now I have to form Grossgermany as Luxembourg while France and Brazil players partition china."
