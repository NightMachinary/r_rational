Yeah, Azarinth Healer and Randidy Ghosthound are appearing on people's recommendations lists and I just can't understand why. I read first 150 chapters of each novel and it felt like those were trying to replicate Chinese junk that's written just for the word count with extremely cardboard characters and inane behavior by everyone involved.
