The grammar and spelling of Azarinth Healer does leave much to be desired. It doesn't look like the author is spending much time going back to fix mistakes as they have been pointed out.

"Must Read" means that /I/ must read the updates, not that they are necessarily "must reads" for people in general.

As hinted at before, I've been obsessively reading LitRPG and the like recently. The only fiction I've read that is remotely close to "high brow" is "The Hydrogen Sonata" by Ian M. Banks, which finished off the Culture series for me. It has been a long time since I read "Look to Windward" and "Excession", so those will likely get a re-read next year. I've still got Echopraxia and the last Virga novel on my to-do list... though both of those are on paper, maybe I should just buy the electronic versions.
