The author of r!Animorphs addresses [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g3ka7e/oh_my_god_animorphs_the_reckoning_is_so_good/fntp3lr/?context=10000][/the/ character's mistake here]] [includes spoilers]. Not sure which other mistakes were bothersome. I think I can guess at one character who's a major source of dissonance at the start, but in hindsight, is a thematic keystone and adds that painfully human element to rationality that I love about the story.

For litRPGs, I'm sadly the opposite. I've been having trouble getting into any. Are there any that aren't power fantasy sops and have some semblance of narrative and character development? For reference, I like Worth the Candle, The Wandering Inn, and A daring synthesis (and the start of Threadbare). I've tried Delve (might try it again) and will check out /I am going to die in this game-like dimension/.
