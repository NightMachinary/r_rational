Do any hard magic systems exist that are similar in complexity to the sciences which most historical conceptions of magic were based on past a high school/first year university level?

At the very least do any stories actually exist where the premise of a hard magic system doesn't amount to an interchangeable descriptor for having certain characters be able to expend specific resources to gain functionally arbitrary superpowers over a span of time or uses due to contrived religious reasons?
