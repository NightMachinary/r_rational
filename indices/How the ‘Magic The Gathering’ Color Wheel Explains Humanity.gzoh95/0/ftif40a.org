As big a fan as I am of [[/u/TK17Studios]], a gentle reminder that this is a subreddit for discussion about rational fiction, not rationality in general. Looking at humanity through the lens of an existing fictional framework does not, I think, pass that sniff test.

I could be convinced this is wrong if you have a good persuasive argument. Until then this joins all the other philosophy blog posts in removal hades.
