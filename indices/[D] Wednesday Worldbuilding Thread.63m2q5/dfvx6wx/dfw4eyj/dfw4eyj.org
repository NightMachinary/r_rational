  Would vampires really have rigid ranks, or would individual vampires just feel arrogant enough to style themselves as >insert title here<?

Do both. Vampires have one "Primary" and several "Secondary" titles.

Your "Primary" title is what you use when traveling. These are translatable, since the whole point is to convey, "I'm a noble. Don't seat me with those commoners."

Your "Secondary" titles are specific descriptions (often self-applied) of your age, accomplishment or role within your society.

So, "Queen Elizabeth" is also "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith"

Someone else could be, "Lady Mary," and also "Mary Stewart, Baroness of Whitchurch, Heroine of the Battle of New Bridge."

--------------

Within this, I might just simplify the 'Primary' titles to something like:

King / Queen: Sovereign leader of a territory Lord / Lady: Vampire with delegated authority Master / Mistress: Independent vampire without delegated authority No Title: Vampire who's someone else's servant / dependent.

The reason for the simplification is that, if I'm interacting with someone across-cultures, the questions I'm really asking are: "Are you speaking on behalf of your state?" and "Are you responsible for yourself, or are you someone's servant / child / spawn?"

A second benefit is that this framework is general enough that it can work for vampire societies that base power on something other than land-ownership.

Your roman vampires, for instance, are using titles that imply they've got a military command structure going on. In which case "Lord = Commissioned Officer," "Master = NCO" and everyone else lacks a title.
