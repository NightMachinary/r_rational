So, I decided my vampire society is very keen on titles and rank and seniority and all that. Originally I was going to give them all titles from ranks from all sorts of foreign countries and ancient cultures, but people pointed out that it would be rather hard to keep track of for a reader, so I decided just to use terms from English, and assume a sort of translation convention (i.e. in Ireland, vampires are Marquesses instead of Barons, and in India you might get a Raj instead of a Duke, or whathaveyou).

So I have a couple of issues:

- If the vampire titles come from the local language, I run into a problem: the vampire travels between several countries (Italy, France, Czech Republic, Germany, Portugal, USA) and so if I'm respecting that translation convention, pretty much all the vampires are going to have different titles even if they're /the same "actual" rank/

- I'm using nobility titles. It's a very world-of-darkness thing to use. I'm considering switching perhaps to military titles?

- Probably using model noble titles is a bit gauche, considering how the main vampire is 1500 years old, he would have started out using something different from the ~medieval/renaissance words that I've used. Should I just go and find words from the Roman empire?

- There's a gap in my titles which I'm not sure what to call it. At the moment I'm calling it a Crown, and while that worked when I was using a variety of languages and cultures, amongst standard british peerage it seems really stupid.

- Would vampires really have rigid ranks, or would individual vampires just feel arrogant enough to style themselves as >insert title here<? My conception of vampires is of having such large brain power that they can pay attention to lots of things at once, do deep analysis of things, etc, so I could see vampires easily having /a thousand/ different ranks and corresponding titles. Conversely, I could see vampires having /n/ ranks, where /n/ is the number of known vampires, with each vampire being slotted into their exact place in society. In that case, titles become completely unecessary, but may still have a ceremonial significance.

Anyway, here's my ranks:

- Emperor - hypothetical title for "king of all vampires" - has never really existed though of course there are ambitious vampires from time to time.

- King - a temporary title given at a vampire convocation to essentially the chairperson of that meeting.

- Crown - Controls a large swathe of land. Highest "permanent" title.

- Duke - Under the Crown, controls e.g. a city.

- Earl > Baron - Vampires who live in areas controlled by "Dukes". Not sure if we need two "levels" here or not.

Looking at Ancient Rome, it's all very complicated, but we can get:

- Rex (King)

- Senators (may be below Patricii; they are actually from different eras in Rome best as I can tell)

- Patricii (patricians)

- Consuls (may be above senators. Again, different eras)

- Conscripti (may be equal to senators? Again, different eras)

- Equites (knights)

- Proletarii (landless poor)

Ancient Roman Military is also tricky, but at least a bit more easily put in boxes because they share an era:

- Legatus Augusti pro praetore ~King

- Legatus legionis ~Crown

- Tribunus laticlavius ~second-in-command to the above

- Praefectus castrorum ~Duke?

- Tribuni angusticlavii ~Earl?

Then the problem is, these ranks are hard to pronounce. But if I didn't insist on vampires using titles for each other (something I'm not married to), then I can just say "Elodia, the Tribunus of Genoa, was blah blah" and then only mention her rank if it comes up, e.g. "William glared at her "A tribunus like yourself tries to tell a Legatus how to behave? How dare you!""
