I'd imagine skepticism isn't among a vampire's virtues, especially if they are devoting more and more mental real estate to etiquette; like a peacock's tail.

A young vampire sees society, see that it all looks pretty set in stone since time immemorial, and "it's just the way things are".

The young ones try and change things probably, but the ones that really get into it end up being taken care of, since the 1%ers benefit so much from the status quo. I'm not sure how strong to make a 1%er compared with the best of the rest, though - it needs to be delicately balanced to be "strong enough that a small group can't challenge them" but "weak enough that they can't commit mass murder".

And I guess that's why things begin changing in the 20th century; the 99%ers are stronger, relatively speaking, as more and more of them get older and benefit from the better-than-linear returns. Pretty soon the 1%ers aren't going to be easily stronger than the aggregate like they once were, and the 99%ers will rise up.

Resulting rules from the 1%ers:

- New vampire creation is very tightly controlled

- 99s should not be able to fraternize much, lest they get ideas

- ---> 99s are often shuffled between Kings' territories if they look like they're getting ideas (more politically tenable than outright killing them)

- 1s may have their disagreements, but they will band together against 99s because they live or die together, essentially

- ---> the Catastrophe, whatever it was, probably means all the 1s are more-or-less allied together anyway

- ------> the 1s all know each other personally, and may have secret meetings to work out ways to better keep a leash on the 99s

- A good 99 (i.e. unquestioningly accepts the status quo) is given good opportunities, good territory, and good lessons. A bad 99 is given bad lessons when the 1 knows that she can get away with teaching badly.

Questions:

- 1s obviously made the 99s; Why?

- ---> They probably wanted to continue the species, their culture, etc. The 99s may have mostly been made by a subgroup who had these goals.

- ---> Sentimental reasons. A favourite human might be made into a vampire.

- If you make a favourite human into a vampire, why would you "keep them down" like the 99s?

- ---> you probably wouldn't. They'd essentially be "favourite children", and the 99s in your land will hate them.

- ------> if they want to get to you, they might kill your favourite child?

- ---> maybe the 99s in a well-established area (e.g. old Europe) are mostly the children of the king they operate under

Thought:

- The 1%ers probably use etiquette as a reason to kill or exile "upstarts" who they don't like. "Oh, didn't I tell you? Uh, three-leaf clovers are offensive if you send them on a Tuesday." - and then that ad-hoc rule is spread until it becomes a real rule.
