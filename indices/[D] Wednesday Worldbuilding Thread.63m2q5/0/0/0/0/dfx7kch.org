Sounds like vampire kings will tend to have pretty good people skills. Maybe vampire kings are usually valued for their ability to settle disagreements between other vampires (and doing so diplomatically, rather than by forcing a decision down everyone's throats) and ability to coordinate and delegate (it's probably the case that vampires can get more done if they cooperate, so it's easy to see why they'd give a little of tribute to the king if he's demonstrated his abilities to turn that tribute into something more and pay a part of that back, in a quasi analogue to how the leaders of steppe tribes did things, but probably with less raiding).
