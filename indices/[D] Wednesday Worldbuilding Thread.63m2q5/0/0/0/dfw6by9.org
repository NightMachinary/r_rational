Oh man, thankyou! The primary/secondary title thing is genius. Plus it lets me give them long, lofty, completely unwieldy titles but not have to keep them at the forefront and distract everyone. Plus I can go back to the more general "all vampires are Lord/Lady" thing I was doing before I tried to make it more complicated.

Moreover, it means that each King/Queen can potentially organize their territory however they like (e.g. a King/Queen in Denmark might have a very rigid set of twelve levels of nobility, while a King/Queen in New York might have elected officials, and a vampire in ancient Gaul might have used military titles based on combat prowess). Gives them more to keep track of, and might make the distinction between territories meaningful, too.

Leadership is not exactly sovereign so King doesn't seem quite right. I'm not sure how vampires would resolve disputes about who controls what territory; generally I've had the one who is obviously less powerful cede their lands immediately, because when it comes to vampire physical abilities, having a few centuries on someone gives you a decided advantage if it came to combat. Then again, since then I've settled better on a concept of ritualised warfare that is essentially like the old-timey duels where you choose your weapon, only instead of choosing which type of gun you can choose to both write an opera and whoever has the best opera wins, or you can have a dance off or rap battle, or compete to identify the most obscure taxidermied animals, or you can even mount armies against each other if you agree to that. I suppose lesser vampires will pool their resources to resist a King they don't like, so a King's job is to maintain his position of authority whilst not being bad enough that people want to overthrow him.

Plus, the main vampire character, William, was actually a King of France when he was a human in the dark ages (I don't know if this will come up in the story), and he's also a Crown/Vampire King, so it seems a little on the nose. That said, when he was the King of France, France was more a warring tribe, so he was more a sort of general/warlord than what we'd think of as a King I guess. (I should maybe ask [[/r/askhistorians]] what being a King meant in the dark ages in terms of duties and day to day life and that sort of thing).
