  Would vampires really have rigid ranks, or would individual vampires just feel arrogant enough to style themselves as >insert title here<? My conception of vampires is of having such large brain power that they can pay attention to lots of things at once, do deep analysis of things, etc, so I could see vampires easily having a thousand different ranks and corresponding titles. Conversely, I could see vampires having n ranks, where n is the number of known vampires, with each vampire being slotted into their exact place in society. In that case, titles become completely unecessary, but may still have a ceremonial significance.

I really like the idea that they just give themselves ranks, and then maybe if Vampire A bestows upon himself a title that Vampire B feels is wrongly outshining himself (i.e. "I only call myself a Duke, so there's no way I'm going to let you call yourself a King") then they'll tussle in whatever way vampires tussle (not necessarily personally or physically, I assume) until one party or the other cries uncle.

Titles can be pretty bland (i.e. "King Carl Boone") or grandiose (i.e. "Amelia Schwartz, Empress of the Great Lakes, Potentate of Detroit, Protector of Southwest Ohio, Hunter of Men and Slayer of Beasts, She Who Gives Gifts"), tending toward "as grandiose as possible, to the extent that it doesn't step on the toes of vampires whose toes can't be safely stepped on."

There's no real rhyme or reason behind the titles. They just pick whatever they like and, as described above, tussle on occasion when somebody picks a title that's too big for the britches.
