Yep, I'm really digging the grandiose titles. Now, the question is: is there a formula or webpage for generating them? I can definitely do it mad-lib style, with "<verb> of the <noun>" being basically what it comes down to.

I like the combo of simple, official titles that are essentially used for communication between individuals who are not well-known to each other and people assigning themselves their own titles in between, with associated tussling.
