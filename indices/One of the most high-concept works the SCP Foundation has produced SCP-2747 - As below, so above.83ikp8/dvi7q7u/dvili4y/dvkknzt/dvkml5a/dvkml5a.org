Because SCP Foundation is an organization whose goals are research and containment of various supernatural entities via mundane means, no matter how powerful or strange they are. There's a lot of overlap between [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s interests and the Foundation's:

- "Special Containment Procedures" are essentially our Munchkinry Threads. We like to come up with interesting ways to defeat dangerous opponents, and the Foundation has to.

- The objects themselves. We like esoteric and interesting things/entities, as long as they're self-consistent and well-explored. The SCP Wiki incentivizes people to generate original and unique objects, and the Foundation, by necessity or by choice, is a scientific institution; as the result, many good SCPs are both well-researched and novel.

- The bigger picture. The Foundation indeed exists in a rather hostile universe --- how do they deal with it? The Foundation has to do a lot of deontologically evil things to continue operating --- and we like moral and philosophical dilemmas.

Ultimately, the SCP Foundation is a literature project which produces a lot of interesting and unique Sci-Fi or fantasy ideas, puts them under spotlight, and explores in-depth. On top of that, its format and worldbuilding incidentally overlaps with some of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s other interests.

(At least that's how I see it.)

I don't think that's the case. Developing new mundane technology is certainly desirable --- containment of a lot of dangerous, homicidal entities would be impossible without it --- as is researching SCP objects (not all of them have metaphysical information-based defence/offence abilities, after all). Achieving complete understanding of an SCP... it indeed happens rarely, but I think it's because of the format (SCP authors are disincentivized from giving full explanations), not because of in-universe reasons. There are some explained objects --- I think they have a "-EX" tag? *Edit:* [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-ex][Yep]].
