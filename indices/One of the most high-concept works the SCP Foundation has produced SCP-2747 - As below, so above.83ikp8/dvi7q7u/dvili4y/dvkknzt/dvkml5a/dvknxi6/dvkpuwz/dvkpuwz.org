Hmm. Well, I didn't say that the majority of SCPs are that good. I can give some recommendations, though.

- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][/There Is No Antimemetics Division/]] --- A series of tales written by a rational fiction writer Sam Hughes, focused on dealing with "antimemes" --- objects that erase knowledge about themselves from memory. Just good in general, has some SCP explanation and exploitation.

- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3000][SCP-3000]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2470][SCP-2470]] --- Extremely dangerous, but exploitable.

- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3003][SCP-3003]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2195][SCP-2195]] --- Well-researched and detailed, and have solid explanations, if I recall correctly.

- There are some examples of the Foundation trying to do what you're describing regarding research, but it usually goes poorly ([[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal][Swann's SCP-001 Proposal]] and [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld][/Visions of a Better World/]], to name a few). It doesn't have to, but the only example of a story exploring what would happen if the Foundation succeed at building a working theory of anomalous objects is in Russian. I agree that it's an interesting idea.

Also, what's your opinion on the titular SCP-2747?
