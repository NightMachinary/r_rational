You could make a munchkin rational SCP story. It would be a character that applies the right techniques and also gets very lucky in finding a "seam" in the problem.

If you had thousands of SCP artifacts all at your disposal and enough time to study them and disposable test subjects, maybe there's a way. Maybe there's some artifact you can use to study other artifacts. Maybe there's a meta-artifact that you can use to reprogram other artifacts to do something actually useful for you. Maybe you can then use a meta-artifact to make the drink machine give you a drink that makes you more intelligent, allowing you to then exploit other artifacts that you gave up on before.

And then eventually culminating in actual control.
