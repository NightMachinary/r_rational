Well, when I skimmed SCP articles, the trend I kept seeing was :

a. The object is unexplainable b. The object is dangerous c. The object is either unexploitable, or in the rare cases where it's useful, it's usually used for parlor tricks. Like the box of endless pizza. Nothing ever provides a solution that scales or the knowledge you would need to make progress towards making objects of your own.
