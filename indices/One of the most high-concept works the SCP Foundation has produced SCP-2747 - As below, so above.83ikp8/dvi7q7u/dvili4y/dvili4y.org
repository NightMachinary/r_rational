Close. It postulates a particular self-destructing narrative: a set of characters and plot points that, if featured in a fictional work, destroys itself and the fictional work in question, erasing it from memories and reality. Appendix A provides clues regarding the nature of this narrative: it features a person or a group of people trying to reach or comprehend something black/evil/destructive, and failing despite expending great effort; sometimes featuring number seven.

The Foundation has been trying to map out fiction-space (by procedurally generating stories and descriptions of these stories, then checking whether there are any descriptions that don't correspond to any story) to figure out exact properties of this narrative, because it's an existential threat to their world (what if it plays out in reality?). ...And then it turns out results of their research are, [DATA LOST].

They have been unwittingly making this narrative play out in reality, being a group of people trying to comprehend a narrative-destroyer.

  If I'm right, then this is a pretty neat concept, but the horror relies pretty heavily on a couple of metaphysical assumptions that I don't share (such as, for example, the assumption that we live in a fictional universe)

It doesn't necessarily. Nothing says the narrative /has/ to be fictional. We're observing its influence only on fictional narratives because there's more stories than realities, but it may very well work on real-world narratives (people and sequences of events) as well.
