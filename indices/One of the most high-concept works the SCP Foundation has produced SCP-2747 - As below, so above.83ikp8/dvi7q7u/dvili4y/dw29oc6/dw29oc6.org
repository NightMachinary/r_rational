While the scp appears to be either the thing creating the meta data or the self consuming narrative itself there is mention in the article that the actual culprit may not be 2747 and instead it's the narrative entity constructed within that then erases the work itself. Think of it like an accidentally generated antagonist or story artifact by the author that then through accident or intent destroys the narrative container it resides within (the story or movie or book). This results in removal of the story from reality making the actual scp the anti narrative element and 2747 just the symptoms or remaining artifacts over the dust settles.

The possibility that the entity can effect the memory of individuals in the"real" world indicates that the distinction of wether we are fictional it real doesn't really matter. We are vulnerable
