Actually that's not as weird if I think about it. Big orchestral pieces contain recurring themes throughout their movements, it would be up to interpretation but most music evokes similar emotions in listeners. Perhaps it's the emotion surrounding the antagonist part of the score that defines it.

Or not and my idea is crap. Good catch reminding me about I/o conflicting with my theory.
