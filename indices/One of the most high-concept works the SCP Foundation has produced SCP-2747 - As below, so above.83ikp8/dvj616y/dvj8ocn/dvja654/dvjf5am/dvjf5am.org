Ahh. So there's several fanfics with wordcount between 343 and 686, then several between 686 and 1029, then 1029 and 1372, then 1372 and 1715, then 1715 and 2058, then 2058 and 2401 --- six sets, with the seventh between 0 and 343 missing? Great catch, [[/u/PurposefulZephyr][u/PurposefulZephyr]], if that's what you meant.
