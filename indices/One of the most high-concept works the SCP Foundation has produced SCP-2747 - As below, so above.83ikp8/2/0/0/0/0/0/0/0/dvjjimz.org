What? No, no, we must do /literally anything other than this/. That is the exact single thing we must not do under any circumstances, why would you even suggest it? We're trying to /not/ end reality, not, not-

Can SCP-2747 bring other aspects of itself into existence? That is, what if once a certain "critical mass" of SCP-2747!tropes is achieved, they somehow end up bringing about the rest of SCP-2747!tropes, destroying the narrative once the process is complete? That... would neatly explain this weird delay with which SCP-2747 works: it allows stories to exist just long enough to have someone comment and review on them, then wipes them out. It's weird behaviour otherwise, why wouldn't it activate the moment a narrative is complete?

Hypothesis: part of SCP-2747's tropes are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceReactions][/audience tropes/]].

I think /No Sister of Mine/ confirms it. In it, the audience/the gamers were the ones to bring the "futile effort" trope into existence, with their attempts to complete the game.

So, running with the hypothesis, we're currently directly involved with SCP-2747, possibly influenced by its incomplete body to call into existence the rest of it. /Wonderful./ What have you done, [[/u/KBAREY][u/KBAREY]]?
