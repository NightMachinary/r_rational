I'm a bit lost here.\\
1. What exactly is the SCP foundation?\\
2. Is this entry describing a "fictional" concept (as in, a concept that exists in a fictional universe - the SCP universe perhaps, if SCP is fiction), or are they trying to explain a part of "our" reality? I'd really appreciate some clarificarion, because it's really interesting, but I don't know to what extent it's to be taken seriously.
