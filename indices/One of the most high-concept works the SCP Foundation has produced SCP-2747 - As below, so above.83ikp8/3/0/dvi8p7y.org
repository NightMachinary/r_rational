[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation]] answers both questions. However to be more explicit, the SCP Foundation is a collaborative fictional universe revolving around a clandestine organization dedicated protecting humanity from the supernatural by tracking down and imprisoning supernatural elements. Users submit entries (SCPs) representing fictional entities or objects imprisoned by the SCP foundations, and they're compiled on the website.
