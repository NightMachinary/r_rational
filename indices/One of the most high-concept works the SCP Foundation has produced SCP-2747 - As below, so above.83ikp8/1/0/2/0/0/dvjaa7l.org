  Edit: I broke the aforementioned seven, but it's worse: we identified six tropes SCP-2747 requires (destination, duality, fruitless, a seven, the seventh is different, spirals). This line of inquiry needs to end, immediately.

Considering that the theme isn't [7] but [7, 1 of which is missing and/or different] we'd probably be better off if someone came up with a 7th and posted it - the alternative is someone's going to notice a 7th and not post it, which itself completes the pattern.

EDIT: Actually, assuming that the 7th trope exists things currently stand at [7 tropes exist, one of which hasn't been discovered], so we're completely screwed even if no-one comes up with one without posting it.
