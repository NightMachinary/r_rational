It's not so much our concerns as it is the narrative's predisposition towards the number 7. I think it likely that there is a seventh trope specifically not revealed by the author so that it can exist as the lost one, and given how shaky the concept of [lost/empty] seems to be here, even if we found it it's likely to qualify as such to some degree (though perhaps to a lesser extent, if that matters when invoking symbolism). As such, the obvious solution is indeed the only possible solution - find 2 more tropes and save our universe, with finding 1 perhaps weakening the effect enough to buy us some time... or perhaps just making the struggle seem winnable, such that our inevitable defeat and annihilation seem that much more tragic.
