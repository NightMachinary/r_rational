The solution to that seems obvious --- figure out /two/ more tropes, bringing the total to 8 --- but I'm worried it will be harder than it seems, and then we'll realize we have spent a lot of effort in vain...

On the other hand, is [7] really invoked in this case? There's nothing to suggest that there's only /one/ more trope to discover, not three or two hundred. Would it really count if we leave it at six? That seems unfair, it's 6/N, not 6/7.

Unless... do our concerns about completing the pattern with seven tropes themselves invoke the trope of seven things? That's such bullshit.
