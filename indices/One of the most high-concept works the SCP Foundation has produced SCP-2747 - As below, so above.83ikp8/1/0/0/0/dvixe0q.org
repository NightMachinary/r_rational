Huh, indeed.

*Spirals:* I think in /ex lux/, the narrative spirals, "as the inner tales eventually begin to intertwine such that later tales shed new light on ones recounted earlier".

I think something similar happens/is meant to happen in /No Sister of Mine/, when the players are supposed to clear the game's previous areas. Perhaps it needs to happen multiple times, not once? A spiral of a sort, too.

Hmm, and /Taitoru/'s title is self-referential. It's... No, it's not really a spiral.

No idea regarding the remaining two.

*One of the seven is different:* In /The Scolipendra Wiki/, the obvious guess to make is that the "antagonist" is pretending to be one of the main characters. In /Punta de la espira/... perhaps the seventh is the recipient of the gift, but we have frustratingly little information in this case.

A duality of the "dark destination" may be another commonality: /Punta de la espira/'s mountain is described as either divine or demonic, and /No Sister of Mine/'s tome either gives power or unleashes a curse.
