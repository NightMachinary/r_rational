Is it possible that the "missing" parts, particularly those that are detectable only through inference (the "fragments," the referenced but unseen antagonists), are not actually part of the anfabula, but are instead evidence that parts of the works had already been annihilated by the time the fanfiction/wiki entries/etc were produced? E.g. maybe the original "No Sister Of Mine" actually contained the fragments necessary to complete the final questline, but they were part of the first fiction tier to be annihilated, so the reviews described a version of the game with conspicuously missing parts. Then presumably the rest of the game vanished after the reviews were posted.

I think this interpretation fits with the "layers of metafiction" motif pretty well. The reviewers of "No Sister Of Mine" could infer from references in the game that the fragments should exist, but they couldn't find the actual fragments because they were gone. The Foundation can infer from references in the Something Awful threads that the game should exist, but they can't find the actual game because it's gone.
