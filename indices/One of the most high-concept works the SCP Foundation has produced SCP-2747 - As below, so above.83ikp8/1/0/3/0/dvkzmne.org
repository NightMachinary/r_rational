Yes, there's definitely something of the sort, but I think you're mixing two tropes there. One is the "duality" of the destination: the demonic/divine mountain and /No Sister of Mine/'s power-granting/cursing tome. Also this for /Mavigne/:

  Mavigne, Or: A Treatise On The Metaphysics Of Inner Space Travel, And The Kingdom Of Erikaar, Whose Name Is *Darkness Made Light*

The other trope is... Hm. Changing environments separated by thresholds? Different worlds in /The Scolipendra Wiki/ (and fanfics? authors?), different narrations and languages in /ex lux/, and different realms in /Mavigne/. /No Sister of Mine/: maybe different levels? /I/O/ seems to sharply break the pattern with its "seamless flow" between tracks, but maybe "different tracks" still fits.

Or vice versa? Transitions are usually seamless, and /Mavigne/ breaks the pattern with thresholds? Or thresholds don't matter?

/Taitoru/: yes, "boundaries blur" may be a clue we can't place because of lack of information. Maybe there were some significant differences between chapters... On the other hand, "a manga divided into chapters" isn't really a noteworthy trope, but then /I/O/ and /No Sister of Mine/ wouldn't count as well. Hm.

I'm also clueless regarding music, is it common for albums to have seamless transitions between tracks? Aha, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/2pytiv/discussion_what_albums_out_there_are_single/][apparently not]], thank you, Google.

Yep, I think that's it, you're right.

- Blurring of the boundaries between contexts:

  - /Punta de la espira/: unclear.
  - /Taitoru/: a "blurring boundary" between sanity and insanity/real and unreal.
  - /No Sister of Mine/: unclear. Guess: transitions between levels/areas were made seamless.
  - /The Scolipendra Wiki/: inter-universal travellers blurring the boundaries between universes.
  - /I/O/: seamless flow of different tracks.
  - /Mavigne/: blurring of the boundary between the tangible and the intangible (gradual transition from the realm of minerals to the realms of light and silence).
  - /ex lux/: near the end, blurring of the boundaries between different narrations.

Well, cool. We have seven tropes now.
