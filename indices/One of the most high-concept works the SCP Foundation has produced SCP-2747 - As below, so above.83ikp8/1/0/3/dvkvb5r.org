There seems to also be a theme of blurring/breaking boundaries. I think, I'm not sure.

/Punta de la Espira/: The mountain alternates between being compared to a "abode of gods" and a "demonic presence".

/Taitoru/: Explicitly stated that "boundaries blur", implication that insane protagonist slowly loses ability to distinguish between reality and fiction.

/No sister of mine/: unsure about this one.

/scolipendra wiki/: Supposedly characters often wonder between different 'realms', and apparently the series is pretty receptive to crossover fanfics with other universes.

/I/O/: No idea, I'm clueless when it comes to music.

/Mavigne/: There are numerous 'thresholds' that must be crossed. Also, the book is stated to be a nested frame narrative.

/Ex Lux/: readers alternate between different story threads, it's written in a mix of 3 different languages, and there's the thing about 'inner tales' intertwining with 'later tales'.
