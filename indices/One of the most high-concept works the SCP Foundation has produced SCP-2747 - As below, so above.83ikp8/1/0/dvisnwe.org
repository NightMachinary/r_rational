It doesn't have to be meta, it has to feature a certain combination of tropes. Among them:

- A "dark" destination:

  - /Punta de la espira/: the possibly-demonic mountain.\\
  - /Taitoru/: the shadows/the manga (unclear, maybe its plot was bleak?)\\
  - /No Sister of Mine/: the black possibly-cursed tome.\\
  - /The Scolipendra Wiki/: the obsidian concept-destroyer.\\
  - /I/O/: the theme of self-hate.\\
  - /Mavigne/: the cold core of the earth.\\
  - /ex lux/: the truth of the murder.\\
  - The article itself: SCP-2747's nature.\\

- Great effort going to vain:

  - /Punta de la espira/: the journey to the mountain.
  - /Taitoru/: getting past the writer's block.
  - /No Sister of Mine/: players trying to complete the game.
  - /The Scolipendra Wiki/: characters wandering between universes in search (unclear, possibly they fail?).
  - /I/O/: exploring the depressing theme.
  - /Mavigne/: learning the secrets of the earth.
  - /ex lux/: identifying the murderer.
  - The article itself: the Foundation failing to figure out SCP-2747's nature ([DATA LOST]).

- 7 things:

  - /Punta de la espira/: unclear; on meta-level, 10+7 articles about it (flimsy, yes).
  - /Taitoru/: unclear.
  - /No Sister of Mine/: 6 characters looking for the seventh; on meta-level, 77 threads about it.
  - /The Scolipendra Wiki/: 7 characters wandering in search of a 7-sided object; on meta-level, 7^{2} pieces of fanfiction about it, with wordcount between 7^{3} and 7^{4}.
  - /I/O/: 7 tracks, one of them (between the fifth and the sixth) missing, each track (34*60+18)/6=343=7^{3} seconds long; on meta-level, 14 reviews about it, and Greene gave it a 7.0 score.
  - /Mavigne/: 7 realms; on meta-level, 7 articles about it.
  - /ex lux/: 7 characters and story threads; on meta-level, posts on 7 blogs, 25*7 Twitter posts.
  - The article itself: SCP-2*7*4*7*, a watchlist of 7000 artists, 7 examples of SCP-2747's manifestations, 7 footnotes.

  /^{I did not expect to do numerology today.}/

It's likely an incomplete list, and not all provided examples clearly feature all of them. I suppose it's because of lack of information (the Foundation being unable to piece together the full plot of these stories), not because they're optional.
