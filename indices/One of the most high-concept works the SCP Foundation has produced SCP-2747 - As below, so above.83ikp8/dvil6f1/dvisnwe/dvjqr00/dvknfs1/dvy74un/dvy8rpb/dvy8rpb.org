Hmm. I don't know. The exact rule seems to be, seven object, one of them with a hidden property. In this case, we would have /two/ objects merging into one, on equal terms. It seems really clever, yes, but it doesn't fit as well as the rest of them.

At the same time, there's not much wiggle room for assuming some missed context that fixes everything. In /The Scolipendra Wiki/, for example, there's apparently 8 characters, but we could similarly assume that two of them --- one of the heroes and the antagonist --- are secretly the same person. Unlike /Taitoru/'s case, though, we could further assume that one of these roles is their /true/ nature (i.e., a hero pretending to be the antagonist or the antagonist infiltrating the heroes), and the other one --- a mere mask. But in this case, a title is a title is a title.

I do count it as a tentative fit, though.
