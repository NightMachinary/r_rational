Yes, I know. I realized it far too late, and now trying to fight it would only hasten the destruction --- skip from "SCP-2747 destroys the narrative I figured out, turning my effort fruitless" to "I destroy the narrative I figured out, turning my effort fruitless". There's apparently some delay before SCP-2747 starts working on its own, so the first option lets our reality to exist a little longer.

/Mind you/, that's the worst-case scenario. In all probability my (and [[/u/ArisKatsaris][u/ArisKatsaris]]') notes don't contain the /full/ description of SCP-2747. After all, all we had to work with were seven brief overviews of the anomaly's manifestations, little to no actual experience with paranormal research, and, what, twelve hours? If that was all it took, the Foundation wouldn't have needed any Lucid Chalices, one bored researcher would've sufficed.

In fact, I think anthropic principle guarantees that SCP-2747's article doesn't contain the information necessary to piece together SCP-2747 fully, otherwise it would have self-destructed already. There's no cause for concern at all!

... Just to be sure, I didn't leave any sevens anywhere, did I? My lists have eight bullet-points, word- and character-counts aren't significant, sevens in direct discussions are on the wrong meta-level, there's 20 (21) comments, 10-18 points... Yep, we're in the clear.

Wait. No. I now made /six/ comments in this thread, /and/ sent a PM to a friend recommending to read this article. Seven messages about SCP-2747 made by me, one of them hidden. /Fuck./

*Edit:* I broke the aforementioned seven, but it's worse: we identified /six/ tropes SCP-2747 requires (destination, duality, fruitless, a seven, the seventh is different, spirals). This line of inquiry needs to end, /immediately/.
