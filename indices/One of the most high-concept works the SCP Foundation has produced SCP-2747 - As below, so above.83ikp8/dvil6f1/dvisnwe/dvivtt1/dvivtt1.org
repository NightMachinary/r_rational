Other things that seems to be shared in /some/ of the works, and probably it would have been all of them if we had a complete description are probably:\\
- spirals (Punta de la espira title, I/O's cover and themes of 'spirals of isolation and inspiration')\\
- 1 of the 7 elements being ominous, mysterious, unseen or all three. (The Sister in "No Sister of Mine", The Stranger in "ex lux", the realm of "cold and silence" in Mavigne, the missing 'audio track' in I/O)
