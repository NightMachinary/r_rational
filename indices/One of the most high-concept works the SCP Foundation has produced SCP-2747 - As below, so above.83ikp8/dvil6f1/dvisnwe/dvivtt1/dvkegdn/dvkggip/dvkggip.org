That's what I'm thinking. And the "coal-black, thornbound tome" described in /No Sister of Mine/ is the charcoal manuscript of /Mavigne/, which is also possibly the gift being delivered in /Punta de la espira/, and maybe even the "obsidian emblem" from /The Scolipendra Wiki/; a single item moving up through the layers of meta-narrative. A book that describes the exact nature of reality in detail would of course be able to grant great power, but its presence in a story threatens to complete the /anafabula/ pattern, thus unleashing a terrible curse.
