As near as I can tell, this seems to be some kind of metafictional entity that manifests inside fictional stories and then somehow nullifies said stories' existence, causing them to disappear from their "parent" world (the world which produced the stories in the first place). Also, apparently this thing is capable of, not only nullifying the stories /themselves/, but also stories /within/ stories, as well as stories within stories within stories, and so on. So it's essentially munching its way up a nested tower of fictional narratives, and the payoff is that because the /SCP universe/ is actually fictional, that suggests that they're also going to be erased--after which, of course, we're next in line.

If I'm right, then this is a pretty neat concept, but the horror relies pretty heavily on a couple of metaphysical assumptions that I don't share (such as, for example, the assumption that we live in a fictional universe). As such, I can appreciate this as a /concept/, but not really as /horror/.
