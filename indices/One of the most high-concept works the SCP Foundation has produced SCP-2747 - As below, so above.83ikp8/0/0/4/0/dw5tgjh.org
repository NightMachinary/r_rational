Yes, but it's essentially a different way of looking at the same anomaly. I look at SCP-2747 as at a combination of tropes which destroys itself. If this combination defines, among other things, a narrative-destroying antagonist --- i. e., if the destruction of the narrative is justified from /inside/ that narrative, if it would make sense for the characters of that fictional work to know that their world would be destroyed if the antagonist wins --- that doesn't change anything. Not /every/ narrative-destroying antagonist /literally/ destroys the narrative it is put in --- think about the Nothing from /The NeverEnding Story/, for example, or [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2470][SCP-2470]]. Only this particular antagonist, perhaps in combination with certain other tropes, has this anomalous property.
