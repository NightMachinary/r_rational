Hmm. "Antagonist" is a trope that plays a particular role in the narrative. It's not obvious that there couldn't be a similar role to play in the narrative created by music, I think you're right on that.

We need a music expert here, though. Or anyone with any clue regarding music-based narratives whatsoever.
