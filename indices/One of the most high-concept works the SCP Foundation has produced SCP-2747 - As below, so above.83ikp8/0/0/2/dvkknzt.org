Can I ask why SCP is of rational interest?

It's a universe that is built to /discourage/ rational exploration, /discourage/ trying to develop tech or figure out the underlying principles of the universe that let these devices work, and so on.

The correct answer in SCP is "lock all the interesting stuff away and pretend it doesn't exist"
