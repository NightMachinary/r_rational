either 2747 is a narrative eating monster created within narrative (Infohazard?) or its a self propagating narrative analysis/artifact generator (memetic).

If the first case then it doesn't matter if you believe we are fictional or not it has had an effect on our level of reality by wiping people minds and erasing the actual story from physical media. Don't get considered the container of an offending story or people will only remember that they read an article about someone like you once.

In the second case people don't remember writing the articles/artifacts because they didn't. The SCP did and seeded those articles/artifacts through some unknown mechanic into our reality in which case the narrative never existed, The reference to LUCID CHALICE is just another artifact, and this SCP is as dangerous as waterlogged bread.
