Brainwashed future self still has to somehow trick current self. If you ask for a locker number and assume that an enemy answers, you can still try any number sent.

The scarier problem of course is that any AI that happens to get developed within whatever time frame you specify will have a shot at convincing you to bring it about in reality.
