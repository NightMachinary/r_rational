What do you think of this power of limited precognition: at the expense of some energy/mana/whatever, a person would be able to look into their future self's timeline for an answer to a specific question. The questions asked must be something the "skipper" (tentative name, open to suggestions) would answer eventually anyway, so long as the answer is something that he or she would find out anyway, had she not had/used this power.

Caveats: the further into the future, the harder it is to answer a question. There is no guarantee that the answer you find out in the hypothetical future is correct, necessarily, just like in one's own life. And finally, it's useless to ask question that in order to be answered requires your death or severe injury.

So an illiterate shaman can't ask if P = NP or "when Winds of Winter will be released", but he can ask "is this stranger trustworthy" or "will Winds of Winter be released in the next month".
