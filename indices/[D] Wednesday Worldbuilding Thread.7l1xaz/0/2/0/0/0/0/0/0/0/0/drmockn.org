Hm, yes, I was thinking along the lines of arbitrarily smart enemies attacking the current self with dangerous memes or ASI-style brainhacking messages, or bullshit mind magic. If the enemies are nearhumanbaselines, then yes, questions on gathering of objective information would work --- but then I really doubt that they would be able to brainwash the future self to the extent you're implying to begin with.
