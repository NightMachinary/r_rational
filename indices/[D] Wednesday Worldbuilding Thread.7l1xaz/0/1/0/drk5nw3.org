He said the skipper must eventually find out the answer anyway, without using the power. So if you ask "is this hallway boobytrapped", and your future self says /"OH GOD YES WHY OH WHY DID I DO THIS! AIEEEEEE!!"/ You will know it is booby trapped, but you will know that you will find out by triggering the traps anyway, because that's the only way your future self would have found out.

At least, that's how I interpreted it.
