It's not exactly a single timeline. You can still make changes depending on the answer you get, but you can't change how you find out the answer at the future time you are queried.

So for example, I can query myself one week in the future: "Hey you, what are the winning lotto numbers?", and future me can just look them up online and tell me. I can then proceed to buy lotto tickets with those numbers, win the lotto, then proceed to look up the winning lotto numbers online and tell past me.

The reason this doesn't work for deaths/serious injuries is that if you query yourself 1 hour in the future: "Hey you, is this hallway boobytrapped", future you can indeed just walk into the hallway to find out, and can indeed tell you "ARGH YES ARGH!!". You can then proceed to make some changes, like maybe telling your party members not to follow you into this horrible horrible trap, but in the end, within the next hour, you *will* be forced to walk into the hallway to find out that it is booby trapped without using your power. Then you will be seriously injured/dead anyway, so that answer doesn't really help you.

It still helps your party members though, so I guess you can still technically munchkin if you're willing to make the sacrifice. But then, if you are willing to make the sacrifice anyway, you could just walk into that hallway like a normal person. No need for future querying. Your party members can see you get horribly maimed well enough without any fancy future sight.
