Both situations compel you to follow the destiny of determining the answer to current you's question.

In the lotto numbers situation, I am compelled, within the next week, to look up the winning lotto numbers online.

In the boobytrapped situation, I am compelled, within the next hour, to walk into the hallway to find out whether it is boobytrapped.

Essentially, if you ask yourself from T seconds in the future the answer to some question X, and future you derives the answer by executing some method Y, you will be compelled to execute method Y within the next T seconds. Everything else about the future can be changed, only that one event that originally led future you to the answer for question X cannot be changed.
