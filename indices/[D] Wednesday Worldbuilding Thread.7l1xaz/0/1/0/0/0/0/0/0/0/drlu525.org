Huh, I'm not sure whether that would work. On one hand, it sounds like the method for determining which hallway is boobytrapped is the mundane method of walking into one. But on the other hand, the full method for finding out which hallway is boobytrapped uses your future knowledge. I mean, if I understood correctly, the proposed method is essentially this:

- Step 1: Ask which hallway is boobytrapped, left or right.
- Step 2: If left, go right. If right, go left.
- Step 3: See that the hallway you went into is not boobytrapped.

Seeing as step 1 is literally the usage of your future query ability, this isn't a mundane method of finding out which hallway is boobytrapped.

In order to work, I think you may have to resolve to walk into a specific one of the hallways regardless of the answers to your future queries, since intuitively, that's what the original-timeline-you would have to do.
