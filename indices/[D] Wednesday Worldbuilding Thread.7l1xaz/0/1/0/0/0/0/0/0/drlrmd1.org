Here's an alternative way to munchkin the boobytrapped hallway.

Ahead of you are two paths. One leads to certain death, and the other leads to survival. You ask the question "is the left hallway boobytrapped?". The answer is yes, so you go right and see through your survival that the left path is the boobytrap and the right path is the one that allows survival.

Is there any flaw in this situation as I present it?

PS I'm assuming the power works by giving only yes/no answers.
