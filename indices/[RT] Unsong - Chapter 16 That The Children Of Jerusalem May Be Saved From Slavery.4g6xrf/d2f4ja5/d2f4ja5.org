Sohu confirmed as the Comet King's daughter (Cometspawn is a strange name for them). We know that she's the youngest, but is she the most recently born? She has been eight years old for about ten years at this point, and it was written that she's youngest /by virtue of/ her agelessness.

For reference, most of this takes place one month before the discovery of the Vital Name. Sohu's part was almost six months after she was made immortal.
