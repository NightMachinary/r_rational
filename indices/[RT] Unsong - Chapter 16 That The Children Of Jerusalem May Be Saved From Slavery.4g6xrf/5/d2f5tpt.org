Okay, I think this chapter sets it: the world we're being shown is a simulation. Uriel is an admin for this world, though it was created by someone else ("God"). All the programming terms Uriel is using are funny, and I may be able to laugh them off if it turns out to not be a simulation, but by this point it just makes more sense.
