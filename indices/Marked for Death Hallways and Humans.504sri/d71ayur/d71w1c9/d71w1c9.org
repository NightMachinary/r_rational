I have a question. I keep seeing references to a plan to create Village Hidden in the Heavens or something like that and I was wondering if you (the GMs) were thinking of adding it to the threadmarks as one of the omakes. Because I think the plan itself is interesting enough to be included in it's own right.

Other than that, wonderful job writing this story! ;)
