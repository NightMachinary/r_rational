Alright, so after telling this to any other gods that'll listen, I'd start sending my prophet to Athens and uplifting anyone who'll join my church (plus any other gods in the "Save the World" pantheon). Smite anyone who tries to mess about with their new powers.

Unify the world under my church. I'll be rather open, all things considered- No worship exclusivity or discrimination. I need this belief and control. If I can't get the various city-states to work together, I'll split various capacities of R&D between them and just encourage trade and information exchange.

Can I make planeswalkers? Make a few, send them to various worlds to learn magic/technology/new ideas and bring them back. (If I can make unlimited planeswalkers, do it to everyone and mass emigrate to somewhere nicer, after having rescued everyone from the underworld)

Once I have a good base of operations, start research on magic itself. We'll need some real powerhouse spells to fight the BioBorg. See if I can jump start an industrial revolution too- The Eldrazi will have the shock of their life when they hit with a nuclear warhead instead of Lightning Hex. Speed this up via *carefully* applied intelligence increasing gifts. If I can't directly raise someone's IQ, give them perfect memory and good health.
