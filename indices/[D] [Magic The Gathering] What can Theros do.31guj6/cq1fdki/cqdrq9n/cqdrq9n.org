This is not destructive in-and-of itself, but it gives infinite mana, turns, card draws, artifact ressurects, milling and counters of all kinds.

Essentially, the opponent happlessly looks on as you summon an army of giant monster tokens, and imprint Isochron Scepters with Counterspell, Lightning, Naturalize, Pay No Heed, and Terror. Mix in some Exile effects for the indestructible stuff.

The other option is to go Green and use Life and Limb (saprolings are forests, forests are saprolings) and then make approximately a quadrillion saprolings (not hard, there are exponential growth-rate saproling strategies) to serve as a Mana battery. Then summon some truly huge mobs, or buff your eternally growing army of saprolings.
