Actually, Emrakul has flying, so you're not blocking it with squirrels without some additional magic. And protection from colored spells is going to stop most direct damage spells.

Luckily nukes, being artifacts, are colorless, and so Emrakul isn't protected from them.

Ulamog, on the other hand, is indestructible. Luckily, he hasn't (yet?) left Zendikar, according to the lore.
