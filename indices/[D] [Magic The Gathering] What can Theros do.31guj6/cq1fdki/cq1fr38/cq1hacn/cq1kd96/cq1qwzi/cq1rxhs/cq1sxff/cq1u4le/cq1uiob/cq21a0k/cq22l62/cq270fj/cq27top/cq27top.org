Ah. Then I suppose this is where we must agree to disagree.

From my point of view, the game and its rules are a vital and integral part of the setting. Otherwise, your just picking and choosing. Your making your own setting, using some preexisting story elements like planes, magic, and planeswalkers. There is nothing wrong with this, but it's no longer the same world. Other than the shared story elements, these two settings share nothing in common. They most assuredly are /not/ the same world.
