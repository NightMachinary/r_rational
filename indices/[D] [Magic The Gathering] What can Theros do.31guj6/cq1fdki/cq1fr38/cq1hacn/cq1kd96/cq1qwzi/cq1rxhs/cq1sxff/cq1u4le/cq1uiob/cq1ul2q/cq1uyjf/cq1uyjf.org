Wrath of God destroys all creatures on the /battlefield/. The plane has nothing to do with it.

(And Emrakul shuffles itself into its owner's library when killed. In-game, this ability shows that killing it is just killing a single manifestation of its ineffable and unearthly presence, and it will be back, sooner or later. 15 (or rather 21) squirrels (or soldiers, or whatever) (with Levitation magic) can't stop Emarkul forever, but they can slow it down a bit.)
