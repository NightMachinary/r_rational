/What/ is the point of the game, if you don't do that? We are in a /game world/, with its own unique rules. We will optimize, within those constraints, and we will tell stories, within that world.

In other places we will tell other stories, set in other worlds, with other rules, but here we are telling a story in this world, with it's own rules.

In HPMOR, a large part of the fun was playing around with the HP rules of magic. If we wanted to tell out own story in a world of our own invention, we could (and we do), but the point of writing in a preexisting world is to play within its existing rules.
