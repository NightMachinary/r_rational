  The rules of physics are kind of vital to the world, and you can't just change them and expect the world to remain the same.

The rules of Magic are not the rules of the /settings/ of Magic. They're approximations of those. Bad approximations, in many cases.

A Theros goat can't literally wield swords, it's just that goat cards are Type:Creature and sword cards are Type:Equipment, and the equipment rules don't bother with details like "does this creature have hands?"

Stories set in Theros, like the discussion we're having in this thread, involve the rules of the setting, not the rules of the card game. At best, the card game can be a source of hints about how the setting works (like how Emrakul is immune to all magic except Ugin's weird colourless brand).
