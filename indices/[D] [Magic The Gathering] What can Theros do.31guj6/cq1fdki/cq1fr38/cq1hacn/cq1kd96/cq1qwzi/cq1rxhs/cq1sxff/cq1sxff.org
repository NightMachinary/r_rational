Yes, Levitation for example. Oh, and you need six permanents that you don't care about. Perhaps more 1/1 tokens.

You could get the tokens with a Martial Coup, X=15 (or 21). Or rather, who cares about the tokens. Just cast it with X=5!

Cheaper yet, Wrath of God. In fact, we've got a /whole pantheon/ of wrathful gods. Destroying an eldrazi isn't so hard... except for Ulamog. Him, you need to exile.
