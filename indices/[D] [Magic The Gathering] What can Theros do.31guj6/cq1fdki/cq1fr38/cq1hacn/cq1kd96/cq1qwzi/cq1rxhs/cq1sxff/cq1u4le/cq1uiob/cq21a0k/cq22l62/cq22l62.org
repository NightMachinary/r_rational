Um... I don't think it works that way. I don't think it /can/ work that way. The rules of physics are kind of vital to the world, and you can't just change them and expect the world to remain the same. Imagine a Harry Potter fanfic set in a world without the HP magic system. Maybe without magic, maybe with a different magic system (for instance, the D&D one.) You could write some fanfic with that premise, I suppose, but you'd be changing the world so much it would be hard for it to truly be fanfic of HP. Certainly, when told a story is set in the HP universe, you assume until told otherwise that this is /not/ the case, and that the normal rules of canon, and maybe fanon, apply to the letter.
