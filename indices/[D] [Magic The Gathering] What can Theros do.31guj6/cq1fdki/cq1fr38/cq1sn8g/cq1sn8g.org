Speaking of the Eldrazi, note that, though they aren't at all impossible to defeat physically, they can't actually be permanently killed; anything that would do so only seems to banish them back to wherever they came from, for a time. This is apparently problematic enough that an entire plane was sacrificed merely to seal them away for a time, and so no merely physical response to their presence should be seen as a permanent solution.

Also, it's easy, but misleading, to think of the Eldrazi as merely powerful monsters. There's an alien intelligence there, with the power to not just unmake reality, but to resculpt it. In this sense, [[http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Kozilek][Kozilek]] is scarier than [[http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Emrakul][Emrakul]]. Sure, Emrakul is big and scary, and has the most destructive power, plus immunity to most magic and the ability to warp time. Kozilek isn't as personally threatening, but it has a fearsome intelligence, which has enabled it to create spawn like [[http://magiccards.info/query?q=%21It+That+Betrays][It That Betrays]], a threat on a whole other level. Instead of merely destroying, Kozilek spreads madness, slowly turning your world and your works to its own purpose. Any people, ideas, or capabilities you have can be turned to Kozilek's service.
