Okay, I'm going to take the role of reality (or the dungeon master, if you prefer) and check what would work and what wouldn't.

#+begin_quote
  Can I make planeswalkers?
#+end_quote

Nope. The gods can do a lot, but this is not something you can do. Planeswalkers are weird like that. Kruphix does know everything a planeswalker on Theros knows.

#+begin_quote
  I'd start sending my prophet to Athens and uplifting anyone who'll join my church (plus any other gods in the "Save the World" pantheon). Smite anyone who tries to mess about with their new powers.
#+end_quote

Works, but takes longer than you expect. Even the gods and their magic are bound by time and casting a spell takes non-zero time.

#+begin_quote
  Unify the world under my church.
#+end_quote

Works, but also slower than you expect. Kruphix doesn't have a lot of followers (he's not a "useful" deity). Once the other gods notice what you are doing (after the first few stop existing, probably) they start to oppose you. You stop them, but lose valuable assets depending on which gods you lose (getting people out of the underworld is going to be impossible if there's no god managing that, for example).

#+begin_quote
  We'll need some real powerhouse spells to fight the BioBorg. See if I can jump start an industrial revolution too-
#+end_quote

An industrial revolution makes it easier for the Phyrexians to corrupt your society, but if your spell arsenal and your early response is good enough, this works.

#+begin_quote
  The Eldrazi will have the shock of their life when they hit with a nuclear warhead instead of Lightning Hex.
#+end_quote

Probably works. At the very least scares of the Eldrazi.

#+begin_quote
  Speed this up via carefully applied intelligence increasing gifts. If I can't directly raise someone's IQ, give them perfect memory and good health.
#+end_quote

Works.
