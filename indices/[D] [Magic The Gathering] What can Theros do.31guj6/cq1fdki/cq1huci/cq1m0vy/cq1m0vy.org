  Also fortunately, Nicol Bolas probably doesn't care about Theros at all right now.

I'm not sure Nicol Bolas is even aware of Theros, but if he is, the whole "belief gives you free divine power" thing might well attract his interest, same way Alara did.

I haven't followed the stories closely enough to know if Bolas is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall][villain-ball]]-carrying or an actual mastermind. Would he think to replace / transform the population of Theros into barely-sentient homunculi who spend every spare neuron on worshipping him? Or would he go about it in much less efficient ways?
