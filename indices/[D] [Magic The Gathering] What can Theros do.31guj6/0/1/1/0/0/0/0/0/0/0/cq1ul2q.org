What I mean is that while Wrath of God might say "Destroy all creatures," on the card, in-universe it can't be used to kill all living things on a plane. Same with the squirrels blocking an Eldrazi. It works in the game because it's an abstraction. If you pit 15 squirrels against an Eldrazi outside of the card game, the poor critters die before they even get close to the monstrosity.
