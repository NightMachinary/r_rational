No. The creative time works hand in hand with design and development. WotC integrates them all into a cohesive whole, which is actually my /point/.

And while I like 2ye, the thing I hate about it most is how it pathologises lawfulness. It spends /way/ to much time with its carnival of edge cases. No, the edge cases aren't pretty, but honestly the same can be said about our own universe's laws (/cough/, quantum mechanics.)

If you think "follows the rules as written" ends up anything like 2ye, you're mistaken. 2ye goes massively out of its way to twist things into looking as ridiculous as possible, and tries to pretend it's the rules' fault. It isn't.

(To paraphrase a recent meme: Never doubt you can have a universe that is both lawful and sane. Indeed, it's the only thing that's ever existed.)
