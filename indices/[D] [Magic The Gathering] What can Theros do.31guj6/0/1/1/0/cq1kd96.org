Remember, MtG creatures generally aren't actually all that scary directly. Emrakul is a /strategic/ threat, more than a tactical one. See [[http://cardboard-crack.com/post/82651057967/emrakul-color][here]] for one possible way of getting rid of Emrakul. Emrakul is certainly big and scary, but enough direct damage will put it down. As such, nukes probably work... if you're in a position to actually deploy them.

Bear in mind that Emrakul has no obligation to sit in a place where you can bomb it, and can wreak grievous destruction on your universe even while in unoccupied parts of it.
