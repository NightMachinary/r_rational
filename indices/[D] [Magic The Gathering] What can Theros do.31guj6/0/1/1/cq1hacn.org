I very much doubt that the bigger Eldrazi like Emrakul or Ulamog would care a lot about nukes. It just feels like it would be a far too mundane weapon when you're fighting against beings that have eaten probably more than just a few civilizations that fought back.

Also, Eldrazi don't specifically eat magic, they eat the actual plane. If they stay too long on your plane (and they will), your homeworld will eventually just cease to exist.
