Two quick questions:

a) Are the Eldrazi the sort to leave a plane alone if it become more trouble than it's worth to eat? That is, if I can find something to temporarily kill Emrakul every time he comes back, will it eventually just choose to go ruin another plane, and deal with us later in it's multiversal plan, or will it take it as an insult and just keep coming back?

b) Are Eldrazi the sort to start sending a few of themselves deep underwater/underground/out of sight to eat the mana of the world without anyone realizing? It would really suck to think they're gone, only for the world to wink out after a few years of stealth-mana-drain.

If the answers are "yes" and "no", then if I can get a reliable superweapon up before one of them shows up, that's a third of the threat gone in the medium term.
