Eldrazi are essentially lovecraftian monsters. If they have personality and so on, it's not expressed in a way that's easily understood.

It may be they just don't have a concept of victory or defeat, let alone 'too much trouble to handle right now'. As far as I get it, they follow a trail of magic, draining as they go.

This makes my understanding of them that the answer to both questions is 'no'. The plane they're currently infesting/trying to eat, Zendikar, was deliberately chosen as a trap for them though. The magic is particularly powerful, and it's a form of wild magic (literally even) as well. It may be that attempts to drain that kind of power covertly is impossible. If you offend Zendikar, the plane itself is liable to try and get up to hit you.
