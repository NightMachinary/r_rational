We've already seen big Eldrazi being physically subdued. It can be done, but it would be problematic in terms of ground and number you'd lose to them.

  Also, Eldrazi don't specifically eat magic, they eat the actual plane. If they stay too long on your plane (and they will), your homeworld will eventually just cease to exist.

They eat mana, not magic. Mana is what keeps planes going.
