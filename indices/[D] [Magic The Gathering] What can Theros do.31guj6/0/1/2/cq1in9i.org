I can make new gods, right? If I have my prophet start talking about Scott, god of hedges and finance, he'll start coming online in a few years?

OK, figure out the tradeoff between consolidating belief and having more gods to believe in- If I can get more total godpower or what-have-you via more total gods, start expanding my pantheon with imaginary gods (Who are, of course, known in lore to be totally loyal to me- Or better yet, just family members who'll never betray me)

If there's no upper limit, institute personal gods for worshippers (Second to me, ala Catholic saints) to get every last marginal drop of god power.

If there's decreasing returns from more gods, have my prophet keep a tight eye on the folklore and apocrypha of my religion- If some minor backwoods cult starts up some evil twin of mine, I could lose power and make a new enemy. In fact, do that anyways- I have enough trouble with competing gods.

As for powers, be more selective but less quiet about them- None of this "One miracle a decade" mystery stuff the other gods like.

Figure out where the marginal value of the additional intelligence powers will be the most useful- Assumably people with bad memories and/or health but high creative skills and fast cognition.

Reveal myself to a few of the +trusted+ (Scratch that, only trusted people get uplifted) high level intellects and get their advice. Same with any new gods I can recruit or create.

God recruitment: Find the dying gods of old times. Recruit them for advice on expanding the old pantheon.

Find the big gods, plead with them about X-Risk, and agree to lower-status worship in exchange for help and control of pantheon.
