Well I don't really give a medamn whether he's a hedge god or a lawn god, so long as he's a)Loyal to me, b) Intelligent enough to help my cause, c) Providing my pantheon with more total divine power and d) Totally fine with me creating him purely for the above reasons. Later on, I might experiment with a few gods of knowledge/intelligence/cunning for a divine-side intelligence improvement, if all goes well.
