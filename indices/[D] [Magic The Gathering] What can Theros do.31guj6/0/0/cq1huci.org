Magic player here. You cannot make planeswalkers. It is unknown how sparks are made/doled out, but the gods of Theros are certainly not powerful enough. It is also worth noting that planeswalkers used to be nigh - omnipotent gods before an event known as The Mending, which killed all of them except Nicol Bolas and (as of recently, time travel weeee) Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. Current planeswalkers are more like endgame MMO mages. There was a war between almost all of these godlike walkers and the Phyrexians. They failed to utterly destroy Phyrexia.

That is the magnitude of problem you have to deal with, all while not attracting attention to Theros as your base of operations. Fortunately, the Eldrazi are currently trapped on another plane and likely aren't going to be much of a threat for the next several centuries at least. Also fortunately, Nicol Bolas probably doesn't care about Theros at all right now. He would gain nothing from destroying Theros, and considering the threat level of the Eldrazi and Phyrexia, it may be possible to ally with him, for the same reason that one might be able to ally with Satan against an existential threat.

That's my take on the situation.
