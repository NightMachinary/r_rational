I don't actually know. I also don't follow the lore very closely, but as far as I can tell, Bolas is just in it for power. The end of the multiverse would end his power, and transforming everyone into praise - brains seems like a much more Phyrexian thing to do anyway. There's also the little wrinkle that becoming a Theran god would also remove his planeswalker spark, as you need to have a living, physical body to hold one.
