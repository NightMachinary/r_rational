I just thought of an idea for a squicky rational story. How about a researcher in either genetics or robotics that decides that the best way to get companions most fitting to a set of desired parameters is to raise them from scratch in a kind of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry][Hikaru Genji plot]].

And have the fic deal with the social and moral ramifications of it. It could tie to the role of service robots in the future and what would a being designed to please its master think of that role, particularly if such a being has consciousness. I'm not sure if that'd be too squicky though...
