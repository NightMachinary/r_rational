While it was an aphrodisiac it wasn't shown as the reason they were in the relationship, and it did touch on many topics regarding those relationships and their implications.

Don't know if i'd really count it as full on "rational" fiction, but it was well written, and i think the author put more effort into the relationships than any other story I read which wasn't first and foremost -about- relationships.
