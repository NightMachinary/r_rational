  Having some sense of sexuality prior to puberty.
#+end_quote

I was not aware of it at all. I knew about sex, and I actually got in trouble in first grade for lecturing about reproduction, but sexual attraction was completely alien to me until around fourth grade.

  OTOH, ideologically I'm a gender abolitionist, so I'm being inconsistent here.
#+end_quote

Abolitionist in what way? I'd certainly abolish involuntary anatomical sex and gender identity. I can imagine people in the future wanting to literally try on gender dysphoria, but as always, in a purely consensual fashion.

  And on the third and weirder hand, if I got to the future and there were all kinds of invent-your-own fads in gender and anatomical sex, right down to how the bits go together, then I'd breathe a massive sigh of relief that everything had gone just fine.
#+end_quote

The third hand is generally the weirdest. But if not all avatar expression or sensory erogeny is somatic, then anatomical sex can get even weirder. Orientation will also become several orders of magnitude more interesting. Fetishization will be normalized, and any mode of interaction with any configuration of people and objects will be sexualized.
