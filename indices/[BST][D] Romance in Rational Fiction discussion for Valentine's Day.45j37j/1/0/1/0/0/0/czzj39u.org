  The difference is mostly that the aggressor has a much greater degree of control than in real life.

Is what I would say, but I did a thought experiment and I'm still creeped out by an unintentional example. Degree of control is a part of it...

I have some more hypotheses:

- Attractiveness, a (debatably) complex function of elements of high levels of organization, is being subverted by a very low level of organization.

  - I say subverted because the effects are not advantageous to the individual. It may be genetically advantageous, just as being raped by a conquering tribe is genetically advantageous to the alternative.

- Attractiveness is made fundamentally alien to me (from an unaffected perspective) and the thought of being affected so I can appreciate it is horrifying to me.
- I believe I would not want to revert the change. I am s (both of D/s) and I would have a hard enough time being abstractly attracted to power without additionally being made concretely attracted. In the context of porn, though, this is incredibly attractive.

  - Why is it not attractive to me in Time Braid? Is it because I am in an intensely strategical mindset? Because I am identifying with the character so deeply while remaining unaffected?

- It resembles wireheading. Possibly the three points above are close to my definition of wireheading.
- I am focusing on only the psychological consequences on the subject (the potential for being exploited, though the aggressor may not be exploitative) and imagining myself in their position. The intentionality of the aggressor is only (morally? aesthetically?) relevant regarding culpability.
- It is the same sort of mind-altering sexuality that so creeps me out by a transformed 12-year-old corrupting her 12-year-old friend.
- It enables sexuality's use as a weapon against you. I can only think in terms of enabling or potential because the intention inexplicably does not matter to me. Perhaps it is the idea of such a world that horrifies me.

I should probably note that I simply adore the incredibly BDSM parts with SakuHina, though that might be an order of magnitude more creepy than everything I've mentioned. It could be affected by my capricious aversion to male characters.

Puberty might be just as horrifying to me. I just haven't been able to go through it more than once to see if my child self did not want. I've occasionally fantasized about being asexual, aromantic, and asocial, with decreasing frequency from left to right. Um, I have some other reasons for wanting to go through puberty more than once, but they're unrelated.

And yes, I think people using sexual attraction against each other in real life is creepy. Well. Creepy in the context of a male aggressor? In the context of a female aggressor I'm not sure I have a word. Or perhaps it's creepy in the context of an ugly, awkward, low-status aggressor. The strange thing there is that I'm not sure I would want to revert the change (puberty) in this case. It is certainly analogous to my concerns.

I can try some more experiments, but I've exhausted my attention for the above.

  All this talk has reminded me of the NSFW manga 'Sweet Guy', which is... the logical conclusion of this line of thought.

My immediate action on that page was to scroll down and start reading the comments. I'm glad I noticed this, because it's on my Things to Notice List. It would be on my Things to Stop Doing List, but whenever I notice it I stop doing it almost immediately. Funny thing, comments sections.
