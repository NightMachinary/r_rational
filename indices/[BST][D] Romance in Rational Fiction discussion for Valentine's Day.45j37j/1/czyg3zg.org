So far the only rational fics I've seen that have romance in them are:

Luminosity/Radiance Strong Female Protagonist

Not sure if Time Braid counts as rational fic.

I don't think I've seen any on screen romantic relationships anywhere else in rational fiction.

It's kinda refreshing to take a break from the culturally omnipresent over-the-top obsession with romance, but I think rational fiction could do a good job of presenting realistic and healthy romantic relationships where a lot of typical romance fiction doesn't. I.e. in the original Twilight, Edward spies on Bella while she's sleeping. In real life, this is called stalking. In Twilight, it's called romantic. You do not see this EVER happen in Luminosity.
