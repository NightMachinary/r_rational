  I.e. in the original Twilight, Edward spies on Bella while she's sleeping. In real life, this is called stalking. In Twilight, it's called romantic. You do not see this EVER happen in Luminosity.

To expand on that, in /Luminosity/, sometimes he does watch her while she sleeps - but only once they're dating, and once she's agreed. His sister Alice looked into the future and warned him that doing it any other way would ruin any chance of Rational!Bella ever even being friendly to him.
