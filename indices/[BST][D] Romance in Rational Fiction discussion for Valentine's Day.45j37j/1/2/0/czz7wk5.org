I think it was more a consequence of things spiraling too far outside of her control for her to adopt her desired, rationalist-esque strategies. You can't really Chessmaster unless you have a solid information/power base and that was something Bella lacked in increasing amounts as the story progressed.

Plus we can also argue that her rational ability was compromised by all of her new attachments, and the subsequent threat to these attachments. It's a rare person that can completely rationalize through most of their loved ones being threatened, especially when said person is in no position to help said loved ones.

TL;DR: I find your comment rather inaccurate, and your downvotes well deserved.
