BWAHAHAHAHA, no.

It started like that, no doubt, but as the story continued any semblance of Bella being strong or rational disappeared in smoke.

Though it can be considered realistic, since as time went on Bella became increasingly emotional and more reliant on reacting to situations rather than proactively plan for them in advance, slowly dropping her rationality in the face of "muh Edward, where is much Edward?".

To be fair, that could be interpreted as a consequence of the vampirical soul mates bond, but still.
