"Marry me"

"Are you serious?"

"We're genetically compatible, highly intelligent and have the same goals. It makes perfect sense to get married"

-[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzu3IT590h4][David Xanatos proposal, Gargoyles]]

I'd love to read a rational Gargoyles fic with Xanatos as main protagonist. He and Fox make a scarily logical based couple (can't say rational as they're not precisely a healthy relationship). Another great example comes when Xanatos decides to use Fox as guinea pig for a magical talisman and yet in the end shows he loves her too much to lose her.

They have great chemistry, are somewhat sociopaths willing to manipulate the other yet in the end they stay together and are willing to grow together and compromise some of their inherent selfishness.
