My sexual identity started asserting itself at 11. I don't know when my puberty started, but it sounds well within the bounds (9-14).

Boy did I read a lot of lemon fanfic. That Roy/Riza, mmm.

What exactly are you calling psychologically normal? And I'm using puberty as a catch-all term for the start of sexual development, which is involuntary and inevitable. In the future, I have an inkling that asexuality should remain the default for a while (although it's unclear how childhood should interact with posthumanity), like gender and anatomical sex. Actually, why not just read Alicorn's [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/damagereport.shtml][Damage Report]] again, that seems pretty akin to what I'd be rooting for. [[#s][]]
