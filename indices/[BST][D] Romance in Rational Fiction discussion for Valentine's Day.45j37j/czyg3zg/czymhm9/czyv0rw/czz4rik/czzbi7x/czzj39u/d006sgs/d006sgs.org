  Puberty might be just as horrifying to me. I just haven't been able to go through it more than once to see if my child self did not want. I've occasionally fantasized about being asexual, aromantic, and asocial, with decreasing frequency from left to right. Um, I have some other reasons for wanting to go through puberty more than once, but they're unrelated.

Did you not have any sense of sexuality prior to puberty?

Also, noooooo, don't turn yourself asocial, I'll miss you!

(Yes, that /is/ psychologically normal. Sexual psychology isn't /entirely/ about hormones, puberty, and genetic imperatives. Just because you're not /ready/ for healthy sexuality doesn't mean your mind is incapable of processing any sexual stimuli that /do/ occur.)
