  What exactly are you calling psychologically normal?
#+end_quote

Having /some/ sense of sexuality prior to puberty.

#+begin_quote
  In the future, I have an inkling that asexuality should remain the default for a while (although it's unclear how childhood should interact with posthumanity), like gender and anatomical sex.
#+end_quote

I always wonder what's the sort of "space" in between forcing these varieties on people and forcing uniformity on people. I'd be a bit disturbed if I got to the future and they'd eliminated anatomical sex and gender because those things were "forced" or "oppressive".

OTOH, ideologically I'm a gender abolitionist, so I'm being inconsistent here.

And on the third and weirder hand, if I got to the future and there were all kinds of invent-your-own fads in gender and anatomical sex, right down to how the bits go together, then I'd breathe a massive sigh of relief that everything had gone just fine.

But I guess I have a completely different perspective because I was always the short, underdeveloped kid waiting for puberty to /really/ kick in, and also because I perceive my current self as fully continuous with my pre-pubescent self (hence always saying that on the scale of "five-year-old vs deathist vs transhumanist", I'm the five-year-old).
