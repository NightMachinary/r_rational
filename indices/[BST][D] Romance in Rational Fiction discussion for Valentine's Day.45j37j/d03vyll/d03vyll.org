I think this discussion might open up in significant new directions if the definition here was expanded from merely "great works of the rationalist canon [with a side order of] romance", to the topic of rational romance in general.

Rather than presupposing (not that I'm accusing you of that, but I'm just pointing out a possible fallacy) that all romance is by definition irrational on some level, we could ask the question: of all the stories that might be considered "romances", how many of them are rational?

Because then that opens up the space to things like Jane Austen's novels, which are definitely considered romances, and which, I would argue, are refreshingly rational. Unfortunately, most of the stuff that passes for romance in the mainstream media /doesn't/ qualify as rational IMO. Way too many of the plots are wholly dependent on characters merely not telling each other some important truth when they first have the opportunity.

I think I've gotten better at portraying romance in my writing. My /Captain America/ fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305962/1/Echoes-and-Questions][Echoes and Questions]], for example, is two canon characters (Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter) sitting down to have a rational conversation about what would be involved in maintaining a romantic relationship with Captain America. There are biological concerns, disparity-of-physical-strength concerns, psychological concerns, emotional concerns... It feels like nobody ever writes about this kind of stuff in the romance genre, and definitely not in the comic-book-superhero genre, so it leaves open vast tracts of land :) in which to write compelling stories.

And then my four-novel epic /Downton Abbey/ rewrite fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10078078/1/Trust-and-Providence][Trust and Providence]], does away with two whole series' worth of the TV show's shallow main romance plot by having the two primary characters talk plainly about their terrible secret and then get engaged /in the first chapter/. Which leaves 500K+ words to actually /tell a compelling and intelligent story/. It's a thorough example of how to write a romance where the parties act rationally, almost never hide information from each other, aren't separated by obvious contrivances, and yet still struggle with antagonistic forces that threaten to tear them apart (e.g., infertility, WWI, paraplegia, rape recovery, plain old exhaustion from being parents and trying to run a business and a family simultaneously). As a bonus, it has plenty of explicit sex scenes and not a single one of them is merely gratuitous. Because, you know, compelling drama and sexuality can be intertwined in a long-term marriage!
