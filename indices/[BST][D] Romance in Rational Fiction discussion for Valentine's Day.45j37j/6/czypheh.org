I'm working on a rational work where one of the subthemes is romance and loss as it relates to a world that has reincarnation, including some level of memory and emotional remembrance of past lives.

It's set in [[#s][]]. The main characters are one SI and 4 of the friends he makes, who become [[#s][]] There may be one or two others who technically count as main characters or romantic interests, I haven't decided quite how to square the pentagon on that yet.
