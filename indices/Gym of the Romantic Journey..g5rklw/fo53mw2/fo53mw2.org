So I was feeling a bit nostalgic and was watching a few old youtube series. One of which is "Gym of the Romantic". A sarcastic take on all child hero tropes. The creator, I think, is brilliant and I find is work to be humorous and clever. I'm not so sure it's a "Rational Fiction" though. I guess one thing I noticed is the few bit of RF I've read have never been comedies. I wonder if those 2 facts are related. I don't now mostly I'm thinking I'm just trying to signal a creator I really like. Also Spoiler but there was a comic [[https://imgur.com/r/webcomics/mULJy]]
