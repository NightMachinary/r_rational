really nice to see this here - Greg's work has always felt just a step or two away from the style used by a lot of rational fiction, and I think Gym of the Romantic Journey is easily the best thing he's put out, being quite a unique little animated series. No-one here's mentioned that it got cancelled, but it was at the end of a little multi-episode arc so I've never minded too much. The setting's mythological origin as laid out in the comics felt very original and evocative to me, so they're definitely worth reading too

in terms of Greg's more recent work, the ongoing webcomic [[https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/kits-orphanage/list?title_no=181549&page=1][Kit's Orphanage]] has been doing some really interesting stuff in my opinion, expanding on the themes explored using the gnomes in Gym of the Romantic journey - namely the idea of dealing with entities that put a physical price on information in quite an alien way
