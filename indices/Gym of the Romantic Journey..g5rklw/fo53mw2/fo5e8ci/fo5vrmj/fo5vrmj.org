I can attest to the quality of this guy's work. Fairly sarcastic humor, and he still produces content, though admittedly with a significantly lower production value.

However! I only watched his content due to the writing, and that has never dropped in quality. In particular I've been enjoying Radio Skyline ([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcELqrEf9hgMlx7_Eok7zzz33JEZIlNjC]]), a fictional radio program for a Cities Skyline city.
