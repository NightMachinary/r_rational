(The linked page has a few interesting-monkey strips after some which feel as though they have big confusing gaps between them, then "the comic is still continuing on the creator's website", but the [[https://www.dawnsomewhere.com][www.dawnsomewhere.com]] website linked only shows 9 sections, of which none seem to have comic-relevant names or image-representations. I'm curious to find whether the original comic makes any more sense before it gets to the monkey parts, but watching video (particularly with audio) is not convenient for me at this time. Do you know whether there are more comic pages somewhere?)
