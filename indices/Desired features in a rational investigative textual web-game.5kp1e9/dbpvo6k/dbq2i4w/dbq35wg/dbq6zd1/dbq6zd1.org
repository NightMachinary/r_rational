Seriously, though, belief in a higher power is only irrational if said entity is unverifiable. The Emperor is probably one of the most verifiable higher powers in all of fiction. For the average imperial citizen, not getting eaten by a daemon on the way to work today is directly attributable to the Emperor's continued survival and adamantium will.

Inquisitors are more aware than most of both the Emperor's power and limitations, and thus have a more rational belief in the Emperor than just about anyone in the galaxy.
