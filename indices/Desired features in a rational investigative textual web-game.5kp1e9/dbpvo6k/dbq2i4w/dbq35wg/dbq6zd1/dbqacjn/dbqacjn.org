Erm, no. Nothing specifically attributes any of the known phenomena to the Emperor.

Anyway, we are talking about magic system that kinda /works/ on faith. More accurately, the Warp reflects emotional state of present psy-active creatures, such as humans or orks. And emoional state of the majority of humans is religious hysteria. There is nothing rational here.

Espetially if you are an Inquisitor. Trying methods of rationality to find chaos cults won't work, at best. At worst... you quickly gain 100 corruption (sorry for using Dark Heresy terms), and hello new chaos cult. Why? Because Chaos is called Chaos for a reason, it's inherently un-rational.
