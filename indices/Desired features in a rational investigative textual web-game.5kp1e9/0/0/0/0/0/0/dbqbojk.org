First of all, a fair bit of the fluff attributes the chaos gods being held off from spreading the eye of chaos to the emperor's influence. Second, the astronomican. Third, soul-bound psykers are safer for the share of the emperor's power they're tied to.

Regarding rationality in 40k, yes, there's magic, and yes, chaos can be absurd, but cultists have goals and use knowable and measurable means to achieve them. Look at the Eisenhorn and Ravenor series by Abnett. The protagonists use rationality, information, psyker examination (of the scene, the "memory" attached to an object in the warp, or an interrogation), and the occasional hunch (which could easily be subconscious realizations from knowing their quarry). The only way the setting would be anti-rational is if trying to understand the cultists' goals corrupts you, and there are plenty of examples contradicting that.
