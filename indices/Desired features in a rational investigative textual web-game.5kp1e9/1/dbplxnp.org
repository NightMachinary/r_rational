That's quite the feature set! I would love to play it one day. Since you're taking suggestions though, I'll add that a conversation feature that requires players to identify and/or refute common logical fallacies (perhaps from their superiors) would be really neat. That could be a whole game unto itself though.

[edit, I re-read your post and noticed that you're looking for comments on your current planned features, so I'll amend this to say that the "Orders from Superiors" section would be a great place to encourage rational thinking! A system similar to, or expanding on, the close reading of passport descriptions from "Papers, Please" would be really interesting.]
