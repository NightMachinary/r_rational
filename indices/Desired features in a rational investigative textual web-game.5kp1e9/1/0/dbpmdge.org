Okay, I like this. I could allow the AI behind both minions (who help your analyses and investigations) and superiors (who give you orders) to make faulty conclusions depending on their stats, and reveal the mistake when justifying decisions. It'd be up to players to decide the following:

- What confidence to assign a theory
- Whether to follow a plan
- Whether to correct a mistake (can train mental stats)
- How to justify not obeying orders (can train superior's stats or influence likelihood of punishment)

I really want to avoid breaking immersion, though.
