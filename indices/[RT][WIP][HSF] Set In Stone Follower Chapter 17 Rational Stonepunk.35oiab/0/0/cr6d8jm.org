My opinions on Allen, Marko, and Riko match what you were trying to get across.

Baker and Davis don't speak and interact with the others enough for me to get a good judgement, but initial impressions are people who are good at their job (in law enforcement, not military where no one in the story is good at it). They seem slightly squeamish, but there are very good reasons for it.

I wouldn't say that Fobi is borderline sociopathic, but rather have a overdeveloped sense of responsibility for the people under her protection (mostly because of the mama bear comment) and is therefore more aggressive towards people who commit crimes in areas under her watch. I hope you don't make her sociopathic, because having Brad, Riko, and Fobi all be sociopathic as compared to the narrator, Allen, when they make up the group of people with a history of violence makes me think Allen is an unreliable narrator or something slightly odd is off. Making Fobi be someone who has an extremely strong sense of duty and slightly impulsive fits the story much better.

Brad matches all of the hallmarks of sociopathy except for the charisma. I heard that most sociopaths are very good at talking people into doing what they want which is why it fit Rikard so well. But that can be explained by confinement for roughly two decades from a young age.

I can't judge anything about Rikard from this chapter since it's mostly body language that I can't interpret very well, but you did present him how you wanted to in previous chapters and nothing is out of character.

There are some cases of poor thinking, but they all relate to their inability to understand how to best commit violence against another person and I outline some ideas they seem to miss in my comment on the story site.

TL;DR - You did well with everyone except Fobi who comes off as too impulsive/aggressive rather than sociopathic.
