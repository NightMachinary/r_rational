Yay! a new chapter... It's one of the things I look forward to every week (that and Shadows of the Limelight :-)

My opinions on the characters matches what you're trying to get across although I would peg Allen as being higher than a marginal level 1 intelligence but without the benefits of experience and with very poor control of his emotions. It feels like he will mature into a borderline level 2 intelligence.
