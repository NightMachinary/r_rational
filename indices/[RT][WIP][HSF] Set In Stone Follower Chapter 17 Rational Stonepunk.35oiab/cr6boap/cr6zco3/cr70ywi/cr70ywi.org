I place Allen as a marginal level 1 intelligence in this book because of his lack of emotional control. He makes some of his decisions based on emotions, occasionally rejecting more rational decisions in favor of emotional ones with regards to Marza, his family, and his friends.

Allen certainly has the potential to become a borderline level 2 intelligence in time, but that definitely won't happen in this book. The concept of a young adult level 2 intelligence like Ender, Bean, or Harry in HPMOR, while interesting, has always struck me as so... irrational (though fun to read!). All those hormones sluicing around in there. Puberty, partially developed brains, insufficient exposure to other modes of thought. Of all of them, Bean seemed the most rational to me, as he was a designed human, genetically engineered and so absurdly intelligent that it was hard to really imagine him as human.
