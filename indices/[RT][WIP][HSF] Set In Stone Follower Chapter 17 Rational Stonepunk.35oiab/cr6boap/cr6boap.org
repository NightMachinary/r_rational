I would really like to hear feedback on the conversations in this chapter. Is anyone being too smart? Have I handed the idiot ball to anyone that probably didn't deserve it?

Allen (protagonist) is a marginal level 1 intelligence that sometimes lets his emotions get the better of him, but has (hopefully?) believable flashes of insight.

Captain Marko and Riko should both be borderline level 2 intelligences with a tendency towards thinking in terms of order.

Fobi and Lieutenants Baker and Davis should all three be fairly solid level 1 intelligences. Fobi is far more violence prone than the other two, and has impulse control issues when it comes to dealing with predator type criminals.

Brad is a solid level 1 intelligence character who is extremely sociopathic and understands violence and how people react to it on a level that none of the rest want to.

Rikard is a marginal level 1 intelligence with some sociopathic tendencies, but much younger than Brad.
