Well, as the writer I'm almost certainly biased. However, I've posted a link to every chapter (except chapter 2 for some reason that I can't remember) as I've written it, so you can poke through the responses if you like. I don't start that many threads, so you can look [[http://www.reddit.com/user/Farmerbob1/submitted/][here]] and see the Set In Stone chapter threads.
