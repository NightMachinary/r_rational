That's not how AI values work. Evolve a bot to play poker tournaments as well as possible, then set a bunch to play against each other, and not one will suddenly start attempting to prolong a tournament, unless that is their ideal strategy for maximizing their chance of winning. Even if there program remembers previous conflicts, it has no reason to value the current iteration of the conflict over the set value to end the current conflict in its favor.
