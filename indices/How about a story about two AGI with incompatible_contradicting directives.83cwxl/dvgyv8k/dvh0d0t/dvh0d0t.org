You, with minor mutation is mostly you (ship of Theseus argument, and trans-humanist assumption that continuity of memory and biases regardless of substrate or substrate localization is continuity of self implied) . OP posited a goal (let's call it a drive) for #1. Survival and #2. defeating /other/ AGIs

Assuming you can mutate and breed an AGI that takes the, in narrative logic, obvious path of "that's just another me lets team up" you might be one step closer to solving the friendliness problem by force evolving kin selective altruism, but I'm still not running them outside several layers of sandbox virtualization on servers with an ax man standing by.
