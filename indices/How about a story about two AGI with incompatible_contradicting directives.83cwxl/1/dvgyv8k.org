But if any AGI wins a few times in a row, it's going to notice that every time it wins, it has to fight another AGI again. One that is about as strong as it is. So if it keeps destroying the other, it will literally meet its match and lose.

So to satisfy its first priority, it now has to ensure that the other is never destroyed. It can do this by say, beating the other half-dead and keeping it in a weakened state.
