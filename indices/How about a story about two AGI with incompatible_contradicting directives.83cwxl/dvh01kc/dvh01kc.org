An interesting thought experiment. Aside from seconding the recommendation for the Crystal trilogy I'd recommend person of interest, and surprisingly the Terminator TV series, neither is really rational, but both have interesting takes on non-FOOM bound/unbound AGI's that are useful points of departure as your eliminate fiction tropes and think about what might happen.
