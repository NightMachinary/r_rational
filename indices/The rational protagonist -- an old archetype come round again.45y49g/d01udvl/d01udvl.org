A correctly written rational protagonist need not be smarter than others, nor possess more skills, nor more willpower. A correctly written rational protagonist /must not/ be able to look at a complex situation and figure out a solution that someone properly weighting the in-universe evidence would not reach. Sherlock Holmes, Tony Stark, Kimball Kinneson, Lazarus Long, and Spock are not rational protagonists.

Of course, we can get at least a little bit Byronic, here: A rational protagonist does not dither indecisively, waiting to make a decision is only rational if there's pending evidence with a high enough expected VoI.
