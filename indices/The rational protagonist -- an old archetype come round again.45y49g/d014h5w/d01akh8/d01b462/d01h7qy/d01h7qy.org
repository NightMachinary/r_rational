  Might be a reference to the "can you recommend anything about a badass" thread that went through a little while ago. I never saw the actual text -- the OP deleted it before I got there -- but apparently it was to the effect of "literature has been getting feminized and we need to bring back the awesomeness of men".

That wasn't my point, but it is interesting. I would think that while that poster got "hyper capable competent protagonist" mixed up with the class "males", males probably weren't exactly what he wanted.

James H. Schmitz wrote some terrific stories with extremely capable and competent protagonists in the old sci-fi tradition -- almost all of them women (I quite like his stuff -- he could really write what you might call "strong yet believable women" extremely well. But he was an exception.).

I emphasized the masculinity element in my OP for the humor value, but I do kind of think that "rational protagonists" are a new way of bringing back that old hyper capable character, whatever zer gender, just like super power explanations over time traveling the timeline of Electricity > Radioactive Waste > Genetic Engineering > Quantum B!X?ZH[B]A{Q}F > portals to other universe allowing for different laws of physics and other weirdness.
