My personal take on it is that it is the very long meditation dives. It breaks social bonds, because you desync from everyone else. The typical cultivator spends most of their time meditating... and /the meditation is not on a fixed schedule/ - so whenever they are out and about, the set of other people who are out and about is different from the last time, so they cannot form lasting social ties.
