That was my thought too. Sure, high level cultivators are ridiculously powerful, but they can still only do one thing at a time.

Superman can do a lot, but no amount of flying really fast or lifting heavy things can feasibly produce a million pounds of beef. An industrialized society can do it easily. Replace "beef" with whatever a high-level cultivator might need a lot of to fuel their further advancement, with "refinement" steps in the middle as needed.
