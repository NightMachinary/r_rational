I think the civilizations with sects/clans would eventually outcompete those without. While on an individual level there is very little to gain from raising up new cultivators, its a huge benefit to the society. Any society willing to constantly invest in new cultivators is going to on average produce more and better cultivators, and if they do it well those cultivators will be loyal to that society. There's a startup cost for sure and thats a disadvantage, but humans are already predisposed to protecting their tribe and especially their children.
