Good for you. I recommend learning German, Russian and Japanese next. Lots of good fiction produced there that hasn't all been translated.

Other people though, either don't have a talent for languages, or the time, or both.

I mean I speak four languages, but I don't expect everyone else to do the same or to shut up about subject first mentioned or more discussed in said languages.
