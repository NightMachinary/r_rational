Unless given reason to think otherwise I would always assume that someone was talking about content only in the language they are using.

Off the top of my head I can't think of a scenario when Bayesian logic would have you guess otherwise. If someone is going to be talking about content in another language they always mention it.

It's not unreasonable to mention that they're talking about English translations only but I also don't think it's unreasonable to not do so.
