It may be less relevant to the discussion, cause it is a xianxia transplanted to warhammer 40k universe.

From what I read, the discussion is about looking at the usual/common tropes we see and trying to see how to sanitize them, to make more sense, to remove senseless exaggeration, etc. To make them more rational.

FMoC could provide some insights how to sanitize xianxia (or to make it better quality, rational, adapted to western tastes), but it has too much western world building to it for this discussion.

The discussion could also be when xianxia stops being xianxia and becomes westxia (or westia, or wesxia).

Face slapping (which is pretty alien idea for people non-familiar with sino culture) would be integral part for country of origins and it is not used (a lot) trope by western authors.

So coming back to FMoC - is it still xianxia? or is it already westia?
