If you need sects with elders growing but still caring, you need the sect to have value to the elders, or they will go off to where they can get resources. If you want people keeping secrets of cultivation, there needs to be reasons to not spread information.

Perhaps, if cultivation methods are complex, then sects can serve as distributed R&D for methods to refine the foundations of a method. If different members are started out with different sections, then they will work to polish their own areas, and the best method of each type will show more progress. At low levels, different fragments may be more or less powerful, but if you need them later, you need to push people into them. If fighting someone with similar fragments helps you figure them out, then you want to 'exchange pointers' and it really is fighting to learn.

If knowing the details of a cultivation method deeply lets you more effectively fight someone with it, then you want to keep anyone who learns it under your control, and make sure it is not widely known.
