  A monarch, centuries old, is proven to know less about Sages than a younger monarch and a Lord.
#+end_quote

A Monarch /who hasn't ascended from Cradle/.

All the Monarchs on Cradle are, basically, the equivalent of deadbeats, dead ends, and no-hopers. If you're a Monarch, you either leave the cradle or you stagnate.

If you don't leave, it's because there was something seriously wrong with your Path. You can see evidence of that in pretty much all of the existing Monarchs:

- Northstrider thinks that power is the only Path; that's why he (mistakenly) thought that power was necessary to touch the Way. He at some point realized that knowledge is power, and just started blindly collecting knowledge without /understanding/ it. (that's also why he's so interested in Dross, because Dross is basically a shortcut to understanding)
- Malice doesn't understand that true power needs freedom; that's why she's completely fucked up Mercy's Path.
- Sethehshshs (the dragon Monarch) doesn't understand that power comes from accepting yourself.
- Reigan Shen is the youngest and he had a chance to leave, but he didn't understand that using your power to kick over the sandbox will only drag you down in the end.
