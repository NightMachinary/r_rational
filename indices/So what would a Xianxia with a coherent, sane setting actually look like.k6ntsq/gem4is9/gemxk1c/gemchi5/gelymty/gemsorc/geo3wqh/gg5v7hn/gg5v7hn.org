I agree to the extent that I agree that the way the powers were achieved was not properly satisfying, but neither really broke the rules.

The books are BUILT on the narrative of the characters stepping above their station and acting out of turn in a system that treats people as known quantities instead of ascendant beings. That they end up transgression against the known "order of things" is not out of place.
