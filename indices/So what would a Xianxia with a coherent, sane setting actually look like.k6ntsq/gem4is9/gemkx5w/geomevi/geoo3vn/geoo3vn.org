Having power does not automatically make you an asocial asshole. Sometimes, people are just nice. They might have been raised by a nice family and have good morals, caring for those around them. Sure, there's the "power corrupts" trope, but that's just a shortcut. Even if some are not very forgiving, there's still an underlying love.
