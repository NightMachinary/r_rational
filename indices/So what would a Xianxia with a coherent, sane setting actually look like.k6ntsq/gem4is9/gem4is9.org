The biggest problem of xianxia tropes is that high level cultivators don't need low level cultivators. Any kind of taxes or tributes from low to high don't make sense. That make existence of sects and clans kind of pointless. If it's a pure reproduction instinct for high levels existence of that instinct should be a common knowledge. If it's some kind of divine/karmic law that require high levels to support low levels it also should be a common knowledge.
