Sure, but what meaningful action can be taken from what you're saying?

When I go into Chinese forums I remind them of how everything they've said has been said already in English forums what should they do? Shut up?

Humility is all very well and good, so is awareness of other cultures. Reminding people that we only get a small subset of content is not a sin in and of itself, but at the end of the day, what else are people meant to talk about? If you want people to preface every message with "in the media available in my language..." then it seems unnecessary. It's obvious that this criticism isn't directed at Chinese authors but at people who will be able to understand it and write Xianxia in English

"Oh well even though everything in English is like this I'm not going to criticise the genre in anyway because it's probably fine in Chinese"

It seems a much more lazy take to not bother criticising or analysing anything because someone has probably done it even if you can't find it never mind understand it which seems to be what you're suggesting

I'd probably go further and say that people can even repeat discussions that've already been said in English too. Sure at Christmas dinner you can pause your abortion argument to google it and say oh look 10000 people already had this argument on a forum, let's silently read that instead but I don't think anyone is claiming originality there

People can learn more by googling more and being more aware but in this instance? (After all you didn't even link an example of a discussion)
