It's already been mentioned in this subreddit a silly number of times, but Will Wight's /Cradle/ series hits so many of these points that I feel it would be irresponsible for me to /not/ mention it.

1) The planet it takes place on is huge, with a wider multiverse outside it.

2) It's a science-fantasy setting, with madra taking the place of electricity and soulsmiths replacing engineers.

3) Putting aside the idea that enormous personal power has dangerous effects on the human mind, there are a number of Paths (especially the stronger ones) which directly influence the mind of the user in negative ways. These Paths are highly restricted. (Blackflame, Hunger Paths)

4) For the most part, it's pointless to fight someone more than two levels above you, so wars are mostly heavy posturing and minor skirmishes until the highest level combatants on each side kill each other, at which point the side which still has high-tier cultivators wins by default.

5) The economy of Cradle is mostly based on coinlike physical manifestations of personal power (Scales), which means that high-tier cultivators are automatically rich. We haven't delved deep enough into the economy yet to see how rational this system actually is, imo.

6) Anything can cultivate. One of the most powerful characters in the setting used to be a tree. Then they died, and became a tree ghost, and /kept cultivating/. Of the two major civilizations on the MC's continent, only one is human.

7) Relative power levels are clear and fairly consistent, although not inviolable.
