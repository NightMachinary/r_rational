The conceit of most works of fantasy is that the protagonist(s) are special in some way. Unsurprisingly, the same is true in the Cradle books, though personally I feel it's much better justified than typical. Certainly you can make a case that the main characters power levels have jumped significantly faster than expected, but that's been true the entire story for reasons that are fairly well supported in-story. Would you prefer that the main characters spend a few decades slowly slogging through the power levels because that's typical in their world?
