Lindon was the result of training; no one really predicated Yerin's ability aside from the Red Sage.

And Northstrider being wrong illustrates my point. A monarch, centuries old, is proven to know less about Sages than a younger monarch and a Lord.

Which makes no sense, as we've known that Northstrider has been collecting knowledge for awhile (Ghostwater's tree). So it seems to me that Will didn't finalize how Heralds and Sages worked until this book, which caused contradictions in previous books.
