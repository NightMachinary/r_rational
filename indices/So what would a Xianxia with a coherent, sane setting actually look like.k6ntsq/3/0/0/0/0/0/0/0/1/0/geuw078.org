Yes, we have Eithan train her perception and she briefly touched the Way, but even then Northstrider (a monarch centuries old) states that an Underlord would not be able to manifest an Icon. A statement that's refuted in the very next book in a manner that does not make sense (Malice says that such things happened earlier in the past, but she's younger than Northstrider, who therefore should also be aware of it).
