There's lots of ways to smooth the sharp edges of Xianxia but the result would depend on the specifics of the baseline laws of reality you chose. Your specific examples make it seem like you have an idea for a setting in which you'd like to see a rational story. That's cool. However I do think that a lot of the problems you're pointing at are more a result of authors not being smarter-enough-than-you to think of everything you'd think of, rather than being unsolvable problems with tropes in the genre.

To this day I'm pretty certain that the reason I liked HPMOR, (which is fanfiction of a very trope heavy setting/story), so much more than many other fiction books is just down to Yudkowsky being smarter than me by a large enough margin that he came up with cleverer tricks while /also/ taking the time to change the rules to close all loopholes I would have ever thought of and more.

To give a few examples of where I think some problems you list /are/ solvable:

- The only problem with making larger more varied worlds rational, is that you need to build more stuff into the world for them to seem big, and the bigger you build, the more likely you accidentally made an exploitable loophole that the reader will yell at the protagonist for not exploiting. At the other end, smaller worlds can get boring if part of the draw is setting, so going that way can /also/ be bad. Authors just need to find a balance between their ability to find and close plot holes in the world rules, and their desire to include more plot dynamics.

- A lot of the things that people think a rational person would recognize as infinite positive feedback loops and exploit, can be easily made unexploitable with additional mechanics that add limits or diminishing returns. There can be interactions between powers that prevent their combination, or training and upkeep-of-training time investment requirements that make wider training focus a severe handicap. What breaks the enjoyment isn't even that there is infinite scaling so much as that bad fiction doesn't do enough to get the reader to accept the reasons infinite scaling isn't user or more widespread.

- Stories don't even have to be hard scifi or hard fantasy in order to be sane. I love hard magic systems but.. The reader doesn't need to know the rules, nor do the characters, so long as the characters come up with basically everything most readers do, and then act on or explain the infeasibility of those ideas. And good enough descriptions can even allow damaged, less-educated, or less-genius characters to /not/ come up with things the reader would think of, so long as the reader's ideas are acknowledged and dismissed in some other way so that we don't assume the author was just too dumb to see the exploit.

- Massive battles with tons of collateral can be part of rational stories too, they just have to have an appropriately balanced effect on the outcome. That doesn't mean that stories would have to all be dark, but if large populations in a setting continue to exist afterwards, that would need a satisfying explanation (could be done with cloning, resurrections, higher birth rates, having children always raised in time chambers etc.)
