  . Anglophones can comfortably dismiss all of xianxia as trashy and dumb since it never occurs to them that their sample is entirely drawn from the lowest common denominator.

Do you really get annoyed if a Chinese person says the superhero genre is dumb and trashy? Obviously they are talking about what they have available to consume.

Seems pointless to say to them, oh well, the niche stuff is actually good so you're totally wrong. If a new superhero thing is translated it's gonna be exactly the same, so unless they're going to learn English it seems a meaningless difference

What's the point?

Besides which, you might as well say this in every thread in existence, the quantity of Chinese discussion I will surpass every English forum and will only continue to increase. I can't find simultaneous data but WeChat had 50 billion messages in day in jan 2019 and whatsapp now has 100 billion per day (obviously not all in English)

A reminder that there is more content than they can access has helped how? How is telling the Chinese that of course there is Worm that they can't read anyway going to help them? Don't discuss the superhero genre Chinese friends because it's already been done on reddit!
