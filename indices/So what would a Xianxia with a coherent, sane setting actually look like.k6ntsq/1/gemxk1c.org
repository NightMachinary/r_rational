The biggest thing you ignored is the tension between cooperation and resource scarcity. Why is everyone assholes? Because if you don't militantly protect your resources you're gonna have a bad time. Why do people form sects? You need people to have your back, make your tools, make your drugs, and so on. Why do people care about the people below them? Because life is hard and boring and getting people to do the dirty work for you is easy. As for why good manuals are rare, again resource scarcity and difficulty.
