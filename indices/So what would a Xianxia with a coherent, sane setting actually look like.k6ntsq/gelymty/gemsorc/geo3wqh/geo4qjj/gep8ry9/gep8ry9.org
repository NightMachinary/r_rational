Science advances like a dragon. Yerin's achievement was theorized to be possible by the Sage of Red Faith (and there's hints of it as far back as Ghostwater, IIRC), and the whole time there's been people wandering around whose powers are based on comprehending the Way but have zero Cradle-style cultivation, so clearly being a Sage doesn't actually /require/ anything from Cradle.
