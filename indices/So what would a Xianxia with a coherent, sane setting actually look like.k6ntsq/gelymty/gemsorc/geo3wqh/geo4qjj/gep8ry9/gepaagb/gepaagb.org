So, there wasn't hints of anything before this book. In Uncrowned, you had Northstrider explicitly state that Underlords could not manifest an icon, but then in Wintersteel, you have both Malice and Eithan say otherwise.

It's quite clear that the author had not finalized his power system until the very end, and so ended up creating plot holes retrospectively.
