Nobody here going to mention Forty Milleniums of Cultivation? I remember seeing it recc'd here a couple years ago, and keeping up with the daily updates, it's probably the most rational take on xianxia I've seen. It dodges and addresses all the issues and tropes that commonly plague the genre, from the dog eat dog world, power scaling across stages AND time periods, level of civilization, inter-cultivator relations, techniques, and so on.

From civilization and government as a whole, the relationships and status of Cultivators at all levels, commentary on aspects like the typical and primitive "dog eat dog" worlds you see in other xianxias, FMoC is pretty damn good. I especially love how the author explains certain things like why two sects are killing each other over a piece of poop, and why that's the only logical course of action.

There's a lot of philosophical talk about civilization and humanity and whatnot, and while it may not be as good as what some people here may prefer, it's much better than virtually every other xianxia.

FMoC really plays to the strengths of the xianxia genre and does some unique things, like an actual advanced society with mechs and space ships, as well as the perpetual journey of going against the universe and the eternal darkness to survive and thrive. All the characters in the novel are also competent, which very few other xianxias have, and the power scaling and leveling is even more grounded than Cradle's.

My explanation isn't that good, the rec for FMoC does the novel justice and really explains how it rationalizes the xianxia genre, definitely worth checking out. I'd dare say it's even more rational and logical than Cradle.
