Look, if you observe something that you can successfully recognize as "supernatural" or "Lovecraftian", you're more likely to be a character in a story than to be dealing with a genuinely eldritch /lawful reality/. In which case there's every chance that whatever it's been /told/ it is by the author, it's almost definitely psychologically humanoid.

Most spooky spooks are people in rubber suits. It's the things you don't notice and classify that get you.

And if you think human minds are so narrow, weak, and stupid, I'd love to see you build one. Otherwise, please, have some respect for the first human souls ever to exist in the ancient depths of the Pre-Recursive Era.
