Sufficiently powerful indifference is not meaningfully distinct from malevolence. Getting accidentally stepped on by a giant monster and getting intentionally eaten by one are both scary possibilities to me. Humans are adapted to a very narrow niche, and things which are outside that niche are more likely to hurt us than help us because it's easier to destroy than create. Most supernatural spooks aren't going to want to be friends.
