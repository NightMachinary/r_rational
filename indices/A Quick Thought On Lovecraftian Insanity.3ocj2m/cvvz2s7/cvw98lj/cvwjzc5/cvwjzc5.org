  How is that different from everyday life, exactly?

There is exactly one way the real world is. Lovecraftianism is an /attitude/, not a coherent space of counterfactual worlds. Literally everything can be taken as Lovecraftian if you just apply the /attitude/ to it that /anything slightly different from you, the author, is A HORRIBLE XENO YOU JUST CAN'T SHARE A FUCKING UNIVERSE WITH/.

I mean, for God's sakes, if they can turn /My Little Pony/ and /science/ into Lovecraftian horror, then I think that's solid fucking proof that Eldritch Cosmic Horror is actually just the choice to scream and cry at the universe for not being optimized to your particular personal liking.
