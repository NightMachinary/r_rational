Just read through the Old Testament. If you worship him in the wrong way or do the wrong thing in his presence, you're dead with no appeal. He instantly killed his first priest's two sons for sacrificing the wrong thing to him. He ordered his prophet to kill 400 some priests of another deity from the same pantheon. When one of his appointed kings refused to finish a genocide, El stripped him of his rank and then had his prophet finish the genocide himself. Holy is not safe.

Edit: found what made you think YWHW was safe, [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moralistic_therapeutic_deism]] It's a common misconception
