My family is Hindu - I'll give you some examples:

1) if you bother a sage who has spent years meditating, their gaze turns you to ashes (not as punishment, just because they've had their eyes closed for so long that their gaze holds tremendous divine power).

2) Shiva and Durga both have "chaotic" forms (Bhairava, Kali). I've heard one myth where she's angry that a guy saw her naked, so she destroys the previous universe in a rage. (and there's an entire story of how she was made to calm down and not destroy the gods themselves)

3) I definitely know a few - not many, but a few - people who have a superstitious fear of not doing puja (because they think they'll be punished by god if they don't)

4) Holy men, Hijras, and other "magical" people can both bless and curse you.

Those are just the examples I've personally been in contact with. If we delve into academic links on Hindu, Greek, Norse, the various surviving hunter gatherers, I'm sure the number of examples will expand beyond count. Pretty sure Magic is not safe (which seems to be a default human perspective) usually creates Holy is not safe. Although I suppose Christianity has a more rigid good-magic vs evil-magic perspective than others.
