If a pattern of floor tiles has ever made you dizzy, you should understand this idea. But it isn't mentally processing the physical shape that does the long term damage--though it surely doesn't help. It is an effect from the beings themselves, disrupting the functioning of your physical brain, as it gets worse when they turn their horrible multitudinous gaze upon you.

My explanation would be higher-dimensional electromagnetic effects scrambling your brain like an egg in a microwave when they use their Old One 7-D radar on your very being. Long term effects are obviously to follow even with a brush with such multidimensional horrors.
