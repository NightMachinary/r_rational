I've heard this before. The best reasoning I've heard is Lovecraftian monsters move through extra dimensions. Presume you were 2d in a 2d world, and a crazy complex 3d object intersects your 2d plane. You don't know what it is, it keeps changing in size/shape/mass completely at random, and it's hostile. Humans are scared of things they can't control, so if the subject can't escape an unpredictable hostile /thing/, loss of sanity is reasonable over time
