In what way is changing around the axons passive? They're connected in a certain way. The connections won't change unless something breaks them.

What do you mean by related laws of physics? General relativity is just warped spacetime, and we're not warping time because that would be too destructive. The other theories don't involve non-Euclidean geometry.

If you mess around with physics as a whole, I can imagine that causing problems. Sort of like how heavy water is poisonous because it's almost, but not quite, just like regular water. Although it would still probably just kill you.
