If all of physics was adjusted by a constant, it would be the same as if nothing were adjusted, and observable anomalies wouldn't be possible. So instead, different aspects of physics get distorted to different degrees. The connections remain intact, but the space between the connections is adjusted. The topology doesn't change, but huge and important changes occur nonetheless.

I'm imagining, for example, something that alters the path which light travels along, even without making proportionately sized changes to the medium through which light travels. Or something that very slightly alters changes the speed at which chemical reactions occur, without changing the speed of electricity within the brain. Any sort of inequivalence you like could be used as an example.

If half your brain were inside an event horizon and the rest outside of it, and magically you didn't die, your brain would not work as it normally does. Instead, half your brain would be working much too fast for the slower half. So, imagine something like that, but applied in other ways as well, and with more subtlety.
