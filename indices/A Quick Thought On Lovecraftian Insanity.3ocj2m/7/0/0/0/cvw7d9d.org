I was imagining the neurons and electrical currents themselves being rearranged and smashed wrongly together, more than the larger pieces of brain tissue. And I wasn't imagining a literal physical collusion between objects, but a more passive change in the way they are put together next to each other. Also, it's not just spatial warping, necessarily, but the warping of other related laws of physics too.
