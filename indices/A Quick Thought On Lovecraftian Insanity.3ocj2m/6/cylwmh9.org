Non-Euclideanness is actually not that hard to understand. The surface of a sphere is a non-Euclidean geometry. "Straight" lines can intersect, if you follow a single straight line you will eventually reach the same point you started at, triangles drawn on the surface will have internal angles adding up to not exactly 180 degrees, etc. These are not exotic things that are impossible to visualize or would even tax any person's mental faculties. I'm unsure what part of contemplating this stuff would actually drive anyone insane in reality.
