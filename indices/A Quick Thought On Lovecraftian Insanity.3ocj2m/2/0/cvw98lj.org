How is that different from everyday life, exactly? Or at least everyday life for a human from before germ theory? When millions died from causes no-one could comprehend (and which obviously didn't understand us), when Aristotelean or Newtonian physics were the norm, both being outliers/vague allusions to General Relativity. Stuck in a universe where logic is provably unprovable.

Not to mention some of us here are trying to create the closest thing to a Lovecraftian God that fits in our universe - a post-singularity AI - to prevent the summoning of a merely apathetic one which would kill humanity or worse.
