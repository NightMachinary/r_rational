Most people who believe in a god, believe it's theirs, like the cultists who summon chuthulu. yes, if you asked them, objectively, if each of the actions their god does are evil, without context, they might call them evil, still they delude themselves it's good. If they are a good person, the good afterlife awaits, with their all powerful god or gods that does things that they'd curse mortals for. Woe unto those who mistake evil for good.

[assuming psudeo-abrahamic god now. not getting into massive pantheons or reincarnation cycles]

the others don't care. might makes right, and God is the mightiest of all. if you follow his rules, you're safe. old testament, it was probably terrifying, but now, the rules are actually plausible enough to ensnare people. He promises everything people want, immortality included, and if God were real, serving him might be the most rational action for a sociopath. He's irredeemaly alien and mostly malicious to humanity, but if you play by his rules, you can have eternity for yourself, and he's the monster protecting you.

Part of the lovecraftian fear is it doesn't have rules, really. there isn't a way to escape, isn't a way to protect yourself. not like demons, with circles of salt, or fae and cold iron, vampires and (sunlight, OCD, holy water, fire). not like god and angels, who if you follow his rules, you'll get the afterlife, even if it doesn't protect you now.

Lovecraft's gods are unpredictable, and uninterested in ruling. That's the difference, if there is one.
