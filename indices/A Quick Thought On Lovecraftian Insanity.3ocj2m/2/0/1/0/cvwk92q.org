  But now...God isn't God. It's this slimy, scaly thing that possesses all the horror of God with none of the anthropocentric bullshit.

You mean God is suddenly a slimy, scaly thing instead of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub#/media/File:Human-headed_Winged_Bulls_Gate_Khorsabad_-_Louvre_01a.jpg][one of these]] or [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Raffael_099.jpg][this fucking guy]] or living, speaking pillars of cloud, smoke, fire, and lightning?
