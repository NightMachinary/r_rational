Lovecraft's own protagonists seem to do a remarkably good job of both running and hiding from Lovecraft's whatever. They never have to deal with the shit that Jonah, for example, did.

Also, God maintains nominal love of your eternal soul? Ok, normally I try not to openly diss on things that are actually important to real people, but /you've gotta be fucking kidding me/. Oh jolly wonderful, the soul can spend eternity in fully-aware but fully wireheaded praise and contemplation of God Himself! Such love, many eternal, wow so good.
