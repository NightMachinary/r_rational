  Ok, normally I try not to openly diss on things that are actually important to real people, but you've gotta be fucking kidding me.

That's not why you shouldn't try to openly diss the idea of God keeping your soul.

You know what's an even better reason? Who cares? It's a psychological explanation, not the opportunity to re-litigate that particular ancient issue.

I'm an atheist for a reason, yet billions of people seem to find comfort in exactly the sort of thing you find disturbing here. So are we to eschew any attempt to explain something that uses that fact?
