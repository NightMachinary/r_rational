As a child I once skimmed the Old Testament out of curiosity. Besides the boredom and my annoyance about not being able to figure out where the Samson story was hiding, I noticed a most /REMARKABLE/ number of admonitions to fear God. I got the impression that worship was good but fear was an order of magnitude better.
