Lovecraft was writing mostly for himself, and based heavily on his own phobias- fish, foreigners, old buildings. So a big part of the horror was based on his personal phobias.

There's a telepathy issue too. It's fairly common for these entities to contact humanity via some method, pushing alien landscapes and values and feelings into their brains. This discordant telepathy causes many issues.

So, if your brain is aligned right or wrong- due to science, genetics, alien influence, whatever, these aliens push their brains into yours which predictably drives you insane.

The situations they put you in are often horrific too.

Just imagine that the cave is your mind and the train is alien thoughts.

  When, long ago, the gods created Earth In Jove's fair image Man was shaped at birth. The beasts for lesser parts were next designed; Yet were they too remote from humankind. To fill the gap, and join the rest to Man, Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan. A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure, Filled it with vice, and called the thing a Nigger.

Lovecraft's fear of monsters was based on a real fear of black people.
