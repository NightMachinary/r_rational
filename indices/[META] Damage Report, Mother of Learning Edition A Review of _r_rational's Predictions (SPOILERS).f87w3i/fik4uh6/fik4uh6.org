  50% counts as getting it wrong because it's basically saying you have no idea.

This makes sense for things with a binary outcome, but not for the identity of Red Robe. It's hard to assess what the correct prior should be, but anyone who assigned 40% or more credence to Jornak should definitely get credit for being right, since there were at least four credible options. Based on there being five possibilities that had a mean percentage assessed at 10% or higher, I'd say the prior was 20% and give anyone who said 30% or higher credit.

Was the average you used 'mean percentage'? Geometric mean of the odds would be a better measure of the collective wisdom.
