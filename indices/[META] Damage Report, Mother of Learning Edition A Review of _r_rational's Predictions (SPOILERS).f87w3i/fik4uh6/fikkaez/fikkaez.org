I made a copy of the sheet and worked out the geometric-mean-of-odds probabilities for everything, and Brier scores. (EDIT: [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZEBfqqEnFa_TOFfNjrRhcE6Fozg6IxMuBYlcwlIX_L8/edit?usp=sharing][here it is]].)

Things [[/r/rational][r/rational]] got very wrong:

- MoL will finish in 2019; aggregated probability 92%, result "no".

- Red Robe is Jornak; aggregated normalized probability 9.4%, result "yes". (Though since I aggregated it after normalizing, the probabilities here only sum to 54%. Will renormalize in the cleaning-up part.)

Things [[/r/rational][r/rational]] got very right:

- Red Robe was not an aranea; aggregated normalized probability 3%, result no. Only one person rated this more than 5% likely.

- Zorian will use mind magic on Zach; aggregated probability 78%, result yes. This is actually understating it; only one person gave a probability lower than 70% and most said 80% or higher. But that one person, hallo_friendos, said *2%*, which was a huge enough outlier to bring this down from 86% to 78% single-handedly. (Whoever hallo is, they were massively overconfident and very poorly calibrated. Sorry, not sorry.)

Other correct predictions: Aggregate probabilities were at least 2/3 in the correct direction for QI surviving, Silverlake working with QI and/or RR, Primordial not being released, and Zorian not dating Taiven.

Basically, on all counts but RR and planning fallacy, [[/r/rational][r/rational]] was collectively correct with a moderate but appropriate degree of confidence. On RR, we were correct about it not being an aranea but incorrect otherwise.
