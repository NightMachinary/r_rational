Thanks for doing the analysis.

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YkxeAllnnf_8xlnePSdSIRsEX_H94uxEldLWNQzagvM/edit#gid=0][This]] is the google doc people placed there predictions in, in case anybody is interested.

  Only sparkc saw through nobody103's planning fallacy and guessed MoL wouldn't be finished in 2019.

So, I was likely one of the few people who made a prediction on this that /wasn't/ aware at the time that nobody103 had publicly stated that there were only [insert a small number ~6] chapters left. I am pretty pessimistic of an author's ability to gauge how long is left in their stories (whether in terms of word count or time) but the aforementioned knowledge might still have moved my confidence in MoL finishing in 2019 from 30% to above 50%.
