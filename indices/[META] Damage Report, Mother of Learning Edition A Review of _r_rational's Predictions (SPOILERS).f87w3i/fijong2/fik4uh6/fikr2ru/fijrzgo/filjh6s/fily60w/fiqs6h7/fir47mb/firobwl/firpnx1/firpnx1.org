The only sense in which I think it being Fortov would have been ridiculous is that it's somewhat contradicted by his predictable actions during loops we knew Red Robe was present, IMO. His incompetence is very little barrier IMO; the time loop is quite well suited to correcting a mere lack of skill, and Zorian certainly wasn't the borderline archmage we know and love today before the loop, and Zach was well-known as a total goofball.
