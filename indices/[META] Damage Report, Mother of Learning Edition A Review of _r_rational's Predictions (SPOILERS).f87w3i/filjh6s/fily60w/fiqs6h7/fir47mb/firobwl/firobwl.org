Yeah, I think there needs to be a balance of it. I agree that the Red Robe reveal didn't feel very satisfying - maybe it being a web serial I read over years made it worse.

I think trying to make someone like Fortov Red Robe would have been kinda ridiculous, even though some people claim that would have been great for the narrative.
