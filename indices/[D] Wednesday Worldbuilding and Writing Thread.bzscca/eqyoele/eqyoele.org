I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas /about the magic/ not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world.

Sigil Magic. Sigil magic is about using a metaphorical pictogram to describe an effect (on conceptual objects). The sigils can be drawn in or of anything, as the spell works it course it erodes itself, a metal wrought sigil will evaporate, a drawing in sand will become homogeneous again, ink on paper will evaporate along with a portion of the paper thinning it (the power of the spell relative to the material consume will determine it's life time or potency, a weak spell made of iron might last decades, a powerful spell made in sand might last less than an eye-blink). Unlike many other magics sigils don't count against universal enchantment limits of the caster - they do however consume a relatively large amount of raw materials for the effects they provide - so in theory they can create effects of unlimited power, to do so would require forging a sigil of such size in a single casting.

Examples:

- Translation Sigil: A sigil of two people talking allows people touching the sigil to understand each other when they talk.
- Firestarter Sigil: A sigil of a fire allows the user to start a fire by touching it to something flammable.
- Traps: Carvings in stone of people meeting brutal deaths in certain locations of a building are a common mechanism for security. Though as a practical matter this often involves walls and walls of slight variants of the same pictogram to catch edge cases and prevent a single variant from being burned out quickly.
- Magic Items: Most magic items are forged with sigils.
- Power Sources: While the cost (in both materials and labor) of using sigils as common power sources is untenable, many things do use sigil engines of one form or another as a power source.
- Other Magics: Refinements to sigil magic over the millennia have created other magics, weaker and more constrained yet with an easier representation of concepts like sequences, conditions, and so on.
