Shutting down the legislation is a band-aid option. Putting people in power who won't do it lasts for the length of their term unless they die. And there's a high rate of election, so pulling something off at key times might stick for a lot longer than that. But those things are only an option while he's alive, and kicking problems down the road for later just leaves those issues for a time when his side doesn't have him.
