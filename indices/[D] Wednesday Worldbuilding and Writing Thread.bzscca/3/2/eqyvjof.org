I wouldn't explain all that to the reader from the front, or to the main characters. It makes the story more compelling if the protagonist doesn't really know why they are doing what they are doing, other than having been told to.

Also introduces lots of interesting power structures since if the wyrm lord doesn't want the whole story to be known, then there must be a good reason he doesn't. Which is usually because there's something out there he's afraid of.
