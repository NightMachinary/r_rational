Wyrm Lords are just semi-divine giant dragons. How they govern depends on the individual Wyrm, but the one that the MC works for is pretty hands-off, demanding some tribute and protecting the people from the very rare GIANT ABOMINATION but not micromanaging anything. More like a protector god than a king.

​

The tech level also depends, but the MC comes from a Venetian-inspired place, think the renaissance but slightly more advanced thanks to the relics that they've managed to research here and there. Plus, the Wyrm Lord of the place likes art.

​

As for the wasteland... Think and endless desert of red and black sands, littered with craters and fissures and where everything wants to kill you, including the air.
