*Have all the most valuable relics already been collected?*

Some of them, but not all of them by a long shot. The empire of the Dead God was big as fuck and the best things were at the center, which now is... well, an irradiated crater full of giant abominations and deadly magic storms, according to the few scouts that survive enough to tell the tale.

â€‹

*What do the Wyrm Lords get out of being rulers?*

So! Two things (the second one is a spoiler)

First: Wyrm Lords can't enter the wastes without attracting pretty much ALL the abominations and having to go against a zerg rush. Their magic seems to attract the monsters. (this also happens with those who have Blessings, but much more subtle and not so ALL THE MONSTERS AT THE SAME TIME!!!)

Second: The Wyrm's magic is... running out, and they need the relics to absorb the magi out of them and keep on having juice for a little bit longer. Not many people know this, tho.

And I already know what you'll ask: If they are running out, why wasting magi on giving blessings? The blessings are kind of like... Entity shards (from Worm), they give awesome powers but, at the same time, slowly absorb your lifeforce until you die and, when you do so, the Wyrm Lord can get a little bit more than they gave away on the first place. Not very efficient, but enough to get by if there are no relics found in some time.
