I actually do think there's something to vampires adulterating blood in order to consume mind-altering substances, especially if there's some bit of vampire mythology that means it has to be /fresh/ blood. Injecting someone with straight alcohol and then draining them of their blood before they die is pretty metal, and fits will with vampire decadence, as well as being kind of horrifying.

Works best on the "only blood because of disgust" type, I feel, because there you'd be using blood to mask the taste of something else.
