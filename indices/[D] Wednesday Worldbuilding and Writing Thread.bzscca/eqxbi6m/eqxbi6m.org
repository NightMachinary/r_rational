A lot of standard vampire mythology holds that they can't eat or drink (consequences ranging from disgust to pain to death). Well, of course, they can drink blood, naturally.

A lot of standard human anthropology holds that people like to take mind altering substances, alcohol being the most popular [citation needed] because it just requires leaving plants to rot and then being bananas enough to try and consume them anyway [citation needed].

So, how could vampires get drunk?
