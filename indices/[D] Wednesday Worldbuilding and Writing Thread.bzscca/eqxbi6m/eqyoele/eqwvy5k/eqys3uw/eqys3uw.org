I think he'd make for a great villain in an AU X-Men series, but I don't think he's a good fit for being the main villain for the main X-Men. The main continuity X-Men are fairly mainstream, a villain who's less morally grey and more evil is easier and safer to do. Also it's useful to have the main villain in super hero series be able to have big fight scenes, Professor X could be taken down easily by anyone with a mind control resisting helmet like Magneto, so you'd never get a climatic fight scene with him outside of perhaps a mental battle.

But I'd definitely like to see an AU with a plotline like maybe Magneto is employing solely moral methods to fulfill his goal of a mutants-only world, like peacefully creating a mutants nation and only using violence in self-defense, but Charles employs any means necessary to place himself as a dictator who can force through civil rights reform.
