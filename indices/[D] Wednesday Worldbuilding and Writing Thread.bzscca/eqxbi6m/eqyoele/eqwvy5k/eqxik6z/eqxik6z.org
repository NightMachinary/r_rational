So! I'm an aspiring writer and I'm trying to iron out the kinks of my fantasy setting. This is what I have for now:

​

Some time ago (1000 years? 10000?) the God-King of the world was usurped by the 5 Wyrm Lords, semi-divine dragons made for the express purpose of managing all the "boring god stuff". One of them, the Lord of Magic, died during the conflict but the rest survived more or less intact. The battle itself was so fucking devastating that around 70% of the world is a dead wasteland populated by mutant and corrupted beasts and plagued by wild magic storms (now that magic is un-administrated) and the surviving Wyrm Lords rule over what small inhabitable pockets of land there are.

​

Thing is? Not everything was destroyed during the battle, and there remain some old ruins in the wasteland, full of old and divine relics that the Wyrm Lords really want their claws on.

​

The protagonist will be part of an organization called the Re-Collectors, founded and maintained semi-directly by the local Wyrm Lord with the express purpose of going out there and giving him relics. As the wastelands are pretty much irradiated with corrupting dead-god magic, they are giving a sort of blessing or powerup by the Wyrm Lord so they don't die, which protects them from being mutated into aberrations, augment their physical attributes and gives them a minor, individual and semi-random power (think Aura and Semblances from RWBY)

​

What do you think? Anything doesn't make sense?
