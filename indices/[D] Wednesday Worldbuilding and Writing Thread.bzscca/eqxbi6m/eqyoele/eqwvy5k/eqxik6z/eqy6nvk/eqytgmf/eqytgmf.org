Have all the most valuable relics already been collected? If it's been X years since the Apocalypse, I would think that the Wyrms would make it a priority goal to collect all the S-tier items first and foremost. But that would make for a bit of a dull story, if all the best stuff was already retrieved and nothing the MC can find will match anything already possessed by the Wyrm Lords.

What do the Wyrm Lords get out of being rulers? What motivates them?
