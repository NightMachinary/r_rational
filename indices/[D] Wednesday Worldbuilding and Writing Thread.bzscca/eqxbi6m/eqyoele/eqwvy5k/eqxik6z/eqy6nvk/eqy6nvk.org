It isn't bad, though I think you need some more flavor text on just how the Wyrm Lords rule over people society, and how things are a wasteland. Are we talking dark souls medieval sort of societies, more modern stuff, etc. Cause you know if someone is called a Wyrm Lord, I probably would think they were kind of a bad guy.
