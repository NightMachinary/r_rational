Maybe too late to post, but here goes.

I'm imagining a futuristic "hellene" society. In the distant past the roman empire never took root, and as a result the west stayed under Greek hegemony for much longer and its influence is significantly magnified even into the present(1900's or so, equivalent tech development of a cyberpunk 2077 or thereabouts). The main divergence would be that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus][Pyrrhus of Epirus]] wipes the floor with the Romans instead of eking out a few close victories (maybe pyhrric victory would come to mean an overwheliming victory?) and establishes a dynasty that rules over Sicily and most of Italy and some of the Balkans.

Think of how much of european civilization is built on or inspired by the romans, how much of an effect they had on every level of society. Now imagine that there is a greek replacement in terms of culture, but not in terms of size or scope, a more distributed pan-hellene meditarranean which survives the "barbarians" invasions better(better use of cavalry and so on), which does not succumb to Christianity(which never existed, together with Islam), and which views intellectual pursuits significantly more positively, and is thus able to advance technologically much more quickly.

Anyway, *the point of this post*: in a cyberpunk-ish dystopian future, a Hellene-descended government in europe has a similar problem as we do now with regard to the replacement rate, i.e. not having enough children. They institute a breeding program with the initial aim of making and raising children, but which gets distorted by utopian(or dystopian if you're lower class) ideals into making "perfect", idealized citizens.

The program has 4 lineages (sort of like a soft caste system) which aims to encompass the entirety of the elites in a society.

- Fates - The ruling lineage - civil, political and military leaders, strategists
- Furies - The enforcement/physical lineage - warriors, police, athletes
- Muses - The intellectual lineage - philosopher, scientists, artists
- Graces - The support lineage - engineers, doctors, psychologists, priests, etc.

Thoughts? Is there something that I'm missing? I also don't like that these 4 are orignially all women, is there any male groups that would fit in this theme? Is there any story that has a divergent hellene empire type of deal that I can use for inspiration? Any historical site or book or video that you'd recommend for some insight into ancient greek culture?
