Christianity not having existed is huge. do native Americans still practice their native culture and religion or do Greek gods demand absolute homage? there's no Spanish Inquisition or witch hunts. certainly no discrimination of LGBT people. do LGBT people then get discriminated because they don't reproduce? do Americans still believe in Providence? is beer still a thing? without the dark ages, are people still going to have a Renaissance? are black people still going to be enslaved?

Islam not having existed is also huge. does India still get conquered and Buddhism all but wiped out? without a buffer in the middle East, do we see a direct clash of Hellenistic empires and china? do people still drink coffee?
