  Another name for the Graces is the Charities. I think anything to do with helping people directly would be a better fit for then rather than the Muses. Do you disagree?

No, but look at the historical precedent for doctors and psychologists. They're not the people keeping the machinery of civilisation running - rather, they are highly educated people who happen to be capable of performing a service, so to speak. In a living world, a lot of professions would be in what would look like the wrong caste now for mainly historical reasons.

I'd imagine, for example, that nurses would be Graces while doctors were Muses; that makes sense to me, and somewhat enhances the Nursing/Doctoral divide. For similar reasons, I'd imagine that computer programmers would be in among the Muses, and not the Graces.

It sounds like the robots are taking the place of the underclass. Is this a world with working AI?
