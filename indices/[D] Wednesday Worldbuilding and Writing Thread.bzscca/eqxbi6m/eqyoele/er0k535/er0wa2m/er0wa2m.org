Questions:

- How directly does the caster have to draw their sigils? If tools can be used, nanosigils (using microscopes and so on) and batch production (using carbon copy paper or a printing press) might be possible. I feel like this would lead to sigil magic serving as an equivalent of electronics in terms of the typical devices and economics.
- Is it the size or the quantity of material that matters to the power of the sigil? For example, would a sigil painted on a balloon change in effectiveness as the balloon is inflated?
- Can partially-formed existing shapes be converted into sigils, or do sigils have to be constructed from scratch? If completion is possible, this system could end up resembling Vancian casting where the sigils are left incomplete, to be finished when they are required. Additionally, it could make much larger workings more feasible by adapting existing structures.
- Can the degradation of the material be used creatively? For example, if a city under siege has a circular wall that can be adapted into a sigil, could a sigil mage do so with the aim of breaking down the walls from the erosion rather than using the intended magical effect? Could you apply a sigil to an ingot of metal in such a way that the erosion adds or removes impurities? Could you slowly poison someone by using the evaporation of a sigil drawn in a heavy metal? Could a sigil mage with a sword cut a sigil into someone?
- How does it interact with other magic? If you magically enhance the durability of a sigil, will the magic last longer? If you magically enlarge a sigil, will the magic be stronger? Can you use magic to draw a sigil? What happens if you draw a sigil at a distance, or using magic as a medium?
- How does it interact with economics? D&D in particular has spell components with fixed prices such as 10,000 gold pieces worth of crushed diamonds, which begs the question of who defines the value of the diamonds. Assuming the sigils instead demand a particular quantity of material, the cost of sigils could change as that material gets used up or a new production process appears. Also, the relative costs of sigil mage labour and sigil materials will probably dictate where typical sigils fall on the spectrum between quick sketches in a sand trough and field-sized great works. If this balance changes over time, that could provide an excuse for ancient sigil-powered dungeons and superweapons that are beyond modern capabilities.

Specific ideas:

- Sigils could be constructed inside blocks of other materials, or made out of shape-memory alloy, for smuggling and concealment.
- Weak sigils could be used to make [[http://www.larryniven.net/stories/roentgen.shtml][hard-to-counterfeit currency]].
