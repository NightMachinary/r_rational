I'd say it all depends on the mythology.Are the vamps dead? If so, no liver function, no intoxication. Also, if the blood isn't pumping, kinda hard for intoxicants to hit the bloodstream and have an effect.

Is vampirism a curse/virus? If so, they're not really dead, per se, so all the standard human functions should work, such as liver processing toxins. Perhaps they just have an incredible tolerance simply because the regeneration provided by their curse causes the poisoning that is intoxication to be healed entirely too quickly for most people's delights. Bring on the kegs!! Seriously, 3 for me and 2 for my friend here.
