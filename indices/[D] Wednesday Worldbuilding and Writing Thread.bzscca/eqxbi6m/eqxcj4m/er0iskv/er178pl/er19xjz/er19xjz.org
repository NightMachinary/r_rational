Maybe the rot hits vampires the same way as alcohol? Or they have to mix in a lot of sugar into the blood and then let /that/ ferment?

[[/piecupcakeget][]] Or you just feed some a whole lot of sugar, then extract and ferment their blood?

  The problem with that is as someone else said, vampires are meant to be "better" than humans - if they can heal a massive arm wound, why are they suddenly not able to metabolise a mild poison? (admittedly, those are two very different systems in the body)
#+end_quote

Maybe they can metabolise it instantly - but they can /also/ turn that ability off temporarily, in the same way as humans, despite having to breathe, are able to hold their breath for a while. (This also means that vampires would have a limit as to /how/ drunk thy can get, because they can't get drunk enough to stop 'holding their metabolism').

--------------

Alternative: vampires can heal everything /except/ blood, which they have to replace. Drinking enough blood from drunk people leads to a drunk vampire, who will then /stay/ drunk until such time as he drinks some blood from enough sober people to thin out the alcohol a bit. (And regrowing an arm leads to a massively thirsty vampire because he's got to get an arm's worth of blood from /somewhere/).
