I'm more thinking, the hormonal thing is really going to heavily strengthen your attachments to the humans you feed on as individuals; if you feed from a man who is crazy about you, afterwards you have this wonderful glow of love that persists. If you feed from him exclusively, well, he'll die, but you'll always have a ~10% level of love from him just from the feeding thing, which spikes after feeding. It's... interesting. A manipulative human might make sure they are in adoring bliss mood before offering their neck to their vampire, just to make sure the effect is as potent.

That said, thinking about My Vampires, they must produce hormones if their brain is working normally, and I'm sure that oxytocin or whatever has a short half life in the body. So the hormonal effects are only going to be immediate, and probably not that strong.

(actually if we have the alcohol rule, probably whatever breaks down alcohol breaks down other hormones, so maybe not?)

I don't know. This is fascinating to think about and my knowledge of physiology is limited to first year university, so I know just enough to get into trouble...
