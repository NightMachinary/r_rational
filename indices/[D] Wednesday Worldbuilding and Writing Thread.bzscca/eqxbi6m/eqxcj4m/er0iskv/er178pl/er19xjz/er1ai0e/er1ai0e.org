Feeding someone a lot of sugar won't make their blood sugar high enough to make it fermentable: if you don't have diabetes, you're going to digest that appropriately rather than have it go in the blood all willy nilly, and if you do have diabetes, you'll go in a coma and presumably die before it gets up to fermentable levels of sugar....

  but they can also turn that ability off temporarily, in the same way as humans, despite having to breathe, are able to hold their breath for a while

I like this idea, and I especially like the implication that you can only get drunk if you choose to, and you can un-drunk yourself at will

This is brilliant! If you drink only drunk humans you get drunk, and then you stay as drunk as the average human you drank. I'm not sure if I want to use it or not but I love it, and I think it's the cleanest, most sensible way for vampires to work. It also has some interesting corrollaries, like vampires can inherit the hormones from their food source (so drinking from scared humans all the time = scared vampire), which might explain why vampries might prefer willing, calm prey.
