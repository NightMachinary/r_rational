Yeah, thinking about how the hormonal effects are likely to work, I think the vampires are either going to run on human hormones or run on vampire hormones. If they run on human hormones, then feeding gives them a nice, small blast of adreneline / oxytocin / whatever, which their physiology is able to attenuate the same way it attenuates the adreneline the vampires produce naturally.

Or, is the reason vampires are so dangerous because these fear hormones build up in their blood from feeding on humans, and the only way they can get rid of them is by depositing them back into the next human they feed from as a waste product?? Are vampires just dangerous because they're "scared", and feeding on scared humans means the affect doesn't attenuate? It's an interesting thought.

The other option is vampire hormones run on some sort of vampire-specific system, in which case the human hormones are irrelevant (unless they're grandafthered in, I guess?)
