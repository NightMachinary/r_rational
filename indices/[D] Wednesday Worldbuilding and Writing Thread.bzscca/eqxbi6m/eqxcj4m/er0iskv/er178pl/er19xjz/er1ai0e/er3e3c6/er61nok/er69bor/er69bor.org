  I'm more thinking, the hormonal thing is really going to heavily strengthen your attachments to the humans you feed on as individuals

That depends on what the human is feeling. If the vampire feeds exclusively from humans who feel scared, then he's hardly doing to feel attached to them - and if he feeds from humans who find the act of being fed on innately distasteful, then he's going to eventually face his mealtimes with disgust.

If, on the other hand, the human enjoys the process, well, then it will likely strengthen their bonds.

But yeah, it would have all sorts of implications, and my knowledge of physiology never ever reached first-year university levels...
