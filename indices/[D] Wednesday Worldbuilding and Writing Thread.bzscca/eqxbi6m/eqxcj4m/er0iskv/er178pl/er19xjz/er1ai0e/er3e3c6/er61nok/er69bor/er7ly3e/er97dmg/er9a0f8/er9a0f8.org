It's tricky, I like the concept of vampire being victims of their beast like nature and having issues with self control, but I also like to think of them as having a great deal of mental control over their meat. Like, My Vampires can will themselves to warm their bodies, so to speak. But that level of control doesn't really mesh well with having a short temper, you know?
