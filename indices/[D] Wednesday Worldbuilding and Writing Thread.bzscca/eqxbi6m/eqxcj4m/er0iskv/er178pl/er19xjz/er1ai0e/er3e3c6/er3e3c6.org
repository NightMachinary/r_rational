  I like this idea, and I especially like the implication that you can only get drunk if you choose to, and you can un-drunk yourself at will

Yeah - it also implies that you can't get a vampire unwillingly drunk, i.e. by spiking his drink.

  If you drink only drunk humans you get drunk, and then you stay as drunk as the average human you drank. I'm not sure if I want to use it or not but I love it, and I think it's the cleanest, most sensible way for vampires to work. It also has some interesting corrollaries, like vampires can inherit the hormones from their food source (so drinking from scared humans all the time = scared vampire), which might explain why vampries might prefer willing, calm prey.

It has implications for any scene involving vampires, really, because hormones have a lot to do with emotions. Vampires can presumably control themselves well, whatever emotions they might be feeling under the surface; but a vampire who recently ate from a vampire hunter will probably be feeling combatative and punchy for a while after. On the flip side - and importantly for vampire romances - a young woman in a low-cut nightie is not going to get the reaction she might be expecting from a vampire, unless he has a sip from some other guy who's had the relevant hormones floating around in his blood. (This might even be a reason why many vampires seek human mates and /don't/ want to turn their partners, because they enjoy having someone around who can provide the relevant hormones for them to partake of).
