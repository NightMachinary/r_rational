  Can blood ferment?
#+end_quote

Sugars are what ferments; blood doesn't really contain much sugar at all, the calories come from protein. So blood wouldn't ferment the same way that if you leave a hunk of cow flesh out for long enough, it will rot rather than ferment.

So no, unfortunately, I think blood can't really ferment.

  I've seen this used alongside the idea that vampires have truly atrocious alcohol tolerance, so that 1% really hits them hard.

The problem with that is as someone else said, vampires are meant to be "better" than humans - if they can heal a massive arm wound, why are they suddenly not able to metabolise a mild poison? (admittedly, those are two very different systems in the body)
