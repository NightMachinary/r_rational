The magic is created at casting time (e.g. the drawing/carving/smelting of a sigil) so existing pictures can't be used unless recreated.

Sigils are binary line drawings that are fully connected (no breaks that aren't connected somewhere else). In general one can represent a "person" or a "face" but the sigil usually only effects conceptual things it touches (but for a "building" that can be quite large).

Sculptures can be used, but only as 2d line drawings, not from a perspective, but a "what if I flattened this out" mathematical warp. 2d line drawing optical illusions would use whatever the caster envisioned (if they envisioned both then it could do both, but that would be master level work).

If I wanted to design an assassinate spell it would be through using something like "assassinate the leader of a country" image and attempt to bring it "into contact" with the nation in question, but that would be absurdly expensive in materials.
