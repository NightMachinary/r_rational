If I put an "assassinate person X" sigil on the inside of an envelope (actually on the inner surface of the envelope), then I write his name and address on the outside and drop it into a mailbox with proper postage, of course) - is that likely to kill him the moment he picks up the envelope?

If I turn a piece of wire into a flat wire-sculpture sigil and then roll it up, do I have a sigil that's still effective but very hard to recognise?
