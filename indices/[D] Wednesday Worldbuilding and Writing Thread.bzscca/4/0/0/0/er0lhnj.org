Based on skimming the wiki article, it probably would have become Greek at some point, because Rome took it in 146 BC, and it was destroyed in 698 CE by Umayyad (Muslim) forces to stop the Byzantine Empire from taking it. There probably would have been some other African/Middle Eastern group that would similarly want to control the area and would take it over. I'd think they'd be successful.
