Having all four groups be named after women might make sense if the lineages are matrilinear: if your mother was a Fury, you're of that lineage.

I assume you've already looked at Plato's Republic, but if not that has a lot of material for what a Hellene-descended breeding program and utopia could look like.

You've mentioned how a Hellene civilisation would better resist the forces that caused the fall of Rome. How would other key historical events have changed, like the Columbian exchange or the Black Death?
