You could try looking into modern Hellenistic polytheists for inspiration, see if there's anything that you can adapt and scale up.

The easy solution I can think of is to make something up or pull from somewhere else. Some other culturally significant forces had to have popped up in the last ~3000 years, draw from that. I think a monotheistic religion makes sense as a foil/contrast. Maybe Judaism has a larger influence?

Also, have they not figured out genetic modification, or the possibility of it as a method? It would be a lot more practical than breeding systems, and could also correct sex disparities. Though I wasn't aware countries other than Japan were currently having problems with replacement rate.
