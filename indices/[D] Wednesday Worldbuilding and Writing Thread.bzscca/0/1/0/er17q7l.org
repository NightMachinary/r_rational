  if there's some bit of vampire mythology that means it has to be fresh blood.
#+end_quote

I don't want this to be about My Vampires, but My Vampires don't just need fresh blood, they need to drink it from a human (they can consume blood from cups/etc, but it doesn't do much to sate their thirst and only has a ceremonial function).

  Injecting someone with straight alcohol and then draining them of their blood before they die is pretty metal, and fits will with vampire decadence, as well as being kind of horrifying.

Extremely horrifying. I wonder if the vampires doing that would get the bad effects? Like, they have to drink blood, but ship of theseus here... if you drain a human and replace their blood with chocolate sauce, and you somehow keep them alive 5 minutes in this state - does that count as "living" enough for a vampire to be able to drink it? Is the need to feed from a human physiological (their digestive system is activated when they clamp on a human), psychological (not drinking from a human is disgusting) or what?
