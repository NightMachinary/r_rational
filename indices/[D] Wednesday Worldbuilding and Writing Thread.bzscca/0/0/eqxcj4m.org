Responding to my own post with the obvious suggestions for people to riff on:

- Get the humans drink enough and their blood is an (extremely dilute) alcoholic beverage in itself ! (So in the rules of this system, you probably can't dilute human blood with ethanol and make a 6% beer for a vampire that way: say the upper limit of spiking blood with ethanol is the upper limit a human's blood contain without killing the human, in which case we're extremely charitably able to get human blood to a 1% alcohol volume which is pitiful)

- Magic potions. Yawn.

- Heroin, coke, etc - anything that doesn't require an oral route. Presumably something absorbed by snorting might still count as "eating"? And heroin doesn't necessarily affect vampires the same way?

- Turns out werewolf(say) blood gets vampires drunk - this is interesting, but why?
