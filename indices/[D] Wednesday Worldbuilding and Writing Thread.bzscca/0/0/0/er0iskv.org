  Get the humans drink enough and their blood is an (extremely dilute) alcoholic beverage in itself ! (So in the rules of this system, you probably can't dilute human blood with ethanol and make a 6% beer for a vampire that way: say the upper limit of spiking blood with ethanol is the upper limit a human's blood contain without killing the human, in which case we're extremely charitably able to get human blood to a 1% alcohol volume which is pitiful)

I've seen this used alongside the idea that vampires have truly /atrocious/ alcohol tolerance, so that 1% really hits them /hard/.

Another option; alcohol is more or less fruit (often grapes) that have gone a little bit /off/ in a very specific way. How do vampires react to blood that's been allowed to ferment a little? (/Can/ blood ferment? I presume it can because it's organic, at least if you can keep it from clotting first...)
