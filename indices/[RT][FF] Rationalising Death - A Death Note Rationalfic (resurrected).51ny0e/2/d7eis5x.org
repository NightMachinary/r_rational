Well done! I really enjoyed this first chapter, and Light is more intelligent, flawed, and generally interesting this time around. I don't know if you recall, but I beta'd for you last time. If you ever want to add another person to your crew, it'd be my pleasure!

Things to look out for, if I remember correctly what you ended up with last time, would be following canon too closely and messing up the introduction of Misa. In the first version, I recall there being some complaints about her being a bit too perfect -- especially given the constraints on her time. I can't remember how valid those complaints were, but I do remember feeling as though the story went off the rails somewhere, and that she might have had something to do with that. The confrontation between the two of them was great though; seeing something like that again would be awesome. As would seeing ongoing interactions between the two of them, except, unlike in canon, with a version of Misa who is actually a character. There hasn't been enough romance in Rational Fic in my opinion, and LightxMisa has the potential of being both delightfully dysfunctional and really deep/heartwarming. HPMOR showed us what a "rational protagonist" will do for someone important to them, but we haven't seen what a relationship between two such people (especially with not-quite-aligned goals) looks like.

Of course, you might be planning on going in a totally different direction. Whatever your plans, good luck. I'm seriously looking forward to reading :).
