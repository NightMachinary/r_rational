Is there more than one chapter? It says "Published: Jun 11, 2013", and you're talking about the first chapter, but there doesn't seem to be more. EDIT: nvm, intro says you are "rewriting it all".

I like the writing style. The plot is point for point the same as the manga/anime.

Also it wasn't very smart to not check the time and kill the harasser faster, saving the girl and Light some suffering. He could've said "broken neck" or something as cause of death.

Do also read this: [[http://thefutureprimaeval.net/the-tragedy-of-light/]] . Key part:

  Yagami Light had that magic ring. And instead of using it to seize political power for himself -- with a tough-on-crime platform that would be pretty popular and the threat of the notebook itself to keep challengers at bay -- Light instead tries to wield his influence anonymously from the shadows. And so a story that could have ended with Yagami Light on the Chrysanthemum Throne instead has him hunted like a dog.

So consider that for your story plans, if you haven't. Of course, do continue with whatever you have if you think it is better.
