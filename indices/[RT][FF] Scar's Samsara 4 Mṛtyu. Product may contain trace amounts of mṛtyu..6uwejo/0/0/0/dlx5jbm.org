I've been thinking why this chapter in particular seems to fast forwarded, but the previous ones don't even though they're short as well. I think it might be because the drama to word ratio is quite high.

We have a total of 4 dramatic things going on: Banzai, Zazu & the zebra, the afterlife scouting & Zira's return, which is by my rough and somewhat unreliable estimate at least 50% more than the other chapters and these ones seem to have more oomph to them.

It also probably has to do with how rapidly you switch between these things. There's no resolution to the banzai problem or even a bit of Scar's introspection to make the transitions softer, it just switches from basically the height of the action to another scene.

These are just my thoughts on the issue. I am not claiming that this is necessarily the case.

P.S. I can't help but notice that you wrote that Zira had been found rather than that she had returned. I find this awfully suspicious.
