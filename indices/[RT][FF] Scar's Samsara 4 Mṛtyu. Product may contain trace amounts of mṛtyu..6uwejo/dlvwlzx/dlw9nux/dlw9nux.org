True, the story as a whole is very fast paced - that was kind of deliberate, since I figured there was not enough material to really make it a sprawling epic. Instead there's a lot of time skips between chapters to show Simba growing up etc. rather than having chapters in which the plot barely moves forward. It's good that you say so though, because maybe I really should have given the story more room to breathe.

Right now it looks like it'll be more than 6 chapters, maybe 8 in total. The reason is that I ended up splitting certain chapters like this one into 2 chapters of 4 pages rather than 1 of eight. Adding another 2 scenes after this one would rob the previous scenes of their power and not really do them justice, since both the Zazu scene and the Banzai scene carry a lot more oomph like this I think.
