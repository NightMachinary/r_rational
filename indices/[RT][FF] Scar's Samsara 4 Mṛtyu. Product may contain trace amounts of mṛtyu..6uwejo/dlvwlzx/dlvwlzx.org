I'm really just waiting to see what happens at this point, but I can't shake the feeling that Scar is going to meet some unsavory end.

I suppose that this was just you setting up for the penultimate chapter. Honestly, It seems a bit abrupt to me even more so than the previous chapters. Now that I think about it, it the entire story feels rather fast paced.
