One major thing I like about this story is that the main character both attempts scientific investigation, while acknowledging how seriously handicapped the main character is in terms of their investigation. With other rational fics, for example, HPMOR, I feel like the narration and the plot lets the main character get away with half-assed experiments without calling them out on it. Here it felt like the narrative and the characters themselves acknowledged how incomplete their attempts at rational inquiry are.

I also like the continued Maybe Magic Maybe Mundane (a TV Tropes trope) thing you have going on.
