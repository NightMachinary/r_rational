True, a lot of rational fiction ironically enough has such investigations happen smoothly for the sake of plot. One of the main things that always bothered me about HPMOR is that the entire world seemed to go out of its way to make HJPEV look as awesome as possible. Rational inquiry and wish fulfillment don't go well together, I feel, but the inherent contradiction of rational fiction is that the audience wants both.

And yeah, like I mentioned in an earlier post, I love the idea of magic as a mysterious force - where the character does not /know/ if anything or everything that happens is because of magic.

Anyway, thanks for the thoughtful review!
