I love writing Zazu as well - to me he's really the epitome of the servant who easily blends into the background, but who knows far more than he's letting on. Not someone you want to underestimate.

Unfortunately for Scar, everyone in the Pridelands is a potential enemy to him, so he can't exactly get rid of everyone who is too dangerous/competent.
