Naruto's original body is still in the prayer room instructing Lee, Shino and Tenten. So this is a clone of a clone with only a fraction of the original's chakra, which is why Sasuke was able to overpower Naruto with genjutsu in the first place. (Well, that and the fact that Naruto sucks at genjutsu and did not flare his chakra in time)
