  They just assume that the Kotoamatsukami is real, does exactly what the rumors claim it does and can be used if not on demand, more often than once in every 10 years. First off of course there really is no clear reason to even believe that the Kotoamatsukami is as powerful as it seems. It's possible that the claims of what it can do are the same as the Uchiha's claiming the Sharingan can see the future, misinformation.

Kinda. You have to remember that Naruto's source of information here is Sasuke - the son of the Uchiha clan leaders, who was around when Shisui was said to have gained this ability. Sasuke was perfectly aware of all the lies that were being spread about the Sharingan. It's true that there could have been additional misinformation about the Mangekyo that he did not know about (and indeed, there clearly was) but it doesn't make much sense to create a rumour that you have an ability that makes you a threat to the entire Village, and then lie again by saying that the only person who could use it just died. The only way that makes sense is if they first spread a lie to make themselves seem more powerful, then regretted it and tried to cover it up poorly. Which is not impossible.

You're definitely right though that neither of them know the exact mechanics of how Kotoamatsukami would even work, and the specifics of that would have huge implications for how they should expect their world to look.
