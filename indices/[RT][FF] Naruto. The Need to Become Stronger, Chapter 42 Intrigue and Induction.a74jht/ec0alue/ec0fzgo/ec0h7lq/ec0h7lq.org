Naruto/Sasuke's line of logic here seems to begin from a pretty interesting faulty assumption. They just assume that the Kotoamatsukami is real, does exactly what the rumors claim it does and can be used if not on demand, more often than once in every 10 years. First off of course there really is no clear reason to even believe that the Kotoamatsukami is as powerful as it seems. It's possible that the claims of what it can do are the same as the Uchiha's claiming the Sharingan can see the future, misinformation. If anything, we have decent evidence against the idea that it's that powerful, Madara lost his fight against the first Hokage and there is no evidence that he ever used the Kotoamatsukami. You'd have to assume that he just never realized he could use it, or that the first had some kind of defense against it.

The other faulty assumption they make is that the idea that it can only be used every 10 years being an obvious lie, their issue of how anyone could know is easily solved, they're standing next to a slab which describes the power of the Mangeky≈ç. Their other issue is more interesting though, why would it work like that? No other jutsu works like that so claiming without explanation that the Kotoamatsukami can only work every 10 years is unlikely.

At this point I'm moving into rampant speculation, but what if instead you could only have the Kotoamatsukami active on some hard limit of people at one time, the first person who used it, wanting to hide this weakness said that it could only be used every 10 years or "as good as forever". Before I explain why this might be the case I should note that the very idea of the Kotoamatsukami seems a little unlikely to me. Genjutsu which can infect the brain and cause illusions makes sense, a not un-common mental condition already does that so inflicting it shouldn't be that hard, even body-bind Genjutsu which controls the brain to shut down movement makes sense (look up sleep paralysis if that sounds unlikely to you), but rewriting the brain to change their personality stretches my credulity, how would you even know what to change? If we could explain how the Kotoamatsukami works without relying on a new level of genjutsu never before seen, that explanation would be somewhat likely. What if the Kotoamatsukami works by making a shadow clone, but instead of using chakra as a base to create a physical body for a splintered off part of your mind instead you send the splintered part of your mind into someone elses body, completely possessing them, or maybe just giving them a voice in their head that tells them to do things. In this case the reason for why you could only infect a hard limit of people at a time becomes logical, most people can't make more than 1 or 2 shadow clones at a time, partially because of chakra limitations but partially because splintering your mind is so difficult. If unlike shadow clones, your clones couldn't make more clones then you might just end up with a hard limit.

Wow, that whole paragraph doesn't have much evidence behind it. Maybe you should just ignore it...

Either way, I'm interested to see what Sasuke does with his probably wrong assumptions, and how Naruto reacts to his clone never returning from his talk with Sasuke.
