Not a native speaker either, but I will note that I have only seen the word corollary used to indicate a natural consequence, and definition b seems completely wrong to me. I'm also a mathematician though, so we might simply be stuck on our own island of linguistical ignorance (and fighting a dictionary definition is probably not the wisest course of action in most cases). Still, I would double-check with a native speaker, preferably a non-mathematician.

  Question: Why does it need to be awoken at all? What disadvantage is there to having more power?

  Corollary question: What other examples of powers requiring stress to unlock are known?

Even granting definition b though, I'm not sure that the second question is a corollary to the first. You have two (actually three) questions that are more or less unrelated, covering separate issues. The number of vessels to be built is related to the types of vessels; if you want to build large ships, you can only build few, while if you want to build small ships, you may be able to buy many. For this reason, the question of type is a natural follow-up question (my preferred synonym for your definition of corollary question) to the question of number. The question of why the Mangekyou needs to be awoken however does not require consideration of powers that require stress to unlock; there's no feeling of it being a natural follow-up question to the first one. At best, it's a natural question to ask when faced with the preceding Fact.

In my mind, the natural sequence of thoughts is at follows (mostly preserving your order; adding a bit):

  Fact: The Sharingan becomes stronger from stress. The Mangeky≈ç requires even more stress to awaken.

  Question: Why does it need to be awoken at all?

  Answer: Don't know. Is there some disadvantage to using its power? Chakra usage? Is it simply something that needs to be learned, like children being unable to use chakra techniques from birth? Is stress even a required ingredient to awaken it?

  Follow-up question: Do we know of other examples of powers requiring stress to unlock?

  Answer: Only the Eight Gates technique, which enhances your power at the risk of hurting yourself. Which... is a pretty good reason for the Mangekyou to be locked.

[Incidentally, I would consider that last sentence to be a corollary in a colloquial sense; in a mathematical sense, it's a little too imprecise.]

Note that the above argument still feels flawed to me; in my mind there's a step missing explaining that being born with such a power unlocked would be lethal to you, so we don't observe individuals with an unlocked Mangekyou. Still, getting genetics in there is probably too much.

Ok, I probably spent way too long on a single word. TL;DR: Using the word 'corollary' in this sense bothers me enough to write a long reddit post on it. :P
