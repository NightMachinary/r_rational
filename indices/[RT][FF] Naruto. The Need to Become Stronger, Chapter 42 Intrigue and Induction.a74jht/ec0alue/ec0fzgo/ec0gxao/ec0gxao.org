Lee uses the 8 Gates on a semi-regular basis, and opening just the first one doesn't seem to cause much in the way of permanent damage. Besides, for all his irrationality in this chapter Sasuke does acknowledge this point:

  “You said that the first thing you would do is to mind control anyone with the same ability. But what if you're just one person and you only just learned this new power from your closest friend? Even if all the other restrictions are a lie, using the Mangekyō still comes with risk. What would you do in that case, Naruto?”

Sasuke doesn't actually believe Itachi went and used Kotoamatsukami on everyone. He believes that Itachi used it on Kakashi, Danzo, Inoichi, the leader of the Akatsuki and maybe a few others. That's perfectly feasible if the risk is comparable with opening the first Gate (though in practice it would be quite different, since all of that power is focussed on just the eyes).
