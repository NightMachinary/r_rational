Why doesn't Sasuke assume Itachi used Kotoamatsukami on him? Especially if they deduced that the once a decade thing is arbitrary?

Also, two things. One, I thought Naruto left a shadow clone with Temari, not Sasuke, does that mean the Naruto at the meeting was a shadow clone the whole time?

Two, when did they discover that Naruto doesn't get the memories back from the clones when their chakra is expended all at once? Won't this cause Naruto to be even more suspicious of Sasuke?
