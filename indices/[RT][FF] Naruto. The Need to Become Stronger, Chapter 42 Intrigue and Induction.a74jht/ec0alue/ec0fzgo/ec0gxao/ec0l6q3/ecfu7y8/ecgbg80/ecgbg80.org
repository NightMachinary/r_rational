Good point. In NTBS you can't really see through chakra though - the Byakugan can make out Tenketsu as glowing spots on the user's body, but looking right into someone's brain would be impossible. So in the case of the Mangekyo, it would simply look to another Uchiha like the user was channelling a ton of chakra to their eye, which wouldn't be enough to figure out what was really happening.
