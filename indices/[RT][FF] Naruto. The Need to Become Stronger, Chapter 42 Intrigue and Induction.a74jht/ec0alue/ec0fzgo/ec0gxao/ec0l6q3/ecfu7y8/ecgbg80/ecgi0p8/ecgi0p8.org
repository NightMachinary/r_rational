Does that mean that the gates are metaphorical? Because ninja have no qualms cutting people up, I just assumed that a non-literal organ would be dropped from their language.

Unless the structure of the human body is kept under wraps... there's definitely canon examples of the villages recovering their dead so that enemies couldn't dissect the corpse. Is it feasible to keep that simple and mundane of a secret from so many people?

With mind controlling ninja, I guess even something as concrete as what organs human organs have can be hidden.

Chilling.
