Kinda yes, kinda no.

Sasuke is very definitely emotionally biased when it comes to his brother, and Naruto has a tendency to express his ideas a little more confidently than is warranted when he gets excited, so you're definitely right that this chapter shows how intelligent people can act irrationally. But a lot of what Naruto says is not necessarily irrational, given his information.

Yes, Naruto is concluding a *lot* based on very little evidence. But on the other other hand, Naruto is 100% correct that the official story of what happened to the Uchiha has more holes than a broken sieve, and that the implications of a mind control technique if it does exist are enormous. And given his prior knowledge of a shadowy figure manipulating things behind the scenes, it's not surprising that he jumped onto this as an explanation.

Think of it this way. Imagine seeing in the news that everybody in a village in China suddenly died. The official story is that a brilliant scientist in that village suddenly went crazy and killed everyone in the middle of the night, then disappeared only to be seen working for some terrorist organisation which is rumoured to have ties to the government. There is zero photo evidence of the event and all the satellites (the Hyuga) could not get a clear image because it was too cloudy. Nobody gets to see the bodies of the people who died. Anyone who questions the official narrative is derided by the media as a conspiracy loon.

Any rational person who looks at that chain of events would instantly realize something fishy is going on. You'd be 100% justified in concluding that this scientist must have discovered something of extraordinary importance to justify a coverup of this magnitude, and you'd have every reason to wonder about the implications that such a coverup can even be made to work in the first place. Now let's say you're also part of a secret investigation about bioweapons being researched in China, and that the mad scientist's best friend died from a horrible disease just a few months beforehand. You can't be certain these things are related, but you'd have to wonder...
