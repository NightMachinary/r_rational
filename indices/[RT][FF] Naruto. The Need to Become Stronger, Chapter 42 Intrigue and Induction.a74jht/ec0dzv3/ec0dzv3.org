  *A/N:* The chapter title refers to induction, which is the opposite form of logic that Sherlock Holmes claims to be doing. Deduction is when you have eliminated all other possible answers, and so the remaining one must be correct. Induction is when you observe that pigs so far have never been shown to fly, and so conclude that they probably will never be able to (e.g. the laws of nature). Philosophers sometimes sniff at this type of practical logic and call it a fallacy because we can't be /certain/ that pigs aren't inventing jetpacks as we speak. However, the fact is that we can never be 100% certain of anything in life, and so the ability to reliably guess at answers based on uncertain information is actually a crucial skill for any aspiring rationalist to learn.

As mentioned before, I find it kind of hard to put in every bit of rationalist exposition in the story without slowing down the flow of things, so I'm thinking I might make these notes a regular thing, kind of like in Scar's Samsara where every chapter started with a brief explanation of what the chapter was about. Of course, this is mostly written for the [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] audience, so it'll probably be pretty familiar material for people here on [[/r/rational][r/rational]].
