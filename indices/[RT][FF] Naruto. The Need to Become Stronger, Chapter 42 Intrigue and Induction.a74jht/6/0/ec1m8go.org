Edit: Then again, Webster seems to agree with my use of the word, at least in the informal sense:

  a : something that naturally follows *:* [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/result][result]] // love was a stormy passion and jealousy its normal corollary.--- Ida Treat

  b *:* something that incidentally or naturally accompanies or parallels // A corollary to the problem of the number of vessels to be built was that of the types of vessels to be constructed.--- Daniel Marx
