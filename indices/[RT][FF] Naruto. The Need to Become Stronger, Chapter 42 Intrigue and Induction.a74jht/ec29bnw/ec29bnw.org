So, there's nothing constructive in this, but it's one of those posts that'll be mainly gushing.

I've liked this story since the beginning. I like me some Naruto, Intelligent!Naruto more than anything and even we can, Rational!Naruto's the best. So you had me pretty sold from the beginning.

But my liking this story quickly turned into love because of the /lore./ There's nothing I love more than a theory of how things works that's consistent throughout and this story has been pretty good at that. But that's all just gotten better spanning from Naruto v Gaara fight to everything that happened in the update today, as if all the pieces that have been laid throughout are coming together.

I've recently started writing a fic set in the Naruto world and the thought you've put into how jutsu work is helping in forming the base in my own understanding of how they work and that's been really helpful.

So thanks for writing this and keep on keeping on.
