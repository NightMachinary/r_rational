Hm, interesting. I checked again to be sure, but even google seems to agree with me. If I type in define:corollary, I get this as the second definition:

#+begin_quote
  adjective: *corollary*
#+end_quote

1. forming a proposition that follows from one already proved.

#+begin_quote
  associated or supplementary."the court did not answer a corollary question"
#+end_quote

It even volunteers the phrase "corollary question", so I definitely didn't just make it up. I suspect it really is just a difference in how mathematicians use it vs how it is used colloquially. Still, I'll change it to "follow-up question", if only to avoid tripping readers up.

  You have two (actually three) questions that are more or less unrelated, covering separate issues... The question of why the Mangekyou needs to be awoken however does not require consideration of powers that require stress to unlock; there's no feeling of it being a natural follow-up question to the first one. At best, it's a natural question to ask when faced with the preceding Fact.

Ah, now this I totally disagree with. Naruto is implying a chain of reasoning here wherein the only logical reason for a power to need awakening is if it has some kind of risk attached to it, and that the mechanism by which this works is likely similar to other powers which also require stress to awaken. Naruto is cutting some logical corners here to get to his destination, sure, but the questions certainly are not unrelated.
