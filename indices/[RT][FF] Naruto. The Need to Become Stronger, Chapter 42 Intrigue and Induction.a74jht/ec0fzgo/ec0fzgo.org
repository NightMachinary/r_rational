Something I find really amusing is that one of the key assumptions that Naruto and Sasuke are making (Kotoamatsukami can be used freely) could potentially have been disproved if they had decided to involve Sakura.

Sakura is a medic and as such she should find it significantly easier to realize that jutsu that can only be used by opening one of the Eight Gates would take a terrible toll on the body and could not possibly be used as indiscriminately as Naruto and Sasuke envision. A medical perspective could also provide an alternative explanation for the seemingly arbitrary once a decade limitation on Kotoamatsukami as it could very well be that the reason for this limitation is that overuse kills or destroys the Sharigan.
