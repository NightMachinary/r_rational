Assuming the most permissive version of this power, it is extremely powerful, rendering the red and yellow pills redundant, and even having a fraction of the abilities of the orange pill (or even just letting you copy any other people with powers).

As others have stated you can get free energy by turning into a heavier animal and then draining the created kinetic energy. However this is among the worst ways to get energy out of this power. Much more sensible would be to turn into a whale then have your head (well head area) chopped off then turn into something else before you could die. You could then extract all the caloric energy in that flesh (assuming it sticks around separated from your body when you change into something else, but I already said this was the most permissive interpretation).\\
However since this power would be most useful in preventing the heat death of the universe what you'd probably do is just feed the excess material into a black hole in order to get direct matter to energy conversion via black hole farming see: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ]], thus this power is vastly superior to the red pill for energy creation (though the best way to use the red pill would probably not be turning turbines but using the regen to create matter to feed to black holes)

If you can turn into /any/ animal (though I think it should be assumed you are limited to real animals that you know about), then by turning into specific humans you can read their mind, not only to gain any sensitive information they possess, but also potentially in order to learn skills faster, directly from their mind. [[/Some%20of%20you%20may%20remember%20something%20like%20this%20this%20from%20Animorphs:%20The%20Reckoning,%20which%20is%20where%20i'm%20getting%20this%20idea%20from][Animorphs the Reckoning spoiler]]. You /may/ also be able to copy their powers, or at least copy the powers of orange (though only the knowledge he had already used his power to acquire).\\
Plus you may be able to turn into highly intelligent people and use your versions of their mind for advice. If you can copy powers then you can also turn into yourself /turning into yourself, turning into yourself, etc/. Which basically means you might be able to leverage this into gaining access to an arbitrarily large number of simulations of yourself (plus a simulation of one other mind) in order to get mental work done faster.
