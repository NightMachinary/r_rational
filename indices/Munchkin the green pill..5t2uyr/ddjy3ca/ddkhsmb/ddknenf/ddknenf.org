Screw "basically gods" stuff, if you are resorting to most permissive version of a power, flat out turn into god.

There are many gods that appeared in the form of animal while still retaining their powers. These powers included turning into the original form of the god. Shapeshift in that version of that animal, and then shift into the original form of the god. Zeus was into shapeshifting to animals to impregnate humans, Loki was a female horse once, and proteus could shapeshift into anything. The list is endless.

And that's before taking into account the human forms of the gods themselves. Shapeshift into the human form of YHWH, a.k.a Jesus Christ. Congrats, you just beat life.

Edit: and if fictional animals are fair game and you want to go into actual munchkin stuff, have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons 3.5? If so, ever heard of Pun-pun? Yeah, that. If you haven't, the fictional race Sarruk can graft supernatural and spell-like power into reptiles. The authors forgot to build in limits because the race was never meant to be used by players. From there, [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Pun-Pun_%283.5e_Optimized_Character_Build%29][there is a well documented way to graft yourself with every power ever published for D&D]], so you pretty much graft godhood into yourself.
