I was assuming you keep your own mind (presumably with your consciousness somewhere outside of normal space), however if you turn into another animal that will include it's brain.\\
So it seems there's no variation of true shapeshifting (well except versions where you become what you turn into losing your previous identity, but those would be pretty useless, except for turning into yourself in order to regen) that doesn't basically mean you are effectively possessing a copy of the thing you're turned into.
