That depends on whether, when you turn into an animal, you can turn into a specific animal or into a generic member of the species. Being able to turn into a different /specific/ human would be super effective in all kinds of ways, but even being able to turn into a generic human-who-is-not-you is useful.

Or maybe when you turn into a human you always turn into you, and when you turn into a sparrow you always turn into the sparrow that got mauled by the hawk?

And picking up acquired abilities is a bit iffy.

Of course you could turn into a member of a species where every individual is a powerful wizard, that would be an inherent ability.
