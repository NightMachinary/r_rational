This is head canon for me now. Black pill guy just ended up selecting for a future where green pill guy dies before he figures this out, so that he doesn't have to deal with the suboptimal outcome of competing with someone who has his power.

edit: To add, since black pill clearly uses the most OP interpretation of "can see one month into the future" it seems to be in line with the flavor of the story to give green pill a similarly OP treatment. Turns out early game advantage is the most OP of all though.
