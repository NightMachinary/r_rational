Obviously you are the world's best spy. Also, Assassin. The number of ways in which these jobs could be accomplished is basically endless.

You can make yourself near invincible by turning into a [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2280286/Meet-toughest-animal-planet-The-water-bear-survive-frozen-boiled-float-space-live-200-years.html][Tardigrade]].

You could perform entropy shenanigans much like red does (for example creating a machine that can take advantage of spinning you up to several G's as a tick then turn into a blue whale - suddenly a lot more energy in the system.

Obviously lots of exploration could be done, the bottom of the ocean and places humans can't easily go.

We don't really know the extent of the power of the green pill so below is some speculation.

Dinosaur and other extinct species. Obviously interesting from a research perspective... Already mentioned but He also clearly violates physical laws so could provide energy in a variety of ways. Turning into a very large dinosaur for a sort of 'super strength' to increase the energy but only needing to eat what a human eats (as far as we know). Could also explore lots of other extinct species, depending on exactly how familiar with the species you need to be there could be all kinds of exotic creatures that are possible.

Not entirely certain if wounds taken in animal form carry over to human form and to what degree, knowing that would be useful (the only mention of wounds came from when the eagle had him by the leg in human form, it sounded a bit like he had taken more damage as a sparrow). If they do carry over, you can heal a lot faster in sloth form or even regenerate limbs in salamander form. If they don't, you can harvest materials more aggressively than mentioned earlier and perform all kinds of shenanigans.

If he is not limited to animals but any living creature: Having human intelligence as a bacteria would certainly be interesting from a scientific perspective and might yield useful information. Could you reproduce in bacterial form and split into several yous?

Could he turn into an aspen forest, which is technically a single organism? I just don't know the extent of his shapeshifting powers...

I'll try to think of some more but thats what I got for now.
