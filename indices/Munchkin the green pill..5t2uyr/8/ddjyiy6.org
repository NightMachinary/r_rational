The guy was obviously an idiot. When he was injured, he could have transformed into either something that doesn't have legs to be injured, or an animal with an amorphous body structure to heal quickly.

Even before that, turning into something like an alligator when the hawk attacked would work much better. Hard scales protect you from it's claws while you eat the hawk.

Even before that, why fly around as a sparrow when you can fly around as a hawk, or an eagle? Why would you chose one of the smallest birds, pretty low on the food chain?

Anybody who is given the option to take any of the pills and chooses green is probably not the smartest person, but I guess it is nice to have that confirmed in story.
