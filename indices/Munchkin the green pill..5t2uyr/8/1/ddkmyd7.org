Yeah, he was simply unoptimal to the extreme.

If I could choose, it's a Peregrine Falcon for sheer speed. Better yet, a brazilian free-tailed bat is the 5th fastest animal on earth, has the fastest ground speed at over 160km/h and echolocation. Nothing will ever catch me, and if I get caught the correct action is to change into something microscopic ASAP to both escape and assure a perfect landing due to Square-cube law.

And why the hell turn into any sea animal, when a regular ship like a cruiser tops them all? You're a shapeshifter, money shouldn't be a problem with you being the best assassin in the world.
