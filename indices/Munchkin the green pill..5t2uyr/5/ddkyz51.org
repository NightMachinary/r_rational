The problem with this pill, as this thread is demonstrating, is that there's such an endless amount of ways to interpret the powers it grants that it's hard to really know if it's overpowered or terrible.

Assuming it works even remotely like Animorphs (or, even better, r!Animorphs) would make it incredibly useful for a spy or assassin, but what I'm more interested in is the potential scientific benefits.

You would be the first conscious being who was capable of inhabiting another mind with (presumably) all its perspective and instincts intact, but your own intellect and values as well. You could learn so much about how different animals learn and experience the world, and help push our understanding of neuroscience immensely.
