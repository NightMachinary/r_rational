  You could perform entropy shenanigans much like red does (for example creating a machine that can take advantage of spinning you up to several G's as a tick then turn into a blue whale - suddenly a lot more energy in the system.

He'd get a lot less dizzy by simply standing on a spring-loaded platform and rapidly switching between blue whale and flea.

Though he'd still only generate a tiny fraction of the energy that Red does, of course.
