You could earn large amounts of money if you say you have super high-rez photographs/x-rays of long-extinct animals that you just happened to find in your dead grandpa's safe and you'd be willing to release for some compensation. Especially the human-primate missing link.

Edit: probably even easier money would be if you can regenerate; I'd bet there'd be a lot of people willing to pay you a lot of money to eat extinct animal bits.

edit:edit: you can also sell some animal byproducts that have some value, like rattlesnake poisons.

editx3: humans are animals! You can perfectly impersonate literally anyone. The implications are pretty clear. You'd be of great interest to militaries but as long as you manage to stay off their radar, it should be pretty easy to have a fantastic life. Depending on how the power works, you could also be able to temporarily simulate all kinds of diseases in yourself that others can use for medical research.

editx4: regarding the above point, the [[http://www.shigabooks.com/][demon comic]] should apply--depending on how the power works, you'd be pretty much immortal.
