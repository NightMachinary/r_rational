The universe is infinite, and the pill powers are immune to relativity so you're not limited to the light cone of the local universe... so animals that are basically identical to any possible fictional animals must exist somewhere, down to a DNA based metabolism if that's a requirement. Even if you can't turn into impossible creatures, you should be able to turn into any possible creature fictional or not.

If that works you can also use this to explore the limits of physics and metaphysics.
