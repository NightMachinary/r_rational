I was going for the most permissive /reasonable/ interpretation (though to be fair that quite subjective). I don't think fictional animals would be reasonably, because while extinct animals still /exist/ (see B theory of time) however whether or not nonexistent things can /really/ be said to have qualities like being an animal in the same sense as "actual" animals is questionable. I don't like those sorts of "interpretations" in CYOA's because it's not a matter of interpreting the CYOA but interpreting reality (as in you need to assume certain philosophical/scientific models are true in the real world for those exploits to work in the CYOA)

Also if those fictional animals have magic powers then whether or not those can be replicated (without which turning into that creature may instantly kill you) is questionable. While I considered the possibility that the pill /may/ let you copy the effects of the other pills by turning into their recipients, whether it can replicate effects that are not part whatever magic system this CYOA operates on is much more questionable.

Also "animal" may refer to the biological phylogenetic definition, in which case any creature that doesn't share a genetic common ancestor with earth animals would be automatically disqualified.

Still I think the most plausible exploit along these lines is to assume that a singularity will be created in the future (with all these pills it seems inevitable), and that people will create proper animals using genetic engineering that are basically benevolent biological superintelligences that have inbuilt biological nano machinery, and of course if they would ever be created then they exist and can be selected. Though if you don't know about them how you could go about selecting them seems questionable, but this can be solved by drawing up many of the details about the animal in the present. Sure you may not know very many details, but given this power doesn't require substantial knowledge of biology/genetics you presumably don't need very much info.
