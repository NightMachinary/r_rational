I think the usual presentation is "give us information that will help us get a more important criminal and we'll get you a reduced sentence." Which isn't that unreasonable.

As to fabrications -- they don't hold up. The deal is "give us (the police) something useful and you get a benefit." If the information turns out to be false then there's no deal.

As to making threats...it's really not a threat to say something like "we have you on armed robbery, and you're looking at fifteen years in jail." That's just a simple fact, not a threat.
