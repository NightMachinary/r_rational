  As to making threats...it's really not a threat to say something like "we have you on armed robbery, and you're looking at fifteen years in jail." That's just a simple fact, not a threat.

It's both. That's the problem. If I say "I have charges stacked up so high that you're never going to see the light of day again ... or you can just plead guilty on this smaller stack of charges and maybe you get to see your family in a year" then /you have incentive to plead guilty even if you are innocent/. This is the problem with plea bargaining; the threat of punishment gives incentives which undermine proper legal proceeding. (With regards to confession, this is a problem because it gives people incentive to provide false information.)

  As to fabrications -- they don't hold up. The deal is "give us (the police) something useful and you get a benefit." If the information turns out to be false then there's no deal.

Even if I bought that, this is /not/ what's going on in this chapter. They're giving an immediate threat which they have no way of fulfilling after checking that information; by the time they find out, he'll be out of their custody and no longer subject to the threat.

But I don't buy it, because in many cases the very fact that the coerced person testified is used as proof against the accused. This was how the witch trials ended up in chains of accusal with every individual person in the chain only considered guilty because of testimony and only forgiven because they gave testimony.

And even if you say "well, then we'll not use testimony as part of our evidence and only offer deals on concrete things" then you're /still/ going to run into problems because every person you coerce is going to have incentive to lie. If they don't know anything, they're going to lie anyway, on the off chance that it pans out (unless you're going to provide a penalty to them for that, in which case someone who legitimately knows nothing will suffer for both talking or not talking, which is pretty obviously unjust).

*/All that said/*, we probably just have different views on how the justice system should operate. I think a lot of how it's done in the United States is the result of perverse incentives which result in poor outcomes.
