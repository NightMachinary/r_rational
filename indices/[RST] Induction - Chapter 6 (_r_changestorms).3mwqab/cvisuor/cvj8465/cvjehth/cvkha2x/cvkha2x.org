My reading was that it was a lot further than "going down for this for a million years" and more similar to Bad Cop holding a loaded gun to his head and saying "You sure you want to risk not telling me? I've gotten away with it before."

As for physical vs psychological torture, like I said, I'm not familiar enough with the literature to know if only one, rather than both, are equally bad at getting to the truth. I suspect Elly would, but only because her background includes training that mine doesn't.

And as [[/u/alexanderwales]] points out, regardless of how you categorize it, it's still coercive and thus seems like it would be less effective at getting accurate information, since in a panic, they're going to spout off whatever they think you want to hear, regardless of the veracity of that information.
