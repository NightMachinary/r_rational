  I think a lot of how it's done in the United States is the result of perverse incentives which result in poor outcomes.

Oh, trust me, I'm not happy with the American system. Two friends of mine just got convicted of embezzlement, which is hilarious when you hear the backstory: they created a charity to help wounded veterans, sold their house to fund it, and didn't draw salary for years in order to stretch the money. Worst. Embezzlers. Ever. Unfortunately, the VA didn't like having their turf encroached on and did everything they could to spike the organization, up to and including criminal charges. It was nuts.
