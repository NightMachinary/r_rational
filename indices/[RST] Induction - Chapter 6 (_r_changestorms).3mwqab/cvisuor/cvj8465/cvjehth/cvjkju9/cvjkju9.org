It's the same logic though. You're going to get desperate fabrications. (Studies on this are so fraught with politics that they're virtually worthless.) And just for the record, there are a large number of jurisdictions where Bad Cop would be violating the law by coercing a confession like that; they're not allowed to use explicit threats or promises because that's an infringement on the human rights of the subject /and/ because it's not likely to get good information.

You tell me to rat on my partner and I'll go free? Well, it doesn't matter that I'm innocent, I'm going to find /someone/ to rat out. Same problem as pulling someone's nails, just less extreme.
