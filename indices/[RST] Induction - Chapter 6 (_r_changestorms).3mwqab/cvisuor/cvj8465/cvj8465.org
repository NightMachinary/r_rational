Hasn't research been done that shows that intelligence gathered from torture is generally not useful? This effectively reads like a form of torture (highly descriptive and not exactly "veiled" threats that are highly believable) which, to my best understanding, generally isn't as effective in reality as it is in TV shows and movies.

I'm not sure if that's the case only for long-term threats rather than short-term threats, and I'd imagine it might be more effective on mercenaries than true believers, but I'm not overly familiar with the techniques to know all of the details of their efficacies.

I'm not certain, but I do imagine that a trained psychologist would be aware of that, especially given that she utilized rapport-building strategies when initially dealing with the kidnappers.
