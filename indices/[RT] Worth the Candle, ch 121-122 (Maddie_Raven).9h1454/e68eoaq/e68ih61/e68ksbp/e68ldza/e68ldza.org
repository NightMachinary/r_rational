  I'm telling you this because Aerb had features that were stolen from my D&D games, and all the stuff I was most scared of came from the post-Arthur era. Fel Seed, Nightsmoke, the borogoves, the mimsies

not sure if we've heard of uther encountering any of these, other than the current reveal about fel seed. certainly possible, and also possible that the DM tossed things at uther in a semi-chronological order, which would make the transition pretty obvious as well.
