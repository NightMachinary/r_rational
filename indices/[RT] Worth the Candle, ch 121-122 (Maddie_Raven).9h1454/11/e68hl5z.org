Yeah, Arthur is definitely Fel Seed.

It's interesting that the quest says, "you know his weakness."

It's definitely Arthur with the /City of a Thousand Brides/ thing. And the whole theme of lashing out even knowing that it's not rational.

Exciting! I wonder what the deal is with the throne of living flesh (brides? Bonesaw-esque?) and that Fel Seed is worse than the top 4000 hells (that's worse than almost half of hell).

Also cool seeing more expansion on characters from Joon's Earth life that were mentioned but I forgot about.
