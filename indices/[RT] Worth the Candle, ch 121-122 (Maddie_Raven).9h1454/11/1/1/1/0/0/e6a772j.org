I mean, whatever happens, Aerb is almost certainly rid of at least one of two massive threats. Sure, it'd end poorly for Joon and his party, but it'd probably be a net gain. And it's almost certainly also a preferable alternative to being captured by Fel Seed, so while it'd be a horrible first plan, it's at the very least useful as a backup.

Come to think of it, if Fel Seed is worse than the first few thousand hells, I bet his victims would deliberately invoke the Cannibal if they knew his name (... assuming they're still in a state where they're capable of speech at all, which is probably NOT a good bet), as much to guarantee their own end as anything else.
