I was thinking it's probably Arthur because it works narratively well. The old missing hero is actually the BBEG trope.

That said, the other point of this story is a new rational take on fantasy tabletop/rpg world building. In this case, it would make a lot of sense for Fel Seed to be the throne of flesh.

The weakness could be something with Arthur, especially considering that this is the game that happened right after he died, so there could be a lot of symbolism that's attached to him. I wouldn't be surprised if an Arthur got stuck in Fel Seed/the phenomena of Fel Seed in a similar way that Joon's players did during the original game, in a fit of dramatic irony.

The Fel Seed mentions in the story did reference a king of the place. There's a good possibility that it might actually be both: grey goo and Uther suborning each other, creating a new monstrosity pushing the worst bits of Arthur into the world. (Maybe a bit like Angra Mainyu in Fate.)
