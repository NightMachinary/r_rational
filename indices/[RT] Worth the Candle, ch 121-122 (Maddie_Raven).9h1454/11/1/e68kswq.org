i'm imagining that fel seed /is/ the throne of living flesh. if it's impossible to kill, even in theory, maybe some sort of grey goo/qdot self-reassembling flesh mountain. it's hard to imagine anything impossible to kill that is an actual physical entity, rather than a process that will inevitably reinforce or reconstitute itself.

any idea what his weakness is?
