  Is this Joon trying to trigger Raven's companion status? If so, then it feels a little odd that it wasn't resolved by chapters end.

Grak didn't become a companion until the second or third time they met iirc. Plus the DM seems to be giving them less information via the game layer as time goes on, so it's still possible.
