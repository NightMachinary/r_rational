Not sure if they're going to go straight to fell seed. Given that it has been consistently described as the most dangerous thing on aerb, and they have a million quests for other exclusion zones, gods, etc it would seem like the Game is very strongly hinting that its meant as a final quest type thing, and if they try it now it'll result in a short and sudden total party kill.
