How does this kind of thing keeps sneaking up on me? Bethel was, from the start, the biggest loose cannon they had. Her introduction was a horror movie and that part on her history with Arthur was visceral as all hell. She has no morals, no loyalty, no duty and has enough power to transform the party into a smear in a second. But noooo. She is a companion so we good! right?

And I was so looking forward to Raven's reaction to Juniper story, so much potential for new info. The way she was reacting to Juniper's lines tells me she is a lot more unguarded with her emotions than her age would suggest.

On the other hand, damn. That first chapter was only second to the Tiff chapter for me on the raw emotion scale. It's interesting how everyone back then was mad at him for lashing out after Arthur died and just kept assuming that was just his way to deal with it. That he would get better once it was out of his system or something, like Craig said. Yet from the outside it's so clear to me just how close to the edge Juniper was.

Juniper could really use some therapy (of the non-Valencia kind).
