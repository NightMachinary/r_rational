The [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9h1454/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_121122_maddieraven/e69e3p2/][discussion above]] talks about this.

[[/u/Sparkwitch]] had a great justification with the crises and its postponement of his depression (though the stats theory is plausible too). Also, anhedonia was a large part of Joon's depression, mostly because he was stuck in the monotonous debris of his Kansas high school life. Something as dramatic as an isekai relocation into a world literally tailored for him "cures" that, at least in the short term.

I think Joon has always seemed well-adjusted when things were going well, but he's downright dreadful at adjusting when it counts (to trauma and grief). And since that first chapter, we've mostly known Joon the DM-as-player-now dealing with in-game conflicts rather than Joon-the-freshly-grieving coping post-trauma that has started to crop up more.
