Would she accept it though? She already has her own values and seems to like it that way.

From her perspective: She cares about being a great house and having people live in her and that's all she needs. Why would she accept brainwashing that makes her care about human lives, emotions, fornicating, and that kind of stuff? And would it really be her. She can fake some values when they are important to her guests (e.g. the funeral?) and that has served her just fine for hundreds of years.
