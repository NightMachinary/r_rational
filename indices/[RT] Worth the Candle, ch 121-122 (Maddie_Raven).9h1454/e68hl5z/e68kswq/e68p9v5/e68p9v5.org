But "a big regenerating pile of flesh" and grey goo don't seem to be /impossible/ to destroy "even in theory". Grey goo is made of normal matter than can be e.g. heated up until it breaks down, and "a big regenerating pile of flesh" sounds like it should be /possible/ to beat with all the many magics and entads of Aerb, even if it sounds like a massive DPS check.
