full text of the quest, for reference:

  “If these things could be done by a single person, or even a small group, they would have been,” said Amaryllis. “Do you think the international community is so negligent that they would let Fel Seed sit on his throne in the City of a Thousand Brides if there were any option to do otherwise? It's flatly impossible to kill him, by any means, not even in theory.”

  */Quest Accepted: Gone to Seed - There is a place on Aerb considered worse than the first four thousand hells. Fel Seed sits on a throne of living flesh, unable to spread beyond his domain, but with a rule of horror within it. You know his weakness./*

  “It's a long story,” I replied. /And not that pleasant of one./ “Is he -- was he killed?”

  “Nope,” said Fenn. “Still sitting on his throne in the City of a Thousand Brides. Not sure if that particular part of your brain survived your stroke, but he's not someone we talk about in polite company.”

  I shook my head. “He was built to consume the world. If he were in the process of doing that, or if he were killed, that would make sense, but ... he's still alive, doing his ... work?”

  And at the same time, some of the exclusion zones must have logically been instigated by people who /weren't,/ for lack of a better term, player characters. Doris Finch didn't fit into the same mold that Uther and I did, nor did Fel Seed, or Manifest.

  But there had to be limits, didn't there? If you could use illusion magic to make an illusion of a bullet moving a tenth the speed of light two inches from someone's head ... well, there would be no need for any other magic at all, would there? That might give it good reason to be hit by the exclusionary principle, but no other excluded magic was that degenerate or extreme, not even the one around Fel Seed.
