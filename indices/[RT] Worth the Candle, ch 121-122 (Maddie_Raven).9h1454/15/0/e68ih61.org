Ugh. That was my kneejerk thought as well, but depending on Raven's meaning, the exclusion zone might have predated Uther's last known position. Otherwise, Uther's slow decline into depravity, alienation of lovers, and amicicide uncannily mirrors Joon's real-life deterioration of self and campaign - both culminating in Fel Seed.

I wonder what plot thread Uther saw that led him there. It would be unbelievably sad if he, near the end, became aware that he was living through Aerb's deterioration because Aerb was a parallel, synchronous embodiment of Joon's world and everything was a reflection of Joon suffering from Arthur's death.
