Chapter 121 reminded me of some of Wildbow's interludes in how one emotional gut punch of a chapter can leave you with this really strong connection to someone who was previously an unremarkable background character. The whole chapter was great but I thought the conversation via Messenger, where we see Joon's shitty headspace lead him on a series of poor decisions, was especially well done. I think Joon (the post-earth version in particular) is often judged too harshly but if he had of hit enter on that message..

  “It's mean and unfair to you, but I'd be a senior dating a freshman, and with everything else that's happened I'd probably have to accept that I'd actually hit rock bottom. If I keep my distance then at least I can say, ‘well, I didn't date Maddie'. Even if no one would ever give me credit for that, I would be able to hold onto it. And the shitty thing is, I don't even like you that much.”

..it would have been difficult to forgive him for it.

This guy...if AW ever needs to bump up that patreon number just set a 'Reimer on Aerb' omake as a stretch goal and watch the money roll in.

  She was horribly mismatched in terms of aesthetics, which was the sign of a high level character.

  <Amaryllis has some questions for Raven,> Bethel said into my head. <She is quite insistent. Are you building rapport?> “Bethel can speak into our minds, so long as we're touching her,” I said to Raven, by way of explaining why I'd gone silent. <I'm not sure. Another few seconds, a minute at most.>

Is this Joon trying to trigger Raven's companion status? /If/ so, then it feels a little odd that it wasn't resolved by chapters end.

  <You and Amaryllis think alike,> replied Bethel.

  <Two peas in a pod, you and Amaryllis,> said Bethel.

I dont want to jump to any strong conclusions on the basis of two small remarks but...All Aboard ship Joonaryllis!
