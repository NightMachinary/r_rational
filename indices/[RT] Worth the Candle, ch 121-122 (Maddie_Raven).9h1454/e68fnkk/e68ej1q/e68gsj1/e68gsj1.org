I'm so excited to see Fel Seed. This development has been foreshadowed since the very third chapter, and we're finally getting the payoff for all that setup. Of course, that excitement will probably change to horror once we find out what makes it worse than first few +hundred+ thousand hells...

Edit: Whoops, first few /thousand/ hells, it's even worse than I thought. Also, Fel Seed was first mentioned in the third chapter.
