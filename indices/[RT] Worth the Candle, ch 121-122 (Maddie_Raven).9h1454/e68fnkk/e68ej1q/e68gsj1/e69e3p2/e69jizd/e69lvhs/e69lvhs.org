Stats is actually a really interesting answer that I hadn't considered. Does that cheapen any character growth if it comes due to external modifications to his thought process? If the story ends in some kind of victory for Joon, earned due to his growth, a-la literary tradition, is it /really/ earned if it came because he put 100 points into "Wisdom" or whatever? Hmm.

I kind of want to write a story to explore that now.
