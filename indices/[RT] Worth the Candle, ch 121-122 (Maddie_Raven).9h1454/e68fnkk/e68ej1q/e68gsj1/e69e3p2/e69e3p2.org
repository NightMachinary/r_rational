I know I begged for an end to the Amaryllis-centric arcs and more of a focus on Joon since it felt like the story was kind of idling for a while there. But man, it is hard to read through chapter after chapter of super-accurate portrayal of a depressed teenager who made tons of shitty decisions and is now haunted by a game world that seems designed to put each one of them back in his face.

Other than the negative overall emotional angle lately, my one real complaint re: characterization is that I don't really feel like Joon's early story character matches the character he is now portrayed as having, before coming to Aerb. Time and again we get flashes of a guy who was withdrawn, selfish, suicidally depressed, kind of a user and a mastermind. His natural reaction to trauma was to be a big piece of shit to everyone. That doesn't /really/ jibe with my memories of the early chapters of this story, where he was a much more generic video game self-insert protag. I'm not saying the two can't be reconciled, or that I would have /enjoyed/ reading 100 chapters of Thomas Covenant, Jr. But I do feel like his emotional growth in this story started from a place that was much better than the one being described in the recent flashbacks. I don't know that the guy who'd sleep with an emotionally handicapped 15 year old, knowing it was wrong, is the kind of person who becomes the more mature, "Trying" Joon who we have seen recently. Especially not in the span of what... a year and a half? Of constant emotional trauma?

I really want a reason to root for Joon. I've spent most of my life struggling with depression, and god knows I've made stupid, stupid relationship mistakes. Originally I was on his side because his loyalty to his friend was kind of redeeming, and I appreciated the creativity and insight of his world building, and boy it'd be nice to think that we can grow beyond our past self. But then it turned out that his friend was kind of a misogynist shit heel and Joon had never noticed, and the relationship and subsequent shittyness to Tiff was revealed, and then the whole Fenn relationship fuck up happened, and more and more the game seems to be turning into "Eternal Fantasy Past-Sin Punishment Land" where every time he experiences a moment of growth we're introduced to some still uncoped-with awful thing that he'd done. It's retroactively making him very difficult to cheer for. I'm kind of expecting him to overcome this Raven/Maddie stuff only to learn in the next chapter that he committed securities fraud, or something.
