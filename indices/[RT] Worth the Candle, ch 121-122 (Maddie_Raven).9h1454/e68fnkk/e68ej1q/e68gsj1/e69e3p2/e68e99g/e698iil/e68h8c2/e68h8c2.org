Oof. The first chapter was a bit of a gut punch thanks to personal experiences. I felt embarrassed for Joon by way of my constant, low-level background embarrassment for my past self.

The second chapter felt fairly short, but that could just be my insatiable desire for more of this story. It's starting to feel like our heroes won't actually go to the Library, just get the full picture secondhand from Raven. Which is unfortunate because magic libraries are my absolute favorite part of the fantasy genre and I was deeply excited for CRJ/AW's take on the trope.
