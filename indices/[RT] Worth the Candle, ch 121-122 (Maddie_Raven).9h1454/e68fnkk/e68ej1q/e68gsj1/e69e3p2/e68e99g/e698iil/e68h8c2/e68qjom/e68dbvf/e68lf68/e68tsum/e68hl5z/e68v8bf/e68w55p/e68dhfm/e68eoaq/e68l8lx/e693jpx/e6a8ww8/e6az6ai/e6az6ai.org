Most interesting is "Fel Seeding":

FEL is free electron laser. FEL seeding is initiating FEL with normal laser in resonance process. Now, why it's relevant? It is [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php#challengexfel][speculated that Free Electron Laser could be most destructive weapon of the future space wars]]. It's tunable nature allow using diffraction focusing system produce continuous X-ray beam, with combat range measured in /light days/

PS Most nonsensical Fel Seed (WTC) weakness would be to build X-ray laser in Blue Fields exclusion zone (Nuke-pumped would be more easy then really powerful FEL) and shoot into Fel Seed (WTC) city /straight through earth curvature/.
