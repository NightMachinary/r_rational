hmm...maybe his soul just gets immediately bounced from the hells every time people send him there? but there would have to be some reason why people couldn't extract and contain/destroy his soul like they can others'.

maybe the soul/seed can't be contained. instead it jumps from vessel to vessel.

still seems like firebombing the entire exclusion zone would solve the problem.
