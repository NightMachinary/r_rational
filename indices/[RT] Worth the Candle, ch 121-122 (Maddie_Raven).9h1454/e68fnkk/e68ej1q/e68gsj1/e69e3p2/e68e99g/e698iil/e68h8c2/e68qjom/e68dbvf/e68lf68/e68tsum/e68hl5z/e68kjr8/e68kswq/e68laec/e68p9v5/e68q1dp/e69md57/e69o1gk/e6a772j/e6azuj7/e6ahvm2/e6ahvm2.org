Ooh, I like this plan if combined with the "Arthur is Fel Seed" theory.

Speaking or writing the Cannibal's name summons him, but I bet Joon could write a set of descriptors that someone else from Earth could recognize without using the name itself. Send in a disposable minion (not necessarily a sapient one. Heck, an arrow with a letter tied to it would work) with instructions to speak the name the note calls to mind.

Arthur is either tired of being Fel Seed and speaks it willingly, doesn't know about the Cannibal and does so out of curiosity, or is sufficiently confused and does so out of that. Fel Seed dead + Cannibal trapped in a handy, suddenly-empty exclusion zone or Cannibal no longer a threat + Fel Seed remains status quo. Really a win-win scenario and the only reason no one's tried it before is that it relies entirely on Fel Seed having out of context knowledge they shouldn't have.
