ch. 121

#+begin_quote
  and then you just wanted to see how much worse you could make, didn't you,
#+end_quote

make -> make it

Also not really a typo but I was a little thrown off by a sentence and thought it could be changed slightly:

#+begin_quote
  I closed my eyes and let out a shuddering breath, and didn't open them again until Reimer and Tom came in the door together.
#+end_quote

Could be:

#+begin_quote
  I let out a shuddering breath, closed my eyes, and didn't open them again until Reimer and Tom came in the door together.
#+end_quote

Not a big deal though.
