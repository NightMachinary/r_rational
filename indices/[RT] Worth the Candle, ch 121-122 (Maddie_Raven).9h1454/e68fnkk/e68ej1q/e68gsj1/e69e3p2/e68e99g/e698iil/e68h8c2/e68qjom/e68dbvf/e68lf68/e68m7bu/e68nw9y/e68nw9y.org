Yeah, no, he's not a /great/ moral center, but he's the only one that causes the others to stop and consider the morality of their plans or actions. Maybe it's more that he instinctively feels offended or upset when the "NPCs" dare to act in a way he finds objectionable, and uses his leverage as a proto-God to force them to justify themselves to him, but he does also allow himself to be held accountable to them (though also to a lesser degree, now that I'm reflecting on it).

Actually, going through them one by one, Amaryllis basically just puts up with Joon on the premise that he'll be a useful proto-God shortly, Grak hovers between contempt and pity of Joon's immaturity, Solace has basically zero regard for Joon's viewpoint, and even Valencia only cares about Joon's opinion in a very utilitarian, "please don't hate me and abandon me" way. Bethal... well, Bethal is Bethal.

Fenn is the only one who tried to respond to Joon's viewpoint and only in the natural way people do in a relationship.

Maybe moral center wasn't the right word, as much as it is that Joon's moral compass seems most aligned with my own, so he's the only one I really give moral credence to, wheras when the others have an opinion on the morality of a situation, I reflexively mark that as "not-my-values" so it doesn't register as moral information.
