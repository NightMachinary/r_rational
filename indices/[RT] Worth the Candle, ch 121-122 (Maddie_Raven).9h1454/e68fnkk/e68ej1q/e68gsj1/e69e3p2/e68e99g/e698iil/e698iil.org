Probably obvious, but nice parallels between Joon's self justifications in the Maddie chapter (in a bad place, etc) and the ones he suspects that Arthur would give to Bethel.

Also, its interesting that Raven apparently didn't know who they were when she arrived, but was working in her own capacity for the Library. Could lead to awkward/interesting conversations when they tell her what happened with her father, and the fight with the others. Unless of course, that was another layer of ruse, or some sort of test of how much they knew and their abilities.

Also, Random thought that occurred to me when rereading the early parts of the book recently: Does Solace count as Amarylis's daughter for the purposes of the various inherited entads? If so is she now next in line if Amarylsis dies? Thats a pretty big deal politically for Anglecyn, especially as she's an immortal druid.
