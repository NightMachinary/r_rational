yeah, i was thinking that the reconsolidating fleshy process would have to be something that continued to work even if all the physical matter were broken down, destroyed, transported out of the exclusion zone, etc. somehow...with magic! (edit: actually, we have people being recompiled from soul-source after corruption so the magic for reconstituting things is partway there.)

got any other ideas for what sort of flesh-proximate entity Amaryllis might consider impossible to kill (in theory)?

maybe a hydra-type, kill one body and two more manifest.

it could be just a little facetious, in that it's not technically alive. but to me she seemed to use the word "kill" as in "destroy."
