I haven't commented in a while, and given how much I've grown to love this story, it's time to rectify this!

I've recently re-read most of the story and pitched it to some of my friends, it's really something else. I immediately loved both the grimdark setting and D&D flashbacks, as well as the incredible shifts in tone, setting and atmosphere. And of course, most of the characters so far have felt real and memorable and I've grown attached to some of them. Especially Fenn.. (Although interestingly I didn't like her and Juniper as a couple too much)

I'll be honest: I actually stopped reading the story for a while around the middle of the Fallahtehr arc. The rampant paranoia and second-guessing was making it a stressful reading experience. After a few months I got back to it and after getting through the essentialism arc, it didn't take long for me to fall back to being in love with the story. I am often appalled at the party's actions and full rationalist murder-hobo mindset, which makes it hard to root for them sometimes, but I guess that's part of the appeal of this setting. There are so many hints of more to come and I have a twisted sense of anticipation to find out about the worse exclusion zones and existential risks that Aerb is facing.

As for today's chapters, I appreciated them for cementing Joon's status as definitely not a gary stu isekai protag! He and Arthur are such interesting characters, although I must say that if I had to choose one to hang out with I'd definitely go for Arthur. Raven wasn't terribly interesting but perhaps that's the point, she has a pretty generic fantasy vibe to her.

Guess that's enough of my disconnected thoughts for now! Thank you so much for writing this and I can't wait for more!
