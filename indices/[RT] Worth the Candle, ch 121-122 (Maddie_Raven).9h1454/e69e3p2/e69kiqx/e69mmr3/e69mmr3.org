The problem I'm having from a narrative standpoint is that each time I go "Yeah, grow up a bit! Good on you" it turns out that oh wait here's this /other/ stupid thing he did that he's been compartmentalizing this whole time.

If this weren't serial fiction and I was the publisher, I'd say "Go back and move some of this earlier in the story so the reader doesn't get so blindsided by hurdles that the protagonist knew about." Obviously that's not possible here. But without knowing the full scope of the story, the character's arc becomes very frustrating.
