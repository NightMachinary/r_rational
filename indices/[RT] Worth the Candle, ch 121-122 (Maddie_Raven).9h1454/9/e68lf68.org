I think Firefly was the last time any piece of fiction had characters that genuinely felt like real people shaped by their prior experiences to me.

Weirdly, that means it's almost hard for me to connect the Joon of the current day with the flashback around Maddie since Joon today is the de facto moral center of the group and driven almost compulsively to try and support the other group members through their emotional difficulties. It also means it genuinely hurts to uncover this part of his backstory.

I think it's somewhat easier to swallow the idea that Joon was left terribly wounded and vulnerable after Arthur's death, and that he lashed out and pushed away everyone else who wasn't as strongly affected by it. When we find out that he turned to taking advantage of another, younger, perhaps more vulnerable person to try and buoy himself, and that he probably left her worse off for having been with him... that's just a gut punch.

Also, I'm super apprehensive about Fel Seed since my hype levels have built up to the point where we're looking at Lovecraftian levels of "the party is fucked", and yet somehow I get the feeling it's gonna be somehow /worse/ than that.
