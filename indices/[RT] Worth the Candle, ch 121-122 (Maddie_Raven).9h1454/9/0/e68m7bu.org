I think Joon is pretty far from the moral center. He consistently forgets to treat the other characters as meaningful individuals, and then remembers to build rapport and support them in order to increase their Loyalty. He acknowledges and owns up to his flaws in this vein, which is important. But it sounds like he was doing that with the underage Maddie as well.
