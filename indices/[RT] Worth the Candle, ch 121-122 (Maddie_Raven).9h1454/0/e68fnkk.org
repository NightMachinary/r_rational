This was remarkably hard to read.

Not in a bad way, to be clear-- these chapters were well-written, and defined more than one new character remarkably quickly. But that first chapter just... hurt to read, really. I felt ashamed on Joon's behalf just going through it, to the point that I had to skim some parts just to keep going.

The mark of good writing is that it can make you feel something, I guess.
