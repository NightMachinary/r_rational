Solace probably doesn't count since changing the family tree part of the soul is excluded and the DM probably wouldn't allow someone to get around an exclusion my recreating the same effect in a more round about way.

  Thats a pretty big deal politically for Anglecyn, especially as she's an immortal druid.

I wouldn't be surprised if Anglecyn already has a way to deal with this, otherwise someone would have thought to kidnap a royal bastard and keep them in stasis for a few centuries (entads with this effect were mentioned to exist, they are necessary for the creation of revision mages) in order to steal a sizeable chunk of Anglecyn's entads.

In a previous thread someone wondered whether Amaryllis is Dahlia who has been repeatedly wound back to a very young age. This seems plausible since it both explains why Anglecyn still has the primary claim to Uther's entads, Amaryllis looks like Dahlia and the Anglecyn princes still show a strong family resemblance after 500 years (They keep marrying Dahlia to 'refresh' their lines inheritance status to avoid losing magic to bastards)
