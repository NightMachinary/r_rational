I think both in and out of universe people have been ignoring her issues a lot since the time chamber and birth. They have pretty much assumed that she's all better now after centuries of killing and torturing people.

Even if we ignore her rather traumatic history, she's still a fundamentally non-human (or whatever the correct term on aerb would be) intelligence, with very different desires and goals. Like how she was more concerned with acting like "A House" than with Fenn's death.
