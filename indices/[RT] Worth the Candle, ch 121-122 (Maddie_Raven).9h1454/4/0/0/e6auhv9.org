  Even if we ignore her rather traumatic history, she's still a fundamentally non-human (or whatever the correct term on aerb would be) intelligence

i think the concept of another being having a totally different way of thinking is more common on Aerb than Earth. That's actually a pretty common theme in WtC, with the stuff about elves and dwarves and Grak's college buddies, etc. her being an alien intelligence is just kinda like...yeah, everyone's different, yaknow?

I will say that I think Mary has shown a particular lack of understanding for her alien-ness, though.
