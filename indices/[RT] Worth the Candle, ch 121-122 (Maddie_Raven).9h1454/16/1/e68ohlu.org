Some disgusting land of rape and evil just to be edgy and turn off Juniper's real life friends during his bad phase. "City of a Thousand Brides" is kind of a hint how it works in this world.

Probably a turned-up-to-eleven/Warhammer 40k version of Sodom and Gomorrah, except it spreads to consume the world.
