In my mind, the (cheap) answer is stats. He's upping his mental and social a bit and those matter, in much the same way that upping his physical stats has changed his appearance and made him more capable in those spheres.

Also, the first fourteen chapters or so (book one, the "tutorial") he was literally falling from life-or-death crisis to life-or-death crisis. Depression is an affliction that saps time and energy for its dark purposes, so it's genuinely hard to just be depressed when you don't have either. Once he survives the early trials and things slow down enough to allow time for reflection (a few /dozen/ chapters later) he really does start asking questions and sounding more like the conflicted, immature young man he is.

But, again, by that point: stats.
