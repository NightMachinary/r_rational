I would agree with you if these revelations about Joon's character were unrelated to each other.

But this revelation about Joon's 'relationship' solidly falls into "Shit I did because I couldn't cope with Arthur's death", along with beating up that kid and everything else we've read about so far, which Joon very explicitly glossed over or ignored until he was confronted with it. Everything we've seen with Joon's character development in these past few chapters has been heavily foreshadowed since the first arc's end.

And since Joon's primary main objective in the first arc was survival, I'm ok with his character development and pace.

I expect more of these sorts of chapters when Joon inevitably meets other player-based characters (Reimer, Arthur, maybe another Tiff if we're doubling up.) Not that I /want/ it, just that I expect it.
