I'm a fan of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]], not because I think it's explicitly accurate but because I believe there is a priority to what a person is. And my pet theory is that you can't really express yourself as the same person on each level.

- Self-Actualization (Last, Top) "I am what I can be and I am content with what I am"

- Self-Expression / Self-Reflection Loop "What I want to be vs. What I can be"

- Survival (First, Bottom) "I won't have the luxury of expressing myself if I'm a corpse!"

When we met Joon, he was being dropped from a plane into Zombie-land. That's the base of the pyramid, a person whose goal is survival. He wasn't selfless, he didn't save the woman who dropped near him. He wasn't virtuous, he killed his enemies. He wasn't evil, he cooperated and acted fairly towards people who were not openly hostile. At his core, Joon is not an objectively bad person.

Then, as Joon gains companions and makes a home for himself, we move up the pyramid and start to see Joon express his ideal self, at least up until the Masters incident. He was rational, logical, ruthless but not too ruthless, moral, and as good of a friend as he thought he could be. There was no self-reflection beyond Joon remarking on himself being shitty in his old world; he was a broken person and oblivious about it. Then when Fenn broke up with him, he found out that his ideal self doesn't mesh with the greater world, and his self-image cracks to better match who he actually is.

So we end up here, at chapter 118 ~ 121, with Joon reflecting on who he is. Turns out the foreshadowing was right, he was a pretty shitty person. But that doesn't mean that he can't be more. He has to reconcile that with himself, not ignore it.

So tl;dr I'm not rooting for Joon either, he's a shitty dude. I'm rooting for who he could be. A person can be something greater than they are. Or not. Because at the tippy-top of that pyramid is self-transcendence, but you have to reach for it.
