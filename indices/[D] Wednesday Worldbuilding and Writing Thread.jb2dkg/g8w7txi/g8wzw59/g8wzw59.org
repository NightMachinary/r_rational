Especially if the powers granted tend to be street-level, there may not be very large societal shifts in the first few generations, since the superpowers themselves only represent one form of wealth/privilege/power, which doesn't necessarily represent a qualitatively different form of inequality than say, food insecurity or lack of educational opportunity.

I'd expect bigger divergences from the sorts of societies we've seen in our version of reality to crop up over time, as people have time to develop techniques and institutions that extract value from these powers, but what is expect to see depends a lot on what constraints there are on the functioning of the powers.
