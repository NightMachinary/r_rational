Given that the corporate country is basically giving powers to the lowest of the low (company owned and raised experiments) while the aristocractic country is trying to reserve these powers for the upper crust, I expect there to be sharp class divides in terms of which powers are 'proper' to give to a young aristocrat. Specifically, anything which ends up in common use by factory workers will end up being declared too low-class for a noble to use or admit to possessing. I can imagine the animal blood variation being popular among the nobility, for example, with more prestigious animals or animals associated with one's traditional heraldry being a mark of special distinction.

After a few generations though, the middle class in the aristocratic nation are going to start agitating to have whatever economically important applications end up getting discovered rolled out among the working class, in order to successfully compete. That's probably the origins of your lottery right there - a family with a child on the way can apply to a company to have their child augmented, in exchange for a guaranteed place with the company and a large debt that needs paid off. There would probably be some pretense of this being non-exploitative, but only the pretense.

Conversely, I expect a decided lack of (visible) augmentation by the ruling class in the corporatist society, as being augmented would generally be connoted with either slavery or loyalty to a foreign power - not the sorts of things you'd want to display if you want a high corporate posting or a military rank. Instead, it would be the middle ranks who would go in for voluntary augmentation, wanting something that will cancel out any power-based intimidation tactics that their exploited underlings might try.
