This seems like it would solidify the power of the current ruling class even more, in direct opposition to your proposal of a lottery for powers. Backing social and political power up with literal superpowers means that violent revolts are extremely unlikely to work. Especially if there aren't guns in your setting, a noble house could treat the majority of the population like absolute garbage and never have to fear any form of uprising. A small group of superpowered guards would make a noble house impregnable to assault from anything less than an opposing army.

If you want to go for something mildly more egalitarian, mothers could pay some fee to give their children economically useful powers in the hopes that the child can raise the family up from their current social status. But this would be incompatible with entrenched noble houses, because it would be giving non-nobles the tools that the nobles use to solidify their power. Pretty similar situation for the authoritarian country, where the powers would only be available to the rich and powerful.

The military applications are pretty obvious, so in a generation or two you would have military families with favored abilities and techniques passed down to their children. Partial transformation into an animal seems pretty weak, but a handful of sailors with hydrokinesis would do quite a lot for a warship.
