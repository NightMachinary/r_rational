I'm attempting an industrial revolution-era alt-universe work wherein pregnant mothers can consume a kind of plant which depending on method of consumption, can grant an array of different abilities (so far things like mixed with water grants a form of hydrokinesis, blood of an animal allows partial transformation into that animal, and a few others - street level abilities, mainly).

The plant only grows on an island chain that has recently been discovered by two different countries - one is aristocratic in nature, with nobility having essentially all the power, and a weakened royal family, the other is authoritarian in nature but strongly influenced by a wealthy corporation.

So far, the idea is that the aristocratic country secured a source of the plant first, but it has been seized by a few different noble families, who are now keeping it strictly under their control. A few black market cuttings have been sold, but it is largely being used to grant the next generation of nobility superpowers.

In the authoritarian country, the plant has been controlled even more strictly, and is cultivated only by the wealthy corporation, who is carrying out extensive testing on the plant's capabilities.

Assuming that both countries manage to keep control of the plant, if not news of its existence, what would be some expected societal changes in the following generations? Jealousy/fear of this new superpowered ruling class? General uproar over a lack of public availability? I was thinking of some kind of 'lottery' system where they would permit a few 'peasants' the chance to give their child superpowers and a better life, adoption into that noble family perhaps?
