I stopped reading after a few chapters. "HPMOR!Hermoine deals with canon HP" is an interesting idea. "Worm/HP crossover" is an interesting idea. Trying to do both those things at once? Feels like a giant, mishmashy clusterfuck that starts to resemble an original fiction with a paint job more than anything else.

Edit to add: The above aside, the actual quality of the writing is high. I would have kept reading if the ideas being elaborated on had been to my taste.
