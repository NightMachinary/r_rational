  NO ALTERING WITH THE TIMELINE BULLSHIT WE ARE NOT DOING THAT

Suit yourself. I /love/ timeline bullshit, personally. It just makes me smile.

  Anyway, there's still the problem of who Hermione talks to, aside from the diary Horcrux. Speaking to canon!firstyear!Harry would probably be torture. Not to mention dealing with Draco and her PTSD over that stuff. Maybe she hangs out with Blaise Zabini all day. Actually, that could work.

It depends, I think. If Hermoine has a chance to understand that canon!Harry is /not/ Methods!Harry, then she could probably cope. It would give her a chance for a bizarre inverse-mentor situation. Although Hermoine would have less to work with than Methods!Harry ever did. Trying to teach canon characters even a tiny portion of what she's learned would be... an undertaking. You're right about her Draco problems, though. Shit's harsh.

Aside from Blaise, she would be in a unique position to talk to other professors and Dumbledore on a more equal level. Especially if at least some of them are made aware of her origins. Methods!Harry was similarly privileged with the ability to force his professors to treat him as an equal, and this fic idea would give Hermoine the opportunity and incentive for the same.

  The plot is harder. If she's not hanging out with Harry, then she doesn't know about his scar hurting when he sees Quirrell. She has no reason to think a first-year, even a smart first-year could have anything to contribute to the magical defenses devised by a number of smart and powerful Hogwarts teachers, not to mention Dumbledore himself.

I'd be in favor of completely derailing the plot right off the bat. Force her into higher stakes interactions with Dumbledore and Snape, give her glimpses of the plots behind the plots, as it were. She's powerful, she's smart, and her recent traumatic experiences gave her some help developing a real ~killer's intent~, so she could probably do all sorts of interesting things to the setting.

The other interesting question is when she arrives. The obvious, default answer is that she ends up at the same point in time that she left, but considering this is blatant universe-hopping bullshit to start with, she can justifiably arrive anywhen. And if she arrives at the start of the school year, before the sorting, that creates lots of new opportunities for her to establish herself as an interesting person. And it negates some of the problems relating to spontaneous bodysnatching.
