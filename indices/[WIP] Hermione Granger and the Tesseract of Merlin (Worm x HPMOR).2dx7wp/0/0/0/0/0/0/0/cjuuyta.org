I don't really know. I guess I'd say "reality" and go from there. Some wacky magical force kicked Hermoine out of her death throes and into an alternate reality that may or may not be some kind of really long, complicated delusion she's having as she bleeds out. In her shoes, my number one priority would be verifying my sanity and my situation before anything else.

And assuming Hermoine manages to verify to a reasonable degree that she's not crazy, she could easily embark on a few basic optimization quests. Within Hogwarts specifically, there's a Philosopher's Stone that can grant something resembling immortality, as well as a chamber of secrets and the Room of Requirement. Along with all the other completely broken parts of magical canon, especially magical oaths.

I'd focus less on creating a single, central antagonist and more on presenting the whole of the magical world as a problem to be solved, with her end goal being to return home having done as much good as possible in the meantime. Less of an RPG and more of a puzzle game, I guess.
