NO ALTERING WITH THE TIMELINE BULLSHIT WE ARE NOT DOING THAT

Anyway, there's still the problem of who Hermione talks to, aside from the diary Horcrux. Speaking to canon!firstyear!Harry would probably be torture. Not to mention dealing with Draco and her PTSD over that stuff. Maybe she hangs out with Blaise Zabini all day. Actually, that could work.

The plot is harder. If she's not hanging out with Harry, then she doesn't know about his scar hurting when he sees Quirrell. She has no reason to think a first-year, even a smart first-year could have anything to contribute to the magical defenses devised by a number of smart and powerful Hogwarts teachers, not to mention Dumbledore himself.

So maybe skip the plot and have it be more about the characters, Hermione overcoming her trauma and coming to appreciate the Methodsverse in new light, something like that. Strong enough characters, Hermione's inner turmoil, and a plethora of in-jokes could probably sustain a lack of plot. /HP and the Sorcerer's Stone/ was mostly about Harry interacting with Hogwarts, not his battle with Quirrell.
