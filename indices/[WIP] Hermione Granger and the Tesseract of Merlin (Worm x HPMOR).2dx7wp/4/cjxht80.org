An interesting premise, definitely. Worm references are nifty.

At the same time, the Hogwarts scenes left a very bad aftertaste. They felt rushed, like the author was trying to get them out of the way so that Hermione could go hang out with the Cool Kids.

There are also bits there where Hermione comes off as not-as-smart-as-she-is-purported-to-be: she doesn't notice where she is sleeping and her uniform colors; when she starts noticing that everything is different, she continues assuming that everything else is still the same, and she keeps getting surprised by new divergences. That would be plausible if all the revelations came over the course of an hour, but they come over the course of several days. At no point does she actually try to investigate what's going on.

Her interactions with other characters at Hogwarts wound up feeling kind of bashy towards them, as if intended to draw attention to how superior everybody in MORverse is. (They are, in fact, superior, but it still reads as bashy to draw attention to that.) I did like how Harry finally blew up at her. (Generally, having the protagonist not win all social confrontations is good.)

And, then, she runs off, and nobody stops her? Also, why doesn't her casting warming charms trip the Trace?
