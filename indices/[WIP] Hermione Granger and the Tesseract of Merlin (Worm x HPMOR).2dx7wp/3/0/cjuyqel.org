  She definitely ought to have taken 5 minutes to give preemptive orders to Dragon. Stuff like: "Priority one: don't let me die or be disabled or mind affected, priority two don't let anyone else get the tesseract" really isn't difficult to plan ahead for.

That was the original plan, but I was tired while writing it and just moved ahead to the fight. But I think it would be better the original way it because it puts the focus on the interaction between Hermione and Dragon, which is more important, so I might change it....
