To be honest, I think that was a good call. The power creep in Worm is less a "creep" and more a "giant galloping stampede." I really enjoyed the story when it was about people--even enormously overpowered people--but eventually it was just about gods, and that gets boring fast. Basically, stories with gods as the antagonist boil down to "zomg, they are huge and powerful and kill everyone and we are totally helpless up until we defeat them because we are tricky and awesome!" And that bugs me because the fact is /people can't realistically win against gods/. It requires the gods to carry the idiot ball in order to lose, and that does not a satisfying storyline make.

But, yes, I'm sure that YMMV on this one.
