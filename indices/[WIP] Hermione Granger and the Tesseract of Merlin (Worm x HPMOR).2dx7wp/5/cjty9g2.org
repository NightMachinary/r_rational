Remember when this subreddit was about fiction? Anyway, Hermione died lol and ended up in sort-of-Canonwarts. Then she gets the hell out because the Sunshine General does not do that work for nobody. Then I fuck canon to pieces. Then /Worm/ happens, sort of.

Basically, Hermione gets Heberted. You got a problem with that?
