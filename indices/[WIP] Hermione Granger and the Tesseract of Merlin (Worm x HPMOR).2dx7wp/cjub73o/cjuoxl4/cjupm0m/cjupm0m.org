I think it depends a lot on how you handle the transition. If she's dumped directly into canon, it creates a serious depression problem. Especially if it happens when she dies in Methods.

If I were doing it, I would probably take advantage of the post-death train station quasi-afterlife to serve as a transition. Not sure who or what would meet her there to serve as a situation prepper. Possibly have her intrude on Harry and Dumbledore's canonical 7th book meeting, and call the train station outside of linear time? It would be amusing to see 7th year Harry and dead!Dumbledore try and capitalize on a chance to alter the timeline once they realize Hermoine is headed towards her first year. And that would give Hermoine a chance for an off-screen debriefing of her canonical situation. The result would provide a greater chance for Hermoine to be motivated and engaged, without being too lost in all the changes.

Of course, you can moderate the level of prep/info she gets by altering how paranoid Dumbledore is about time paradoxes, and how determined Harry is to change the timeline.

That spectrum of pre-insertion preparation creates a neat corresponding spectrum of possible fics, too. Hermoine given heavy prep by Dumbledore and Harry would be ridiculously powerful in her first year, and able to capitalize on pretty much ever exploitable element of canon with hilarious ease. that results in more of a lighthearted power fantasy, with the central conflict probably arising from Hermoine's Harry-enhanced moral system conflicting with other characters', plus her desire to find a magic that would let her push back into the Methodsverse somehow.

On the other hand, a sufficiently underinformed Hermoine is forced to play a game of subterfuge and infiltration, as she tries to take steps to use the ambiguous (and partially unintentional) hints from Harry and Dumbledore to cope with the challenges of blending into a new, more overtly nonsensical universe and avoid getting caught as a bodythief (which she presumably is, if she just gets dumped into canon Hermoine's body and overrides her brain).

Although, with all that said, I think it would be interesting to make the background workings of the canon universe more closely resemble the Methods setup, just to give Hermoine a chance to encounter and solve some of the problems her Harry has already dealt with. But I'm really just saying that because I dearly want her to solve the problem of the Patronus 2.0. She deserves to understand what it really is.
