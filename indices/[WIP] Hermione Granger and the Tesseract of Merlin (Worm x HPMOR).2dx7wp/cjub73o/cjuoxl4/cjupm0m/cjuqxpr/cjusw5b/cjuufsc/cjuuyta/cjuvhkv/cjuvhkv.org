It's just not obvious to me how to get a plot out of that. What you're describing is basically what HJPEV sets out to do, but in HPMOR Quirrell drives the plot, introducing the armies, the trip to Azkaban, committing murders and so on. Something like that would have to be done for Hermione, and then it feels like HPMOR but with a chick.
