This is intriguing, and I'm looking forward to more. Frankly I wish there was more at Hogwarts. The 'rational Hermione infiltrates canon hogwarts' has a lot of potential.

So far the worm stuff seems more like head nods than an actual crossover. That's fine, and makes more sense, but it does make the Worm tag a little confusing. I was expecting scion, protectorate, parahuman powers, etc.

The Tesseract and other artifacts are interesting, and seem to fulfill the role of parahuman powers in worm. I'm kinda surprised Gilderoy let Hermione take his artifact.

She definitely ought to have taken 5 minutes to give preemptive orders to Dragon. Stuff like: "Priority one: don't let me die or be disabled or mind affected, priority two don't let anyone else get the tesseract" really isn't difficult to plan ahead for. Maybe if there was an actual time limit on the Vance attack so she was in a rush? Or something previously unknown about the Tesseract that invalidates her previous orders. Say, if it fails at one command, all others in that chain are invalidated too. So when her "don't let me get hurt" command is failed because of the knife, all her other protective commands are also disabled. Similarly I'm having difficulty imagining /Hermione/ leaving Hogwarts without food and equipment.
