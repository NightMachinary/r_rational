I agree. Rachel's whole "plan" was kinda a let down for me.

In the end I wasn't agreeing with Rachel. The way I saw it, Rachel went into this military mind set where things she says are right because the situation is not luxurious enough to argue about who is actually right and shes higher on the chain of command. This would be just like when she was fighting in Abstract War.

Incidentally, in Abstract War, Rachel understood why she should step down when all was said and done and maybe, at the end, Rachel even agrees with Laura but again is stuck in a shitty situation where there's nothing she can do to immediately take responsibility.

... Not that any of that justifies saving the 6 astronauts.
