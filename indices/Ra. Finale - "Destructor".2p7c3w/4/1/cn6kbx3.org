  Both factions too bloody-minded to put some light-cone between them before things blew up?

Yeah, this. I remember one of the comments in the chapter where Nat are in the whole history simulation which points this out: How are all the actuals dead? Did none of them leave the solar system?\\
Anyway, the ship that King's group left to was already in transit by the end so someone figured that was a good idea.

My big concern is if this is really the end. Why won't the virtuals expand beyond sol? One Dyson Swarm is good but think of how good two would be. There is a com lag but why would the virtuals care? It seems like Ra's only interest is giving the virtuals whatever they want and its just convenient that the virtuals don't actually care how they get it.
