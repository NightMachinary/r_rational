The story is a tragedy, in a lot of ways. The hubris of King's band of Actuals in their attempt at creating a world that they could run. The hubris of Laura Ferno in thinking that she was important, and so could break whatever rules she wanted.

I don't know. I think that what you might have /wanted/ was some moment of awesomeness where the protagonists thoroughly whooped Ra and saved the world, ushering in a new golden era for humankind. But I also feel like that would have undercut the bulk of the story. It's still a much happier ending than it might have been - Earth is gone, but humanity as a whole isn't wiped out, and King's Actuals even got their comeuppance.

In a way, I guess I would describe the ending as "bittersweet".
