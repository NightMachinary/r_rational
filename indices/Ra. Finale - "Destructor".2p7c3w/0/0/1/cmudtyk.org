I'm not sure the comeuppance was deserved. Or that I wanted it to happen. And after the buildup to 'OK, we'll get the Bridge, this might not work but there's a chance' and the payoff is... running away? Really slowly?

It's not that it doesn't follow, it's that it isn't much of a conclusion. It's like a horror movie in reverse; instead of a few survivors making it out and resting easily that they killed the monster, only to have you see a stinger of the monster waking up, it's everything anyone cared about being destroyed, with a bit of 'they're not necessarily dead!'

Basically, this felt like a massive downer ending quickly brushed past followed by a rushed epilogue. And after months of wait and years(?) of buildup, it felt /bland/. Like if you'd split Metropolitan Man's finale scene (the appointment with Luthor) into a separate chapter, had taken a very long time to put it out, skipped most of the conversation and the backup plan, left the resolution ambiguous, and then cut to Floyd. It wouldn't be out of character for anyone or inappropriate to the story, but it also wouldn't be satisfying at all.

EDIT: Quoting a few totally different commenters on the story page itself,:

Well, not forever, but it feels like it.

  /JJJS:/ It's clear from Sam's recent comments, both here and on Twitter, that he was no longer enjoying writing Ra (in no small part because of the recent influx of commenters), and this ending reads as if someone else read the story and finished it in the easiest, most obvious way possible. Ra was better off unfinished.

Agree heavily; this does not feel like someone trying to write the right ending, it feels like someone trying to write /any/ ending.

  /blastron:/ I'm not going to deny that this is basically the only logical conclusion: the existence of a refugee ship fleeing the Solar System is the smallest possible ass-pull I can think of that would allow anything close to something someone might call a "victory". I am disappointed, however, that a story that started out as an exploration of a modern world with scientific magic (and the conspiracies behind it) rather abruptly turned into a war story about a rampant god-AI, and was then led down a path to which this ending was the only logical conclusion.

It popped up a level from the interesting hook, and never returned to its roots, or even nodded at them.
