  The hubris of Laura Ferno in thinking that she was important, and so could break whatever rules she wanted.
#+end_quote

If Rachel was actually rational, there would have been some additional plan behind saving the astronauts. I think Laura was perfectly justified in think there was some special plan. 6 lives should not have been a good reason for her to blow her cover. The fact that it was just an impulse decision on Rachel's part makes me hate Rachel. Laura's thinking would have been correct if Rachel had actually planned things and acted in a utilitarian manner instead of whatever bullshit deontological ethics she lived by.

How about the six billion other lives that you've trapped into a per-post-scarcity hell?
