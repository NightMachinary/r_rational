I must admit, I was /expecting/ them to upload humanity and run away. (Not precisely in that manner, it was just the only way out.)

But I was expecting it to /feel/ ... yeah, like a moment of awesomeness where /the entire population of Earth/ was saved from destruction by a hair's breath. Not a footnote as the world was destroyed and everyone lost.

I like tragedies. I've read some damn fine tragic stories; some of them were written by you. But tragedies aren't /exempt/ from the laws of storytelling; the climax /happens/, it's just that the climax involves Bad Things happening.

I dunno. I liked it, but it could have been better.

(Also, Laura's final line felt massively OOC, but I don't think I ever had a great grasp on her character to begin with.)
