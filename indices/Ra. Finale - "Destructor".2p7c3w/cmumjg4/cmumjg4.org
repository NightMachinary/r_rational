I like it. It doesn't read like a happy ending for anybody, but... life goes on. Neither Virtual nor Actual humanity was genocided, no main characters except the Glass Man were permanently killed, and differences were resolved in as peaceful a way as could reasonably be expected.

Everyone lives and both sides had a point. It's the happiest ending there could be, really.

And I am sad that the story had to end, and now that I can see /Ra/ in its entirety there's a hundred things that I think could have been done better... but it's good that the story is finished. Nothing would have been worse than being stuck in deadfic limbo forever.

I'm excited to see what you do next. I hope it has spaceships.
