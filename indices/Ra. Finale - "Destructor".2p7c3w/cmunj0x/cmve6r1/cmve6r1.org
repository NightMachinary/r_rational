  On the other hand, who the heck is going to pick a fight with a dyson swarm?

1. Create/find a black hole.

2. Punt it exactly at the center of the sun.

3. Star collapses; Dyson swarm starves.

If you want to be really sure, use a black hole with Schwarzschild radius equal to the radius of the sun (2.5x10^{5} solar masses) or of the Dyson sphere itself (5x10^{7} solar masses for Earth orbit. Probably closer to 5x10^{5} solar masses).

Sagittarius A^{*} , the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way, weighs in at 4x10^{6} solar masses. Black holes formed by stars are upwards of 3 solar masses, the heaviest are 10^{3} . The milky way is 10^{12} solar masses, the small magellanic cloud 10^{10} .

So if your Kardeshev scale[1] is higher than its 2.0, it shouldn't be difficult at all to mess with the Swarm. At 2.5, you can destroy them before they realise it.
