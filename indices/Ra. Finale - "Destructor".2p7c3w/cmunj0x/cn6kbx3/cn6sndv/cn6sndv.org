Two are in fact not appreciably better than one. Not to the minds staying, or to the minds going - A matrioska brain represents an information/cultural economy, and the more processing power it has, the more complex / rich it is. It makes sense to want it to be bigger, but wanting a new one? Why? It wouldn't have people in it until you built some, people who don't exist yet don't get to vote on decisions, and without a lightspeed breaker, a second swarm in the next system over is behind so huge a time lag that it would decouple entirely from the primary culture. - The second brain doesn't add value to the first, so it doesn't get built.

Uhm. I think it might be worthwhile to harvest the nearby star systems for mass, until your original brain is on the verge of turning into a singularity, because doing that would increase the size of the economic/cultural network. But the actuals are well out of the area likely to be hit by such strip-mining operations.
