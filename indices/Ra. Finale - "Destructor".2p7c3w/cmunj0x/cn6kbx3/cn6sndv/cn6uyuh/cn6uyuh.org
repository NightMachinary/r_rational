I don't really know what a matrioska brain is. Isn't it just a thing that fits around a star, capturing the star's energy and using it to run a computer?\\
Stars output a lot of energy but its still finite. What if, at some point in the distant future, the total energy output of the star is not enough for the virtuals and they decide, "OK, half of us will go make a new brain around a new star and continue our virtual hedonism there".
