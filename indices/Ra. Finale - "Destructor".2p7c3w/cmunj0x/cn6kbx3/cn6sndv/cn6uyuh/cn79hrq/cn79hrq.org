It's an information/cultural economy. Splitting it in half makes both halves much poorer, until they get the population back up.. at which point both halves are back at the same level of "wealth" that they started at. So, no point. Negative point, in fact. To have actual growth, they need to increase the available energy-gradient and computational substrate in the same location. Which means either everyone migrating whole-sale to a star system with more resources in it ..(.. an accretion disk?) or Dispatching non-sapient automation to the next star over to take it apart and send as much mass as possible back home. And the second strategy is also limited in scale - even if they decide that fusion is for suckers and recenter the swarm around an accretion disk, you can extract much more energy from a small singularity than from a big one, so at most it involves killing the nearest dozen stars or so.

This is my most liked / least nightmarish solution to the fermi paradox - Network effects, and the impossibility of having any meaningful network across interstellar distances mean that even apex civilizations limit themselves to small spacial regions instead of devouring all matter in their forward lightcone, which is a thing such a civ could technically do - It is merely that doing so isn't in fact a rewarding activity.
