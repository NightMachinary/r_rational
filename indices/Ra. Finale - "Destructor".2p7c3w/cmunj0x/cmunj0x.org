Well, it is about as ... good? And ending as is possible. The virtuals don't have any interest in expanding beyond sol.. Because the com lag is unsolvable, and they don't want to splinter the culture irrevocably? They have had virtual eons to think it over so the instruction to RA can't have been a rushed decision. The actuals get to build planets away from the dyson swarm. The main thing I am wondering here is.. why didn't this happen to /begin/ with? Before the war. Both factions too bloody-minded to put some light-cone between them before things blew up?

Also, RA just transmitted a "Technological Civilization Here" signal visible at really absurd distances. A star going off sequence and only transmitting deep infra-red doesn't happen naturally. Not subtle at all, this. On the other hand, who the heck is going to pick a fight with a dyson swarm?
