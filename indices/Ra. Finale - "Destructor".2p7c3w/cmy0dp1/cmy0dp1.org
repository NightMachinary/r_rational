Repeating my same post from [[/r/qtnm]]

There are a lot of other comments that cover what I think. In particular I agree that the hyperintelligent AI and future simulations really took a lot of human agency. It changed the tone of the story, but it wasn't necessarily bad in itself. The ending was realistic, but bland.

One thing I haven't seen discussed yet. One thing I was bothered by was the way Rachel takes the time to chew out Laura. Laura was up against hyper-intelligences, hyper accurate simulations of the future, and in general had a hard time telling what was real and what wasn't. Even seeing all the perspectives, I wondered if the story we were told about the war was just another layer of deception. I really thought it wasn't fair for Rachel to complain to Laura.

The most deceptive, misleading, and annoying detail was the fact that Rachel had no master plan with the astronauts. That was pure stupidity on her part. Rachel goes to all that trouble to save a few astronauts just because they are in front of her, but she had no master plan to overthrow the wheel group? Even the slightest trace utilitarian or consequentialist ethic or reasoning makes Rachel seem outright stupid, if not evil to me.

Laura herself address all my issues, but I am not sure if you intend for us to agree with her

Good point Laura

No Rachel, when six billion other lives are at stake, you let those people die if it means a significantly better chance to save the six billion.

If Rachel was actually intelligent, she could have left enough hints and clues for Laura to actually do something that matters to help save the other six billion.

TLDR; Laura's right in all her criticisms of Rachel. Are we supposed to agree with Rachel more, I wasn't sure?
