I was going to link to this: [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/]]

But that 300 seconds per day thing limits your options.

That being said, it's still possible to do a binary search with three hundred seconds-- if it takes you 10 seconds to perform an action and another 5 to write down the results and later results based on that action (ie. you querying 15 seconds ahead recursively), you can go down 20 iterations, and 2^{20} is 1048576 actions to search through for an optimum answer.

Obviously the number of iterations you can go through for each answer depends on the time necessary to do an action, but that's easily enough for some stock trading.

This is assuming you can change the future based on what you see, though.
