1) The glance is the 300 seconds immediately after you activate it (unless you decided to cut it short to save seconds).

2) You can change the future depending on what you see. If you decided to do something, look into the future, and change your mind, if you look again you'll see something else.

3) You cannot save seconds for the next day.

Alright! Munchkin away.
