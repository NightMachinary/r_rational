What I love about this trilogy is that each book illustrates a different interpretation of quantum physics. Book 1, /The Universe Next Door/, is in accord with the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics. Book 2, /The Trick Top Hat/, has characters connected through non-locality. And book 3, /The Homing Pigeons/, is in an "observer-created universe" in which consciousness causes wavefunction collapse. Preeetty cool.
