  There is, of course, much more similarity between a thing and its opposite than between two randomly-selected things. Which are more alike: blue and yellow, or blue and an armadillo?

Indeed. I've read a lot of books in the /Illuminatus!/ series (including these), and there are a few gems. I'm a fan of Celine's laws, and apparently EY is sufficiently satisfied with them to toss a mention in the more recent chapters of HPMOR. So it's not all bunk.
