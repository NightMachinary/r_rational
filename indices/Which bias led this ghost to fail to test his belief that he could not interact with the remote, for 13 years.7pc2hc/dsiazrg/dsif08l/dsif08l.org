Lead poisoning was apparently pretty well known in ancient rome. It's one of these hindsight things were we try to ascribe one belief to all past people like how people in the past all thought the world was flat and hated women, ancient roman leaders were aware of lead poisoning but it wasn't a huge problem back then. Lead was known to be dangerous and thus people preferred clay pipes, the really dangerous stuff was apparently lead acetate which was produced by boiling grape juice in lead pots and was used to sweeten wine. What people often neglect to mention is that rome was large both in time and space and you'll find times and places in which lead poisoning was a problem and times and spaces in which it was not.
