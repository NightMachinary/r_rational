I'm flattered you're interested.

No polishing was ever done, I fear; never got to the top of the projects list. I do have a few new books since then, however. :> The latest one is "The Patchwork Realms: Arrival"; it's still in progress, with 8 chapters available [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30636/the-patchwork-realms-arrival/chapter/464681/chapter-1-arrival][on RoyalRoad]] and a ninth sitting on my hard drive, hopefully to be finished today.
