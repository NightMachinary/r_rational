I did mention in the original post that it would probably be run over an online tabletop like Roll20, but that was buried in a wall of text, so I should have been clearer about that. I do like the idea of an asynchronous game, but in my experience it's hard to keep a play-by-post campaign going without running into the issue of people losing interest or just not posting with sustainable frequency; I've rarely had that sort of issue with in-person gaming, so hopefully having regular sessions should help keep things focused and on-pace.

That said, I would definitely welcome and even encourage players to collaborate, communicate, and even undertake projects/missions/interactions 'off-camera' via chat/email/etc., so even if you couldn't make the regular sessions, you could still be an active participant in the campaign.
