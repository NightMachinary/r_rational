Sorry for the delay. I want to get in contact with all the prospective players and figure out when would work best for everyone, but the preliminary time is late morning to early afternoon on Saturdays. I'll send everyone a message with my contact information and add people to a group chat as they get in touch.

I can definitely see the Jedi taking a deathist viewpoint, and a Jedi who rejects that and aims to cure all ails would fit well with the campaign. I do wonder whether the Jedi actually use terms like 'heresy', though. Did he have previous exposure to Sith or Sith ideals? Suddenly declaring oneself to be Sith in the middle of the Jedi Academy seems a bit dramatic. There are certainly plenty of 'grayer Jedi', actual Sith, and unaffiliated force-using traditions in the KotOR era that he could have been drawn towards as part of his disillusionment, whether just philosophically or politically as well.
