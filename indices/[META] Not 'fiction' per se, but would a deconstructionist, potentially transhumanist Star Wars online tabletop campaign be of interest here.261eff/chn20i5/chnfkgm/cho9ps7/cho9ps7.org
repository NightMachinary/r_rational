so if I do play ((which, what time are you planing)) I would want to go with a more transhumanist theme as opposed to a munchkin one, specifically one based on [[http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified/]["transhumanism as simplified humanism"]]

Disgraced jedi Alistair Wright one day in a class at the jedi academy alistair asked why some things were darkside, bringing back the recently dead, healing terminal illnesses, forcing plants to grow faster, preserving the life of those injured past natural recovery. The teacher answered as they had every time, most of those things were not possible and even if they were they would violate the natural balance, they would be using the force to make the impossible possible, they would make you a tool of the darkside doing your will against the will of the force. they didn't know about his experiments, the animals he had killed and brought back, the plants he had made grow, the patients he had quietly cured and sustained through surgery. Alistair stood up and announced "then I denounce ballance, call me darth wright" and left, the students paralyzed by bystander apathy and the teacher left with his brain trying to find a line in a script that wasn't there. A few days later Alistair saw the first wanted poster for "Darth Right, wanted for heresy"
