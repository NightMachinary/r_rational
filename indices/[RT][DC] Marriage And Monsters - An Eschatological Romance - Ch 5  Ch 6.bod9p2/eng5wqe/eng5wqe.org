Neat story so far. I like the latest twist a fair bit.

The next named category of d20PF Gold Dragon ("Very Young") comes with Change Shape, so presumably Haley will be able to turn into 'any animal or humanoid' 3x per day (indefinite duration each time). Being able to spend time as, well, her former self, should do wonders for the whole metamorphosis body horror thing and associated problems. Even if she spends a lot of time as a dragon, just /having the ability/ to do otherwise would reassure the heck out of me in the same situation.
