Thank you everyone for reading along so far! I'm blown away by all the attention and feedback this story is getting. As a little extra thank you (and because I'm getting too far ahead in the reserve chapters), here is an extra chapter for your Tuesday update!

Also, here are Haley's monster stats for Chapters 1-6. Obviously it would have helped if I'd had these out for CH 1, buuuut better late than never: [[https://urlzs.com/cKgh5]]

Final Also, this story now has a royalroad page, if you prefer to read it on there. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24751/marriage-and-monsters-an-eschatological-romance]]
