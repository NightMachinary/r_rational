From the looks of the rules:

"A creature cannot change shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. This ability functions as a /polymorph/ spell, the type of which is listed in the creature's description, but the creature does not adjust its ability scores (although it gains any other abilities of the creature it mimics)."

she'll only be able to change to her original shape until she's a young adult, at which point she'll be size category Huge. By Sean's estimate, that should only take just over a week or so. Good luck finding clothes in size giant! I can already see the looks in the tailors' eyes.
