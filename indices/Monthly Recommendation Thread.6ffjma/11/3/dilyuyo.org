[[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound][Randidly Ghosthound]] is a pretty good LitRPG where a bunch of people from earth get sucked into a game-like fantasy setting with what turns out to be a rather high difficulty level. It has a better explanation than most for how the MC becomes overpowered relative to everyone else (it's accidental, not divine intervention, and makes sense in context). Also features a lot of skill grinding and improvement over time, and a lot of variety in the fantasy elements / game mechanics used.
