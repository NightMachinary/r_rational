Anything else in that vein? Either the munchkin or uplift variety.

But I have been looking hard for more uplift stories, but not everything has really grabbed me.

I think I'm kind of a stickler for the "from nothing" aspect of those stories. The SI GoT uplifts that I've seen usually start with an established and already powerful character. Same when it's not an uplift story. Portal/isekai should help with that.
