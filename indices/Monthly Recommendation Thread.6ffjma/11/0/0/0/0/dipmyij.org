  The second one I can recommend is I'm a Spider, So What?

Not exactly rational though. Like, the protagonist [[#s][spoiler]].

EDIT: Read further and a few chapters /later/, there's a throwaway comment about how you [[#s][spoiler]]. Still annoying to read though, since you don't know if it's an oversight or the character's just that dumb.

Also, massive points loss for not checking if there's an "enhance intelligence" skill.

EDIT: Also, for not checking for a [[#s][spoiler]] skill. It's a major weakness that should be resolved. Also, not [[#s][spoiler]]. I mean, even if she's not expecting to use the skill except for temporary pit-stops, it's still a /huge/ advantage for emergency situations where she has any real warning.
