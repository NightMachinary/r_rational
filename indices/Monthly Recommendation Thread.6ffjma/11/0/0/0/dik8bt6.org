The main one for this sub is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][Two Year Emperor]], which is even linked on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][the wiki]]. Guy gets sucked into a dnd setting under rules as written, and as he learns how to horribly game the rules he's faced with obstacles sufficiently overwhelming to keep tension even as the power levels skyrocket. It doesn't quite have the 'from nothing' thing because he starts as the absolute ruler of a major nation, but it's still quite good.

The second one I can recommend is [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][I'm a Spider, So What?]], where a magic duel of destiny between the Hero and Demon Lord culminates in an explosion that crosses dimensions and kills a high school classroom in a modern world, and the protagonist is reincarnated into said fantasy world as a weak spider monster. If you're looking for 'from nothing' stories, this is /very much/ it and I've found it to have excellent pacing as the protagonist grows stronger against all odds.

The last one off the top of my head is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/comments/5xh4o7/chapter_0/][The Snake Report]], which was linked from here recently. Much like /I'm a Spider, So What?/ the protagonist is reincarnated into a fantasy world as a weak snake monster and forced to survive against all odds. The main difference is that /The Snake Report/ feels much more frantic, as the protagonist's actions often have unintended and just as deadly consequences and he's constantly trying his hardest to keep on top of everything that's going on, with varying success. For what it's worth, I found /I'm a Spider, So What?/ more exciting and /The Snake Report/ more amusing, but both definitely worth reading.
