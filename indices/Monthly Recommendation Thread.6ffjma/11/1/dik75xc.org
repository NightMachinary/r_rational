Someone recommended [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30985483-cast-under-an-alien-sun][this one]] a few months ago. Portal Fantasy(isekai) where the MC from our world and time is transported to another world with 17th or 18th century technology. He uses his very general knowledge of science to get an edge up and help an ireland-analogue to defeat some invading english/turk-analogues. Last book/4 should be coming out in a month or two.

It's OK. Not great, mostly because the invaders are kind of holding the idiot ball and the MC is kind of a mary sue. Recommended because it's addictive and /good enough/.
