[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/39157/the-best-of-all-possible-worlds][The Best of All Possible Worlds]], FiM fanfic, completed. French philosopher Voltaire is transported to Equestria. Crazy premise with good execution. It's interesting take on portal fantasy with competent main character, extended worldbuilding, politics, historical in-jokes and lots of snark.
