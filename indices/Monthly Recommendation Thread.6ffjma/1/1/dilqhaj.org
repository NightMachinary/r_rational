Does it get any better in the later chapters, maybe? I'd really like to read a good Prototype fanfic but this ones suffers from a bunch of problems.

1) It's too stretched out. Especially when it's being told from the Blacklight-protagonist's perspective, it's full of these unnecessarily long introspective streams of consciousness that don't really add much to the plot development.

  God damn it, Lio! Enough of this emo shit

2) Another problem is with way too many PoV switchings --- I don't care what's happening on some tangentially relevant government briefings or with some anime characters, I just want to read some literature-ised Prototype story from the perspective of the special infected.

3) Finally, the first serious fight (with helicopters and all) not only turns into a chain of what-an-idiot moments, but also pulls a bunch of Deus ex machina plot armors that make the already-powerful protagonist into a reassembles-from-ashes-level immortal, which just makes me lose all the remaining interest in the story.

Also, as a side note, maybe anyone knows any good Prototype stories to recommend?
