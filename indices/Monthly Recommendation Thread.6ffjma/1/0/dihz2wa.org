MIaL is really really good and well written. I like it a lot.

If you're at all into anime, I strongly recommend checking out the ufotable Kara no Kyoukai adaptation. Not so much for the plot, but instead because it is visually gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing. Also, Paradox Spiral (part five of the series) is just really neatly told and cut together in a really interesting way.

Ensou's [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-finely-honed-blade-worm-kara-no-kyoukai-garden-of-sinners.32454/][Worm/Knk crossover]] is not bad, but not as good as Maybe I'm a Lion. However, the update rate is frustratingly slow and extremely irregular.
