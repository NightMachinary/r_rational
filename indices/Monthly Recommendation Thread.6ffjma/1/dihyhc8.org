This was submitted as a thread 2 years ago, but I've been reading [[http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover][Maybe I'm A Lion]] and enjoying it. No particular familiarity with the source material needed - I've seen one Fate anime and that's it.

One thing that it does that I really like is that there are multiple smart characters who are wrong in their own ways, and as the point of view hops around, they point out the mistakes of the other characters (though rarely their own). Aside from making things easy for the reader, it's also really entertaining.

EDIT: eventually the pace became too glacial and I stopped reading. First 25 or so chapters still fully recommended.
