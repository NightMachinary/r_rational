Tentative recommendation of the RWBY/Exalted crossover Miracles of Ancient Wonder (on spacebattles). It's not really rational, given that it has Exalted as its main characters, but I liked the writing well enough. Other than that, if you've read Worm, I would recommend A Cloudy Path. I just reread up to the end point, and other than a few bumpy spots, it's probably the closest fic to canon quality and length. If you haven't read Worm, then read that first. (Or don't, I'm interested to see what you can gleam about canon from a piece of fanfiction. Not that that would necessarily be in your best interest.)
