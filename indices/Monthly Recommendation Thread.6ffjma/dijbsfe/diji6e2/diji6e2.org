  Maybe I'm just a depressed weirdo who likes to live vicariously through fiction due to insecurity about social isolation, but dammit, this story makes me happy and I want to share that happiness with others. It's not simple distraction from misery happy, either, seeing these characters tackle simple yet challenging personal problems makes me want to do the same and gives me the confidence to do so.
