I was torn over how to respond to someone who's written one of the few pieces of fiction that's had enough of an emotional impact on me that I regularly cry with feels and relish each moment. I didn't know whether to half-jokingly say "senpai noticed me!", go full fanboy over how I was hooked my this story because I already knew I liked these characters, or just praise the achievements you've made with this story and wish you luck. In the end, I settled on "thank you".

Thank you Destiny for making a story that I have already prepared a place for in my personal hall of fame. I'm autistic, so I sometimes have trouble feeling emotions and relentlessly berate myself for it because I probably have anxiety and depression. It's rare that a story comes along that reminds me that I can be happy even when life is hard. That difficult challenges, particularly social, are surmountable and I will find a way to do it.

Out of all the stories that have made me feel that way, though, yours is unlike any other. Every other one of them had some supernatural or sci-fi elements to them. Sometimes it was used as a metaphor for some personal conflict, other times it served to enable the plot and influence character development, but never have I /loved/ a story that had no fantastical elements at all. There's no escapism in SRU, not even in terms of romance, it's just...people, and somehow I can feel what they feel.

Maybe this clicks with me because it helps me understand how other people feel, or the characters are just so relatable that even someone like me can feel the way they do, but I've gotten as far as Katara and Toph rudely arguing about Toph's parents (it's heartbreaking) and my only issue with the fic has been the barely distracting typos. My life feels fuller just because I have read this story, so thank you Destiny and Godspeed...

...you know what, screw it! I was about to wish you on your way and go, but why should I? If there's one thing your story reminded me of it's the value of friendship, so Destiny, I would like to be your friend. Message me when you want to talk, friend me on Facebook, schedule time to hang out, whatever you'd like. I'm not going to gush over your work, we can just geek out over the dumb stuff we like. Even if you say no, I'm still proud of myself for having the confidence to do this.
