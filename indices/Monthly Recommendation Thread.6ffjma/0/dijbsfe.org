[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6417590/1/What-I-Learned-at-SRU][What I Learned at SRU]] is a slice of life drama set in a college AU of Avatar: The Last Airbender. I know that doesn't sound very interesting, but for what it is, it's amazing. It takes characters that you already care about and want to just see interact with one another while they live their lives, and gives you exactly that without changing anything about them.

It's astonishing how thematically similar the story and characters are in a completely different setting. Even the addition of Aang/Toph actually perfectly suits their character dynamic and allows them to develop in similar ways to the show without retreading old ground. Sokka makes pop culture references, but every one of them sounds like a joke he would make and are just as funny!

I will argue that this is a rational fic given how well it handles its characters personalities and the fact that they are really good at thinking critically about each other and themselves, but I won't deny that the fundamental appeal of this story is friendship. You just get to see these people be good friends to each other, facing personal trials and tribulations, and it feels /really good/.

Maybe I'm just a depressed weirdo who likes to live vicariously through fiction due to insecurity about social isolation, but *dammit*, this story makes me happy and I want to share that happiness with others. It's not simple distraction from misery happy, either, seeing these characters tackle simple yet challenging personal problems makes me want to do the same and gives me the confidence to do so.

I literally started reading this the day after I graduated college (swell timing on my part) and despite my time at university being nothing like this I still adore it. I haven't even come close to finishing it and I have no idea whether it will leave a lasting impact on me or help me through this point in my life, but I haven't felt this much pure hope while reading a story in a /long/ time.
