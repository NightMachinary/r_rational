“seeing these characters tackle simple yet challenging personal problems */makes me want to do the same and gives me the confidence to do so./*”

This is 100% literally the ENTIRE REASON the story exists, the reason almost all of my fiction exists, this is why I tell stories, I'm legit crying over here. I NEED to find a way to finish something I can actually publish because my fictional children have a job to do after I am gone and just goddamn.

All right. Got that out of my system.

SRU took 3.5 years to write. I went through a divorce, left my entire life behind, and started a brand new life, all while working on this story every week. A generous patron helped make SRU my full-time job for nearly two years, and helped me foster the over 300 piece art gallery the project has amassed (almost all of which by commission). I learned so much about myself and how I wanted to tell stories through this project, as well as how to collaborate with others to bring visions to life. It is an imperfect mess, an experimental mish-mash of so many things that express my love for these characters (later on I start introducing Legend of Korra characters, with Korra becoming a 6th main member of the cast). The story is a few years old now since completion, and it's so meaningful to know that even if its ramshackle state, it can still do what I set out to do with it.

I am revamping the story as an original series, very slowly, in the form of 'What We Learned at Rokudai,' (some of which is freely available on the net) a choice that was easy because the story and its characters were like children born of my DNA and the DNA of Avatar. In SRU, I'd argue the biggest issues with the story boil down to me trying too hard to reference the source material. I want to fix those problems, get rid of unneeded plot lines and characters, and add in brand new ones. I don't want to hide its genealogy, but I want it to grow into its own 'person,' in a sense.

Because of the scale of this narrative, and how many aspects need to be edited and modified, it's going to be a long time. But I still feel like this story can do what I meant for it to, if I can only get it to where it needs to go.

I hope you enjoy the rest of SRU for what it is. Thanks so much for sharing these supportive words on it.
