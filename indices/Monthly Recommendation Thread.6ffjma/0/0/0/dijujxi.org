I've gotten surprisingly into the slice of life genre lately. I really liked the anime /K-On!/ and /Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid/, but SRU is on a whole other level. I honestly think I like this fic is as good as Netflix's /Master of None/, a show I absolutely love. In some ways I like SRU even more just because of these characters and comedy, as well as the fact there's so much more content at such a consistent level of quality.
