[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8188557/1/Magical-Detective-Ayase-Yue][Magical Detective Ayase Yue]] is a fanfic of Mahou Sensei Negima (I consider knowing the source a requirement to follow along) that takes the idea of Yue as a private eye presented near the end of the series and runs with it. The narration is witty and the action is great; by her own admission Yue's not a powerhouse type, so she has to not only think fast but be unscrupulous when she fights. Currently, the story is finished with three cases and is on the opening chapter of the fourth case. A note, though, that it can be argued that while the style of the story is good, it's not really in line with the source material. Also, this was started before UQ Holder! and doesn't take material from there into account, though I don't think there's anything that contradicts each other yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]] is an AU of Sword Art Online with the premise that the concept of Alfheim Online (originally material for the second arc) was chosen as the first death game (so no need to know the source material to read). I would call this the best SAO fanfic out there; it's thoroughly and extremely well built. The characters authentically feel like a mix of gaming geeks and in-over-their-heads laymen that they should be, with all the different personal motives, objectives and conflicts that implies, and the game mechanics are explained logically and extensively (the author even built a conlang for the "language of magic" that fills the purpose the original source informed the audience about but never lived up to). The one criticism I've seen that's validly levelled at it is that its main characters are too smart for people who are ostensibly fourteen-year-olds at the start, but considering this subreddit's themes I don't think that'll be much of a problem here.

I brought this up in a previous recommendation thread but didn't get much attention, so I'll bring up again [[http://ebonyriddle.com/][E.B.O.N.Y. - The Weirdest Riddle Game On The Internet]]. As a riddle game, you are given riddles and you have to input the answer correctly into the URL to proceed. Those riddles aren't just trivia questions - you have to correctly figure out the train of logic that's being asked of you before you can get anywhere. And unlike other riddle games, its storyline is both coherent and an intriguing thing. That said, the first few levels might not look like much - I would point to Level 10 as the closest taste of some of the brain-wranglers you'll be forced to go through later in the game. (Also, a warning that some screen settings might not let you see parts of images properly, like if you have high brightness and low contrast.)

+EDIT: Well crud that's what I get for not checking up on the game recently. The game's gone down sometime, I'm not sure when.+ Nevermind found the new link.
