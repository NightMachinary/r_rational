I like Fate/Revelation Online also, but I will qualify the recommendation by the fact that the author is taking his time with character development and worldbuilding, and doesn't seem in a rush to advance the plotline. If you like characters trying figure out and experiment with magic in a manner that develops their character at the same time, that should be okay with you. If you expect each chapter of the story to directly build up an overall plotline, this story may be too slow paced.
