I'm tentatively recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9740933/1/Fate-Revelation-Online][/Fate Revelation Online/]]. After the events of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/stay_night][/Fate/Stay Night/]] (the Fate route), Illyasviel persuades Shirou to play virtual reality video games with her. But unfortunately, when the two of them log onto [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online][/Sword Art Online/]] for the first time, they find themselves trapped in a death game just like everybody else.

What follows is a frankly impressive deconstruction and reconstruction of both FSN /and/ SAO, which are both close to irrational by definition. FSN is set in a world of mysticism (the less-understood and well-known the magic, the better) and traditionalism (the older the magic, the better), and Sword Art Online features a villain without a motive, acting because the plot demands it.

In contrast, FRO features a large cast of characters who apply critical thinking, doing everything in their power to escape their ignorance (magical or otherwise), acting intelligently to pursue their varied goals - and the villain is no different. FRO moves beyond the stations of canon as it goes on (or at least, where it does stick to the stations, it justifies them in a way that SAO never did), and features strong characterization.

There are more chapters available on Sufficient Velocity and on The Fanfiction Forum (where the author also openly posts his notes and outlines, which are a treat to read).
