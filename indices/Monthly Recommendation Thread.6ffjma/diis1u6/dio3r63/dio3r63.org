Thanks for recommending Fairy Dance of Death. Not only is it a pretty decent work in itself (coming from someone who knew nothing about SAO), it led me to the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU][SAO Abridged series]] which, I have to say, is the best Abridged series I've seen (even better IMO than Yu-Gi-Oh and DBZ Abridged) and frankly one of the funniest and most enjoyable things I've watched, ever. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend checking it out. It doesn't exactly fit the theme of this sub but it's so damn good that I had to give it a shoutout anyway.
