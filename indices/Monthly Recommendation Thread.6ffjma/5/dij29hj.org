I have only read a couple of things in the last month, and only one would probably be considered rational:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] is a Harry Potter fan fic where the only difference is that Hermione is exceptionally good at math(s). That fic follows the first four years in Hogwarts; the on-going followup [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/Lady-Archimedes][Lady Archimedes]] is covering the final three years and is currently approaching the end of year 6.

I enjoyed it for the world building since there is a good bit of focus on rituals and spellcrafting, and seeing the small changes that add up to bigger deviations over time. There is also a lot of real life mathematical concepts at play, though it began going over my head for the most part after the first few years. Some of it is frustrating - I feel like a few of the choices the characters make are primarily made to keep the plot somewhat closer to the source material, rather than being based on what the characters would actually do. And I keep finding myself going "Kill the bad guys, you idiots!" but I suppose that's a bit out of character for the kids (though Harry and Hermione are getting closer to that point). Still, it was really enjoyable.

The only other thing I've been reading was an original work climbing the lists at topwebfiction.com called [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests/chapter/99919/prologue][Everybody Loves Large Chests]]. It's... well, not rational at all, but can be funny at times. Fair amount of explicit sex in it. The title itself is a play on the main character, [[#s][Spoiler]]. It reminds me of [[http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/1729/change-new-world/chapter/14075/prologue-summer-cicadas][change: new world]] which I reviewed a few months ago... except that one is really bad. I can't really recommend this one either, but it made for a decent change up. I probably won't finish it though.
