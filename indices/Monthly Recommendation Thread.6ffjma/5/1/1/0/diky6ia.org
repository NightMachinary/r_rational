  The sequel..has its moments, but also has Hermy-Sue.

I think that's a fair criticism; the first has a lot more world building (though the latter does when it comes to alchemy) and slow build-up over time; the sequel is much more "She already knows all the stuff so it's nothing to just make up a bunch of new spells off the top of her head; let's get to the action!"

I am still enjoying the sequel, but it definitely has a different feel than the first - and a lot of that is because Hermione seems like she can do (almost) no wrong.
