Well, yes, but Noether's only goes one way, as far as I'm aware: from symmetries to conservation laws. You observe that action doesn't care about certain continuous transformations and derive the corresponding conserved quantities. Observing that things seem to be conserved is at most a hint to go looking for a suitable continuous transformation, it doesn't allow one to actually use the theorem directly.

The thing that would be interesting is precisely in what way magical rituals can be described by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)][actions]]. That would have been the actual explanatory content, if it existed. Without it, mentioning Noether's theorem is just an applause light for nerds.
