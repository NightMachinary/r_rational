I wonder how one would go about boiling down magical rituals to continuous symmetries of a Lagrangian.

I mean, it's high quality technobabble that uses real world jargon. Still technobabble, though, unless it gets a lot more detailed than name-dropping Noether.

Maybe the author actually managed a good job and one can infer things about magic before they are revealed in story just by paying attention to the maths, but I doubt it. If they do manage it, though, let me know and I'll give it another go. Couldn't manage to get into it the last couple of times, due to stations of canon.
