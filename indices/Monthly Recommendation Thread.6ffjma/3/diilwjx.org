Dungeon Keeper Ami has updated twice recently on SV. A great read that doesn't require knowledge of the crossover elements to enjoy.

Cogito Ergo Lung [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-steves-battery-cage.36277/]]

A Worm fanfic in which post-story Taylor's conciousness is inserted into Lung at the start of the story, where Lung's conciousness remains but is changed by the information delivery.

Its well written and a fun read so far. An interesting aspect of this Lung's power is that as he grows larger he becomes more intelligent.
