It's a RPG-Mechanics Verse that knows well the universes it's sourcing from, it does a great job of deconstructing these universes and merging them together into a more detailed new one, it showcases many original and interesting solutions inside the new setting that are consistent with its laws. The protagonist has to work her way out of a pretty bad situation (recover her soul before dying) starting with rather limited resources. While it does have its idiot ball moments, there aren't too many of them.

All these are things I'm interested in, so the story is interesting to me too.

Though admittedly I don't like protagonist's flavour of morality, and there are some running gags that in my opinion partially spoil the story (e.g. how lawful goods keep interpreting her benevolent actions as those of an evil overlord, or how they keep seeing her as a perverted person despite her attempts to not appear as one, etc).
