SAO is inherently irrational, every aspect of the plot breaks down like a flaming cobweb after the most cursory of examinations.

I wouldn't say FSN is inherently irrational, the setting just runs on narrativium- the thing that works best is literally the thing that makes the best story. Also- intentionally or not- it does end up subverting a large majority of the standard epic story tropes ("King" Arthur is really a girl, the first legendary hero is actually a complete bastard, the Holy grail, the protagonist is actually complete dogshit at being the hero, etc.)
