  I wouldn't say FSN is inherently irrational, the setting just runs on narrativium- the thing that works best is literally the thing that makes the best story.

Well, sort of?

The setting has room for instrumental rationality, but the core problem is the essential nature (and conservation of) "mystery". Magecraft fundamentally draws power from consensus reality, and thrives in ambiguity; it is a "god of the gaps" argument writ large. When things run on narrativium, they run that way because humans love stories, and that love gets carved into the world.

But you probably know that already, or know better than me; I'm not a full Nasu maniac.

  "King" Arthur is really a girl, the first legendary hero is actually a complete bastard, the Holy grail, the protagonist is actually complete dogshit at being the hero, etc.

Yeah. I think Gilgamesh's dickishness can be attributed either to his bath in the Grail mud, and/or to value drift over time. The idea of what is considered a "Hero" has changed a lot, since the Epic of Gilgamesh was first written.
