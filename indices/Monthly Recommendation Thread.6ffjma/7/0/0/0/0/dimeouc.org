No, that's a big theme in the story. Gil starts out as an asshole, Enkidu is created to kill/temper him, they show up, show down, and a lot of impressive flexing and punching later they decide to become best friends. Eventually they go out looking for immortality by deed, Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh gets sad and terrified by the prospect of his own death. He decides to go looking for immortality in truth, completely fails at finding it, but gets a plant that reverts aging as a consolation prize. By this time, he's become wiser, so instead of hoarding it, he decides to share it with the elders of his city. Unfortunately, a snake steals it, and he goes back to the city, only to find that his newfound wisdom and experience, not to mention lack of dickishness, has granted him the immortality in deed he longed for when he set off at first.

At least, that's what I remember.
