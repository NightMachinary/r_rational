  The biggest reward I'd enjoy seeing is having yourself in the story, even if it's just a one off mention about how horrible your death was.

Ah, I could do that. Thanks for the idea.

  Early drafts is pretty high up there in terms of priorities too. It's fun having a somewhat regular story to read and critique.

Note that this particular one is going to be a long short story -- something on the order of 5000-8000 words. (Which is roughly on the order of 20 pages.)

  It'd be good to have a few exceptionally high rewards in case anyone powerful and rich drops in. 100 dollar ones and such. Say, the chance to design a monster within the story, the chance to design a character that plays a major role, the chance to help design a death scene.

Good, I'll add that to the list.

#+begin_quote
  I would be willing to precommit to boost your ranking and get a good story.
#+end_quote

Excellent, thank you so much.
