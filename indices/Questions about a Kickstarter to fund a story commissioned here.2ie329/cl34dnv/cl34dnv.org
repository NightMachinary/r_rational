The biggest reward I'd enjoy seeing is having yourself in the story, even if it's just a one off mention about how horrible your death was.

Early drafts is pretty high up there in terms of priorities too. It's fun having a somewhat regular story to read and critique.

It'd be good to have a few exceptionally high rewards in case anyone powerful and rich drops in. 100 dollar ones and such. Say, the chance to design a monster within the story, the chance to design a character that plays a major role, the chance to help design a death scene.

I would be willing to precommit to boost your ranking and get a good story.
