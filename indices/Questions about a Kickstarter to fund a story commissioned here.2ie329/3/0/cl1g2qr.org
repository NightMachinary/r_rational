  it would need to be implemented in a way so that there aren't too many mismatched ideas from different people there.

Simplest solution is to only have one or two rewards available at this level. That way if people want it, they need to pony up quickly.

Also, as mentioned, I get final veto. If what you want is "and then clowns come parachuting in!"...well, no. But I'll talk with you and say "ok, maybe the clowns just walk in? And they're psycho clowns, with knives...and..." until we figure something out.

  I wouldn't want to spoil the experience by reading an early draft, but I would be interested in seeing a late-stage draft before you publish. That might limit the extent of changes you could make, but I'm fine with that. I'm not particularly interested in any of the other rewards.
