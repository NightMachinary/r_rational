I tried a lot of things to get that table decent on epub, but none of them worked well. Here is one that you might prefer to ao3's mobi: [[http://82.102.11.148:8080//tmp/worth%20the%20candle%20%28v2%20ok%20tables%20till%20ch205%29%20-%20night.mobi][file]]. My only other suggestion is to try printing the webpages to an A7-sized PDF via your browser. That might work better. Ebook formats generally suck for anything but plain Western text. Blame the consumers.
