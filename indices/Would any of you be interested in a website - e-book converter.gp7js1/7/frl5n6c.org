While I probably wouldn't use such a thing myself, there's always a demand for format converters. And while (as people mentioned) there are existing things like FFF, it never hurts to have alternate channels in case something unfortunate (service outage, legal trouble, site DDOS etc) happens to one of them.

Plus, I guess, you could always add additional functionality like the creation of ebooks with customizable covers, title pages, and so on. Make those kinds of services cheap enough and fans of various works may well be prepared to drop a couple of dollars to create a fancied-up version of their favorites.
