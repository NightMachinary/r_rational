The problem with scripts and plugins is that you need a PC for that still. Would it be possible to create an app for this? If it indeed has the versatality of WebToEpub and works for multiple sites (e.g wordpress royalroad, spacebattles, etc.) I wouldn't mind paying for such an app, and probably others would be willing too.

The reason? Even if you use WebToEpub, you're going to need to use that from your PC, and then use /another/ app (Send to Kindle) to actually be able to read it. As a person who reads only from my phone and doesnt have access to a PC, an app that A) can scrape serials into an epub and B) add any downloaded epubs to your Kindle library would be a great lifesaver and something I'd gladly pay for.

That's my two cents. WebToEpub stopped being useful when I no longer had access to a PC ;-;
