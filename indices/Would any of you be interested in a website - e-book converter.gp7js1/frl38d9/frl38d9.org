This already exists. There are FF.net downloaders and browser extensions, and I've used bloxp for wordpress sites.

What I'd pay money for is a service that keeps an up-to-date ebook of a web serial synced to my kindle, so I don't have to start up a download/conversion manually every time there's an update.
