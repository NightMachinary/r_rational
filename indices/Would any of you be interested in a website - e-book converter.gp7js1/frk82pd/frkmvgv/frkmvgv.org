I have written extensive scripts for converting stuff into ebooks. I have general purpose scrapers that accept URLs and give you epubs, with support for additional modules such as Mozilla Readability, outline.com, the internet archive wayback machine, Github, raw text (such as URLs that contain code), ... . I have written convenience wrappers for RSS, k2pdfopt, Libgen Genesis, [[http://myanonamouse.net]], fanficfare, Lesswrong sequences, ... . The scripts are very powerful and customizable, supporting cookies if needed, JS-rendering via puppeteer, url redirecting, ... . I have opensourced all my [[https://github.com/NightMachinary/.shells][scripts]], but I have not documented them.

If you're interested, I have recently written an experimental tool that converts any of my shell functions into a standalone script. I have used that to generate this [[http://82.102.11.148:8080//tmp/tl_a2b572e8fd354ff7b04ab799f1381407.zip][script]] that can be used as =EMAIL=whitelistedemail@sth.com kindle_email=youremail@sth.com tl.zsh <url> ...=. (I have not tested this experimentally generated script though.) (This =tl= is the general purpose scraper plus Mozilla Readability.) (I think you'd be better off using the scripts as I do, by sourcing all my shell functions.)

Unfortunately, using my scripts for the backend of a webservice presents some security challenges that I do not have the expertise for, because they are written in shell languages and use “eval” quite a bit, so they may execute code if their input is not sanitized properly. Of course, one can always isolate them in docker containers so that if they do get hacked the damage would be small ...

I also have written a unix-to-Telegram [[https://github.com/NightMachinary/betterborg][bridge]], with which I can easily utilize my scripts from mobile devices using my VPS. I have recently written a Siri shortcut, too, that sends the HTML content of the page via SSH to my VPS to be cleaned and sent to Kindle.

PS: For the specific case of fanfiction, there are already good sites out there (Haven't you searched?!). [[http://ff2ebook.com]] [[https://ficsave.xyz]]

PPS: Some screenshots of my workflow:

If you like to use these, open an issue on my github repoes, and I'll help. The primary reason I haven't documented my work currently is that nobody has asked, and this isn't all that motivating.
