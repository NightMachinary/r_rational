Thanks for your extensive answer.

Your scripts definitely look promising. I will take a closer look once I start implementing the backend and FanFicFare/leech do not cover my needs.

I looked into ff2ebook and ficsave, but both of them sometimes failed with general error messages without further information. So I feel like a more robust service would definitely be of use.
