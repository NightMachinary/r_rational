You seem to know what you are doing so let me ask you this:

I am trying to download [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] in a MOBI format to read on my Kindle but by using the download feature from archiveofourown.org I get tables looking like an unreadable mess [[https://i.imgur.com/3ZBLj3z.png][like this]] when [[https://i.imgur.com/4Uni1dE.jpg][this is]] how it properly looks like on the webpage. Any way I can get it to look nice on my Kindle?
