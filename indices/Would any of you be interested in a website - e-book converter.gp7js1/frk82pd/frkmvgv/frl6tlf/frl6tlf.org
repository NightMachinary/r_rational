Other than FanFicFare, another such already-existing program is [[https://github.com/kemayo/leech][leech]]. It seems designed more specifically for the kinds of long-form independent web-novels that get linked here, as it focuses more on making it quick and easy to configure their generic scraper plugins for custom one-off sites (the kind of "novel as WordPress blog on its own domain" works we see a lot of here.)

This contrasts with FanFicFare's focus on explicit preprogrammed support for fiction-hosting websites, blogging engines and forums, at the expense of requiring you to sit down and write a plugin from scratch if you want it to scrape anything more bespoke.

Amusingly, in leech's example on how to configure a job for its "custom" plugin, the developer has chosen to use /Practical Guide to Evil/ as the scrape target. :)
