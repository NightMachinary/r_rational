A bit of background info about FFF. To quote a recent post by the developer:

  ... the *mobi output*. Honestly, that code is ancient and it is reverse engineered from Amazon's proprietary binary format. It predates my involvement in the project and I don't understand that code.

  I recommend downloading to epub and using Calibre to convert to mobi if you really need mobi (I use azw3 for Kindle myself). You'll also get better mobi output with chapter marks.

  That also gives you the advantage of being able to update and add new chapters without downloading every chapter every time.
