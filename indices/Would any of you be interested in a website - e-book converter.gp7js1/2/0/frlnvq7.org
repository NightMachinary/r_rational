I'd second leech. I use it quite a bit, and it cleans up web text nicely to more traditional book style (indented paragraphs instead of line breaks for example.)

It isn't very hard to create new entries for one off sites (Wordpress, or really anything that has a discrete table of contents page). I haven't had the need to create a new web service (RoyalRoad, ao3, etc) since it already has the ones I need, but I figure it wouldn't be that bad.

Updating existing ebooks is pretty fast, but does take a few minutes (I keep my kindle offline and transfer with Calibre, maybe faster way)
