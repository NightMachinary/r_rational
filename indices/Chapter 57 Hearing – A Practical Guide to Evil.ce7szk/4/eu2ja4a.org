This chapter, and the previous one, calls to mind an issue that I never recognized as a potential problem. I can't recall if it was explicitly stated from Malicia's POV or inferred by Cat, but it was mentioned at one point that Malicia's deal with Neshamah included a provision allowing him to invade Praes if Malicia reneged. At the time, I saw this as Neshamah safeguarding himself against a famously traitorous empire, but now I'm seeing it as a weapon in Malicia's arsenal. If Amadeus takes the crown of Praes, there's nothing to stop her from triggering the contingency out of spite. In fact, I can't remember, but her losing the crown might have actually explicitly been the trigger condition.
