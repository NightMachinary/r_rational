  If I understand Bard's implied bargain correctly, it was supposed to limit the divine pissing contest and Fate influence to champions

I'm sorry, what bargain?

We've never gotten any information on how the Bard became the Bard, beyond the vague suggestion that she once opposed the Gods' experiment.

Your theory about her making a bargain to limit the experiment to Named sounds interesting, but as far as I can tell there isn't any evidence for it.
