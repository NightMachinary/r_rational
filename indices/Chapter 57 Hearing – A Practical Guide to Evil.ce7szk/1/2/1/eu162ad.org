I could see magic academy-based centre for villains, a place of learning and power that follows Below's objective of becoming more - that's the reason Praes' villains gravitate to the Tower. I could see a Good institution in the vein of real-life theological universities - already some heroes like Stalwart Paladin come from places like that, and Levantines put their Bestowed on the rolls.

But while the two use the same basic framework, their purposes kind of pull them into opposite directions. The only precedent we have for a mixed institution so far is, again, Refuge - which remains stable due to Ranger's ban on conflicts between students. Using it to /contain/ the conflict between heroes and villains is just asking for the school to get blown up.

Overall, this just kind of feels a bit underwhelming and thematically inconsistent. Just like with the ban on ruler Names, it's something you can spin as generally beneficial, and there certainly are people who want to do just that, but that doesn't explain why this exact shape and how to enforce it with those who will protest.
