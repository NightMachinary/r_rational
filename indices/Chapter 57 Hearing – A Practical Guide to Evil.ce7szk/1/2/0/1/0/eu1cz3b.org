Hierarch is rule of the mob within his own pet legal system. Him being "legal means" would be like if Mexico came to China and started punishing everyone for failing to pay taxes to the Mexican government, and otherwise violating Mexican laws. Except in this analogy Mexico also has some kind of ridiculously powerful mind-controlling weapon that actually lets them back up their claims with pure force.

Hierarch is not rule of the law, he is the rule of the biggest stick.
