Long response time, brace yourself.

  how is /compulsory education/ a “play on the alleged purpose of creation”?
#+end_quote

My understanding is that the "play on the alleged purpose of creation" isn't related to the education at all, it's the rules about Named conflict. She isn't prohibiting it, she's restricting it to a form where stories can still play out without massive collateral damage. The education's purpose is simply to ensure they all know the rules, why they exist, and how they will be enforced. Between historical Calernia, modern Calernia, relatively alien settings like the Everdark, and foreign lands like the ancestral home of the elves and the gnomish empire, we know Named conflict can take a variety of forms. There's no reason to assume this is inherently less stable.

  The notion doesn't seem to be congruous with the setting. Even if we're talking about a medieval /universitas/-like institution - with disputes, riots and all - the only precedent to that is Refuge, and it's held together by the personal authority of Ranger
#+end_quote

Named are rare enough that I think we have to expand the scope to larger polities than academic institutions. There are multiple isolationist states in Calernia--the Kingdom Under, the Titanomachy, the Golden Broom, and, to an extent, Daoine--and at least three of the four explicitly have, or have had, Named. It's rare for their people to leave for any reason, and we have little evidence of them spitting out their Named to wreak havoc on the outside world. Likewise, all have been politically stable for centuries, which means they can't be suffering extreme, regular internal strife from Named conflict. It's entirely plausible that Named could gather in one place without running rampant, especially if that place grants them a controlled fashion to settle disputes in the form of duels.

#+begin_quote
  There's simply no other reason for mostly combative Named to stay together for an extended period of time.
#+end_quote

It's worth noting that, while most Named engage in combat in the series, their Names aren't inherently focused on it. Adjutant, Scribe, and the various ruling Names all deal primarily with administration and organization. Sorcerous names have immense combat potential, but magic is a versatile tool--Hierophant, at the very least, would very much prefer research to combat. Names also vary based on culture and the sociopolitical climate. Adjutant is the first orc Named since the Praesi conquest of the Steppes, and his Name bears no resemblance to historical Orc names. In times of peace, it's likely that combative Names would emerge less frequently.

Also, they'll go because enough important people are working together that it's easier than /not/ going. Not all Names are equal.

  Other than that, the proposed subjects are something that would be expected to be a part of the treaty instead. If the idea /started/ with building a magic academy, and had the conditions for Named participation tacked on later, I would understand, since the magic studies are actually subject to the kind of centralization needed for that (from separate mage towers to extended apprenticeship systems to whole orders and libraries)
#+end_quote

I agree with you here, but maybe for different reasons than the ones you bring up. You're definitely right that magical academia would benefit from centralization, but more importantly, it would /scale/. There are enough people with magical potential that an academy would have /huge/ returns. For Named, though? You don't need a university, and you certainly don't need a university /city/. There are maybe one or two hundred named on the continent at any given time, and they probably only need a semester or two of schooling to grasp the ins and outs of the proposed laws regulating Named behavior. There would never be enough of them at the school to justify its existence by themselves.

#+begin_quote
  the pitch was stated as “put all the mentors in one place, and build a city there” (why?). That doesn't look much more stable than regular mentor story, and we know how those are supposed to end.
#+end_quote

The chapter doesn't actually say anything about mentors. Obviously, the academy would have instructors, and at least some of them would be Named, but the goal isn't to make the academy itself into a story. The instructors' goal wouldn't be to form a relationship with students, but to provide information. Teachers, in this instance, are an expendable, interchangeable part of the machinery of education.

#+begin_quote
  What's supposed to be special about a Named directly telling other Named “do not break those” that can't be subverted over generations the same way normal treaties are?
#+end_quote

"Over generations" is a big part of this, I think. Sure, someone born decades into peacetime might not know the horrors of war, and might think it's a good idea to break the rules, but villains in this setting /don't age/, and villains are among the architects of this plan. It would take a long time for the Accords to fall apart by attrition. Said architects are also some of the most experienced, powerful, and intimidating Named of an era, so that's a point in favor of obeying the rules. Eventually, though, the goal isn't to have a few big names enforcing the rules, it's to have /everyone/ enforcing the rules. If Calernia is free from Named conflict for a century, then some punk levels a city, it won't be just another Named running amok, it'll be /the biggest catastrophe in living memory/. People will see the horror for what it is, and they'll be tripping over themselves to stop the guilty party.

The only way the system can really fall apart at that point is if an entire side (Good or Evil) breaks from the Accords at once, or if enough Named from both sides worked together to subvert it. Granted, there's another possibility: the now organized and educated Named jointly come to the conclusion that they would rule better than current institutions. Don't really know what to do about that if it happens.

  I just don't get why is everyone so excited about this other than “lol we hogwarts now”.
