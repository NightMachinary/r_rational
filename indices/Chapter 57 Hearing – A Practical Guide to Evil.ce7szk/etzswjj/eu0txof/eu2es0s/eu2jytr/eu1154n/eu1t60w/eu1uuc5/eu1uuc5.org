Sorry, this isn't even a proper theory, just a guess. It just struck me how the phrase about “grooves appearing in the workings of Fate” doesn't necessarily mean that there should be a select few Named instead of an Arcadia-like setup, or why would there be a Fate in the first place. In the initial divine argument the final choice is what matters - and so the things that impact it are important for Gods, hence stories. But in the context of that same choice, Named don't make the same kind of sense. However my guess is just one option as to why they work like that.
