  Name one hero that was bestowed despite legal means being sufficient for resolving their core conflict.

Hierophant just wanted to do research and find a way to hack reality. Perfectly legal and sensible motivation, unlike 95% of Named who just want to start yet another nationalistic pissing contest(waaaaaah independence for Callow, waaaaaah your ruler is bad and we will crusade you to death) within their crab bucket of Calernia.

Of course, he is good as dead now, on account of losing his magic. And 95% of other Named want some variation of "I am sad because big bad people hurt my feelings, and no I don't understand how systemic incentives work, gotta go stab the biggest baddest guy in the face right now". So yeah, it's not looking workable.
