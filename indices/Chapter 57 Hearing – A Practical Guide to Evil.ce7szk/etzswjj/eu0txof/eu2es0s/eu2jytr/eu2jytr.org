Yeah, the whole academy things seems super weird to me. I really don't see how they could make it work.

Like, if someone's Name is "The Sadistic Assassin" or "The Anarchist", why would they ever accept to attend that school? Because other Named would force them? Saint's death shows that Named aren't great at coordinating to enforce rules, especially across the Above-Below divide.

And why would the Dominion ever agree to these terms, let alone the friggin Dread Empire? They were almost willing to start an open war just to retrieve the Pilgrim's body, why would they accept to send their Named to another jurisdiction?

And, even accepting that every nation somehow manages to enforce mandatory attendance... wouldn't the resulting school be super-segregated, Good students sticking with Good students and reciprocally, with mutual sabotage attempts and the like?
