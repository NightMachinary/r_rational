So, everybody seems to like it, so I'm probably missing something. That said, as much as I like school settings (when they're in the story with a generally younger cast), aren't the Named just, well, /not about that/? If I understand Bard's implied bargain correctly, it was supposed to limit the divine pissing contest and Fate influence to champions, and instead backfired by Named dragging everyone else into their conflicts, and Bard being forced to keep it going. But how is /compulsory education/ a “play on the alleged purpose of creation”?

The notion doesn't seem to be congruous with the setting. Even if we're talking about a medieval /universitas/-like institution - with disputes, riots and all - the only precedent to that is Refuge, and it's held together by the personal authority of Ranger, and only “teaches” combat-related subjects. There's simply no other reason for mostly combative Named to stay together for an extended period of time. Cat's idea is reflective of her origins as a Squire explicitly mentored by a Black Knight, but why would anybody else be agreeing to that?

Other than that, the proposed subjects are something that would be expected to be a part of the treaty instead. If the idea /started/ with building a magic academy, and had the conditions for Named participation tacked on later, I would understand, since the magic studies are actually subject to the kind of centralization needed for that (from separate mage towers to extended apprenticeship systems to whole orders and libraries), but the pitch was stated as “put all the mentors in one place, and build a city there” (why?). That doesn't look much more stable than regular mentor story, and we know how those are supposed to end. What's supposed to be special about a Named directly telling other Named “do not break those” that can't be subverted over generations the same way normal treaties are?

I just don't get why is everyone so excited about this other than “lol we hogwarts now”. Hogwarts was specifically modeled after old private schools, and while an academy is a good point to shift the focus from direct conflict to learning, on the current Calernia it's not a /starting/ point.
