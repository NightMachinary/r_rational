I would be interested to see how/whether the Academy comes to be and whether it ends up influencing Names. Of course, people have name(Name) dropped things like Pitiless Tutor and whatnot, but what I'm talking about are how the Academy will influence things like public perception of Names, as well as the Stories and Roles that are fundamental in determining and empowering aspects.

Like, with all Named being more or less held accountable to a higher power (Academy and the Accords), will their Names and aspects be less powerful? Heroes and Villains draw their power from their Stories, and I feel like a Story that goes 'It all began at the Academy, where I had to answer to professors and higher laws' takes away from the romantic elements of heroic and villainous stories, which are in part what empowers Names.
