At the moment it does! I actually have suspicions about that.

Neshamah has agreed to a 30-year truce, which went into effect during the battle for the Twilight Ways. There are only three ways to resolve the Neshamah conflict by force in the story:

1. A time skip. The story jumps ahead 30 years, then resumes. This feels like an ugly solution to me.
2. Neshamah breaks the truce. Unlikely, because Neshamah is far too competent to set himself up as the traitor in a story.
3. The Grand Alliance breaks the truce. More likely, because the Grand Alliance isn't a monolith, and any one party could break ranks to restart hostilities. Still somewhat unlikely, however, because almost everyone is in bad shape and would welcome the respite. And, again, it would put them at a disadvantage as traitors in the story.

In the end, I think the only way the truce is broken is if someone in the Alliance backstabs them. It could happen!

I think a more likely scenario is that the war with Neshamah never resumes in earnest, at least during the series. He discovered something about Bard when he was possessing Hierophant, and I think that's the setup for the big finale. My theory is that something everyone has taken for granted is a fabrication by Bard, and Neshamah finally has enough of a foothold to reveal the lie and turn the tide against her.

That might mean the drow exodus thread doesn't get wrapped up in-book, since they were promised Keter, but I think PGtE is grand enough in scale that some threads have to stay loose. It's not realistic to end with "And all of Calernia's problems were satisfactorily addressed for a while after that."
