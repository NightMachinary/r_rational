You missed his “don't look at the other prisoners, look at the bars” speech; after witnessing the unmaking of his childhood home, the unraveling of the secrets of Creation /is/ his personal struggle. Besides, he's not a hero: villains start with an explicit desire to reshape the world way more often.

As for your (unnecessarily oversimplified) demonstration of initial motivation - yeah, stories are for making the political struggle personal for the hero. Not sure how an academy far away from their region of origin is supposed to help with that.
