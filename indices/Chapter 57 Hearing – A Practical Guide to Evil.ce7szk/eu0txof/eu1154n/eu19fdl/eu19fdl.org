Or, more directly, because “the mentor said so” isn't that good a reason for anyone outside of Levant - and not even all Named there. The idea to drag everyone into the same city misses a whole swathe of stories about more standalone Named, and those whose Roles are about circumventing the law, like rogues and schemers. A lot of those need to be cut out, like diabolists and angelic intervention, but not all, and it doesn't address the problem of what to do with their stories (that are both the core of the problem and not going to disappear on their own).

Likewise, “the Accords say so” is a motivation of a politician running a country subject to them, not of Named that speak mostly for themselves. You need a way to enforce that, and Names /exist/ for transcending those kinds of restrictions. Name /one/ hero that was bestowed despite legal means being sufficient for resolving their core conflict.
