I think the whole point is that the school is a microcosm for the wider world while they develop their skills, so they can do their random and big bullshit out there.

This also /really/ reminds me of a [[https://mangadex.org/title/9854/maou-na-ano-ko-to-murabito-a][manga]] though.\\
It's a Japanese high school where there are special students with "Roles" that they try their best to fulfil.

What does that sound like?
