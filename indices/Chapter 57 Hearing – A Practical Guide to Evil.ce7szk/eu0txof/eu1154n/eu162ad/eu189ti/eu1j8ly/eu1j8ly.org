You do realize that a standard manga/LN setting of “let's take a typical (usually Japanese) high school and cram it somewhere it /really/ doesn't belong in” is usually a consequence of the high school setting being familiar to the audience and not a good in-universe reason, right? If the end result is anything remotely close to what the comments are bursting with right now, that might be sufficient reason to drop the series.

School-themed spinoffs are, well, spinoffs, and doing that to PGtE would turn it into a parody of itself. So far it looks like it's another attempt like introduction of “just war”: it aims to exclude the unsavory elements like madmen and rogues, instead of addressing them by undermining their Roles' reason to exist. It can be subverted the same way.
