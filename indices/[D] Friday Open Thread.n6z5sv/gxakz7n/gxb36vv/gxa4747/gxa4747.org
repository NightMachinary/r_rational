Is anyone here familiar with (I guess) both basic stats and set theory? I'm OK at the former but well out of my depth in the latter and looking for a way to complete the following analogy:

#+begin_example
  Correlation :: Jaccard Similarity
  Partial Correlation :: ?
#+end_example

More details in a thread I posted yesterday here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/n6krb5/partial_correlation_equivalent_of_a_jaccard_index/]]

Any suggestions would be appreciated!
