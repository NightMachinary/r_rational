There are people calling Eliezer Yudkowsky a cult leader and someone that doesn't qualify to be an ethical AI theorist/artificial intelligence researcher, prime example being [[/r/sneerclub]]. What does [[/r/rational]] think of this?

Personally, I don't know much of the guy and his works; I dropped HPMOR as I disliked Harry (not that it makes the story bad, just not my taste). I don't think I can accept calling him an ethical AI theorist/artificial intelligence researcher if he didn't go to college for it. Or at least, no more than I can call Rolf Dobelli of "The Art of Thinking Clearly" a Cognitive Scientist. Rolf Dobelli is a well-respected author even if he isn't.
