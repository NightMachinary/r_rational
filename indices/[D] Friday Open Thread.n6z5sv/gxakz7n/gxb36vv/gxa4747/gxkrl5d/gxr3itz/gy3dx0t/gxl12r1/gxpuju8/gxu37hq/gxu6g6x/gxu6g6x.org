  What do you think my argument is, exactly?

It wasn't clear, but if I'm being frank, I was hedging my bets that your original comment was that of a die-hard Yudkowsky supporter aggressively putting down a doubter and also attempting to prevent any further responses.

Whatever the intent, that level of aggression, sarcasm, and dismissal is not conducive to discussion. [[/u/HantuAnggara][u/HantuAnggara]] made a reasonable point and presented it in a reasonable manner, and ideally other responses would bring in more evidence or present counterpoints so as to further the overall discussion. But instead of explaining why you think he's wrong and why you consider Yudkowsky to be qualified, you essentially just told him to shut up. With an actual argument tacked on, buried a bit beneath the shut up.

There's a time and a place for that sort of response, but generally that is after /someone else/ throws the first verbal punch.
