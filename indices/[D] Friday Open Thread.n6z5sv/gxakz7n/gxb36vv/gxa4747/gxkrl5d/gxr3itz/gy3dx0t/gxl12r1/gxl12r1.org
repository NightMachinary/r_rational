I'm inclined to agree with you about HPMOR, but before that I'd like to see a diploma in an relevant field(eg. English Lit, etc) to know whether you're qualified to even profess such an opinion.

As to your comment on Yudkowsky's lack of qualifications in the field of AI, seeing as you've also admitted to not having any qualifications in the field yourself please keep your diploma-less mouth shut. Unless you have a degree in a field of Pedagogy? That would allow one to perform a meta-analysis on diploma deficiency, I suppose. Scanned copies of any relevant diplomas and valid ID will do, but know that I will be contacting the institutions to verify.

Please reply forthwith.
