My favorite way of interpreting standard quantum mechanics is the ontologically agnostic view. To me, the moral of quantum mechanics is that the more completely you isolate a system, the less you can say about the existence, persistence, and behavior of particular states. In the quantum world, existence is synonymous with observation, and therefore interaction. If you don't interact with something, you can't say whether it exists in any particular way. Only once you define and subsequently open the channel of interaction, do you observe things to exist in some way.

Applying this to the entanglement scenario, what happens is that since you've managed to isolate two correlated particles from the rest of existence, you can't say how they exist until you interact with them, and that by defining how you interact with your particle (choosing a basis) you define how your partner's correlated particle will appear to you. What you can't do is influence how your partner's particle will appear to them. That will be defined on how they end up defining the interaction (which basis they choose).
