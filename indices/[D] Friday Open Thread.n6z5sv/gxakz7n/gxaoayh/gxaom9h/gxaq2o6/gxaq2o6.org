Sorry, yes, realised that would lead to confusion but you spotted it before I deleted :)

Imagine you hold up a coin so someone in front of you can see one side, and someone behind you the other. Someone stands in front of you and sees heads; they can instantly deduce someone standing behind you will see tails, but this deduction does not give them a means to communicate with that person.

This is a nice intuition pump but as you noticed it does not actually reflect what's happening with entangled particles, where there are no hidden variables - there is no way round a coin is until someone looks.

Imagine the coin is spinning rapidly, and the act of someone looking at it instantly makes it stop. You can never observe it spinning, you can only see one side or the other. This still doesn't help - the person standing in front is in exactly the same situation as before with respect to the person standing behind.

This still isn't /quite/ what's going on with entanglement, but closer, and getting even closer to what's actually going on doesn't help the observers communicate in the same way that the change to the model above didn't help.
