I'll try to clarify how the measurements work. The usual example is of the polarization of light.

In an unknown state, the polarization can be in any direction.

Possible polarisations: | / - \

When you measure the polarization, you choose what basis you want to measure it in. Let's say we use the vertical and horizontal basis.

Measurement basis: + (rather than the diagonal basis X)

In this basis, the measurement states are horizonal polarization or vertical polarization. If the unknown state corresponds to one of those, it will stay in that state. Otherwise, it collapses into one of those states, with the closer one being more likely. You can think of it as snapping into one of them, like prodding a Phillips screw with a flathead screwdriver.

| -> |

/ -> | or - at random

- -> -

\ -> | or - at random

So if you measure the polarization as vertical, that doesn't mean it was vertical to begin with, it could've been a diagonal state that was forced into the vertical measurement state when you took the measurement.

Let's say you invite your friend to measure the particle too. If they use the horizonal and vertical basis, they'll get the same result as you, but they have no way of telling whether you made a measurement before them - the probability of it coming up horizonal or vertical is unchanged. There's no way to communicate information just by taking a measurement.

When you have two entangled particles, you can measure the state with either of them even if they're in different places, but the same rules apply - you still can't communicate just by taking a measurement.

Does that make sense? Apologies if I misunderstood your question
