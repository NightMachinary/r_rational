You could accomplish the shared timing by printing out two copies of a random time and sticking them in envelopes to open when you arrive. I wouldn't call that FTL coordination, and it doesn't require quantum mechanics.

Using entangled particles could serve to improve the security of your communication by using quantum cryptography, but that's a separate topic. Happy to talk about that if you're interested, though.
