Correct. You'd have a huge box that somehow contains a bunch of particle pairs, and every time you ran out of bits to send messages with, you'd need to have some more particles shipped in from the place you're trying to talk to.

The impossible magic supermaterial would be some sort of super-particle pair where wiggling one instantly wiggles the other. That would indeed allow for FTL communication (and, interestingly enough, time travel) but as far as we're aware that isn't a thing and can't physically exist.
