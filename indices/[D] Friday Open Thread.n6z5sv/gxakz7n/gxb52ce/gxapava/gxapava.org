It's a standard-but-boring correlation/causation thing that popsci articles blew way out of proportion. To offer an analogy, it's like trying to communicate by establishing a special office where they make outwardly identical pairs of envelopes where the word "yes" is written on a slip inside one envelope and "no" is written on a slip inside the other, then mailing someone one of the two envelopes at random along with instructions to take the out the current slip, cross out the current word on it, write down the opposite of their actual response (which still has to be yes or no) and then throw it into the fireplace so that your envelope back home will magically transmute itself to have their reply, because "durrr, the magic slips always have the opposite words in them, the paper office makes sure of it". Obviously that doesn't work, and the reason why quantum communicators can't work is basically the same logic, except with an extra layer of quantum physics explaining how exactly the "envelopes" are being produced, shipped and altered.
