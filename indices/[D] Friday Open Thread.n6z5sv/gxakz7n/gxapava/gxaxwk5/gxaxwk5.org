Wait, so all of the "entangled/quantum particle linked FTL Communication" in fiction would functionally be space ships with those letter pairs? I feel so betrayed. I always thought they were a theoretically possible material that might be practically impossible, like warp drives and huge amounts of antimatter.

Edit: Read the wiki entry for action at a distance. Turns out my understanding of quantum entanglement via 50 year old Einstein quotes criticizing it as "spooky action at a distance" wasn't a good foundation
