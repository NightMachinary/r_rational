It is often said that quantum entanglement is not capable of permitting FTL communication. The reason I most often see given for it is the somewhat circular logic of "because the laws of physics forbid FTL communication"; that is, instead of explaining why quantum entanglement can't do it, the person instead explains why it is forbidden for quantum entanglement to be able to do it.

I find this somewhat dissatisfying. I've read a bit about what the mechanical reason is, and it seems to boil down to "entangled particles don't actually affect each other, they merely behave exactly the same way as each other; so you can't use them to communicate". Is that about as accurate a statement as I'm going to get/understand as a layperson, or would someone care to correct me here?
