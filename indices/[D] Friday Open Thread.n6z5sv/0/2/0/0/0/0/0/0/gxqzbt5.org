I can confirm it does this because it includes almost exactly the contents of your post early on - I literally ended up rereading the relevant bit of exposition to check you weren't quoting - and concepts develop from there.

As for whether it does it /well/, YMMV, I guess - some of the conclusions are... surprising, though not entirely without precedent in the literature.

Overall it's nowhere as rigorous a piece of physics fanfiction as, say, the novels Greg Egan writes (though, as is common with those works, there is an appendix developing some of the maths touched upon), but it certainly fits somewhere on that scale, and makes up for it by being rather less dry. Certainly I enjoyed it :)
