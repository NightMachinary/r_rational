Interesting. So, presumably, I'd still be able to coordinate with someone faster than light if we agreed on what to do beforehand?

For instance, suppose that we have a large number of entangled particles, we measure them and translate the state into a time, and then we rob a bank in, say, the Earth and Mars at the same time.
