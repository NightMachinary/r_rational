This is great and we're making progress, but I still have questions, and I hope you don't mind answering them.

Is it possible to measure in such a way that the random distribution you get from the / \ collapse is skewed? Hypothetically, if you could, it seems that you could have a million of them and a pre-set time, and use it to transmit a probabilistic bit. So I'm guessing you can't?
