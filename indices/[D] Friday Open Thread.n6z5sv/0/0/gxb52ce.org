Sort of, here's how I'd put it:

When a particle is in an unknown quantum state, the only way to get information about that state out of it is to perform a measurement on the particle. That forces the particle into one of the measurement states and tells you which one it ends up in. However, you can't control which measurement state it goes to. Once a particle is in a measurement state, performing the same measurement on it will get the same result.

With quantum entanglement, two particles share the same state. That means a measurement of one of the particles will be a measurement of the shared state, and so it forces both particles into that measurement state even if they're physically separate.

That means you can have one of the particles and send the other to a friend, and when you measure yours, your friend's particle is also put into the measurement state. However, you can't do anything with that because when you take the measurement you can't control what state it ends up in. In fact, your friend won't even be able to tell that you made a measurement at all, because when they take a measurement of their particle it'll look the same as if they were the one to measure it first.
