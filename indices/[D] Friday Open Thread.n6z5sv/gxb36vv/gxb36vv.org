I got my second COVID vaccination last week. No "flu-like symptoms," but it turns out that if you get migraines, that can trigger them.

I don't know if anybody else on here gets migraines, but I thought I should mention it just in case. Obviously do get vaccinated anyway, but make sure you're prepared (I can work through the flu but can't do much with a migraine, so it sorta threw my workflow out of whack).
