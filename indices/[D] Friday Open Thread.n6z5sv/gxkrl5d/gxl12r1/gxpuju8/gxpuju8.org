First, I'm going to state that I'm neutral to Yudkowsky, I have no strong opinions about him either way.

Secondly I am not a doctor of any sort, I have never been to medical school. Therefore, I am not qualified to decide whether or not that guy offering cosmetic surgery, operating out of the back of a van, is a medical professional who will follow proper hygienic standards.

This is, frankly, not even straw-manning your argument.

You don't need a degree in a field to /be able to tell if someone is competent in a field/. That's just ridiculous. /Verifying/ is almost always easier than /doing/; you don't need a degree to compare post-operation complication rates between a doctor and a 'doctor', or hell, even just check if they sanitize their tools. Maybe you'd need to be a doctor to /decide if/ sanitizing tools is a thing that should be done, but there are doctors, they've decided that, and they've told us all, so you don't need to be a doctor.

Now, this does not translate perfectly to AI ethical theorism, because to the best of my knowledge there aren't really degrees in AI ethics. It's scarcely a field at all. Or at least, not as far as strong-AI ethics is concerned.

But this means that OP is (if we're only counting formal education), /just as qualified as Yudkowsky/. You can't dismiss his opinion on the basis of formal education without even moreso dismissing Yudkowsky, since OP is merely trying to verify while Yudkowsky is trying to /do/.

If Yudkowsky is qualified to theorize about AI ethics without a formal education, we're qualified to /judge/ him without formal education. The lack of a standardized regulatory body as a basis for more objective comparison means that we just have to do the legwork ourselves. In other words, individuals' competence should be judged by their known experience and knowledge, and the weight given to any arguments should be on the basis of how well-reasoned they are.
