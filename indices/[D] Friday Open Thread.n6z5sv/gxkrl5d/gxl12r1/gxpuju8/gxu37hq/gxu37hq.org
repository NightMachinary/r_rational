What do you think my argument is, exactly? Because I was just taking the piss of the guy's argument by using reductio ad absurdum. I'm honestly shocked that you could misinterpret my short little comment so fucking much, and write so much while under that misapprehension.

  If Yudkowsky is qualified to theorize about AI ethics without a formal education, we're qualified to judge him without formal education

The original argument by [[/u/HantuAnggara][u/HantuAnggara]] is that yudkowsky /isn't/ qualified *because* of his lack of formal education. I made light of that argument by reducing it to a ridiculous extreme. I /obviously/ wasn't actually arguing that one should have a diplomas before being a smoothbrain mouthbreather online and sneering at people, like you two are doing. I WAS MAKING FUN OF THAT CONCEPT.
