All opinion:

To my lay knowledge and outsider perspective to his rational community, Yudkowsky is an ambitious self-taught philosopher. His research has a very narrow focus ("humanity might create a godlike intelligence at some point in the future, the most likely avenue for that is AI, and when we do it we'd better know how to not fuck it up"). The fact that the godlike intelligence is likely to be an AI is almost inconsequential to the core of the work (as far as I can tell), but he isn't willfully ignorant about developments in AI. He might not be in "the club" of AI researchers, but his work is dependent on the field.

And crucially, you don't have to have an academic background to be a philosopher. But also crucially, most philosophy is ridiculous and useless. It's a fine line to walk. On utilitarian grounds, I would say it's better than not to have /someone/ thinking about this problem, and Yudkowsky seems intelligent enough to put some actual creative thinking into it. There are a lot of other existential risks out there, though, and balancing resources between them intelligently is difficult. On the whole, I would rather donate to the old standard Effective Altruism causes, like cheap long-lasting mosquito nets to prevent malaria, but I don't think it's a bad thing that MIRI exists.

One reason people have cultish vibes from some of his writings is because the idea of the big, shining Singularity with a capital S smacks of a pro-science atheist version of a doomsday cult. And he is definitely a charismatic writer, judging by the fervent following he has gained in the communities he founded. I would argue against him being a true cult leader based on the lack of separation rhetoric. As far as I know, Yudkowsky does not want his followers to separate from the rest of the world and become completely reliant on his supposed "cult". He's more like Ayn Rand: a charismatic writer who speaks to and is believed by a certain sort of person.

I read at some point that his ulterior motive for HPMOR was to attract that particular sort of person and get their help on his AI alignment project, but I don't think it was particularly successful. BUT if his writings have inspired people to try to be smarter, and to think more deeply about the world, that's at least a better track record than someone like Ayn Rand.

Bottom line, I don't worship the guy, but I appreciate him for what he is and what he's trying to do. I also do not agree with the modern academic system, and do not think it is the end-all-be-all of qualification, so I am biased in that regard.
