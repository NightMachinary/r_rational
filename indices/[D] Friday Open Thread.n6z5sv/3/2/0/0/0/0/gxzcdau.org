I thought it was hostile myself, which is why I didn't bother replying.

I didn't mean one couldn't have an opinion unless they had a degree on the subject... To me, there are two types of opinions: layman and expert. If I were to take EY's take on the matter as an expert one, I'd treat it like a suggestion from a doctor that is treating me. If I were to treat like it was from a layman, I'd do my own research and search for expert takes before deciding/opining.

I believe it's important to discern between the two. After all, taking "advice" from someone that appears educated yet unqualified is one of the major reasons why opinions like anti-vaccine is so prevalent.

If, even after calling him an ethical AI theorist, I have to take EY's perspective as a layman's then the term 'theorist' would only hold as much meaning/weight as an 'ancient alien theorist/historian' on the History Channel does. If that's the case, then I suppose you wouldn't need academic qualifications to become one.

As to whether he's actual researcher, that is something I'm unclear on. As [[/u/WhispersOfSeaSpiders]] said, EY has released research papers. Problem being a majority if not all [[https://intelligence.org/all-publications/][MIRI papers]] are released on arXiv where papers are not peer reviewed.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/73rht/not_everything_on_arxiv_can_be_trusted/][Example of a crackpot paper on arXiv (not EY's, just an example)]]. Since the papers may not be legitimate, I wouldn't be comfortable calling him a researcher either. But maybe I am missing something as I am very new to this. I hope to be proven wrong and that they are legitimate.

I'd actually love it if he has always been qualified for these things and people are just hating on him. He kinda popularized the rational writing style and I like it. AI is a field I want to get into (I just have a CS diploma), so he'd gain my respect too.

I hope I come across as ignorant and curious this time, not hostile and malicious.
