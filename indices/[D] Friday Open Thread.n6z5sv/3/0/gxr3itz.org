It's been several years and I'm a layman to computer science, but I remember looking into MIRI and reviewing some of their research papers on the topics you mentioned (which seemed pretty par for research papers).

Based on that, if Eliezer's still contributing to that work then I don't see why he couldn't be called an ethical AI theorist/artificial intelligence researcher. You don't need a degree to conduct research, after all.
