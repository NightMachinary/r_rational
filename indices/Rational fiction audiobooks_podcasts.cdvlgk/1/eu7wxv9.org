If you're listening to Worm you might be interested in the audiobooks for [[http://www.mediamdpodcast.com/feed/podcast/pact-audiobook][Pact]] and [[http://audiotwig.dauber.kim/][Twig]].

In non-Wildbow works, [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705][The Metropolitan Man]] has an audiobook version, but I haven't listened to any of it myself.
