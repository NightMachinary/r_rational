[META] - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56uzvp/bst_q_request_itt_post_reactions_to_latest/d8pe4ch][This poster]] raises an interesting point. This thread is not really properly showing the emotional impact of having Vermont flattened by an asteroid impact. People would have relatives there - people would be angry - people would be upset. That level of sheer /hurt/ is not being reflected. We're - most of us - discussing the situation as though it were something that never really happened. We're analysing it, we're not emoting about it. Our parents, aunts, uncles, cousins are okay, none of them were really killed. We haven't felt that emotional impact, and so this thread isn't really reflecting it...
