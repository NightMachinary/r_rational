[META] Yeah, the problem is, acting emoting is /really really/ hard, like, you need to be a legitimate actor or proper author or something to have a good idea of how to talk. I'd probably be way too melodramatic if I tried to write a post in that sort of voice.

I think the person who shared the 911 thread on slashdot had the best idea. That's the tone that's probably most suitable now.

Also, given it's a rat!fic, it'd be quite easy to say "amid the torrent of overwhelming sadness at the injuistice at it all, there were also...." and only quote the "interesting" ones. Though it'd probably be best to have some wailing and gnashing of teeth, tone-wise, because you're right, we forget that the asteroid on Ventura county killed a ton of people.
