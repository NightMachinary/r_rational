You gotta go through a tube and stuff, and the machines are rare and expensive. You need a qualified uninfested person to interpret the results. The subject needs to lie PERFECTLY still, good luck getting children to do it. Do you need a contrast for an MRI? If so, you need people to administer that and monitor for adverse reactions. You can't use one if you've got metal in your body. etc.

A single vaccine you can train someone to do well enough in an hour, I'm guessing. You can go to schools, offices, etc and vaccinate one person a minute every minute.
