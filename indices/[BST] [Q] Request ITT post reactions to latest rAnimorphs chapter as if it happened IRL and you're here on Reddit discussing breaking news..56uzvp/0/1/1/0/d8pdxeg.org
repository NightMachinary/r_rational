<meta> How on earth would a government or military actually fight the Yeerks? Any scientific test for them, /anything anyone does/ is automatically suspect, how do you they're not a controller?

Coming from someone who enjoys idly fantasising about how well I'd deal with a zombie apocalypse or whatever, I can't imagine how crushingly demoralising that would be. I can imagine fatalism a la the French command in WWII being a common response. Why bother trying when you're so obviously fucked?
