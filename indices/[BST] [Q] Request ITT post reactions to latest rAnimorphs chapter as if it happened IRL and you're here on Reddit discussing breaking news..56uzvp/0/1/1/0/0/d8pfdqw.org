There are ways, you would just have to spend some time thinking about them. For example, you could broadcast the MRI results live to a crowd of people which is statistically unlikely to be /entirely/ controllers. The important thing is to make sure large crowds are monitoring the "choke points" of information flow - you don't want any single area entirely made by controllers. You could also just have a live three day quarantine to be safe.

Come to think of it, this is a war that must be fought with very /rigorously/ public access to all important information. Because the single worst thing that can happen is if you have a tightly knit group operating in secret (say, the CIA) and every single one gets taken by yeerks and controls the entire public.

We can still have war secrets, but they can only be kept by a publicly verifiable uninfected cohort.

(I say "rigorous" because it must not be fake-able - for instance, having a media outlet disseminating information doesn't work if yeerks infest the whole outlet. No information is trustworthy unless a large mass of the public can verify how information flow happened)
