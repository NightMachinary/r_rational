That alien was able to freeze a man in place by waving at him. Who says it's not controlling its cow-body the same way?

They mentioned they need to leave every three days to eat, so they're [edit: *not*] drawing nutrients from the host.

Breathing is a bit more problematic, but they're aliens - who says they don't run on totally different principles, like eating small amounts of radioactive material and living off the heat?
