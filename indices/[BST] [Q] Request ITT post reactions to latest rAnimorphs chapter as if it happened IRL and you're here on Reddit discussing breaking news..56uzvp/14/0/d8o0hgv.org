Except even the Goa'uld were more plausible. The Goa'uld explicitly used the Jaffa as incubators for their young in order to help them be biologically compatible with humans. The ancients seeded life throughout the galaxy which is why they also had DNA and such.

These aliens just so happen to be bio-compatible for unexplained reasons... and I just realized that ancient aliens/panspermia is now a plausible hypothesis.
