If the stock market's any indication, a sizable amount of people seem to be expecting the planet to be glassed or equivalent soon. I know /I'm/ certainly not going to work this week.

As for the meteor, the risk seems too big. Remember that this is ostensibly where their base was in the first place: any enemy that knows from experience that they have kill-switches like that in place should just devote their efforts to getting it to trigger themselves, after which there would be nothing they could do to stop it.

Huh, didn't know about the blackout, but that's pretty telling. The timing of them realizing their "mistake" about enslaving humans and yet still having their plans so badly screwed up makes me all the more leery.
