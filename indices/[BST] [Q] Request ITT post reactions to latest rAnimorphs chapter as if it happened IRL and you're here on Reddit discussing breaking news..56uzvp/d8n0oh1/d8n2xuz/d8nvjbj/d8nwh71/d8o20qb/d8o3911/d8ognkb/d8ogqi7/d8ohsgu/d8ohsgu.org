Maybe just like Yeerks have invisibility cloaks (or something) that shields their ships from our telescopes, Andalite invisibility cloaks can (at least sometimes) shield their ships from Yeerk observation? Or if they've got portable versions, maybe they gave them to these hypothetical human teenagers?

I'm just speculating - but now that we know invisibility cloaks exist, we need to reevaluate a whole lot of our tactical assumptions. For all we know, [[/u/CCC_037]], the Yeerks effectively might not have reliable security cameras.
