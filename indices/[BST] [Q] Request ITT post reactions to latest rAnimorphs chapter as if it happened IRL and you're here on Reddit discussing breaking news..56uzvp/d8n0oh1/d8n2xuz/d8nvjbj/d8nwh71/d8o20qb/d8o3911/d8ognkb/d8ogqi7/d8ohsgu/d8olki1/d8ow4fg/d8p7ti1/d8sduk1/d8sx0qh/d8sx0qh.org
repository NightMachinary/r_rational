Yeah, but it's not like we can't detect them, we just have to not use radar.

And any system that includes a human is /going/ to be putting out waste heat or will cook the human in fairly short order. So, I mean, I can get that they can make some sort of invisibility cloak that'll work when it's a kilometre away; but not that they can't detect one when it's actually /inside their ship/.
