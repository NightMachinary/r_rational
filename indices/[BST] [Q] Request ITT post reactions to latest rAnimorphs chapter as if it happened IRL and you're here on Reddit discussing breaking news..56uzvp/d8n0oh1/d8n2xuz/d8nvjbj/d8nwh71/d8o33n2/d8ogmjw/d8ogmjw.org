If fighting aliens who can crawl into your brain and control it, then splitting the party is the /last/ thing you do, because once one of your group is out of sight you can never be sure he's not controlled next time you meet him.

Mind you, I can see teenagers getting that wrong. But I can't see teenagers who would get that wrong /winning/ against /aliens with mind control/.
