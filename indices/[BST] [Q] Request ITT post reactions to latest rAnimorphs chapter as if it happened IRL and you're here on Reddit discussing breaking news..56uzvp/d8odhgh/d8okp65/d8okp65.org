I really hope this technology isn't held onto by the military. They'll try, but hopefully even our government will see there's a clear public interest in letting at least the non-weaponizable stuff out, like the engines.

(Yes, I'm sure someone will come up with a way to weaponize that - we did it with planes - but I doubt an alien engine is cheap enough for terrorists to make them.)
