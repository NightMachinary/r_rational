Guys I had an aunt and an uncle in Ventura, are you telling me they fucking died because of this alien's 'dead man's switch'??! Were they even themselves when they died, or were they just hosts to alien body snatchers?!

Fucking hell, Thanksgiving (I'm Canadian) was already going to be an absolute wreck this year with them dead and /now this/.
