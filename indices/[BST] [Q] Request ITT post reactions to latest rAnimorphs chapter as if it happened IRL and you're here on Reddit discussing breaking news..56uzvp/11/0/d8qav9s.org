I did some thinking...every winter my family visited my aunt and uncle in Ventura to get away from the snow during Christmas break. This year, around the end of September when my mum called them to set up the dates...they said they couldn't host us this year. They said that my uncle had a business trip between Dec to Jan because it was really important that he impress his boss, and my aunt would be going with him. What kind of job makes their employees spend Christmas break away from their family!?

Guys, I...I don't think that was my aunt and uncle anymore at that point.
