Well, yeah, if we start looking for weird stuff in the story Esplin told, we'll be here all night. I'm working on the assumption that it's all bullshit until proven otherwise. No meteor, no meddling kids, no body-snatchers, maybe no aliens at all. The whole thing stinks.

I'm hung up on the secret agent thing because we can actually see it in the videos, and it doesn't make any sense. It's like he expected Esplin's appearance, and was prepared, and he knew somehow that he wasn't in real danger, other than being made to fall over. MIB guy didn't treat Esplin like an unknown alien, or like an ambassador, or like an unpredictable prisoner - he treated him like an escaped pet.
