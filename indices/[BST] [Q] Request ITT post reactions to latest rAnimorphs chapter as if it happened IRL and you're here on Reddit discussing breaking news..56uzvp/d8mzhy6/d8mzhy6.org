Okay, there's a ton of heavy stuff here... but can we talk about the random MIB dude?

Esplin had barely gotten out two sentences when this guy showed up, and a few angles show that the police just let him through. So this one, single guy, with no backup and no weapon I could see, he just confidently walks up to the self-professed alien war criminal with a sword for an ass.

/Then Esplin stuns the MIB dude!/ Right in the middle of talking about how he's learned to treat humans with dignity and respect! Then, only after Esplin has finished talking, MIB guy gets up and demonstrates that he apparently has the training and equipment to restrain a Yeerk space-cow, and he's still totally calm and collected despite having just been attacked.

So the police apparently finally get the memo to help MIB guy, and together, they stuff Esplin in the back of a black van and take off.

I don't want to be a conspiracy nutter here, and I don't know what any of this means, but... it's not just me, right? That's all /really fucking weird?/
