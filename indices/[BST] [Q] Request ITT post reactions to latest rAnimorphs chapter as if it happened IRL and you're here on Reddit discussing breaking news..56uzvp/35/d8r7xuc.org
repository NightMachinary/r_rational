I don't buy it. That 'asteroid' was probably a government weapons system, like the tungsten rod satellite things, and it either malfunctioned or was intentionally fired on the town (crater photos with map overlay HERE). Plus it's too convenient that aliens would just so happen to land in Washington DC, speak our language, breathe our air, and feel sorry for us. And the thing with the kids fighting them off is taken straight from a fucking movie.

I don't know what people are trying to get past us but aliens and a teenage resistance movement? Gimme a break.
