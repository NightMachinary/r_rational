Okay, no. This is - these aliens are nowhere /near/ advanced enough.

Look. Earth took billions of years to form, right? Then life formed. Some couple of billion years later, we get multicellular life. Then, nother billion years, intelligent life. Then a few million years before we settled down enough to start recording history. Then we're talking a few /thousand/ years to go from small villages with basic farming and ploughs to, well, internet and virutal reality and skyscrapers and everything. Each step takes less time than the previous step, right?

So, two intelligent species evolve. Fair enough. But each step in that process - there's no fixed length to them. Fraction of a percent difference one way or the other in the time it takes for intelligent life to turn up, and one life forms got a good couple of million years technology on the other.

Which means that there are only two reasonable ways we can expect to meet our first aliens. Either we go to their planet, and if we're /really/ lucky, and they're /really/ advanced, they've just discovered fire. Or, they come to our planet, and their technology's so far beyond ours that it might as well be magic, and will be completely incomprehensible; in short, they're wizards.

The idea that their technology is only a /little bit/ ahead of ours, to the point where we can usefully study it and learn from it, is laughable. Odds are this whole business was deliberately staged, start to end, with some unknown and possibly unknowable end goal.

(Mind you, I'm not entirely sure this "Esplin" was the one doing the staging. He might be a vat-grown creature with implanted memories. In fact, he probably is; he wants to die to sell his story, because that resonates with us, but he doesn't even know it's fake...)
