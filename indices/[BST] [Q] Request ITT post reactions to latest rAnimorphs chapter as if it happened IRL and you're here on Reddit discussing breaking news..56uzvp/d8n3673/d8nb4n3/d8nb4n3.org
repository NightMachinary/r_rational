[META] Canon Animorphs had a pretty good explanation for this: The Ellimist did it. More specifically, he seeded life on many, many, many different planets as part of his war for life against Crayak. Which is why most species in the story are compatible with morph tech and susceptible to yeerk infestation.

It might explain the closeness too: if he could have optimized the DNA seeds to create a fauna evolving into sentient species as fast as possible, reducing the variance in evolutional "distance".
