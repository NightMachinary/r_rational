To all of you in Toronto, we're having a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Ventura asteroid strike. Queen's Park, Oct 14, 8 pm. (FB link to the event). Due to the potential of a riot breaking out - there's been a lot of controversy around this Esplin's address to the world - police will be present to keep the peace. I'll be handing out black buttons with 'Remember the Victims of Ventura' on them. Will happily accept donations of any size to cover cost. There'll be a few others handing out [[http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/california/state-flower/california-poppy][orange variants]] of the Remembrance Day poppies.
