Exactly what [[/u/Evan_Th]] said. With science (as a body of knowledge) completely failing to predict what we have observed, I am looking to other cultural sources of knowledge. In this case, the aliens are a decent fit to various myths about demon possession.

I still believe in the scientific method, so I'll make some advanced predictions for you: The "aliens" "tech" is going to have even more BS capabilities that make no sense given their overall apparent technological capabilities. These capabilities will make more sense when considered literal magic.

So some examples of stuff from various mythology that they could try passing off as BS tech or limitations to their tech:

- Being limited to acting under various astrological conditions. They will probably try to explain this with some babble about the quantum state of the universe [META: apparently they are dependent on z-space configuration which can vary over time naturally?]

- Shapeshifting ability that ignores mass limitations. If they had this capability, why can't they instantly create spaceships or materials/supplies? Why couldn't they instantly make host bodies for themselves/parasite race? [META: yeah I went there]

- Weird and arbitrary weaknesses. I.e. cold iron, salt, silver, their reflections. If they have some particular weakness to say, an Earth food, that they don't have to other Earth foods, I am going to call it as a rough match to this. [META: the oatmeal isn't a perfect fit, but if you are already starting to buy this story...]

- Psychic Powers, especially if they fit under conceptual/metaphysical categories: I.e. control the weather, control war, control love, control the sea, etc.
