  What secrets has he built into this ship?

This is going to sound crazy... what if the ships are literal magic? As in entities primarily composed of mental phenomena are seeking a foothold in our reality and are posing as aliens to manipulate us. Building the ships gives them vessels to channel their power through.

It would explain the psychic powers and a lot of other implausibilities about their technology (see my comment for details).
