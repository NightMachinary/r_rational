So he's giving us two small alien ships - one of them destroyed - and saying that if we want to keep negotiating, meet his friends at Europa in five months. I assume he knows that we can't get to Europa in five months with current technology. So, that means we'll be going there either in his ship, or (possibly, if our factories are up to it) ships built from his plans.

What secrets has he built into this ship? Audiovisual bugs? Remote controls? Remote yeerk infestation units? Can't he have his friends meet us someplace closer instead - maybe our own Moon?
