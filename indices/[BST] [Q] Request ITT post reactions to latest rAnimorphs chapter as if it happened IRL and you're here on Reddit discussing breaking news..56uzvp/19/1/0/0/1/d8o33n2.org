Like [[/u/TK17Studios]] says, maybe they split the party. If I was fighting aliens who had the power of mind control, splitting the party would be about the first thing I'd do, just in case one of us got controlled, so they wouldn't be able to get the rest of us.

Alternatively, maybe they did some slow-acting sabotage to the ship.

Or maybe they didn't do any of this, but Esplin's guessing they might have.
