Yeah... this is starting to remind me of Starcraft II. We're in the fun-filled position of people fighting off the Zergs when the Protoss arrive and start cleansing everything. That's... fuck. fuck fuck.

Re - The deadman's switch: They might be telling the truth. Like, if you put a giant "if we lose we destroy everything" deadman's switch in place, you're not going to put any way to deactivate it in place. If you do, you're just begging for someone to hack them. And I guess his comment on "orders" and "subordinates" meant when they put the deadman's switch in place, not when it triggered? Or maybe they saw their fortress in Ventura explode and jumped to conclusions? I'm not trying to make excuses, mind you. Millions of people died in that explosion.

Re-Ventura: The most suspicious thing I heard of is there was a complete blackout in the city, and everything including internet and phone lines and traffic lights lost power at the same time, half-an hour before the meteor struck. At the time, the official explanation was "It's either because part of the meteor struck early and hit the power grid, or it's a coincidence, or it's not. We don't know". Maybe they were trying to cut communications to cover up their fortress exploding.
