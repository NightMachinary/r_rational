  If the stock market's any indication, a sizable amount of people seem to be expecting the planet to be glassed or equivalent soon. I know I'm certainly not going to work this week.

...This just occurred to me. How easy is it to get a hold of drugs if you have no prior contacts and none of your friends use drugs. The planet is now a lot likelier to be glassed or humanity enslaved... mind as well enjoy things? Unless my demon theory is true, in which case I should keep a clear, sober mind in case the mechanic of alien control is actually possession.

  Huh, didn't know about the blackout, but that's pretty telling. The timing of them realizing their "mistake" about enslaving humans and yet still having their plans so badly screwed up makes me all the more leery.

The aliens have the technology to automatically blackout media in a given area? Anything else would be through the whole "mistake" story into suspicion.
