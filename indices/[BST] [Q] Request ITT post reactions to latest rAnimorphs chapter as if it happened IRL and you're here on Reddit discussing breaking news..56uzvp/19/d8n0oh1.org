Okay, hold on... he said Ventura was executed on his "orders" and carried out by his "subordinates." So what's with this "dead-man switch" bullshit? Anyone else catch that? Doesn't add up. Aliens this technologically advanced, and that's his excuse for half a million people dead? "Oops, we didn't put in an off switch?"

Also, fuck this guy with his two ships. That's supposed to make us feel better? We have no idea how many of them there are, or how powerful their technology is. These could be their equivalent of slingshots.

Unless one of these teenage resistance fighters (I don't even know where to begin on that) shows up soon and corroborates, it would be absolutely stupid of us to take his word for anything. And when that teenager shows up, they'd better be willing to submit to whatever test is needed to make sure there's nothing in their head that shouldn't be.

Anyone here had friends or family in Ventura? Were they acting weird at all before it got hit? I know it's insensitive to ask, but we need to know what actually happened there, and we need to know sooner rather than later.

Also, should we be worried about these "andalites?" (sp?) If they don't like these guys (and its not hard to see why) they might not take it kindly if we do end up in some kind of federation with them. Sounds like they're much more technologically advanced, and it could be a huge mistake to end up on their bad side by allying with the body-snatchers.
