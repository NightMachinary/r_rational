So, anyone else buying up canned goods and guns right about now? I was going to put my money into bitcoin, but if communications networks get shut down I might no be able to access it. Maybe gold?

/EDIT/ I just checked, prices of both gold and bitcoin have skyrocketed, the dollar is crashing as well. In my small midwestern town people are mobbign the walmart and gun stores stocking up on food, like in a hurricane or something. Atmosphere is pretty calm for now, and people are still lining up peacefully to buy things, but I reckon we'll see major riots when things start running low.
