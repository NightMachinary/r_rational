Sorry - that wasn't clear at all :/ Hopefully clarified:

- Yeerks probably arrived pretty recently. Evidence: Earth is largely unconquered.

- Earthly and Yeerk-ly life may have a common origin. This is speculative, but possible given that (a) interstellar travel is clearly possible, and (b) biocompatibility is /very/ hard to explain otherwise.

- Alternatively, biocompatibility could be explained by engineering. Which means our "friends" have some 'utter bullshit' grade bioengineers backing them, and we're probably doomed. Compared to creating a sapient things which can take over a human brain, something like Bonesaw's prion plague from /Worm/ would be pretty easy. Or more insidious threats...
