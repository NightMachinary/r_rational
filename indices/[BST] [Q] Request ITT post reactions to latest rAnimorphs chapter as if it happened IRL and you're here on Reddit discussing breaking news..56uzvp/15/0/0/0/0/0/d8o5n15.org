I meant the empirical case of Earth, which we're pretty sure evolved /in situ/... right? Although the 'extraterrestrial origin of life' hypothesis is looking a log more plausible with a sample of extraterrestrial life /literally right in front of us/.

I don't even know anything anymore, if this is even real.

Every time I start thinking about this my head hurts with the implications, because it's going to require massive revisions to almost every field of human knowledge. Biology. Paleo-everything. Physics. Ethics. Politics (hello, external threat psychology!). Gah!
