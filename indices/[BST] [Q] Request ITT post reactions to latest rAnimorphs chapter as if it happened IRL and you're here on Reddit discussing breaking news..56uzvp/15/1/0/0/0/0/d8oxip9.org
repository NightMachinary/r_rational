... hmm. There's a /small/ amount, I guess, but if they were in direct contact with the brain they'd need to be very small, and you'd have to be very careful draining exactly the right amount of fluid as you added the Yeerk or risk pretty nasty effects on the brain.

Which, I dunno, maybe they do cause horrific brain damage. I just rewatched the footage, and he never /says/ they want to keep infesting us, like everyone's assuming - in fact, he claims they're planning to withdraw completely. Maybe all the people in Ventura were lobotomized. It's possible. But then how were they infiltrating? Someone would have noticed.

I'd assume that living in the mouth or something was more likely, but he explicitly says they "crawl into its ear" ... which is crazy, there'd be a big hole. The more I think about it, the more implausible it seems that these guys are telling the truth.
