For demonic motives on classical alien and UFO activity:

- Not sure why they would abduct cattle, but that is an activity trickster spirits in folklore would engage in, so assuming the folk stories have any grain of truth, they are presumably continuing their old activities in a more modern guise.

- A lot of the "alien" experimentation has a weird focus on human genitals. In many mythological traditions there is interbreeding between humans and the supernatural: nephilim in the bible, demigods in Greek myth, Kitsune marrying humans in some of the stories from Japan, fairies switching human and fairy offspring and leaving changelings, etc. Whatever motive existed for these entities to create part human hybrids (better adaption to our physical world? some abstract metaphysical purpose?) might still exist in modern times, they are just continuing their old methods.

- Crop circles seem pretty obvious. A lot of mythological traditions put a great magical importance on symbols. Crop circles are just a convenient way to make large scale symbols quickly with minimal physical intervention in the material world.

As for alien motivations, I think I thought of a few:

If the Yeerks story isn't BS, then genetically engineering a lifeform or even just a body from scratch is a lot harder than we guessed, at least compared to interstellar travel and outright interstellar warfare (or else why not engineer bodies from scratch). Likewise, the alien "Esplin" acted like it was dying, so they also presumably don't have mind uploads? If that is the case, experimenting on intelligent lifeforms is a lot more valuable than we would otherwise guess:

- The alien abductions are exactly what many UFO fanatics would claim: the aliens are experimenting on humans. Prior to the recent absurd events, I would point out obtaining a few genetic samples and then brute force simulating humans would be easier than interstellar travel, but apparently this is incorrect.

- Crop circles could have been attempts to study the mimetic spread of symbols by artificially introducing symbols. If humans are one of the few "sapient" species and engineering a species from scratch is harder than interstellar travel, then humans could make a valuable test population.

- Cattle abduction: the aliens might have abducted and studied any number of species, we just notice cattle because we keep track of their number. Alternatively, if intelligence and tool use is rare, studying a domesticated animal might be interesting from to an alien.

- Roswell incident: exactly what conspiracy theorists think. If so, I really hope the US government shares that info. Still, even if it just weather balloons or whatever, just because this isn't real doesn't mean that UFO/alien abductions haven't been.

So yeah... I think there might be something to all the UFO folklore, a year is a little tight on time though. Assuming Esplin isn't a human made hoax in the first place I think I would take that bet. If the planet gets glassed or society collapses I wouldn't have to pay out, right? And wow I intended that as a joke but now it seems too dark.
