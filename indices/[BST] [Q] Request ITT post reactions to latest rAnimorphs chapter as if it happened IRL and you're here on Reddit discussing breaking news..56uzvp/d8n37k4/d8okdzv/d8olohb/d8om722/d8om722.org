Who says they control the brain? I was thinking more along the lines of causing muscle spasms, or maybe straight-up telekinesis.

Look at the video again:

  ---the man broke through the cordon, flashed a badge at the assembled cops, strode out into the open space between the Visser and the crowd---

  ---and froze in mid-step as the alien lifted a finger. Actually froze, his eyes wide, his mouth half-open, every muscle taut and thrumming.

  The rest of the crowd sucked in a breath. The Visser raised his head, his body ramrod straight, all four eyes looking past the petrified agent and into the center of the mass of humanity.

His muscles are crazy tense. Doesn't look like it's his /mind/ that's being controlled.
