Your second point seems... not /unreasonable/. But I was thinking your third point is looking far more likely right now.

As to your first point - yes, /if/ Yeerks had been around since, say, anytime before the 1700s, and /if/ they had wanted to conquer us, we would be conquered. No doubt. Therefore, either we have been conquered and don't know it; or they're recent arrivals; or they're not interested in conquest and are lying to us.
