Thing is, we don't know what the aliens can do technologically. See my other comment - they're probably wizards to us.

They can genetically engineer a Yeerk which can control a Human. Probably 3D-print it at range. Of that I have no doubt. What I'm wondering about are the odds that something like that could have /evolved/ naturally.

We can't out-guess the aliens' technology. But we should be able to out-guess evolution.
