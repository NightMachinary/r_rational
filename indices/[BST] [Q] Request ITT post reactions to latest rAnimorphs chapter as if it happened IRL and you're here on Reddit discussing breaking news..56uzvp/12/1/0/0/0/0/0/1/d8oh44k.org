Point; I suppose we don't really know anyone's fighting the Yeerks. For all we know, they could've dropped the asteroid on Ventura for some reason of their own (accidentally or on purpose) and decided to reveal themselves intentionally (for whatever reason).

However, I think it's most likely at least part of the story's right; why would they destroy Ventura for no reason? And if Esplin's telling the truth about the base being seriously harmed, I don't see how human teens could do it on their own - so we've got some aliens involved somehow. We might as well call them Andalites. And again, we know nothing about them except that they're fighting the Yeerks, and they're just as invisible to human sensors.

And... sure, the human teenagers might not be real, but again they might be. I can imagine some reasons why the Andalites would want less-conspicuous local help. I think we should tentatively take Esplin at his word, try to locate any of these teens who survived, and be on the alert for Andalites trying to recruit other human teens for their inscrutable ends.
