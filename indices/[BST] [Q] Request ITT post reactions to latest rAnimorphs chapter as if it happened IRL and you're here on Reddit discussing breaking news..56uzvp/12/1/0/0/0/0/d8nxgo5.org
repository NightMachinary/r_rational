I don't know. We know absolutely nothing about the Andalites, except their enemies say they teased them with knowledge but didn't share it and now "pursue us everywhere we go." Maybe they have some moral block against fighting for themselves. Maybe they don't want to be conspicuous. Maybe Earth's atmosphere is poisonous to them. I don't know.

What I do know is that some human teenagers have ostensibly destroyed an alien invasion... which means that unless the yeerks are really stupid or horrendously unlucky, the teens had some help from somewhere. I hope at least one of them somehow survived the asteroid - I'd love to hear their side of the story.
