  aliens capable of FTL must have better technology than we do

Are you sure? We might be assuming that the way our technology progressed is the only way for it to happen, but it's just as possible that the aliens completely missed things that were obvious to us. It's even possible that FTL was something "obvious" that /we/ missed - meaning we'd have better all-around technology. (This was suggested in a sci-fi story I read a while back, forget the name.)

Consider: the Aztecs discovered the wheel ... but never thought to use it to make vehicles, only kid's toys! Meanwhile, they had those obsidian-glass swords, but those never occurred to anyone in the Old World - even though we had obsidian and glass over here too. (Sure, they're worse than steel, but I assume they were better than bronze weapons since the Aztecs had bronze.) The ancient Greeks has steam engines thousands of years ago, but considered them a curiosity and never did anything useful with them. Why are we assuming that technology progresses on a fixed timeline, as opposed to random technologies being invented at random points in their history?

Consider: the aliens have shown two great technological feats; the spaceship, and the asteroid. Maybe throw in the fact they got here at all as a third "feat". But all of those are doable with just one technology - the FTL drive!

Who knows what their guns or computers are like. If they even have guns or computers! We haven't /seen/ any.

In fact, thinking about it, this Esplin announced himself by flying to the crash site in person - no radio message, nothing on TV. They supposedly didn't notice we were intelligent - but radio messages are the first thing our SETI program looks for. Do the aliens even /have/ radio?
