I could understand most intelligent species being parasites. But you can't take something that lives as a parasite inside a rat and expect it to live off (say) a cabbage. And we evolved in a /completely different biosphere/ to these things, there should be /no way/ that any sort of mind control they have isn't the result of deliberate genetic engineering.

  If andalites are very similar, they might "team up" with humans, giving them the same abilities.

And /two/ /independent/ alien species biochemically compatible with humans stretches credulity well beyond the breaking point. Mind you, I'm not saying the Andalites (if they exist) can't be parasites - I just don't believe the part about them (or the Yeerks) being able to take human hosts.
