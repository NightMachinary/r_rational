Assuming that they're competent invaders (and I am assuming that, since we didn't know until today that they were here), it would be really weird to pick a narrative that paints their initial actions so poorly. No matter how well it matches a B movie, destroying Ventura can't have done them any favors diplomatically.

On a more personal note, which I tried to keep away from the summary post, I've always admired generals who are willing to put their own lives on the line when a mistake is made. Maybe I'll be proven wrong here, but I like that Esplin seems to have that same moral fiber.
