Yeah, and then all the aliens need to do is infest the people doing the MRI scans.

Or the people making the MRI machines, if they can slip some sort of software bug in there that detects when it's scanning a Yeerk and then gives a picture that looks like not-a-Yeerk (maybe under the guise of being a free upgrade?)

If they've infested the people running the MRI scan, then they can pull aside everyone /without/ a Yeerk for three days - to "make the Yeerk starve" - only everyone who comes /out/ of isolation is infested instead. (And we have no proof of that three-day thing, either).
