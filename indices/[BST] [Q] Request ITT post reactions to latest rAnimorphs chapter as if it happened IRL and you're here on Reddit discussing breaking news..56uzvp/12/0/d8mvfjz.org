  So, there are not only aliens, but there are multiple kinds of alien who are at war with each other and until recently thought of us as, basically, livestock.

Take a step back and reexamine everything before you take anything that the "alien" claimed as relevant.

I notice I am confused. Parsimonious explanation: the entire story is BS. Reevaluating it in that light, maybe the entire story sounds like something out of a cheesy sci-fi movie because that is exactly what the aliens did: copy a bunch of generic sci-fi movie tropes to make a story they thought would be compelling in order to manipulate us.

Or they are controlled also and will just feed us a story that confirms our beliefs.
