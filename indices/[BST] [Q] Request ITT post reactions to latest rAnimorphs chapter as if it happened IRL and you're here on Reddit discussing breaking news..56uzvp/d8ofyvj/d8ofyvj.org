[Different poster] I think this confirms the theory we were discussing last week that the 'accident' in Ventura was no accident. The authorities are clearly trying to cover their asses after an accidental nuclear weapon explosion . There was some good discussion on [[/r/uncensorednews]] about how the explosion couldn't have been a meteorite because it didn't have any debris cloud impacting around the rest of the planet [link]. There were rumors of weird goings on in Ventura beforehand, so I guess it was a CIA or army site transporting nuclear weapons, and they don't want to admit they fucked up and detonated one in a civilian area, so are concocting this "aliens" story as a distraction. Who wants to bet that this alien mysteriously dies or teleports away, and the spaceships turn out, by huge coincidence, to be too damaged to use? Guess we'd better put even more money into the military industrial complex to fight off these evul sppaaahhs invaders!
