Puh-lease, this is the fakest shit I've ever seen. First an asteroid and now aliens? This is how America is trying to cover up what happened in Ventura? The asteroid story was as good as debunked as soon as the satellite images got out- the destruction was centered right on the town, it was obviously a target. We need to be figuring out who did it, and why they're trying to cover it up. An attack? Or did the US nuke itself to... contain something? Are they lying so they don't look vulnerable? And don't give me this aliens shite when there are NO scientific organizations reporting anything out of the ordinary in the past 3 months (oh but of course, they were all body-snatched, that's why no one who watches the skies saw anything, anywhere, in the whole world, right. I swear, this body-snatched thing is going to become the new "lizard people," it's so /convenient/). I'll take this "alien" and anything he says seriously if and only if someone can tell me where I can point MY OWN telescope to see this guy's fleet or whatever. How much does anyone want to bet they'll be "cloaked?"

I don't get the people who take this thing seriously at all- if you actually believe in alien bodysnatchers, then how can you trust anything anyone tells you, even if (especially if) it's about alien bodysnatchers? Like, say somebody comes up with a way of detecting who's been bodysnatched- how can you be sure that /they/ haven't just been bodysnatched?? Mind-boggling, they just pick who to believe based on what they already want to believe.

GUYS IT'S REAL THERE ACTUALLY IS A FUCKING SHIP AT THOSE COORDINATES I CAN LITERALLY SEE IT! ALIENS! LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS, SUCK IT FERMI! Interstellar travel! A real goddam ship. An alien mothership.

Capable of dropping rocks.

Well, we're fucked.
