Okay, I see you, but you're pattern matching to the pre-alien invasion world where things were more or less okay and idiotic Conservatives ran around freaking out acting like a zombie apocalypse was eminent, when in reality all we had was other humans with more or less identical hopes and dreams and the entire thing was just a coordination problem where we couldn't get everyone to hit cooperate.

This time, the zombie apocalypse is actually happening and there is an actual /reason/ to turn our societal immune system up to eleven.
