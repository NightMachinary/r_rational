If an MRI can't pick it up, then yeah, it would need to be so close to undetectable that you wouldn't notice yourself. They would have to make you /believe/ you're doing what you want, for logical reasons.

There's no logical reason a cow would start talking, so that at least would show up on an MRI.

Plus, they claim to be physically inside the host, unless I misunderstood that speech. That would be pretty obvious unless they're energy beings.
