But who told us they die after 3 days? If we can't trust a yeerk it would seem foolish to rely so absolutely on a "weakness" that they revealed so willingly.

Even if we capture yeerks and watch them die 3 days later... for all we know they're able to voluntarily suicide, and are under instructions to drop dead after 3 days when captured so as not to give the game away for the undetected yeerks.
