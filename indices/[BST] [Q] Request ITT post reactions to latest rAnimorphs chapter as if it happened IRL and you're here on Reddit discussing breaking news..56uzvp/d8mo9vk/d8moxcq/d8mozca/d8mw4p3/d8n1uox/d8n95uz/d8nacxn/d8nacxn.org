I would, but I would feel awful about it, and would want a good amount of resources be devoted to research to allow me to use a robot body or at the very least breed a blue space centaur that's about as smart as a flea or oyster.

These guys have friggin spaceships. I think they can handle a little robot. I would sure as hell take something with 10% the quality of a cow's senses so I wouldn't have to hurt another sentient being. (yeah, that's right, look up the difference between sentient and sapient sometime)
