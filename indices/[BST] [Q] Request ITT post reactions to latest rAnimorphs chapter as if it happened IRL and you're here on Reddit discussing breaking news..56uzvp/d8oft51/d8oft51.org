God you guys are so fucking credulous. You see a bad CGI alien on some shaky phone camera and suddenly you lose all sense?

Lets ignore everything about the Fermi paradox, the impossibility of faster than light trevel, etc. Its a blue alien centaur, with a human face that speaks perfect English. I've seen more convincing aliens in Star Trek.

My bet is that its viral marketing for a tv show or game. MAybe a new VR one where you get to play as one of these slug aliens and control different animals, fighting against the nasty andalites. The line about teenage resistance fighters is a very obvious plot hook.
