[[/rdtwisquint][]] [META] Yeah, I think that's right on the money. I am quite sad I didn't think about it, but I guess in fiction you don't think about the fact that Ventura county is a real place with real people, who all died in-universe.

Add that to me being on the other side of the world from California and I generally don't have occaision to be personally affected by these events.

Actually, after the Bataclan attacks, I wasn't able to get in contact with my Parisian penpal and I was silently seething about everyone posting about how we only care about Paris because we only care about white people and why isn't anyone putting the flag of Lebanon on their profile picture, when I was worried /one of my friends was dead/. Maybe I should try and channel that a little and write a comment. Maybe.
