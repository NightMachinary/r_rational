While given the circumstances I can understand people's mistrust, this really does represent a tremendous opportunity for us. Until now, I would have said humanity was destined to die quietly without ever leaving this one, admittedly nice, little rock. We shouldn't trust the aliens blindly, and anger over Ventura's bombing is definitely justified, but even a small chance this is legit makes the cost vs benefit of going along with the possibility of peace worth it.

Also, the rush to hostility here is hardly going to be conducive to good strategizing. Anger makes for poor planning. If nothing else, we should pretend to believe the Esplin, then take it somewhere quiet and pump it for information on its home planet, making our move only when the time is right. Aaand now I'm realizing this was probably the government's strategy all along. Time to see whether or not I get disappeared now, I guess.
