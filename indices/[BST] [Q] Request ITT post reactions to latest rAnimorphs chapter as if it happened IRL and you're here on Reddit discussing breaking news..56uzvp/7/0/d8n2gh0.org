The part that weirded me out the most was the thing with the resisting teenagers. I mean, maybe there were kids fighting in secret at first, but, get real. If /you/ heard about an alien invasion, what's the first thing you would do? Assemble your friends in your garage and start a resistance movement Captain Planet-style? Or go warn the military?

If there's anyone who was already aware of this, it had to be the USA government.
