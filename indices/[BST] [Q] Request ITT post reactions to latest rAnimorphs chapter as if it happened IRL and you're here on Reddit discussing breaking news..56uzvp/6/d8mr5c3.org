[METAish] mostly describing instead of doing, because images

Photoshop mixing a photo of the Bug fighter with something like [[https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/6134733161_5d99b15ef4_b-640x480.jpeg][this image]], with overlaid text saying "TAKE OUR SHIP LOL".

Photo of the Ventura crater with the text "WE COME IN PEACE".

One I can do: [[https://imgflip.com/i/1c4m74][this]].

Lots of [[https://imgflip.com/meme/Ancient-Aliens][this guy]].

One of the more striking photos of Esplin would also be posted over 9000 times with various captions, such as "I'M JUST A SPACE SLUG, I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR STRANGE WAYS" and "I, FOR ONE, WELCOME OUR NEW MOLLUSC OVERLORDS".
