Actually, thinking about it, if it terms out demons are behind one of the following: Crop circles, alien abductions, the Roswell incident, would that qualify?

If so I'll take that bet. I bet their is some truth behind the incidents. I can't think of any logical motive for aliens to carry them out, but their capabilities are so weird that I wouldn't rule anything out. And I can think of some fairly plausible (relatively speaking) motives demons might have to carry out these kind of actions.
