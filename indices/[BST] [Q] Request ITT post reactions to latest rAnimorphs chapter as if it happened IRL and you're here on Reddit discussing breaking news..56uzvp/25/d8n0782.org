So alien spaceships have invaded America, with the aliens stealing bodies and demolishing a city with an asteroid. Does that make this /Independence Day/, /Invasion of the Body Snatchers/, or /Starship Troopers/?

And now they're saying they come in peace, so it's probably /Mars Attacks!/ or something.
