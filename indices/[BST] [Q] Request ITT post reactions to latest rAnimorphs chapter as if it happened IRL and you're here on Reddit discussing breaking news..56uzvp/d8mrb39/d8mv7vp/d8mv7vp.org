Maybe they really don't understand humans that well? They think that we take our entertainment as plausible, so the aliens/demons (see my comment pointing out all the inconsistencies with physics as we know them) came up with a totally BS story to try to persuade us. Unfortunately for them, they laid it on a bit to thick, so hopefully someone in the government will realize how ridiculous the story is.
