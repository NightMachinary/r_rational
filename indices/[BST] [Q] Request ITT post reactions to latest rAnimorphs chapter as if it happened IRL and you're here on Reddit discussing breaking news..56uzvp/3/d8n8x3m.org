I hope all you unbelievers have opened your eyes. The reckoning is come and the apocalypse is upon us.

  Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

  But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

That hour is before us. Great is the Almighty God, He warned us but we refused to heed.

  10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: /thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen/, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.

  11 /With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets/: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.

  12 /And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses/: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.

  13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

There is nothing richer that God has given us but our brain that we might think praise and our voice that we might sing it. Our song will cease because it has been /stolen/ by these monsters.

  8 Therefore shall /her plagues come in one day/, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be /utterly burned with fire/: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

  9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

  10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, /that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come/.

  2 And /the beast/ which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

  3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

  4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, /Who is like unto the beast/? who is able to make war with him?

  5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.

  6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

  7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and /power/ was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.

  8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

  9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

  13 And he doeth great wonders, so that /he maketh fire come down from heaven/ on the earth in the sight of men,

  ...

  16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or /in their foreheads/:

  17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

He laid it all in plain speech to warn us, and here it has come to pass! The horsemen were foretold, and lo and behold who is responsible for "making fire come down from heaven" and destroying a city "in a single hour"? A /horse man/. "By the hoofs of his horses" indeed.

And a "mark in their foreheads"? A mark /inside/ their heads? These yearks are plainly foretold two /thousand/ years before their coming.

I hope you all can see the plain message of Scripture. Repent or worse than this is still to come!
