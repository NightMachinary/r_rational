  I have great hopes that we shall learn in due time how to emotionalize and mythologize their science to such an extent that what is, in effect, a belief in us (though not under that name) will creep in while the human mind remains closed to believe in the Enemy. The “Life Force,” the worship of sex, and other aspects of psychoanalysis, may here prove useful.

  If once we can produce are perfect work --- the materialist magician, the man, not using, but veritably worshiping [demons] while denying the existence of “spirits” --- the end of the war will be in sight.
