You are really stretching it to make it fit... With the implausibility of recent events from a scientific perspective, I am willing to consider such alternatives as biblical prophecies. That said, the majority of eschatological scholars who took a strongly literal, future, and apocalyptic interpretation of Revelations also believed in a pre-tribulation rapture. One of the requirements of a scientific theory is that it can make predictions and that it doesn't require post-ad-hoc fitting. Naturally, there hasn't been any mass disappearances that fit with the rapture. I'll definitely keep Revelations in mind, but if all the events require this much stretching and cherry picking to make fit, I am not buying it.

That said, messages from the future in the form of prophecy are about as plausible as FTL+telepathy so I think taking a second look various prophetic traditions might be useful. Anyone familiar with Nostradamus?
