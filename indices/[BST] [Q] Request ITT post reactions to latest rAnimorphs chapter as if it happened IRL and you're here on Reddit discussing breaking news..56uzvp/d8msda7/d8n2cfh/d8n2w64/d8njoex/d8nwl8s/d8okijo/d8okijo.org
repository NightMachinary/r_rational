Hmm. These guys seemed really surprised to find we were sentient. Maybe /most/ intelligent species are parasites, and we're the weird herd species that developed intelligence.

Yeerks seem to have telepathy and telekinesis - presumably either technological or part of their control mechanism (scary thought - what if everyone who was there is already infected? Their minds and personality subtly altered?)

If andalites are very similar, they might "team up" with humans, giving them the same abilities.
