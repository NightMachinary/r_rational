I posted about this upthread - I think they probably control bodies using that same telekinesis/body control effect we saw him use on the guard. They have some kind of "telepathy" that works at range to communicate, too (probably the equivalent of an Effector from the Culture novels.) No need for them to be doing messy things like hooking into the bloodstream and nervous system; just move the body like a puppet and take your time decoding the brain with your MRI-like senses. (EDIT: which also explains why they took so long to notice we're sapient, even though they can communicate on a mental level.)

It's probably more of a way to get /hands/ and a body (and senses?) than a way to get /nutrients/, the way Earth parasites work - he mentioned they have to leave the body to feed, remember? They're probably not biocompatible with humans at all.
