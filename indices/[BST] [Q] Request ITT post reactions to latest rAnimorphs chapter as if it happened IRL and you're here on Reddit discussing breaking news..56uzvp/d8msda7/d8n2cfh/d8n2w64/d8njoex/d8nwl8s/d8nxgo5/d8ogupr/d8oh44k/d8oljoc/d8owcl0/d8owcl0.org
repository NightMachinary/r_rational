Wow; that's a chilling thought!

Ask NASA? Or the Air Force? I haven't heard anything from them besides "the asteroid was small enough that we plausibly missed it during our surveys," but I'm sure someone noticed something as it was falling into the atmosphere.

But then again, who knows - maybe a half-failed Yeerk invisibility shield will make the shielded ship look like an asteroid to us.
