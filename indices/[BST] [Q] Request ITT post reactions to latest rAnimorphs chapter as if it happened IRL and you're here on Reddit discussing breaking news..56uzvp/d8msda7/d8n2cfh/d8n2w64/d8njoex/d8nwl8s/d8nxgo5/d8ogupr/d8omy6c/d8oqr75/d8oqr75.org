Had someone pointed out the basic idea of a wheeled vehicle to the Aztecs, they'd have been able to make them easily enough. (Not sure they'd have been practical, given the steep mountains and lack of horses).

Technology doesn't have to move along a fixed timeline. But, in general, /more/ complicated items come later than /less/ complicated items. And I find it highly unlikely that it's anything other than /significantly/ simpler than an FTL drive. (Seriously, you can make a basic camera from a lens and a box - the film is trickier, but there are lots of chemicals that react in some or other way to light).
