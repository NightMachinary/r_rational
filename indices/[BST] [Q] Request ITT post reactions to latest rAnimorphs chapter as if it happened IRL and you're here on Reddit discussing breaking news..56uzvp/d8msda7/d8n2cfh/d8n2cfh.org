This is wild unconfirmed guess territory, but I /think/ that the mysterious mind voice was one of the teenagers with attitude who fought against the yeerks. I mean, we're talking about high-schoolers, against an alien military force*? They had to have superpowers.

Plus, I've read the transcript, and the comments made by the voice seemed kinda... childish? Like, what I'd expect my little brother to say if he were watching the speech on TV.

*note to self: what exactly were the yeerks' forces before the asteroids? maybe they have more troops left than they led us to believe
