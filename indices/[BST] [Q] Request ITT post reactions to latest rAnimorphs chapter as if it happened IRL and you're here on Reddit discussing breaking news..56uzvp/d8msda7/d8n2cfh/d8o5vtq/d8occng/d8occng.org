Yeah but chimps use tools and crows recognise faces. Maybe chimps look down on lemurs for not being able to use tools the same way we look down on chimps for not using nuclear weapons the same way Esplin looks down on the space centaurs because they don't use scglarbles, which all intelligent species he's seen know all about.
