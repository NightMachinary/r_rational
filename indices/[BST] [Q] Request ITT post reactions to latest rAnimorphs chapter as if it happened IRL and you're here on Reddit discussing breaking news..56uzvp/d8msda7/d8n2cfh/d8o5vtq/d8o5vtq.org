  *note to self: what exactly were the yeerks' forces before the asteroids? maybe they have more troops left than they led us to believe

And *where* exactly were they? Because only /complete morons/ would have exactly one base, and put it in a developed and well-connected city and nation. What if there are bases in Indian slums? Central Africa? Shenzhen? Subverted groups in the middle-East?

I mean, it seems safe to assume that anything capable of (probably FTL) interstellar travel is at the very least not much stupider than I am, and if I was leading an invasion force I would not put all my eggs in one basket.

Which implies "Esplin" is lying about the whole 'oh I didn't know you were people' thing, because that's bullshit - cow's don't have nuclear weapons.
