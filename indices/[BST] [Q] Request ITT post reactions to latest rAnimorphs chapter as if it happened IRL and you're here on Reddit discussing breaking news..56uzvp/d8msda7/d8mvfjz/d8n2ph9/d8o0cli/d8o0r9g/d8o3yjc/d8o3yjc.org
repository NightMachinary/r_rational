We do the MRI thing, but we also have catholic priests perform an exorcisms, just in case...

Actually, first, the government could just try various forms of exorcisms and banishments on "Esplin", to see if any work. If any do, then we know to prioritize exorcisms over MRI.

The government should also try various solutions and techniques from mythology and folklore. Visual exposure to grains of rice, needles, ofuda, crosses, pinches of salt, inside out clothes etc.

I'm not saying I'm sure it's not aliens, just that it would be worth trying a wide range of solutions. Our preconceptions were blown out the window...
