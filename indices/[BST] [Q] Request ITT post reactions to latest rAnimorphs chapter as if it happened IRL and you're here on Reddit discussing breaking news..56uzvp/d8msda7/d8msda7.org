So, there are not only aliens, but there are multiple kinds of alien who are at war with each other and until recently thought of us as, basically, livestock. Probably one of the worst ways to find life in the universe.

Notable aliens:

Yeerks: What their envoy claims to be. A slug that can crawl into things' ears and 'share its thoughts'. Presumably it has to be somewhere near your brain to do that, otherwise the ear thing would probably not be necessary. Starves after three days of continuous possession. Currently stationed on +Europa+ Europa's moon (thanks Jasmume16 for the correction).

Andalites: At war with Yeerks. Not clear what exactly they are. Apparently had better technology than the Yeerks do, which is saying a lot by the looks of those spaceships (/link to photos/). Sound pretty awful, but there's almost certainly at least a little bias.

Unnamed Blue Centaur: What their envoy is currently possessing. Don't think he said much about what this is.

Other notables:

Esplin: The Yeerk who gave the speech. Attempted to invade Ventura, realized midway that humans are people, and then accidentally destroyed Ventura once his 'stronghold' got destroyed. Absolutely horrifying; I'd hate to be the guy responsible for /that/. Willing to die for crimes committed, giving us their space ships to open up diplomatic options.

Unnamed Freedom Fighters: High schoolers (what the fuck?) who /somehow/ were going toe to toe with Esplin's forces, eventually blowing up their stronghold and triggering the dead man's switch. Again, absolutely awful to find yourself responsible for something like that. Even worse since they were trying to help humanity from the get go.

Unnamed Psychic Voice: Unconfirmed, but some people at the speech are saying they had a message placed in their mind. Message is consistent between multiple people (/transcript link/), hard to arrange this fast if hoax. Apparently not fond of Esplin. Andalite, maybe? Hard to guess with limited information.

It should go without saying, but take all this with a grain or a heaping tablespoon of salt. There's a lot we don't know, and only one source so far. If we can locate these freedom fighters, we might be able to get a clearer picture.
