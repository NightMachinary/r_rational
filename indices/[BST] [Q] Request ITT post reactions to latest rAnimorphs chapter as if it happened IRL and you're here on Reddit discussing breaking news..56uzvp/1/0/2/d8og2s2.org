It sounds like classic hollywood because it is classic hollywood, in a week we'll get an app, then an ARG, then we'll find out its all been viral marketing for teh sequel to district 9 or something

It could be pretty cool actually if they tone down the disney parts, refugee aliens working with humans, who seem weird and freaky to us but find us just as freaky? Pretty bad taste to use the ventura disaster in their publicity though, way too soon. Thats like if the MCU had ultron blowing up the twin towers
