How the hell do they live in a person's head and control them so well nobody notices for months, and then the blue guy's able to give a speech like that, but they never realised we were sentient?

Are they actually way smarter than us so we /do/ seem like ants to them? If this is real, that's scary as hell. We're basically at their mercy.
