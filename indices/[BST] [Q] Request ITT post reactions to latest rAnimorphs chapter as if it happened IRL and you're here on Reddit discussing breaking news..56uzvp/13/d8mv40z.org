So... the fact that these aliens are able to have a war (i.e. the timescales and distances aren't too far apart for them), and the fact that we didn't see a near C ship enter our solar system (some with more astronomy check me on this, but I think decelerating after interstellar travel would leave very visible exhaust, as in you could see it with a telescope in your backyard) means that either these alien races are super long lived and/or have a very long-term oriented culture (and thus can fight wars on century long timescales and are willing to travel interstellar distances at timescales slow enough that they didn't have visible deceleration) or they have some form of FTL travel. Anyone back me up on this with more precise calculations?

So on one hand, from our current knowledge of physics, near immortal, super long-term planning aliens is more plausible than FTL. But that would mean that they have all that advanced tech (I think immortality is not very well selected for evolutionary so it would have to be artificial)... but they can't just genetically engineer bodies?

Also, they didn't recognize humans as sentient, but they are able to put on a near perfect performance (don't tell me the landing scene didn't look just too perfect)?

And then there is the mysterious psychic voice talking into people's heads... Direct mind to mind communication sounds really implausible from our current understanding of physics... it would take some type of media to transmit it. Say like nanobot released into the air. But if they have tech capable of manipulating minds like that, why stop at just communication? They alien claim to be symbiotic brain slugs (anyone reminded of Stargate?) but didn't recognize we were sapient? They decide to resort to diplomacy after a brutal massacre?

Anyway, something is off about all of this... the alien's tech capabilities don't make sense (I guess we'll find out when we try reverse engineering them) and/or our understanding of physics is very limited/wrong (FTL possible, true telepathy possible, etc.)... The alien motivations don't make too much sense either (not recognizing sapience, but perfectly able to communicate when it comes down to it).

On the plus side, with their capabilities, even if they have some easy FTL that doesn't require absurd energies (i.e. they don't have the energy to just blow up the planet and/or launch interstellar kinetic kill vehicles), they could still drop rocks on us till we all die, so whatever their goals/intentions, they don't want to just kill all of us.

*Crazy wild guess*: The aliens are actually demons (in the mythological sense): they possess people and their technological capabilities don't make sense. The asteroid was God/Angels/Gods smiting one of their initial footholds. The alien story is just to mislead us and distract us from how BS their tech is (FTL, psychic powers, interfacing with alien brains without bio compatibility issues, interstellar warfare being practical or possible, etc.)

[META: without outside knowledge, The events make no sense from someone that takes our current understanding of the universe seriously. Hence the bizarre conclusion.]
