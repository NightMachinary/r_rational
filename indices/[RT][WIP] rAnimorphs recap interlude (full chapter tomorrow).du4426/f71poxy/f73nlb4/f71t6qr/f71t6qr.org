Haven't read the recap in full yet, but I'm grateful for there being one. You have so many delightfully twisty plot threads that I'm sure I've lost track of several of them, given the hiatus.

Will hopefully find time for a full reread at some point when the story is complete, but this should tide me over to follow the plot as it wraps up.
