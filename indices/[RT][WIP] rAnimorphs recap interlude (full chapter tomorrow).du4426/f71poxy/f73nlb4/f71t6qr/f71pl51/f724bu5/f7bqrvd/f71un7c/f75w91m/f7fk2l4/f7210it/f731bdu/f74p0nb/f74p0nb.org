Garrett wouldn't see Marco demorphing his other instance as murder because he doesn't believe (whether correctly or incorrectly) that continuity of consciousness requires causal continuity of computational states. (I.e. if you morph into your past self that was acquired yesterday and stay past the time limit, you'll only lose two days of memories instead of blacking out forever and being replaced by another person.)

That /sort of/ makes sense, because if you change your state into a state from two days ago and /keep matter the same/, it seems you'll only lose your memories, and the continuity of matter isn't relevant to the continuity of your consciousness, so Garrett /just might be/ right. But that means he wouldn't consider demorphing the other Marco as murder.

(Another way to motivate the same conclusion would be to consider /first/ changing someone's state into the state from two days ago, and /then/ replacing their matter with the matter teleported from the Z-space backup. This achieves the exact same result with one extra step in between, and neither step seems to destroy your consciousness.)

Edit: My "another way" is actually the same argument in different words.

Edit2: Great chapter, by the way! I love how everything was kept in Garrett's character.
