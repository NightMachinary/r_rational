Red's angst-riddled internal monologue.

If you know that this is written by a team, consisting of me (I call myself AMC) and my coauthor (I call her AAC), then this interlude is 98% AAC.

Most of the story is about 80/20 or 70/30 in my favour, and people in the discord have expressed interest in how our writing styles are, so interludes like this give you that opportunity, I guess?

If you want early access to the next chapter, I'm posting the "virtually final" draft in the discord now. (I have some safety buffer I'm so happy! It's not going to last long because we are really getting into the weeds as I have chapters that I'm not sure what /order/ they should go in).
