This is some freeform, public worldbuilding, partly for the fun of it; skip it if that's not your thing.

--------------

Continuing on /Shadows of the Limelight 2: Electric Boogaloo/ ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aq7h6q/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/egesvs9/][last seen here]]), some examples of verb domains, doing some of the "work forward, then work backward" oscillation process that I like.

*Verb Domain: Cut*

An illustrati with the verb domain of "cut" can cut things with supernatural ease, where the definition of "cut" is defined memetically (that is, by the collective conscious relating to the "cut" meme, rather than any standardized definition or linguistic tradition, modulo Sapir-Whorf effects).

/Domain enhancement:/ A cutting illustrati can cut more cleanly and deeply with blunter instruments than a non-illustrati, typically employing blades. This ability depends on both physical proximity, sensation, and whether or not the illustrati is the one cutting: enhancing a cut made by someone else is very difficult, bordering on impossible, as is cutting using an implement at a distance.

/Domain generation:/ A cutting illustrati can cut things without the use of any implement whatsoever, sometimes aided by a cutting motion or other notional link to the verb. Range and power depend on standing (fame).

/Domain sense:/ A cutting illustrati can sense when someone is cutting something, with perception being easier for longer, more powerful cuts, and the sense increasing with standing (fame). With greater standing, this can extend into the place (i.e. sensing where cuts have happened).

--------------

So the big question is how much this generalizes to other verb domains, and whether there are other broad abilities that need to be a part of this. From [[https://www.randomlists.com/random-verbs][a random verb generator]] we get the following: dress, admire, worry, report, skip, spot, check, explode, mourn, tour, inform and zoom.

Some problems are immediately obvious:

1. Some verb domains are worthless. This is probably okay, and fits with the existing magic system, but I worry that there are too many duds in here. "Dress" in particular just doesn't work, at least within the system as described; you can dress yourself faster and possibly more completely, but it's not a noun domain, it's a verb domain, and the act of dressing has almost no combat or mundane utility whatsoever. It would be easy to create a superhero with a "dress" keyword (pulling different customized outfits out of hammerspace?) but the magic system would need extending. I'll have to categorize different ways in which verbs are useless.
2. A lot of these verbs work a whole lot better if you can affect other people with them (admire, mourn, worry), and thus, /domain compulsion/ is born, a cluster for mind-affecting effects, the details of which are TBD. From a writing perspective, I don't know how much I like this, given that mind-affecting stuff can be difficult to write and interfere with character stuff too much.
3. Some verbs are long-term, like "tour", and I'm not entirely sure what to do about that. I suppose there's no big problem with that, given that all the existing abilities still map pretty well.
4. Some words have two or more different meanings: those will just be considered memetically distinct from each other, so that a checking illustrati can refer to either an inspector or someone who stops or slows people (you get one or the other, not both).
5. Illustrati aren't illustrati of words, they're illustrati of concepts that somehow map to the real world, and words are just a quick shorthand and a quick method of generation. I'm struggling to think of memetically distinct concepts that don't have words, but I'm sure they're out there (though if they were important enough, you'd think that someone would make a word to describe them).
