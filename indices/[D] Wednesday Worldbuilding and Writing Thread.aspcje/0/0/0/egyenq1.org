With a greatly expanded register of domains, there will be a lot of them that overlap in one way or another, assuming that it's a full expansion, rather than "here are the 16 verb domains". We could imagine that "Pierce", "Cut", "Slice", "Puncture", "Slash", and "Wound" are all active domains, and then there are adjacent material domains for "Knife", "Edge", "Sword", "Scalpel", and so on. All of these have overlap with each other, similar in presentation with some mild differences, and since these base concepts are only exposed to the illustrati through their powers, they might mistakenly believe that they're the same, even though they're not.

"Sound" would be a material/phenomenal domain, and then something else would be a sound generating active domain, e.g. "Sing", "Clap", "Yell", etc. (And we could divide up "Sound" into high and low frequencies, or particular manifestations of sound, at least under the new scheme.)
