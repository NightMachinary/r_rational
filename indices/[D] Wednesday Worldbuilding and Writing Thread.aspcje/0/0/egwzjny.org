I suspect that the gulf between 'words that happen to be verbs' and 'concepts that happen to be actions' is bigger than the one between 'words that happen to be nouns' and 'concepts that happen to be objects, substances, or energies', but also both the space of words and the space memes are extremely slippery and soft. For example, if verbal (or 'active' or whatever) domains are a thing, is 'Sound' a verb domain or a noun one? If so, why is it that one and not the other? Is it both, or are there two separate ones that happen to brush shoulders?
