  Why would a government in that setting allow or encourage young adults to become Boltzmann trainers?

​

I would say the easiest explanation is that the government is actually very effective at keeping the threat contained, and the Pokemon League is essentially the Boy Scouts, combined with 4H.

​

Those kids aren't generally going toe to toe with the bigest threats around, they are actually exploring wilderness that is really more of a curated park/preserve, and they generally do it with adult supervision, and as part fo a program that includes a lot of safety and general skills classes as well. Sure everyone's heard about that one kid who ended up being in the right place at the right time and was the first responder who caught a dangerous pokemon that had gotten into the preserve, but that's not typical.

​

It's even easier if you remove the battle-sport bit and focus more on competitions where the 4H parallel is stronger, and the kids are presumably being taught useful husbandry practices. Also if you use the Alola region's challenges as your thematic model rather than the gyms form otehr regions.
