The 4H/FFA/Scouts idea is a good one. Gym battles would be something akin to college, then, but there's still expanded tiers of other forms of competitions.

With the idea of a preserve comes the idea of a border, then provides structure for introducing Pokemon Rangers, who are the ones who enforce that border and provide for the expansion of civilization. Kind of like the Hunters in RWBY, I guess.
