Interesting idea. I think it works best in a more isolated setting, in part so you don't have to answer questions about what the wider world is like or how outside forces impact society, but I tend to be a fan of smaller, more constrained settings, since they can be a bit more focused on whatever their primary subject matter is.

One of the ideas that I've been kicking around for a while to justify a "young trainers" type of thing is a society with fairly good healthcare, but really poor birth control. Assuming that infant mortality is no longer a large consideration, overpopulation (or just surplus population) might mean a devaluing of human life, especially in third or fourth sons, depending on how the society is set up, similar to how third or fourth sons were over-represented in the Crusades among nobles, or how children were sent to nunneries/monasteries at least partly because there was no money/prospects for them. I'm a little iffy on the sociology, though I think it at least passes the sniff test for a layman reader.
