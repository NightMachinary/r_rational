Blend Pokemon with Anne McCaffrey's /Dragonriders of Perm/ series and more than a touch of /The Expanse/.

The native beings of the planet, a form of Boltzmann brain, have been domesticated to serve the human population. Different breeds are created for different purposes, suited to their roles in human society. Crossbreeding with wild Boltzmann brains results in wider speciation. Different regions have different conditions, leading to the "Regional Pokedex" clusterings of Pokemon seen in Pokemon lore. This planet is a human colony.

To keep the population safe from wild Boltzmanns, what government may exist encourages humans to capture and train these Pokemon, to befriend them, and to use them to keep society free of these ferals. Sort of like various Nuzlocke-run Pokemon fanfiction. The government subsidizes these trainers through R&D focused on training captured Boltzmanns, on improvements to Boltzmann-capture technology, research on Boltzmann biology and life, and healing of Boltzmanns damaged in battle. This is commonly seen through new Pokeballs, Pokemon Centers where Pokemon are healed, and the Pokemon Professor's research.

Does this idea fit better in a high-tech Expanse-style setting, where interplanetary travel is assumed, or in a low-tech Dragonriders setting, where much tech has been lost, and Greater Humanity has forgotten about this colony?

Why would a government in that setting allow or encourage young adults to become Boltzmann trainers?
