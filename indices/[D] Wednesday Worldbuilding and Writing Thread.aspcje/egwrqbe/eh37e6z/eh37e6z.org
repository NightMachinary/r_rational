For #5, there are concepts in other languages that feel like they should be in English, or concepts with multiple words in them. Does Shadows of the Limelight have multiple languages in them? Do people in other cultures have different illustrati? Is the general perception of the words the general conception of the word or the concept itself?

If the power is bound to the culture, I wonder what would happen with people who belong to two different cultures. Would it be based on personal identity or how the people around them view them? Frequently people w/ multiple cultures codeswitch, so if it's personal identity that can change. If it's public persona and they're fairly split between two ethnicities then depending on the people that surround them the public's perception of them can change.
