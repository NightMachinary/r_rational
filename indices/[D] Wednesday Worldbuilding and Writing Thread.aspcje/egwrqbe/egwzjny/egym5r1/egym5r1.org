I made a similar suggestion on the discord, but I'll repeat a modified version of it here:

Convert verbs to nouns, either using the gerund “-ing”, or using the agent noun “-er”, (or both) depending on which version seems more ‘memetically salient'.

Then treat the gerunds like material domains (with powers based around inducing and controlling the domain externally), and the agent nouns more like the animal domains (based around alteration of the self).

Some verbs aren't memetically salient as either agents or processes, and so don't appear as domains.

*Examples:*

/“Dress”/:

/Dresser/, as in someone who dresses, is an uncommon word but does seem like a plausible entity in memespace. Such an illustrati would have intuitive knowledge of fashion and tailoring. And may be able to subtly alter themselves to be more dextrous or have a more cutting figure.

/Dressing/, as a process, doesn't feel salient to me. But such an illustrati could sense when someone is getting dressed, and telekinetically help or hinder the process.

--------------

/”Explode”/:

The agent form /exploder/ is not salient.

The process of /exploding/ is. In fact, we have a word for it. Explosion. This domain fits right into the established paradigm, alongside fire and sound.

--------------

/”Mourn”/:

Both forms of this seem salient. /Mourners/ are an actual profession in some cultures. This illustrati would be very very good at feeling sad, or at least appearing to be so. Might be hired by the wealthy to appear at their funerals and write laments about their deaths.

/Mourning/ is the one you're worried about. Clearly, this domain should involve inducing mourning in others. I don't think this needs to be thought of as another cluster of powers; it's just domain creation. To make it manageable from a story standpoint, maybe make the emotional effects dissipate quickly once the illustrati leaves the area. As in, the Mourning illustrati can make you feel intense sorrow while they are next to you, but as soon as they leave, there is nothing to sustain that emotional process, and so your mind quickly readjusts. Maybe a mental illustrati could only induce long-term compulsions via pavlovian conditioning. (Or maybe the precursors excluded mental process domains just like they excluded nerve tissue as a domain)
