If a "cut" illustrati reaches the point where he can cut non-material bonds, then he becomes super powerful - cutting someone off from their allies is just /ridiculous/. And cutting them off from their /power/...

But even a 'dress' ability has at least some combat utility - especially if the domain power can be /reversed/. That is, if you can - in an instant - undress an opponent and then dress him in a strait-jacket (presumably, a Dress illustrati will have a selection of strait-jackets with him just in case). It might not hold up against other Illustrati powers, but it can take a non-powered person out of the fight with a touch.

  Illustrati aren't illustrati of words, they're illustrati of concepts that somehow map to the real world, and words are just a quick shorthand and a quick method of generation. I'm struggling to think of memetically distinct concepts that don't have words, but I'm sure they're out there (though if they were important enough, you'd think that someone would make a word to describe them).

Probably the easiest way to find such a concept is to look for words in other languages which don't have a simple English translation. A brief google bought me [[https://www.ef.com/wwen/blog/language/13-words-with-no-english-translation/][here]], which includes suggestions like Toska (Russian), a word which means “A sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without a specific cause; a longing with nothing to long for” - a single emotional state for which there isn't an easily-found single English word.
