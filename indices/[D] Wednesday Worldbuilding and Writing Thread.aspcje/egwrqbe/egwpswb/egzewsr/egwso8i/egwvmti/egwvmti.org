I think you could do this with an interplanetary setting, it'd be interesting to ask and answer questions about tourism, trade, what happens when you export Boltzmanns or import off-planet species. Medicine! Cuisine! Boltzmanns going wild on other worlds due to a mix-up in shipping ("what do you mean they escaped?")! The isolated setting has been done a la Pern, I think it'd be more interesting to mix it up and throw that in.
