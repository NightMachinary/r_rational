  HSF is hard sci-fi, which means that the science is good to the best of your knowledge.

Ugh, that's not really true? Like, anti-gravity is fairly common in HSF; we have no science that would support that.

Usually HSF is science fiction where the technology is in focus; soft science fiction is SF where the technology is just background for a story focused about something else. You can still take an impossible technological idea, but as long as you treat it consistently and in enough detail (rather than just handwaving it away), you're writing HSF.
