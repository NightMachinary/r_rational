  I thought he magicked the suit to strenghten himself thousandfold.

It's not how he did it but the amount of power it gives that makes me disbelieve it. It's easy to /say/ a thousand-fold, but if you think about it..

Let's say you have someone who works out regularly in the gym, and let's say he can bench 285 lb, or 129 kg. That means his muscles are exerting 1,266 Newtons of force (actually not since moments about the elbow are involved and the strength to lift weights up is greater than just holding it, but we'll ignore those).

Wearing this suit with this spell, this guy's muscules can exert 1,266,000 Newtons, meaning he can now hold a weight of 130,000 kg, benching 286600lb. For scale, according to Wikipedia a blue whale (the heaviest mammal in existence, now or ever before) weighs 190,000 kg.

Another example: the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737][Boeing 737]]. The most it can weigh on takeoff is 85,100 kg.

This suit lets a weightlifter bench two medium-sized jumbojets at once. I think it's overpowered.
