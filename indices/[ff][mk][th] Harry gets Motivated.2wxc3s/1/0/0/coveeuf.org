  There is no kill like overkill. Though getting that good at martial arts /with no partners, or the benefit of any experience at all/ is ridiculous.

Italics mine, for emphasis. Not to mention finding a suit that has a frigging jetpack, multiplies your strength a thousand fold, and has integrated weapons. That's not an actual project, that's a plot device blatantly there for the sole purpose of curb-stomping. Not to mention, Harry can't possibly have been the only one to think of Imperiusing himself like that - there's nothing unique about him that makes it viable, the spell isn't recent, and there have been too many humans in history before him that could have thought of it first.
