I'm going to say that I completely disagree (although I'll admit I read Twig pretty quickly and probably missed things).

I thought Twig was /relentlessly/ grimdark to the point of exhaustion. The world was bleak, the characters' fates were bleak, and I never really had any hope that things would get better. The protagonist's mental state made it difficult to read as well. I also don't know what "fun, positive" chapters you're talking about.

I also don't see what's rationalist about it. I see you conceded that the protagonist's powers are "Holmesian mutant powers", and that was a big turn-off for me. But I guess I missed all the insight into social dynamics and power.
