Really curious to know what makes you think that, and suspect we just have very different definitions for Grimdark. To me it's some combination of protagonist locus of control, capability to face challenges, win/loss ratio, confidence in themselves, and outcome. Twig wins on like all of these counts compared to Worm and Pact, even while still containing a lot of tragedy and bleakness.

Maybe I'm just calibrated weirdly though, and am curious for your perspective. If you want to use spoiler tags go for it.
