ok, sure. At some level it comes down to "I found the darkness in worm a lot more compelling and not as bleak but I can't really explain why" but here goes.

So first of all, I think you're probably right that we have different definitions of grimdark, in that I seem to consider the setting as part of it a lot more than you do. And the atmosphere of Twig is pretty awful. Whenever I picture it in my head, it looks... gray. Whenever we see "ordinary" people they don't seem to be doing so well.

On the other hand, even by your definition, I have a hard time seeing Twig as non-grimdark.
