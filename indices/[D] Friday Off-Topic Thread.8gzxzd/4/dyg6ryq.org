So I finally finished Twig, and I'm ready to reaffirm on my earlier midway review of it. No spoilers involved.

As I said before, it's the most implicitly rationalist of Wildbow's 3 major stories so far. A lot of the protagonist's inferences lean more toward Holmesian mutant powers (more literally in this case) rather than learnable rationalist techniques, but there's still a lot of insight into how people think, social dynamics, the interactions between power and status, and the light and dark sides of using that knowledge.

It's also definitely the least grimdark of the 3. The world is often nightmarish, and bad things happen, but there is far less of a relentless grind of negative thing after negative thing, of bad to worse. There's a lot more breathing room, a lot more "wins" and positive, even fun, chapters, and there's overall a stronger sense that the protagonist has control of their own destiny.

I think of Wildbow's three stories, Twig might be my favorite? But only because of the characters, which are a huge part of enjoying stories for me. Worm has my favorite plot, had great world building, but only had a few characters I really enjoyed. Pact has my favorite setting, a few great characters, and some solid twists and surprises. But Twig has my favorite characters by far.

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Worm, but also to those who did not enjoy Worm as much as others because of the characters or grimdarkness of it.
