I gave Full Metal Panic three episodes and it didn't click with me, but then I gave it one more and ended up binging the whole story arc. Dammit, I'm hooked. Now I have to watch more of this bizarre blend of genres that have no reason to be combined.

Half the time it's Ranma 1/2 meets Chuck, the other half it's Metal Gear Solid meets Gurren Lagaan....even for anime, wow that's a weird concept. I'm not even sure if it works, at least half the plot is stupid on purpose, but I still want to see more of it.
