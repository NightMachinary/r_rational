Spoilers for infinity war follow:

Did anyone else find it interesting that Strange could find an outcome where they won despite dying (even if temporarily)? The idea that Strange could view potential futures that accounted for Thanos having the stone is something I find strange. Doesn't that imply that thanos never makes full use of the stone? Else Thanos would be able to see what would happen and then react.

Really though that's minor in comparison to the overpopulation problem that he's supposedly reacting to. The largest plot point in the movie doesn't make sense. I can only conclude that he's an idiot-savant.
