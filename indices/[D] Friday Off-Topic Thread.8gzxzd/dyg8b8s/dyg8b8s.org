Look, all I'm saying is: 14,000,605 is basically just, like, 23.74 bits of entropy or so. So 1/14,000,605 chances at victory with uniform sampling over your own potential actions isn't actually /that bad/: it mostly just means you need to do roughly 24 coin-flips worth of the Right Thing.

Does this go against the maxim that a good plan has only three steps at most, and really only two because never be as baroque as possible? Possibly. It depends how many bits of optimization power you get out of each step in the plan.
