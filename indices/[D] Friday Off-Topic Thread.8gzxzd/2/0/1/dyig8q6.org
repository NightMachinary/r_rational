A day late, but whatever:

Thanos barely even uses the power of the stones except for the throwing the moon thing. He doesn't need to, but that's beside the point. Remember in the first Guardians movie when Ronan was going to destroy an entire planet with just one? Thanos has over 2 for most of the movie.

Maybe the gauntlet can only draw on some of the Stone's power? That seems consistent with his actions.

Strange, however, has time to focus on just the one stone, how to use it effectively, and he's drawing upon it directly.
