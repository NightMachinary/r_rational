My headcanon is that, while Thanos is Tough, he is not Tough Enough to directly channel the power of six (or even one) infinity stone. The gauntlet, in this case, serves as a complicated metaphysical 'transformer', stepping down the power of the stones and doing a good portion of the mental gymnastics necessary to actually command that power. This would then also be the reason why the gauntlet is /wrecked/ by the Snap, as it'd be blown out by the through-put necessary.
