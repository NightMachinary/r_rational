I'm trying to find the website where they mundanely explain Lovecraft's mythos sort of in-universe.

The gist of what I remember was that Lovecraft's racism made him build up a false interpretation of the personal philosophy of a devout Muslim scholar with strange but not heretical ideas on the divine.
