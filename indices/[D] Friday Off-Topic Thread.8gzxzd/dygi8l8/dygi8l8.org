I'm taking part in a fanfiction writing fest to try writing some new stuff with prompts outside of what I'd normally think of. Unlike most of these events, it's not related to any particular ship, and in fact is a non-shipping-fics-only kind of deal. Check it out, submit prompts, and/or sign up if this interests you. Hopefully this can give me some inspiration to write more.
