Hmm, I'm not sure what the schedule but I think it goes something like this, from what they wrote earlier:

May 2, 2018: sign-ups start

May 14, 2018: prompting closes

May 21, 2018: prompts posted

May 31, 2018: sign-ups end

And then shortly thereafter you can claim a prompt and start writing, I think it's a 6-week or 4-week window or something.
