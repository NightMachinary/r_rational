I'm really liking this, although it's got two distinct tones and the combination is kind of... weird. There's the tone that's "dust and remnants", and then there's the "recruiting for roflstomp". Both are done well, but the combo is weird.

But beside all that, it's got at least one twist that's absolutely inspired. Seriously it's amazing.
