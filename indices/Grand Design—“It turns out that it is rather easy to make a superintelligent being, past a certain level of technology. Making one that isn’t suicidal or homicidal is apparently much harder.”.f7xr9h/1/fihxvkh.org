Oh man, this is a really great book. The author perfectly captures the feel of Big Adventure sci-fi, but without ever resorting to the tropes that made that genre so eye-rollingly dumb. Also it's got a dog in it!

Related to that, he's actually writing a new story now called Inheritors of Eschaton, which is like what would happen if Stargate hadn't abandoned the importance of language. Keeps the importance of assault rifles, though.
