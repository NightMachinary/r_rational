This is absolutely brilliant ! It makes so much more sense than an independently evolved symbioite being compatible with human biology. This is going to be my personally preferred canon for the series. The mindless symbiote feeling pain in the home waters is puzzling at first, but makes sense as Baal"s after-the-fact interpretation of the symbiote memory.
