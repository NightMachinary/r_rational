You can dislike something due to personal preferences or plain lack of interest and thats fine and dandy.

That doesn't give you a blank check to talk shit about it. No one is starting a forum thread about why rational or rationalist fiction is just a label given a posteri that's trying to "co-opt" or "steal" well-written fiction, if they don't already have some serious preconceived notions 'bout the subject that go beyond "I'm not a fan of the constant science related stuff"
