  That doesn't give you a blank check to talk shit about it.

Pretty sure it does.

EDIT: I mean, unless a mod actively intervenes, there's no rule saying that somebody isn't allowed to talk shit on the SB/SV forum about a subject they dislike.

EDIT 2: There are rules against threadjacking though, so some of the posts may be in violation of those. I'd have to see the actual thread to tell.
