Well there's a large difference between claiming that "You personally don't like XYZ facet of this book/song/game, and that's why you don't think it's very good." and "X is a steaming pile of shit that is horribly written and has unrealistic protagonists."

The first is fine on all accounts, can't fault a person for having a differing opinion.

The second... if you're claiming that something is just inherently /bad/ as a whole or in some facet, then you need to bring some more ammunition to the argument if you want that claim to be remotely justified. You're no longer saying your dislike of the media is a personal opinion, but due to some inherently poor quality of the media itself that's just /objectively bad/, which is always open for debate.

You could say that HPMOR is bad because the pacing is glacial, some of the science is absolutely shoehorned in, and that the justification for Harry's scientific background (his stepdad's a Biochemist at Oxford) is a super flimsy excuse for his context knowledge (Biochemists wouldn't really have a reason to know any of those things that Harry talks about throughout the fanfic...).

Edit: Like, anyones welcome to just spout their opinions on the internet, but if someone preps a five page diatribe on "Why genre X is shit." without showing their work or at least providing some reasoning, then that's just terrible debating by any standards.
