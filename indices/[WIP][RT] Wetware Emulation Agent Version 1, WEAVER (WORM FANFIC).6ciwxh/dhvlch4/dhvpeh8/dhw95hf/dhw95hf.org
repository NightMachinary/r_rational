I've seen a lot of people on SB/SV that seem to dislike the genre as a result of some of their own personal biases.

One, the foremost example is usually given to be HPMOR, which has its own writing flaws and there is valid criticism to be made against the stylistic design vs it's intent as a work of (fan)fiction.

Two, it is seen by many to be an attempt to "STEM-ify" fiction. I think a lot of people who are into literature are naturally adverse to this since many of them have preconceived notions of the efficaciousness of science, mathematics logical reasoning etc. as well as some inherent dislike for these subjects (on average).

Three, many people just don't see the appeal. It's like a joke that gets lost in translation to the average audience member instead of playing to the common denominator of that particular audience. I would hazard a guess that many actually don't want to really think too hard about their entertainment if they just want some cool explosions or action scenes (the success of any Michael Bay film would suggest this), neatly regurgitated horror tropes, etc.to pass the time.
