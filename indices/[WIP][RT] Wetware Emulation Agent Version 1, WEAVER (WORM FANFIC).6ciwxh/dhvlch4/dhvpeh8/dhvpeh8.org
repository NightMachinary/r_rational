Fics from Spacebattles come up here pretty often actually, but the vast majority of them are not intended to be rational or rationalist and only cater to the general munchkinry and nerd culture of SB itself.

And the fact that spacebattlers aren't fond of rational culture and fiction is an understatement if I ever saw one. I've seen people bash and make fun of MoR even in threads that aren't related at all to these kinds of things. I remember that there was this average, nonrational fic in which some commenter simply wrote "I like this character because he's rational" which in the general context probably meant the casual definition of "smart". Literally the next post was MoR critique.
