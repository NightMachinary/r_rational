I spoke with Radvic on this one. Our main feedback is that we're primarily writing a collaborative story, which the mechanics are intended to facilitate as your (the players') tendrils of agency within the world -- as opposed to running a game with a set of mechanics that the narrative is supposed to support.

If you want a detailed set of clearly defined rules to exploit, that's what video games are for. If instead you want to participate in a simulation of a real world (insofar as it is possible to do that with fiction), it just doesn't work that way. You don't have access to the rules of physics underlying reality in real life, and almost all of the knowledge we take for granted has been earned through centuries of extremely intelligent people bashing their heads against a natural world that is wholly unmoved by their frustration. That isn't to say we want you to be frustrated, or that we're expecting that level of commitment to unearthing hidden secrets; only that you're going to have to work a lot harder than you have been if you want to be rewarded with deeper knowledge of how magic works.

To be fair, the first infopost says explicitly at the very top: "Note: just as you do not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern real life, you will not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern events in the story -- you will need to determine what works, what doesn't, and how to improve based on your own experimentation, progress, and ingenuity." I'll grant that we could probably be clearer on this front so as to avoid misunderstandings and frustration. Some of this is on us. But to be fair, I've said as much on multiple occasions (which you yourself have correctly pointed out in thread).

I think most of this might be bourne from some kind of perception on some of the players' part that the world is much more shallow than it actually is, coupled with a general aversion to being openly /wrong/ about things when there is so much uncertainty -- that is, judging by a few responses I've seen in the thread. It certainly isn't the case across the board. One or two players have made extremely accurate and astute observations in theorycrafting posts (even if most of the same theorycrafting has been wrong -- which is to be expected). I'm not sure what else I can say on that front besides "no -- there's a reason it took me and Radvic over 2 years of working on and off behind the scenes before I was comfortable starting the quest."

Additionally: while we certainly don't /not/ want our players to have fun, ensuring every possible method of interaction with the quest is fun isn't exactly on the top of our priorities. We /absolutely do want/ player interaction to be deeply rewarding and engaging. But that's only going to happen if you actually engage with the story on a deeper level, rather than dragging your heels and expecting spoon-fed results from pulling the mechanics levers in the right way. I half-expect to get downvoted for saying this, but I'm not going to own the mistakes of my players if they believe they can interact with the story in a shallow and confused fashion and expect anything but shallow and confusing results in response. Think of it this way. If I gave you a budget of $10k and said "go figure out the fliglebloog effect from the gargablag artifact which you only know about from a description in a story that might not even be based on anything real," how much progress are you going to make on that?

With Research Magic in particular, you (the players) have thus far chose to spend your limited VP in very shallow ways (that is, directing Fi to research something out of folklore and legend and giving her a small, fixed budget). As has been communicated (and again, perhaps this should have been made clearer), Fi isn't going to be able to make much progress on research without (1) a /really/ solid idea of how the magic is supposed to work, including its mechanisms of action and limitations, or (2) a working example to draw from. A lot of stuff just isn't going to be possible -- and further, the players haven't seem to even acknowledge that fact despite me saying so on multiple occasions. Direct quote shortly after Chapter 3: "Oh also, some of those legends Zelda referenced may or may not be pure bunk. Or they might all contain the barest nuggets of truth. Or they could all just be fanciful stories and scary tales. Or maybe I just want to screw with you and you should disregard this message. Or maybe it's all 100% real. Who knows." I think there's even been an IC response from Fi (though I might be confusing things) to the effect of saying that any VP spent on research isn't guaranteed to result in anything at all.

The ability is there, and you may use it. That doesn't mean you have to, or that you're expected to, or that you'll need to right away if you want to make progress. Ultimately, figuring all this out is up to you (the players).

All that said, I want to thank you for your honest and open feedback. Unless it isn't absolutely clear: both I and Radvic are heavily committed to making this quest a rewarding and engaging experience for our players, and we care very much about fixing and addressing problems that crop up. We've talked about these issues and if nothing else we'll certainly keep them in mind as we move forward.
