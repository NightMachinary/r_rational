  The ability is there, and you may use it. That doesn't mean you have to, or that you're expected to, or that you'll need to right away if you want to make progress. Ultimately, figuring all this out is up to you (the players).

Since this is one of our primary mechanisms for exploring the game world as a whole, I think some out-of-game clarity on how the expected use would be very helpful.

To give you an example, I mean something like:

*Research Magic*

This allows you to attempt to research a spell. This has a variable cost, and chances of success are modified by the following factors:

- Direct experiences with the magic being used.
- Items that already possess the magic.
- Detailed records of previous uses of the magic.
- Similar magic being used as a foundation in the research process.

Research magic requests should include the following elements:

- Spell Name
- VP Used on Research
- Methods used for research.
- Examples used for spell research (e.g. items, existing spells, legends, etc.)
- Expected results of the spell.
- Expected VP cost for casting the spell.
- Expected restrictions on using the spell.
- Expected time to cast.

*Example spell:*

- *Name:* Lesser Mark of Transference
- *VP Used on Research:* 100
- *Methods of Research:* Utilizing your knowledge of the Mark of Transference spell, attempt to create a mark on Link that emulates the VP collection function of the Mark of Transference, but without duplicating any of the other functionality of the original spell.
- *Examples for Research*: This is a reduced version of the existing Mark of Transference spell.
- *Expected Results for Spell*: If successful, this will create a limited-effect version of a Mark of Transference that collects VP based on the target's level of activity. It will also serve as a foundation that can later be upgraded to a full Mark of Transference spell. It has none of the other functions of a full Mark of Transference.
- *Expected VP Cost for Casting:* Variable by target, based on a portion of the cost of a full Mark of Transference. Due to significantly reduced functionality, expected cost is 25% of the cost of a "full" Mark.
- *Expected Restrictions*: This spell requires the consent of the target, just like a full Mark of Transference.
- *Expected Time to Cast*: 25% of the time of casting a Mark of Transference on the same target.

I'm not saying you should use my description - this is simply an example of the type of thing I think players would find useful. Please, give us examples like this.

  All that said, I want to thank you for your honest and open feedback. Unless it isn't absolutely clear: both I and Radvic are heavily committed to making this quest a rewarding and engaging experience for our players, and we care very much about fixing and addressing problems that crop up. We've talked about these issues and if nothing else we'll certainly keep them in mind as we move forward.
