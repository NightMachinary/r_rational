  I spoke with Radvic on this one. Our main feedback is that we're primarily writing a collaborative story, which the mechanics are intended to facilitate as your (the players') tendrils of agency within the world -- as opposed to running a game with a set of mechanics that the narrative is supposed to support.
#+end_quote

I think the difficulty here is that we're having trouble understanding how our own means of interaction with the world work. This is getting somewhat clearer over time, though.

  If you want a detailed set of clearly defined rules to exploit, that's what video games are for. If instead you want to participate in a simulation of a real world (insofar as it is possible to do that with fiction), it just doesn't work that way. You don't have access to the rules of physics underlying reality in real life, and almost all of the knowledge we take for granted has been earned through centuries of extremely intelligent people bashing their heads against a natural world that is wholly unmoved by their frustration.
#+end_quote

I think you're operating under a false premise here - I'm not looking for playing something that's automated like a video game. I'm used to quests being structured more like a tabletop game, with relatively clear rules and mechanics, at least for the things players are capable of doing.

A more minimalist approach is fine, even if it's not to my personal tastes. The thing I'm having difficulty with is when we're presented with information that looks like gameplay rules (e.g. spell descriptions), but that information is unclear or unreliable.

#+begin_quote
  That isn't to say we want you to be frustrated, or that we're expecting that level of commitment to unearthing hidden secrets; only that you're going to have to work a lot harder than you have been if you want to be rewarded with deeper knowledge of how magic works.
#+end_quote

I'm all about exploring how magic works, and I do a ton of exploring that when I'm running games or writing books. The problem that I'm running into isn't that it's difficult to learn about the intricate details of magic.

I'm struggling with the fact that the rules on "how to use Research Magic" are unclear.

For example, for a LARP that I run, spell research requests come in with a specific template. This includes things like the name of the spell, the expected mana cost, the expected function, how the research is being performed, the types of magic it uses, etc. That's the type of thing I'd like the QMs to be clear about: How do we play your game?

#+begin_quote
  To be fair, the first infopost says explicitly at the very top: "Note: just as you do not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern real life, you will not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern events in the story -- you will need to determine what works, what doesn't, and how to improve based on your own experimentation, progress, and ingenuity." I'll grant that we could probably be clearer on this front so as to avoid misunderstandings and frustration. Some of this is on us. But to be fair, I've said as much on multiple occasions (which you yourself have correctly pointed out in thread).
#+end_quote

Absolutely. I get what you're going for here - I just think that there's a distinction between being vague about things like in-world physics and being vague about things like how to format posts, requests, etc. in the format that you want.

Basically, I'd like for you to give us some templates for things like how you'd want action plans to be structured, how to utilize each individual spell, etc.

#+begin_quote
  I think most of this might be bourne from some kind of perception on some of the players' part that the world is much more shallow than it actually is, coupled with a general aversion to being openly wrong about things when there is so much uncertainty -- that is, judging by a few responses I've seen in the thread.
#+end_quote

I haven't been having any issues with thinking that the world is shallow, personally, or anything along those lines. The depth of the setting seems very solid. My problems come with from how player interaction with the game works, not the setting.

#+begin_quote
  I half-expect to get downvoted for saying this, but I'm not going to own the mistakes of my players if they believe they can interact with the story in a shallow and confused fashion and expect anything but shallow and confusing results in response. Think of it this way. If I gave you a budget of $10k and said "go figure out the fliglebloog effect from the gargablag artifact," how much progress are you going to make on that?
#+end_quote

In my opinion, this is a game design issue, not a player issue.

If you're repeatedly seeing players interacting with the game in ways that don't make sense to you - for example, making vague statements like "go figure out the fliglebloog effect from the gargablag artifact", then there need to be instructions on what your /expected/ posts look like.

We also have some conflicting design elements:

- There are a lot of things that feel like they /need/ to be addressed quickly.
- You seem to want more detail than we've been giving.
- The two points above conflict with the fact that we have a very low (200) word count maximum.
- The end result is fractured sentences and hard-to-read instructions.

I've attempted to guess what you're looking for and write things out in a clearer way, but while I do appreciate you saying things like "Salaris is closer to the mark" on spell research, that's still extremely open-ended. What elements of my research suggestion are what you were looking for? What aren't? What would be helpful for you as a QM for us to include?

That kind of information should be in the spell descriptions, too, not something that people are going to have to dig through a bunch of posts to find information on. Putting it right in the ability descriptions helps new players that might catch up by checking things in Reader Mode, as well as existing players who may not catch every single reply, etc.

  With Research Magic in particular, you (the players) have thus far chose to spend your limited VP in very shallow ways (that is, directing Fi to research something out of folklore and legend and giving her a small, fixed budget). As has been communicated (and again, perhaps this should have been made clearer), Fi isn't going to be able to make much progress on research without (1) a really solid idea of how the magic is supposed to work, including its mechanisms of action and limitations, or (2) a working example to draw from. A lot of stuff just isn't going to be possible -- and further, the players haven't seem to even acknowledge that fact despite me saying so on multiple occasions.
#+end_quote

I've been trying to clarify this to the players myself (as you've seen), but it would be much clearer and more meaningful if you laid out instructions on how exactly you expect the ability to be used.

  Direct quote shortly after Chapter 3: "Oh also, some of those legends Zelda referenced may or may not be pure bunk. Or they might all contain the barest nuggets of truth. Or they could all just be fanciful stories and scary tales.
#+end_quote

I think the players as a whole understand this part, we're just spending VP to try to figure out more details. I've personally pushed for gathering more physical items through things like the Order of Sages, that just hasn't actually made it into a winning plan yet.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe I just want to screw with you and you should disregard this message. Or maybe it's all 100% real. Who knows.
#+end_quote

This kind of attitude makes it very hard to get excited about playing, honestly.

#+begin_quote
  I think there's even been an IC response from Fi (though I might be confusing things) to the effect of saying that any VP spent on research isn't guaranteed to result in anything at all.
#+end_quote

Yeah, we know that, but there are differing opinions in the player base on how to approach that issue. Some people want to go with the bare minimum VP spend and assume that spending any VP at all will get us an answer on if something is viable. Some people feel like a higher investment is more likely to get us usable data, but with disagreements on what a viable VP range would be. Others think we should just be saving our VP for marks, or waiting until we get physical items to study, etc.
