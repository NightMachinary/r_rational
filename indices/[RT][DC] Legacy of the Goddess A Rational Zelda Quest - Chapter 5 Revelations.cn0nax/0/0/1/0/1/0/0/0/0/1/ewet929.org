  To attribute to us as QMs "want" for what you do as players is incorrect. When the world slaps you down, it isn't the QMs doing that or trying to send you a message. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure.

I get what you're trying to say here, but the QMs are the ones who set up the start conditions, the variables for the simulation, the mechanics for things like the magic system etc.

I don't know exactly what you're doing under the hood (which is, of course, by design), but certain factors are always going to come down to the people writing the story.

To give you an example, Fi telling Zelda that Hylea is dead was a decision on the QM side, not a simulation. That's an area where player phrasing and formatting was relevant - if players had a better idea of how specific of detail we were supposed to give Fi in her communications with Zelda, it's likely we would have told her /not/ to approach the conversation from that standpoint. From a player perspective, that type of thing is extremely relevant.

  When the world rewards you for your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that or rewarding you for good play. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure.

The VP rewards/planning incentives are direct rewards from the QMs for how we write our plans, though.

  When NPCs are hostile to your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that. It's the result of those actors acting according to their desires in the system we've set up, as best we figure.
#+end_quote

QMs are still writing those NPCs, though. I don't think there's any way for QMs to be completely dispassionate executors of the simulation (nor do I think that would be a good idea even if it was possible).

I apologize if I'm coming across as needlessly contrary here, but I don't agree with your assessments about a lot of this.

  You keep asking me for clarity. I don't know how much clearer I can be on this topic.
#+end_quote

I believe I understand your philosophy a bit better now, it's just very different from my own, which poses challenges to my ability to participate in your game effectively. I will do my best to try to adapt to your style, and if I can't, I'll bow out as gracefully as possible.

Thank you again for taking the time to write these replies, as well as to run the game. I appreciate your time, and I hope understand that my detailed replies are due to my own interest and respect for your work, even if I have disagreements with you about certain elements of the game.
