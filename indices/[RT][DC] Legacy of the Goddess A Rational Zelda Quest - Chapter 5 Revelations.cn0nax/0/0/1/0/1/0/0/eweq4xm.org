  My problem lies with there being ambiguities about what we're supposed to include in a post
#+end_quote

I've said this before in other contexts, but it's just as applicable here: there are no magic answers. We aren't looking for you to guess our passwords. There simply isn't any predefined way you're "supposed" to do this.

We know roughly what magic can and cannot do (though there may be patches or holes in our own understanding of the system). All we're "looking for" is observing how players approach the problem and then conveying what we believe the results of the efforts to be.

  I don't think there's anything to be gained on the player side or the QM side from having formatting a post be part of the challenge of the game.

The details of formatting aren't and haven't ever been an issue. What I'm trying to get at is that there's a large gap between the space you're pointing towards with your formatting proposals and a one-line bullet point saying "put 10 VP towards researching the Lens of Truth effect." So far, what's been put into plans is the latter.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that most of your gripe has been in frustration stemming from trying and failing to convince other players to do it differently. But what you're asking for (detailed guidelines on how to present research directives) is at odds with how we intend research to be done, full stop. It might serve the purpose of allowing you to sidestep the frustration by holding it up and saying "see? QM says do it this way", but that doesn't mean it is the only solution, or even necessarily a good one.

There's a larger set of issues this touches on, pertaining to navigating coordination issues with other players given the quest constraints in particular and forum-style communication in general. I presently don't think it's worth getting into that, as I'm hopeful most of the roughness will clear up with time, and also with better constraints on plans.
