  In my opinion, this is a game design issue, not a player issue.

  If you're repeatedly seeing players interacting with the game in ways that don't make sense to you - for example, making vague statements like "go figure out the fliglebloog effect from the gargablag artifact", then there need to be instructions on what your expected posts look like.

  We also have some conflicting design elements:

  There are a lot of things that feel like they need to be addressed quickly. You seem to want more detail than we've been giving. The two points above conflict with the fact that we have a very low (200) word count maximum. The end result is fractured sentences and hard-to-read instructions. I've attempted to guess what you're looking for and write things out in a clearer way, but while I do appreciate you saying things like "Salaris is closer to the mark" on spell research, that's still extremely open-ended. What elements of my research suggestion are what you were looking for? What aren't? What would be helpful for you as a QM for us to include?

  That kind of information should be in the spell descriptions, too, not something that people are going to have to dig through a bunch of posts to find information on. Putting it right in the ability descriptions helps new players that might catch up by checking things in Reader Mode, as well as existing players who may not catch every single reply, etc.

I'm going to fall back on what I've stated previously. It simply isn't the case that I intend to give players an easy and intuitive channel to do research. The real world doesn't work like that. The fact that this is ostensibly "a game" does not mean I am bound by having to follow anything that looks like "proper game design."

I intend for players to figure this out the hard way (including what types of approaches are more fruitful and which are less so). And when/if they make progress I expect it will be appropriately rewarding. I also appreciate it might be frustrating working with an open-ended system like this, and appreciate you may rightly judge it to be "poor game design." I even appreciate that you might not want to participate in the process. But none of that changes my perspective on the issue.
