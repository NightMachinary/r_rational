Thanks for your feedback, and I'm glad you've enjoyed it (though the writing is all Vecht :) )

Some of this is due to starting quest issues and a bit of communication issues on our end for which I apologize, and I believe will clear up as the story goes on (e.g. I hadn't fully stress tested Sacrifice at quest start). This should also be cleared up as we don't really intend to provide additional tooltips moving forward -- we expect the players to track the results of what they try and learn from them. If they want documented use cases, they can experiment with them to generate use cases.

I suspect that the crux of the matter here is a difference of goals. Vecht and I are out to write a collaborative story with interesting characters, decisions, and planning which is supported by reasonable mechanics. We are not trying to make a set of clearly defined rules and ask people to find edge cases to hit the win button. If people want that sort of thing, they should play a video game instead of a quest -- computers track that sort of thing better, and a full team of developers will probably make a more robust set of rules than two people in their spare time. At the end of the day, we don't think the world works via video game logic and exploits, and we don't want that to dominate our story (which necessitates either being smart enough to remove literally every unintended edge case upfront (we've certainly tried, but are confident we've missed spots), or "black boxing" the mechanics so that the edge cases can be dealt with without significantly impact the story or player expectations).

As an example of why we're doing it this way: In Marked for Death, explicit mechanics were written to explain how substitution worked. The QMs worked on it, and I discovered that this meant every ninja should be able to set off atomic scale warheads by the time they've got ~1 year of experience. This meant that we as players had it as a goal to go for that, but, when the QMs got around to modeling it, decided to change the mechanics so that this didn't happen. If substitution had been black boxed, the players wouldn't have pursued it, and there never would have been the disappointment, the feeling of being cheated out of something, or a disruption of the story due to issues in the way the game was set up. As another example, Marked for Death needed to revise their mechanics systems a few times. Ultimately, each time, players were very cognizant of relative increases and decreases in power, which were (at least to me) disruptive to the story and planning. By Black boxing these things, we limit player understanding of their power to what is viewed on screen, so the backend mechanics need only match up to what is shown, not what is extrapolated into edge cases. This, we believe, leads towards a more stable quest.
