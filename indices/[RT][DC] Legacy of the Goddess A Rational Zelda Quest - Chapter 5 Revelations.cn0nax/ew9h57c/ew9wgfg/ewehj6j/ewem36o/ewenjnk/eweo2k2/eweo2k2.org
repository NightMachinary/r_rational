  I'm willing to up the word count limits, or try some other constraints. I'll discuss it with Radvic. The other thing we're trying to ensure is that people can interact with the quest without demanding too much from them in having to read through and parse megaplans with tons of multilayered bullet points. That just isn't fun for anyone. The ideal solution would be if players could just not, but for various reasons that doesn't work.

I think it might be more possible to get players to cut down their plan scope if we had clearer time allocations for specific tasks, like:

- Talk to a person at the castle: x hours
- Talk to someone elsewhere: x hours
- Travel to another location: x days
- Research a spell: x hours
- Assign people to a task: x hours
- Write a letter: x hours
- Cast a spell: x hours
- Etc.

That way, a plan that contains four bullet points would take up the same amount of in-world time as two plans that each have two of the bullet points, but with greater detail.

Alternatively, give us a limited number of "action points" or "time units" per turn and have specific types of actions take up a set number of action points or action points. This would be forcing the issue more, but it would also be the easiest way to get the kind of turns you want, imo.
