  While we see that there are VP bonuses for things like brevity and clarity, we do not have large enough sample sizes to compare results across plans, nor do those point scores have clear enough breakdowns for us to currently understand why those specific point values are being awarded. More clarity on that front might help improve this issue as well, at least in the long-term.

FWIW no one has asked after that information. I'm happy to provide it. We break it down every time and try and judge it as fairly and impartially as we can.
