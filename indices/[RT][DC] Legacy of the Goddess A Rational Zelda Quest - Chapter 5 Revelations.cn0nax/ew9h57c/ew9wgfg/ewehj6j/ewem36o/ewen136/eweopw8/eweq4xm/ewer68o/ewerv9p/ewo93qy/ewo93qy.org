  To attribute to us as QMs "want" for what you do as players is incorrect. When the world slaps you down, it isn't the QMs doing that or trying to send you a message. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure.

Good luck ever convincing them of that. Obviously, any time anything bad happens it's because the QMs are giant meanies who are punishing the players. The idea of "following a simulation" is utterly foreign and you should expect to be semi-regularly accused of lying about that being your goal.
