  Apologies; not my intent. I enjoy poking and prodding people playfully at times. I recognize it's easy for that to be misinterpreted. This particular instance was more or less copying something I said from the discord (which is a more relaxed and casual atmosphere with people who I've been interacting with for years via MfD).

That's fair, and I apologize if I'm overreacting. I've had some bad experiences with game masters that have enjoyed screwing with their players (in hostile/adversarial ways), and I may react overly strongly to things that come across that way. Tone is tricky to relay on the internet, and I'll try to give you the benefit of the doubt more.
