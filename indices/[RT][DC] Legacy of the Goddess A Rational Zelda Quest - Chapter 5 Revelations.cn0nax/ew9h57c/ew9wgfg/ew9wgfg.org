The world building and writing in general have been excellent quality, and I've been enjoying the story so far quite a bit.

The "game" side of the quest has been much more difficult for me to enjoy so far. I think the latest changes to how we are constructing plans may help somewhat with that, and you've been better about setting expectations after the latest plan.

I think my biggest issue is that we have been running into a lot of disagreements between players about the fundamentals of how game mechanics work, and I think that ultimately comes down to the mechanics themselves being vague and open ended. I get the impression that your intent is for us to gradually learn more about the mechanics along with the story and setting through testing, but my observation thus far has been that these ambiguities in core mechanics are not fun for players to explore - they're just needlessly confusing and annoying.

There are a couple levels to these vague mechanics. Some of them are clearly deliberate, like the unknown costs for applying marks and performing spell research.

The other level are things like the descriptions of the spells we already have being unclear, such as how Sacrifice didn't work anything like how the players were reading it.

I would advise you to address at /least/ the second issue - vague tooltip for things we already can do. Personally, I consider it to be poor game design to give players abilities that are functionally very different from what their description implies. Similarly, I would advise adding use cases, especially for Research Magic.

I don't think things like the unknown costs for marks are fun, either, but I suspect those are more of a conscious design decision that I simply disagree with. Perhaps a middle ground of giving us a clear mark cost if we spend a reasonable and clear void point amount would be a good middle ground.

The "black box" style of approach to how things work doesn't appeal to me as a player - I prefer clear rules systems in general - so I have some biases here. That said, I think that other players are running into similar difficulties, and those difficulties are contributing toward making the game more confusing and less fun overall.

I would like to thank you again for running the quest. Your writing is excellent, and your world has been fun to explore.
