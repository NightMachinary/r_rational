  I've said this before in other contexts, but it's just as applicable here: there are no magic answers. We aren't looking for you to guess our passwords. There simply isn't any predefined way you're "supposed" to do this.
#+end_quote

It feels like you've decided some player approaches are "wrong", though, even if you don't have a "right" way. Perhaps that's just my perception.

#+begin_quote
  We know roughly what magic can and cannot do (though there may be patches or holes in our own understanding of the system). All we're "looking for" is observing how players approach the problem and then conveying what we believe the results of the efforts to be.
#+end_quote

I get that, but I do think clearer instructions and examples would go a long way toward facilitating that.

#+begin_quote
  The details of formatting aren't and haven't ever been an issue. What I'm trying to get at is that there's a large gap between the space you're pointing towards with your formatting proposals and a one-line bullet point saying "put 10 VP towards researching the Lens of Truth effect." So far, what's been put into plans is the latter.
#+end_quote

Sure, absolutely. I think the issue is that none of the players are clear on how close approaches like my own are to acceptable, or what the difference in effectiveness would be between one of my lower-detail plans and one of my higher detail ones.

I recognize that you seem to be of the opinion that players should try plans with varying degrees of complexity and see what happens, but that doesn't appear to be a natural play pattern with your player base.

#+begin_quote
  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that most of your gripe has been in frustration stemming from trying and failing to convince other players to do it differently.
#+end_quote

No, that's incorrect. While I'd certainly like it if more people would vote for my plans, that's absolutely not the main issue here, as I see it.

My main problem is that we don't have a good idea of what you, as QMs, are looking for - and as a result, everyone is just shotgunning out submissions in their own personal styles.

When each chapter is posted, the main thing people are voting on in the aftermath is the plan of action. Formatting is, from a player standpoint, secondary to that - even if it's something that is, from a QM perspective, extremely relevant.

While we see that there are VP bonuses for things like brevity and clarity, we do not have large enough sample sizes to compare results across plans, nor do those point scores have clear enough breakdowns for us to currently understand /why/ those specific point values are being awarded. More clarity on that front might help improve this issue as well, at least in the long-term.

#+begin_quote
  But what you're asking for (detailed guidelines on how to present research directives) is at odds with how we intend research to be done, full stop. It might serve the purpose of allowing you to sidestep the frustration by holding it up and saying "see? QM says do it this way", but that doesn't mean it is the only solution, or even necessarily a good one.
#+end_quote

Okay. I think we're just going to disagree about this, and that's fine. It's ultimately your game, and I respect that you'll make decisions that are different from my own.

#+begin_quote
  There's a larger set of issues this touches on, pertaining to navigating coordination issues with other players given the quest constraints in particular and forum-style communication in general. I presently don't think it's worth getting into that, as I'm hopeful most of the roughness will clear up with time, and also with better constraints on plans.
#+end_quote

Fair enough.
