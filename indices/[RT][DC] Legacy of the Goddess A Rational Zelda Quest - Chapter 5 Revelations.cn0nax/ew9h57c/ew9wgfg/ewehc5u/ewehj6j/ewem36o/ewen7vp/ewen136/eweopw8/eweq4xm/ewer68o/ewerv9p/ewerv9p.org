  It feels like you've decided some player approaches are "wrong", though, even if you don't have a "right" way. Perhaps that's just my perception

Yes, that is correct. I don't have to know how to build a rocket engine to know that you don't start by building it out of wood, for example.

  My main problem is that we don't have a good idea of what you, as QMs, are looking for - and as a result, everyone is just shotgunning out submissions in their own personal styles.

Again: There are no magic answers. There are no passwords to guess. There isn't anything we "want" you to do. There is the simulated world, which we simulate to the best of our ability, and then there is what you relay to us that you want to do in that world. We write the results of your actions. To attribute to us as QMs "want" for what you do as players is incorrect. When the world slaps you down, it isn't the QMs doing that or trying to send you a message. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure. When the world rewards you for your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that or rewarding you for good play. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure. When NPCs are hostile to your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that. It's the result of those actors acting according to their desires in the system we've set up, as best we figure.

There are no problems with whatever approach you take, be that a highly rigid and well-defined format for plans, or people "shotgunning" styles. We don't care (insofar as it isn't a headache to read and parse plans for us and other players -- we do care about that). They're all valid, and we're going to do the exact same thing: write the results of whatever it is you try and do within the world, according to how we believe the world should unfold. This includes research. This includes /absolutely everything/ you do.

You keep asking me for clarity. I don't know how much clearer I can be on this topic.
