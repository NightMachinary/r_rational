  We also have some conflicting design elements:

  There are a lot of things that feel like they need to be addressed quickly. You seem to want more detail than we've been giving. The two points above conflict with the fact that we have a very low (200) word count maximum. The end result is fractured sentences and hard-to-read instructions.

I'm willing to up the word count limits, or try some other constraints. I'll discuss it with Radvic. The other thing we're trying to ensure is that people can interact with the quest without demanding too much from them in having to read through and parse megaplans with tons of multilayered bullet points. That just isn't fun for anyone. The ideal solution would be if players could /just not/, but for various reasons that doesn't work.
