  I'm going to fall back on what I've stated previously. It simply isn't the case that I intend to give players an easy and intuitive channel to do research. The real world doesn't work like that. The fact that this is ostensibly "a game" does not mean I am bound by having to follow anything that looks like "proper game design."

I understand that you're trying to go for something that more closely resembles the real world, but I still think that should mean the problems with magic research should come from difficulties that are encountered on the in-character side.

I can get there being ambiguities about how much it helps to have things like example spells, or physical examples of a magic type to study, or whatever. My problem lies with there being ambiguities about what we're supposed to include in a post. In-character difficulties are great. Meta-game difficulties because we don't know what you want in a post are just frustrating.

  I intend for players to figure this out the hard way (including what types of approaches are more fruitful and which are less so). And when/if they make progress I expect it will be appropriately rewarding. I also appreciate it might be frustrating working with an open-ended system like this, and appreciate you may rightly judge it to be "poor game design." I even appreciate that you might not want to participate in the process. But none of that changes my perspective on the issue.

I honestly might just have to bow out at some point, then. I don't really want to, because I respect your writing and the world itself, but dealing with problems on the level of "How do I format a magic research post?" is extremely frustrating.

I don't think there's anything to be gained on the player side or the QM side from having formatting a post be part of the challenge of the game.
