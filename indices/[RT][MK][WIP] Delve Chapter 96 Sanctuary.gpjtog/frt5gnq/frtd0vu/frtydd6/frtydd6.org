I was excited, initially, by people's speculation that Rain would dig straight down to reach more powerful monsters as a means of escaping the limits of the dome. It really looked like it might go that way and give a second meaning to the title â€˜Delve'. Rain could have dug down, bitten off more than he could chew, developed as a character and had opportunities to grow stronger without it making everything too easy (tropes like a dungeon area that suppresses the character's power, or mysterious portals that send the character somewhere where everything's overpowered abound, to name a few ways out once Rain's somewhere truly unusual). I don't feel bad for the author, if they are unwilling to shake up the status quo in a way that can permit progress again. Hell, something sent Rain to this world in the first place, why shouldn't it yank him out the moment he's got a handle on things? Character growth is about facing adversity, and Rain's arc doesn't seem to have much anything interesting left - not to mention that the moment the rest of the story is predictable it's hard to justify another hundred thousand words telling it.
