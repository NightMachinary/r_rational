I don't agree that the author has backed themself into a hole. In my opinion the story has been more about exploring a new world and a neat magic system than anything else. Giving the main character more power doesn't remove conflict from the series it just changes what the conflict is about. I think, so far, the author has done a very good job of transitioning through different challenges (language barrier, lack of common knowledge, how to advance after lvl cap was reached, Barrier and invasion, etc.) and of those I would say that a lot of them haven't actually been about combat.

I can see the author transitioning to different forms of conflict as the story goes on. It seems like rain has large ideological problems with the current governments and I can see him being at odds with those governments in (much later) story arcs. Whether that is on the scale of rain forming a conflicting government or him working within an existing system (such as being a dke citizen).

Additionally, the power level is only an issue if the world didn't scale with those power levels. So far it seems like everyone at high levels is extremely powerful (and there are more flexible limits on power based on the soul, damage cap, etc.).
