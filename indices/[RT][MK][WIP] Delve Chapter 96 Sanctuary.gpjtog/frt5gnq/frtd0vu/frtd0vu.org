While all you have said is very true. I dont feel like we need the power up /now/. What really annoyed me about the story lately is that it moved from its already slow pacing to almost stagnating. We got all these situations and plots converging onto fel sedanis with rain inside.

DKE taking over fel sedanis

Lavarro going after Westbridge

Velika in power

Our party got split

Global and continental Politics

The attack of the Empire

The tensions inside the city

All those things are really, really cool. Finally we have some action, the world gets a little bit bigger and we are looking for that payoff. I thought we could have had it. With the watch and velika fighting each other but what happens after is a bit... weird.

Rain gets stuck in a hole for like 8 chapters. Nothing happens, carten has one paragraph of focus as the only party member of rain in the city. Westbridge gets killed OFFSCREEN. We are introduced to some members of DKE which immedentially get killed and we are left to wonder about how should we even care about them. The Empire leaves Fel Sedanis(?) even though they just curbstomped the members of the DKE and there is no sign of the watch or the guild in sight. As one of the posters said on a previous chapter thread. The light guy has a frankly ridiculous motivation that might be explained in the future but now he just looks stupid. The Empire defeating those DKE citizens is just kinda author fiat cuz the guys had a pretty solid plan while trying to avoid detection etc but 100 soldiers and 1 gold (?) is enough to absolutely murdere them cuz illusions(WHICH THEY KNOW ABOUT)

there was near zero payoff from the entire situation for me besides the velika fight. and that was just ONE thing that i am still kinda dissatisfied with cuz i guess nobody but rain cares about it ? it feels weird that in a watch controlled city everyone just doesnt care about them and every character is like "meh, those were adventurers and the watch, those things happen".

I really dont need a rain powerup or whatever to enjoy the story, i just want to see some interesting stuff happen and ... thats been a dissapointment so far.
