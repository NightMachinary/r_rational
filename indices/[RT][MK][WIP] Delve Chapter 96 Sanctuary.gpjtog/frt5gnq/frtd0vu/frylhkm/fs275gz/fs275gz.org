Good idea, the cave section could be a great follow up to a catastrophic fight for readers. Use it to hammer home how he still needs to get stronger and to mourn all the dead/how the world works. Breaks in action, excitement, and stakes are great but as is there was already a lack of those before the cave.

Edit: I really disagree about the Lightbreaker fight though. If his illusions tied up the 3 citizens specifically selected to fight the Empire that's a big enough win. Distract them then slam them with reinforcements, great. Distract them and essentially solo them? Guess the Citizens are super incompetent. Also I want to point out that he burned the Citizen who's legendary skills were hot/cold manipulation and conversion to death. He also managed to easily fool them even though they knew exactly who he was. You're fighting the light mage who you know at least makes whole armies invisible, and you have no precautions?
