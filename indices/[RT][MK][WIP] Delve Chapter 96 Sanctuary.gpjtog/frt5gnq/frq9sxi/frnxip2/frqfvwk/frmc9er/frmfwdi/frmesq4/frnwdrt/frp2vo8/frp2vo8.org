Rain can do essentially whatever he wants now, the situation is very different. Rain is a self-AoE specialist and everyone is stuck in the area with him.

1. Rain is essentially the right hand man of the domes dictator, she's currently injured but likely killed all threats to herself in the dome. Rain is now politically and combatively extremely powerful in the dome.

2. Rain is the domes only hope of reversing or reducing the domes greenhouse effect, along with purify probably preventing CO2/filth issues. If all he can do is cool water this is even stronger, since he is now creating a resource (cold water) he has a monopoly on.

3. Rain used to be a walking watch/civilian WMD and is now a whole dome WMD. Instead of cooling he could heat and cook the entire dome. Hopping into flowing water would make this fast but just using waves of heat alternated with self cooling would likely make the dome unlivable for everyone else before the Citizen gets informed and responds.

Edit: Hell, any amount of water heating kills everyone by heat exhaustion. If your only source of hydration is hot I don't think you can compensate. A warm water source is so unnatural I can't find any research on it, but at some point drinking warm water stops helping you regulate your core temperature at all.
