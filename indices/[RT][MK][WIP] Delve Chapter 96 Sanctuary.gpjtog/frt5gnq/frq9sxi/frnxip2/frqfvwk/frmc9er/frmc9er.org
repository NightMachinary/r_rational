Rain uses Purify in town square.

Rain gets thrown out of guild and nearly breaks a bone by Halgrave for illegal magic use.

/Looooong/ montage of harrowing events before Rain gets back into city and guild.

Rain uses *intimidate*, Refrigerate, and death threats. They are effective!

Rain gets thrown out of city again by Halgrave and Watch.

Have you /learned/ nothing Rain!?!?!?!
