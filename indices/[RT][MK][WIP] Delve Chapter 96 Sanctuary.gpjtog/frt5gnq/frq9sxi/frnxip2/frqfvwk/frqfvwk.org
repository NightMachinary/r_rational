I'm getting a bit impatient that he's still stuck in level 18 for several months real time now. I might drop and come back when I see some progress - I was hoping this oversoul thing might be potentially an alternate source of power.

Can someone who has Patreon let me know if he gets at all stronger in the next 10 or so chapters? That translates to another 2 months in real time, and if he still doesn't get at all stronger I might just drop this until 2021.
