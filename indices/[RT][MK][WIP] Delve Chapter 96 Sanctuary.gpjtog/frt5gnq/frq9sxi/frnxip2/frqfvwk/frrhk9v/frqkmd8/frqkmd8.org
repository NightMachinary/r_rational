People on the patreon have been raving for weeks about how his build is way overpowered, and he hasn't actually substantially changed power level in months now. At least not counting the physical strength stuff from the rings. His aura's do basically the same amount of damage since well before the dome went up. So I'm fairly sure they know something we don't and we'll get something new relatively soon.

But I'm also frustrated at the slow pace. The author has over 2000 patrons on patreon now. Even if they are all at the $2.50, get early access to chapters level, that's very nearly quit your job to write full time money. But we're still getting one chapter a week. I hate to complain about something I'm getting for free, but you think he would be able to justify some more writing time.
