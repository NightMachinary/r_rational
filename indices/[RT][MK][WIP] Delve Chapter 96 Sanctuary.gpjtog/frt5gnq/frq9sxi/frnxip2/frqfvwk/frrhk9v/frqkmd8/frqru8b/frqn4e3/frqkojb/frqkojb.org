I find this a bit silly, because it implies that the only measure of improvement possible is in level, despite the fact that basically every chapter has been him either improving tolerances for his absurdly overpowered artifact ring, or coming up with new lateral uses for his abilities that gives him a far more flexible amount of power. His level hasn't moved, but it's not like his character is just sitting around doing nothing.
