  Furthermore, those powers are all useless narratively. Anyone strong enough to hurt him through his armor is strong enough to drain his mana pool and kill him while he is out of mana.

I think this isn't true. An Aura that doesn't risk Mage Burn would be a real powerup.

Defensive auras could protect rain from things his armour doesn't cover like mental effects. And they can protect others too, I'm sure you could have a plot like escorting some glass cannon builds or even some unawakened through an area that is innately deadly (boiling hot, poisonous misima, etc) where an aura is highly suitable.

  His mana pool grows enough that due to intrinsic Focus and increased tolerance to stat boosts that it becomes much, much harder to instantly drain his mana pool and hurt him.

Skills to bypass defensive auras exist. We saw Lavarro use one when she was angry about Rain and co destroying the dungeon. Rain's build would be great at providing basic protection to everyone around him (that stacks with their own skills). We haven't seen anything to suggest it will provide him with advanced protection against things like pierce skills; and if it did it's likely that self-only defences will have better anti-pierce and single target attacks will have the penetration to match.

  Even if he never ever got above level 27, it would only be a matter of time before his Focus reaches Platinum-tier levels.

Wasn't there something saying your maximum tolerance is relative to your level?
