Hahahaha what a great theory! Him getting sent somewhere else is actually a fantastic idea: it wouldn't be hard to explain teleporting the whole dome into dangerous territory. The ancient shield's secondary function is to transport itself to "safety", and once it absorbs enough mana, now that the Empire aren't draining it, this suddenly activates. Have it start another drain and alert everyone, have Rain rush to shut it off but fail/mess it up at the last minute and you're good to go! Send it into the wilderness, into a dungeon for the title screen, or on the outskirts of the Empire somewhere!

It gives Rain new challenges, and lets the story keep most of what it's built up like all the characters in the city. It also encourages city development by Rain/Velika for future story beats.
