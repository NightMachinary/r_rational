Man, I kind of feel bad for the author here. They are backed up against the wall by the math of their own system, and their attempt to get around it (cleverly, in my opinion) is obviously not satisfying a lot of the readers.

Rain is at the most interesting part of his power curve. Strong enough to affect things, but not all things and it takes effort. Knowledgeable enough to see exploits, but not yet able to break things. The next "step" in the power curve will fundamentally break everything though, and I don't really see a way around it without major setting-changing consequences. Rain has to stay here, at roughly level 18, until he has satisfactorily resolved some stuff, because once he reaches the next tier of power, resolving that stuff will be trivial and thus boring.

I've been messing around with the Delve calculator/spreadsheet. The next 7ish levels are more or less dictated by his build. If he wants to get the Legendary class, which he does, he needs to take some defensive auras and some offensive auras, and he doesn't really have too much choice there. Furthermore, those powers are all useless narratively. Anyone strong enough to hurt him through his armor is strong enough to drain his mana pool and kill him while he is out of mana. Anyone who isn't able to full drain his mana pool probably couldn't punch through his armor anyway. Similarly, the other offensive auras don't really do much that immolate/refrigerate don't do already. The next 6 levels are going to be boring.

Level 25, on the other hand, is an enormous power spike. His max mana regen goes up by roughly x100, based on a reasonable estimate of what the Legendary Dynamo gives. His mana pool grows enough that due to intrinsic Focus and increased tolerance to stat boosts that it becomes much, much harder to instantly drain his mana pool and hurt him. That in turn makes most fights into battles of attrition, which he wins by dint of being a Dynamo. His max range also goes up x5, making the volume of the sphere he could affect go up by ~x100.

Level 27 is even worse. If he picks the ability to take multiple auras (Prismatic Intent) and the ability to boost his own focus (Empire of Will), that's basically game over. While in Aura Focus mode, Empire of Will together with Winter boosts his regen more than it drains, so he can slowly but surely strengthen his soul and boost his tolerance to Focus. Even if he never ever got above level 27, it would only be a matter of time before his Focus reaches Platinum-tier levels. Seriously, look at the spreadsheet. He could have hundreds of thousands of Focus with those two skills, if doing so didn't melt his brain. He could then do millions of damage with any aura, killing anyone. Sure, it would take time to strengthen his soul, but he could do so Xianxia style. Go find a little cave, sit inside and meditate for a decade, and then walk out and disintegrate a mountain. That would be... boring. It wouldn't feel earned.

That's the problem here. If Rain gets any stronger, either it doesn't matter (levels 19-24), it makes him probably too strong for any of his current problems (level 25), or it makes him a demigod who can only be beaten within a time limit of a few years (level 27). The author is doing his best to keep the story moving while problems of this tier still matter, and give Rain some development while doing so, but everyone wants a power boost...

A lot of people seem to be suggesting that he figure out some way to level up without Blue monsters, but then everything breaks. If he levels up by strengthening his soul by some amount, it is difficult to imagine how he wouldn't just keep doing that and become a god. Similarly, if he levels up by turning slimes into Blues, he also rapidly becomes a god.

I dunno. I just feel bad for the author.
