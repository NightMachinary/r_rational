Why would he have gone down? It's not like he is actually good against strong monsters alone, so he can't really level up. Unless they do only physical damage and he can beat their regeneration by stabbing them enough, which would take a lot of time... how long can he use the def aura at 100%? Aren't the big monsters in the dungeons anyway, not down? This is not MoL.

I don't think he needs to "progress" in levels. At all. Not all stories like this have to be about getting more levels. The system doesn't have to be the purpose. Maybe he will be the one who negotiates peace between the empires? Maybe he finds a way home and loses his power? Maybe he tries his best and dies? Maybe he will learn to use the artifact that makes the shield, learn some new shit that way, and go to space?
