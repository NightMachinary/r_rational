I would say they didn't know "exactly who he was". They would have had rumours, maybe eyewitness accounts, but that's not the same as knowing what he can actually do.

For example one of the citizens specifically thought his illusions were just bending light and he could see through them with mana sight. That was factually wrong. So it's not a case of them having no precautions. It's a case of them being overconfident and their precautions falling far short of what they need.

So one guy vs three cocky and underprepared opponents. That's a fight I could see going Lightbreaker's way; even if he wasn't explicitly supernaturally more powerful than any of the three.
