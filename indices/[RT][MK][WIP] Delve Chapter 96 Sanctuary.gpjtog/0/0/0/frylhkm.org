Lightbreaker winning that fight makes sense to me. They may have known about his illusions but they still overestimated their ability to see through them and fell for the trap.

The rest of your complaints I agree with. The way I would have done it would be to have added a big climactic fight between Lavarro and Westbridge. Then say end of book one.

That would make the cave section feel less out of place. The cave section should be shorter too.
