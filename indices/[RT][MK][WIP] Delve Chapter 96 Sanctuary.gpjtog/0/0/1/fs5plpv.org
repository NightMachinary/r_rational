This seems like a super fair assessment.

Everything is being thrown up in the air all the time but nothing is coming together yet.

You talked about the political aspect but this also happens with his powers.

We see all these things and we get all these questions, but so little of it actually matters to the story (so what if he gets a little bit more synchrony with strength or whatever?)

I like "numbers go up" but they have to matter for the story!
