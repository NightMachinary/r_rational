Your implied criticism aside, no, this story does not do much for me. I could read Joon and Amaryllis talking all day in WtC, but I mostly cringe when Rain speaks in Delve.

And if you'd read the rest of the comments here you'd know that the complaint isn't about what number the level has - stat ring synchronization stuff was clearly added to allow an increase in numbers while allowing everything else to be stalled out. The interesting stuff is the exploration of builds, skills, synergies, and new content. For months now Delve has offered very little new content of any kind whatsoever. Its main strength is that it is very easy reading, but after a while when the hooks have all shriveled up and disappeared, that stops being enough to keep going. If you haven't yet, subscribe to the patreon and read the next 10 chapters and see.
