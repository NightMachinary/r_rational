You're being a bit heavy handed with the yud bloggosphere references, but i liked the story so far despite that.

Pacing was spot on, good writting (as far as i can tell but not native speaker), and i love that you don't make the whole story about "escaping the box", that's been done allready enough... I also like it when non-main-caractere still choose reason over emotion.

Please don't abandon this, i'll read it.

Also, not very important but curious: why " fimfiction" instead of more well known website?
