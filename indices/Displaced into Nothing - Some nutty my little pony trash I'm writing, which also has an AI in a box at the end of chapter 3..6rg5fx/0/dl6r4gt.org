Would it be too much to ask for you to also put this on fanfiction.net? It would lower the barrier of entry enough for me to start reading it, since I can check for updates to it alongside every other story I'm reading on fanfiction.net at the moment in the press of a single button.

Fimfic doesn't have an [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spicymango.fanfictionreader][Android app]], so reading on their website is like switching from silk to burlap, comparatively speaking.
