[[/twioohshiny][]] I've read all five chapters and I've really enjoyed it. Right off the bat: kinda tickled by the EY name drop.

The characterization is very slightly AU, of particular note: Spike. But I feel you're treating him a bit better than in the show, and it feels like his emotional age has been upped a bit from Canon, even with the main emotions displayed being fear/worry.

That kinda tangents into my next point, but I'm not sure how to formalize it from feeling, so I'll hit it in a roundabout sort of way. In the show Twilight is showcased as being extremely intelligent^{[1]} by being extremely loquacious in a manner occasionally unintelligible by observers (e.g., S1E1: "Precipice"/"Threshold"/"Brink" of disaster). You have stepped up the vocabulary level of both shown show-characters (and even managed Celestia's tone decently in her letter). Spike and Twilight's bumps are reasonable, and Spike's has been explained (reading more hard sci-fi). This pulls at the question of others knowledge(-> reactions) when they encounter Meta.

[[/lunacomehere][]] Ooh, also, now I'm wondering about the one ("One", capitalized?) who sent her Out and if they have any contact with anyone/anything local to Equestria. Inb4 Nightmare Moon cultists. :p

If you want editing help re: spelling/grammar, I can point out a few things. Regarding tags on Fanfiction.net, I'm not sure how their editor works, and while leaving the tags in helps with understanding intent, it's not quite the same as the actual effect desired and will probably take some finagling.
