Elizer Yudkowsky, while I've had some public disagreements with him, HAS been a major influence in my understanding of philosophy and rationality, meaning I can reference him, and I find it perfectly believable that others would too. This is just as much as other people, like Plato, Crowley, LaVey, and Nietzsche: I referenced all of them because I can see them all as being just as relevent to Meta as they were to me. I didn't reference the work of W. Edwards Demming, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Keynes, Hayek & Mises, John Rawls, John Nash, or several other of my influencers and contemporaries in the Occult and Economics communities because they weren't relevant to Meta, despite the fact that their work had a profound effect on my life.

I'm glad you're liking the way I wrote Spike and Twilight: it's hard to tow this line between writing them in character and writing them smart enough to be major characters in a rationalfic. You are correct that this is slightly AU, though not enough for the tag: I keep forgetting to mention things like Spike being 14 because he WOULD be 14 in the show, and it hasn't come up that they don't have access to the Mirror portal because I didn't want to deal with that in the story. I'm going to give my own explanation at some point as to why we could have a show based on this real place, and why the actual place is different from the show. Fun stuff, Chapter 6 has a scene in which [[#s][tag]] Other than that though, Spike is a pretty reasonable character normally, and is usually the one to ground Twilight, and I'm trying to write him that way.

Her Displacer shows up and gives a vague explanation of why this is happening by Chapter 8. This is where Meta reveals that she's something of a LaVeyan Satanist / Atheist, which leads to some really cool dialogue. I'll tell you that [[#s][tag]]

I need to go back and fix the formatting on FF.net, but I'm primarily using FiMFiction, and am focusing on getting Chapter 5 out for now, so it's in the backlog.
