Thank you!

I don't mind formatting snags like the tags still being in there, I'm kinda desensitized to it by now.

Fimfic lets you download pdf/mobi of stories, but that's each story individually, and if you want to update it, you have to redownload each story. With an app like the one I linked upthread, you download every story's updates with the single press of a button.

(Also, for some reason [[http://i.imgur.com/wwJdFwt.png][Fimfic doesn't even record every chapter I read]], so their setup is unreliable as a bookmark.)
