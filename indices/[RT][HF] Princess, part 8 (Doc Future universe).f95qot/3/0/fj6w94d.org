It didn't start out that way. I used to think authors talking about how their short story involuntarily turned into a novella were exaggerating, but once it was clear to me how the chronology had to work, it worked best in a single story 8-). And I haven't forgotten about Maker's Ark, it's still percolating along in the background (it's mostly the "meanwhile on Earth" stuff causing the problem) and there are parts of Princess that are foreshadowing.
