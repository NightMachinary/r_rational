Okay my previous complaint of everything coming to a head is withdrawn; this isn't a sidestory it's a full background prequel.

I am still looking forward to (things I like in makers ark): flickers spear, and the war against the homewell things that think of humanity and demons as bugs nesting in a rotting everett branch, and more transhumanist lessons from /Learning is about to occur/ but I'm really enjoying this.
