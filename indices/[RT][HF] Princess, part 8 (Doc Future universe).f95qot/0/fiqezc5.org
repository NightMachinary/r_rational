Reading this one chapter at a time can be painful sometimes. This was a good one, but I want more. I'm waiting on reading the 3rd novel for the same reason. Don't want to start it then get drip fed.

Excited for speedtest. I wonder if there will ever be an opportunity for Speedtest 2.0 on a planet they don't mind truly destroying.
