No, just wanted to see if perhaps others would manage to come up with any unique solutions to a problem like this. I think there have to be at least some opportunities among the near-infinite available paths of action that would allow to beat the impossibly bad odds, if one managed to devise a proper “know-how” route. Which pretty much means munchkining, hence my question.
