A great story I read started with the MC spawning in the new world in the middle of being attacked, and getting his initial bonus for being the first person to make it down to 1hp and survive. Of course, he also happens to be in a slip-time thing that gives him months worth of grinding during everyone else's first few hours, because amateur writers love to make their MCs OP. Still, snowballing would really be the only way to really exploit a system like this.
