[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound][The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound]]. I stayed away from it for a while despite it being on a bunch of RRl's top lists because the name is just so... weird. That being said, it has one of the best starts to a real-world litRPG I've found. So much so, that I actually wish the author had just stuck with the 'stuck-in-a-dungeon' premise. It's fine he didn't cause the story just keeps getting better, but it would have been amazing.

There's actually a copycat story that uses the same premise, but has much worse writing and doesn't have the right pacing (not linking because I don't actually like it). I'm still kinda hoping that someone does the same premise but with the pacing/style of early Randidly mixed a bit with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18663/tallrock][Tallrock]]'s pacing/style (slow, steady, expansive world).
