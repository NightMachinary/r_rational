Which kind of RPG? Because the answer differs a lot depending on how seriously one needs to take death. Is it primarily just pain and suffering, and a visit to the spirit healer, or is it permadeath?

Because in the latter case, the "First" incentives are a really obvious trap, and the world is going to belong to the people who level really, really cautiously.

In the first case - Where death is painful, but not permanent, read up on cognitive behavior theraphy as it relates to ptsd, and still level extremely carefully, because in this case, ultimate power will acrue to whoever manages to stay sane the longest.

Other obvious areas of study; Anthropology, and the study of non-human minds. Because diplomacy, if possible, is a path to success too.

Animal handling? Very few rpg style worlds do not have at least an option for combat capable pets.

The art of snares and traps.

General priority is not to go for any achivements, except the "Undying" title. When you are actually present, violence has consequences.
