Just because one in a thousand might succeed at a stupid plan does not make the plan clever.

And even for that one in a thousand, the problem is, that if you initially succeed by taking stupid risks, you will fall into a pattern of taking stupid risks, and will be dead or insane by the end of the second year.

The priorities are:

1: Do not die.

2: Locate the resurrection magics, be cause these kind of worlds usually have them, and even if you manage to stick with 1, you are going to need them for your friends.

3: Find magics that are good for staying sane. Sub-point of this, protection from mind control. Just like the first magical item one should always acquire in DnD is an amulet of protection from evil, except a lot more urgent, because if mind control is possible.. and under almost all rpg rules, it is, it is going to be a bloody problem.
