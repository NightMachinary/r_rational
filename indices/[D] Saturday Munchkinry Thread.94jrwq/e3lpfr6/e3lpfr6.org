You know that:

- in a month from now your world is going to get RPG-ified
- people will get transported into a new dimension, without the ability to retain any clothes or items that were in their possession at the moment of transfer (everybody will be given standard equipment sets instead; people with implants will find themselves in more standard baseline human bodies)

  - they will be separated at first, then eventually be able to communicate with a random (growing) set of other people

- each time someone manages to be the first one to accomplish something significant (kill a monster, kill a boss, clear an area, do something unique, etc), they get a bonus as a reward (a title that gives passive buffs, a skill, an item, experience points, etc)

What plans do you come up with during this one month to accelerate your power accumulation once the new system kicks in? What calculations do you try to make (e.g to try predicting what approaches will likely be helpful for munchkining this yet-unknown RPG system), what risk factors do you try to keep in mind, etc?

Your goals is to attain the quickest power accumulation rates among humans.

Given the sheer number of people involved in this “experiment”, it is very unlikely that you'll be able to stay on the edge of highest level “players” unless you come up with some really effective and unique strategies.
