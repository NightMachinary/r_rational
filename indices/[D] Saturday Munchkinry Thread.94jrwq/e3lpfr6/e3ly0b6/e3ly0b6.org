I start looking up bug lists for major RPGs, and research how they were found, what caused them, how to trigger them, and how they were patched.

A month from now, I'm gonna make myself invincible by overflowing my HP integer into the negatives, walk through walls by bugging out the collision detection, and bury the land in a mile-deep layer of cheese wheels through item duplication.
