If people are randomly scattered around this new dimension, I would try to learn Mandarin Chinese and Hindi, because being able to communicate with the people near me would be invaluable in forming alliances, resolving things through diplomacy, and trade. I already know English, which is a pretty good advantage considering how widespread it is, but it's not universal.

For the actual combat bits, probably study military strategy and wilderness survival. It would be difficult to make any precise plans without more information, but being generally more proficient at strategy and being better able to survive without civilization would be useful.
