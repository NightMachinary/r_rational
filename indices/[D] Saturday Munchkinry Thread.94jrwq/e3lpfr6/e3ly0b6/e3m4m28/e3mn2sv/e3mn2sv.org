The nature of the setup means that you need to snowball in order to be successful. If you're the first to one to do something significant, then you now have a bonus that will help you get more of those first-past-the-posts bonus. That means that at the beginning, you want to be ready to go into immediate action. You have foreknowledge, so you can be mentally ready; most people, transported to a new rpg dimension will panic instead of going monster hunting. If you're immoral, trying to commit the first murder might be avenue to new titles and bonuses, which you can then use to snowball. Otherwise, just being the first monster killer, by sprinting right out of the gates and finding something small to strangle might give you enough of an initial boost to get rolling.

Another priority would be to make your skills, titles, and classes thematically unified. It seems like there are more potential unlocks for creating unified sets of skills, so staying on theme should help with that. One skill that would be important to try to discover/create is something related to learning, in order to try to increase xp gain/skill growth. Meditation and visualizing also seems like a useful route to new unlocks and potentially magic.

So, to summarize. Since everybody is getting a standard body and no prior tools, the most important thing to get ready for the beginning is your mindset. If you can move faster than most people in the initial minutes, you can start a snowball. You should try to pick up skills that go well together, like rapier and Dodge, or wind and fire magic. Complementary skills are more likely to have further unlocks, which helps with your snowball. And during the preparation month, you should practice meditating, martial arts, and get comfortable with a weapon. Staffs would be a good choice, due to the ease of making/finding one in a new world. It might not be enough to catch up to somebody already skilled in martial arts, but I think what would matter most is how you behave in the first minutes.
