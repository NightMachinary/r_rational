Prepare and memorise a number of short proofs for basic mathematics (Pythagoras etc.). On arrival in the new world, /instantly/ take a stick or something and (try to) be the first in the new world to write several proofs in the sand.

Hope that this starts a useful snowballing. (Improved mental stats are particularly useful because that allows you to improve your stat-gaining strategy).
