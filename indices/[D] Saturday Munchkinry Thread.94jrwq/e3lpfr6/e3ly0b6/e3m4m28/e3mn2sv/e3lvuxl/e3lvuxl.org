If the skills from your life are transported to this new world then learning swordsmanship, archery or fighting in general is pointless, since there will be thousands of people that have been doing it for years. The skill gap would be too large to become a top player.

The best bet would be to aim for skills not available in our life. Stuff like magic, healing etc. You could maybe prepare for this by learning some memorization techniques though obviously there's no guarantee this would be useful.

I imagine forming a group of like-minded people prior to the transition would be one of the priorities. A month is a long enough time that you could build trust and being with a group is safer plus you can accomplish more.
