I think this would've been the case if the pool of participants was relatively small. With 7+bln people, however, even if most of the players, who chose an extremely high- risk \ reward playstyle, died, some of them would still survive and reap immense benefits.

The CBT \ anti-PTSD training seems like a good idea in either case. Haven't thought in that direction. Maybe self-hypnosis would also be helpful?
