  each time someone manages to be the first one to accomplish something significant (kill a monster, kill a boss, clear an area, do something unique, etc), they get a bonus as a reward (a title that gives passive buffs, a skill, an item, experience points, etc)

This sounds a lot like you want us to kill everyone else in a month. Competing to be the first out of 7 billion is hard. Kill them all before the RPG-ification starts and it will become much easier to get these bonuses.

Otherwise there's really only mundane strategies that everyone else will also be using. E.g. learning how to use a sword, how to dodge attacks, how to build traps, how to resist pain, etc. They will help you stay alive, but aren't likely to make you the best among humans since everyone else will almost certainly be doing the same, and there's no way in hell you can catch up to Olympic athletes in a month.
