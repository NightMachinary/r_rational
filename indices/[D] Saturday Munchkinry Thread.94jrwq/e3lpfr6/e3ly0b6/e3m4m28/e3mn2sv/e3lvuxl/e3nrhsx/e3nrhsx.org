I'd research all existing RPGs, and try to form natural categories for them. I'd look into the underlying rules of various systems and memorize them, so that I'll be able to recognize these rules in the new world. My goal is to know how the game is likely to work already, instead of having to discover it from scratch while playing. For each category of world I'll design a response strategy.

In general, I'd look for feedback loops. For example, do lifesteal and damage reflect work with each other? Can I boost intelligence temporary with potions, allowing me to make better potions of intelligence? Assuming no truly broken feedback loop exists, I try to find the fastest response strategy for each type of world. What type of character steamrolls given the world's rules?

I would probably come up with a basic experimental paradigm to distinguish the types of worlds. For example, a quick tour of town to look for respawn points would be one of the first steps. Another example: I'd visit a shop and examine the wares to get a sense of progression. If nothing in the shop seems end-tier, there must be other towns to be discovered rather than the single home base, or other ways of unlocking new gear. The specifics of the experiments would depend on what my research into RPGs yields. As much as possible, I'd put in experiments that would reveal that the new world doesn't in fact hew to anything I had studied: I need to be aware when something in the new world doesn't match any of my expectations, as well.

Whether or not death is permanent is one of my primary concerns. I'd have to balance the risk of death with the desire to advance. If death is temporary I build into a glass cannon; raw power will give me many firsts and will feed into itself well. If death is permanent I build into a summoner or tank (unless I think some other class is a better strategy to live, obviously). I ask myself how much risk of death I'm willing to tolerate, for power.

I inform my intelligent friends of this impending doom. If the world has fast transit options, we can meet up and cooperate. If it does not, we will reconvene later and use more flexible strategies until then. We'll have different response plans for each case, of course. The problem of finding useful party members is not trivial and I'd prefer to party with a group that had a month to prepare with me. If that isn't an option I need to come up with a way to select good party members--hopefully my (recently-acquired) abundant knowledge of RPGs will lend me persuasive power in the new world.

In all cases, power is not obtained alone.
