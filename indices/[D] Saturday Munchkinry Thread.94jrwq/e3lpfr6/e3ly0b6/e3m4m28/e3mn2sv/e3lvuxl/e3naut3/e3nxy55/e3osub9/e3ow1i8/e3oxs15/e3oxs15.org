If the system actually enforces balance, you are screwed no matter what. - Specifically, spears being better follows from the mechanics of hand to hand, and the only way to override that is to limit you to a fixed move set, in which case any training you do in advance is pointless.

Spears have a fantastic defense: Reach. You can kill things that show up without a spear before they get close enough to touch you.

If you are in an archery contest, you should have brought a bow, not a shield, because without 40 buddies to make a testudo, you are just going to earn an arrow to the proverbial knee.

The historic record, and the reenactment nerds say the same thing: Swords are what you carry in peace to tell everyone you have the right to kill people that annoy you and dispatch (untrained, unarmored) bandits that jump you.

Carrying one into a battle you know you is coming is the equivalent of going off to fight Isis with a glock. Sure, it is a weapon. But.. uhm. Nope. Good way to die.

Also, you are quite likely to be fighting a lot of animal-level enemies. Again, swords are terrible for that.
