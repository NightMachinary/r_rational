... No Swords!

Firstly, Swords are for melee. Secondly, swords are not a weapon of war, they are a badge of Rank. Either social, or military - the fact that you are carrying a sword means you are entitled to wear a weapon, and also that you are important and protected enough that it is more important that the weapon is easy to carry around than actually any good for winning a fight.

Same social niche as a handgun has today, more or less. If you know you are going to be fighting for your life, you bring a /real/ weapon instead. Which means something ranged, or some variation on the spear. If everyone is geared up in plate, then a maul.

So. An intensive course in gun-smithing?
