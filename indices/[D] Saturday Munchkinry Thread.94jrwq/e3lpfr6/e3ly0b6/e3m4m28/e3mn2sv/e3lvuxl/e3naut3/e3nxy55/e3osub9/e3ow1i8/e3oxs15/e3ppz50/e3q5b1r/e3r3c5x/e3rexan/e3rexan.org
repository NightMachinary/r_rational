The spear is the queen of the battlefield. That changes once people figure out white plate or firearms manufacture - (And in a game world, absurdly durable armor seems inevitable) - but it wont get superseeded by the sword, ever, in any circumstances. Trying is like finding a battlefield use for the pistol as your main armament - that is just not what it is for.

..... Uhm. Have you ever practiced a weapon art? Making the rule of cool determine balance is very straight forward when you are talking pixels on a screen.

Doing the same thing when you are physically present requires the game to dig its hooks way deep into your skull and actively stopping you from doing the obvious thing. Or blatantly intervening to make the wounds from a spear less severe than they should be, while not debuffing swords.

Neither of which will "be cool" from the perspective of the people in the immersive world, so assuming some sanity in game design, wont happen.

Things that might happen is combat just being much less lethal than it should be across the board, and the classic "very rapid learning" thing. Which is also monstrously invasive of your mind, but most people will not reject that one.
