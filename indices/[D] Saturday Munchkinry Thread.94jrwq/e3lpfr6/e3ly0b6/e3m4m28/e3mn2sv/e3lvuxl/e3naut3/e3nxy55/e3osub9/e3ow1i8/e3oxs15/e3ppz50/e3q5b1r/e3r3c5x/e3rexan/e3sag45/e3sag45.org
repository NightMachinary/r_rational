  Doing the same thing when you are physically present requires the game to dig its hooks way deep into your skull and actively stopping you from doing the obvious thing. Or blatantly intervening to make the wounds from a spear less severe than they should be, while not debuffing swords.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. Level 1 Sword == Level 1 Spear == Level 1 Mace would not be some abstract game design concept, that would be abandoned as soon as humans got hold of them. It would be an immutable law of nature in this new reality, as rigid as physics was in the old.

You talk about "blatantly intervening", but that's nonsense. Do you say that gravity "blatantly intervenes" when objects fall downwards? Do you say thermodynamics "blatantly intervenes" when cold objects heat up to the ambient temperature of their surroundings? So why would you say that about a world where the rules were wildly different?

  Neither of which will "be cool" from the perspective of the people in the immersive world, so assuming some sanity in game design, wont happen.

Uh... going by OP's post, this new world isn't some hyper-immersive videogame. It's its own, self-contained reality, with its own internal rules and logic. It's not trying to be sanely designed. It's not trying to be anything. It just /is./

And insofar as the setting would be governed by rule of cool, well... it wouldn't be going by what its new human residents think is cool. Why would it? What RPG is designed around appealing to the /entire human race?/ No, it would be going by what people playing RPGs in the safety of their own homes think is cool. It would be a world built to appeal to armchair warriors.
