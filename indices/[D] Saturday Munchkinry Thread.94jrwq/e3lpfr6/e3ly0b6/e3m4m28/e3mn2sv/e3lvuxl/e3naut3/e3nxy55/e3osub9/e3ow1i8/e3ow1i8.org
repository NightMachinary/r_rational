  the technical term for a swordsman going up against an archer or spearman is "Corpse"

I've never seen an RPG in which swords and spears were that radically out of balance. It usually comes down to swords doing Hack or Slash damage, and spears doing Pierce or Stab damage, with the damage types being better against one type of armour/enemy than another, and range being all but ignored.

That, and swords are usually one-handed, while spears are usually two-handed. So you can fight with a sword and a shield, but not a spear and a shield, making swords the safe option (especially against archers) while spears are the aggressive damage-dealer option (with no safety net).

Swords are popular, so most people want swords to be viable in casual play, so the devs make efforts to ensure that swords are viable in casual play. It's an approach intended to attract modern-day fans of Fantasy iconography, not hardcore re-enactment types.
