  If the system actually enforces balance, you are screwed no matter what.

What? How do you figure that?

If the system enforces balance, then a Level 1 Sword and a Level 1 Spear will do similar, if not identical damage. If spears are allowed extra range as an advantage, then they will likely do less damage per hit to compensate. Likewise guns, crossbows and normal bows will all have tradeoffs to keep them all viable to use depending on context.

If that sounds bizarre and arbitrary, well, /welcome to RPGs./
