Yah it depends on how sensitive the results are to your choices after seeing the bit(s). For a single bit you'd ideally find a roulette table-like system whose result has been determined beforehand and hidden, so that your success or failure is purely decided and deterministic -- this prevents your actions upon seeing the bit from affecting the outcome (e.g. if you bet red upon seeing red maybe the spin is affected or scrambled enough to fall on black, and if you bet black it falls on red. If the oracle sees both these occurring it'll just give you a random bit and call it a night). But most roulette systems probably aren't so sensitive, and so that lower bounds you to table maximums ($10k? $500k? the internet doesn't seem to have a firm answer). You might be able to get more value out of playing the stock market, again depending on the size of your investment and how much money you have left over after buying the bit to wager (and if your investment would affect the future trajectory of the stock). I'm not sure what the best opportunities for that sort of thing are; hence my question.

You can also use it to obtains answers to "big" questions that might otherwise affect how you live your life, e.g. regarding your continuity of experience after death, or something. Or if you fancy yourself capable of doing great things, asking about futures where you didn't see the bit but dedicated yourself wholly to achieving some goal, and the proportion of those futures (e.g. > 0.5?) where your attempts succeeded.

In this hypothetical the decision to buy or not is being asked of you now, so pooling humanity's funds would be limited by your ability to convince others quickly, absent any evidence (only you are magically convinced). Still, I think if you're confident an AI likely to satisfy your values can be instantiated with, say, a billion bits, it's interesting to ask how many years of extratemporal labor you would be willing to trade for it (defining a marginal cost curve would be difficult, but seeing your average-maximum-payment-per-bit would be neat, esp. in comparison to how much you'd pay for smaller numbers of individual bits)?
