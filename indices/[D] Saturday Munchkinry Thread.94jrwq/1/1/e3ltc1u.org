Well, the question is, how much $ could you get for one True bit? If you could use true bits to win lotteries, then you would naturally be willing to pay almost as much for the true bits as the lotteries winnings they would give you.

If there's no limit to how many bits you can buy (other than cost), it's probably best to pool together all of humanity's funds to get the bits for an FAI.
