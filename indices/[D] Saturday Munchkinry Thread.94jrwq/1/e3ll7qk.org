Similar questions have been asked here before, but those discussions are old and I want to ask it in a slightly different form:

How much $ would you pay for one, Trueâ„¢ bit? If an omniscient oracular device agreed to give you a completely true answer to any single answerable binary question, what's the highest amount of money you'd be willing to pay it for that answer? You ask the question and then some short (<1s), arbitrary amount of time later it answers. Assume you are completely convinced of its authenticity, but can't transfer that conviction to anybody else except through normal persuasive means. Questions that have no true answer (say, ones involving prediction of the future, and then you do the opposite of what it says, or whose answer otherwise affects the future in a manner that results in the answer being untrue) are instead drawn from a discrete uniform distribution over {0,1}. Ambiguities in question-wording are resolved by mind-reading your intentions and finding the closest well-specified question.

You can pay money in three alternative manners: via 1) using already liquid funds, or through liquidating existing possessions, 2) using money borrowed through conventional means from a conventional, though unusually trusting loan officer, 3) using money borrowed from a supernatural loan agency that upon agreement teleports you to an extradimensional, extratemporal space, where your current bodily condition is maintained and you perform uninspiring hard labor full time at a rate of $100/day, and cannot otherwise use this opportunity to engage in meaningful work. You retain memory of your time here, but those memories are really boring. Your psychological health remains unchanged throughout your stay, so you are not driven insane by loneliness or other factors.

How much money would you pay through the above methods for each marginal bit, assuming you can negotiate deal an arbitrary number of times? How many bits would you buy, and at what maximum total cost?

How would your answer change if you could delay acquisition of bits indefinitely? Say, for a single bit -- you receive a magic coin that can be flipped while focusing on your question, and subtle forces interact to alter its trajectory such that it lands on the predefined "true" side, before becoming a completely mundane coin. The coin is transferable, but again, nobody but you is convinced of its power. The forces applied max-out after a single Joule has been used, so no creating perpetual motion devices that keep the coin forever spinning in an attempt to answer a known question, or whatever.
