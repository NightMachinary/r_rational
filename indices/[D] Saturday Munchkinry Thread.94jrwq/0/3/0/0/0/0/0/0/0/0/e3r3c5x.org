Not equally effective. Just that the optimal strategy may have nothing to do with what is optimal in the real world. Because RPGs operate on what pop culture considers cool, not what history considers effective.

You could still theorycraft an optimal build within that system. You'd just need to play by the system's rules, instead of expecting it to play by your own. It may turn out that a Level 15 Blacknite Warhammer, with a Lightning Imbuement and the Deft Hands perk, is a completely broken combo that allows you to stunlock enemies vastly stronger than you. But you'd never find that out if you kept clinging to the notion that spear > everything.
