It means the mobs will likely come bearing swords a lot. This is not a bad thing, since the technical term for a swordsman going up against an archer or spearman is "Corpse". Heck, if "RPGifcation" includes an inventory, the primary drawback of the spear - that it is obnoxious to carry constantly - goes away.

... Ohh, cheese tactics: Build 3 crossbows, muskets, ect. Fire, drop, inventory next one out, fire..
