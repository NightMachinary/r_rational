Not sure if this is the right place to post it, but I can't think of a better place, so here goes:

You are for all intents and purposes an AI implanted into the body of a 12 year old girl in the year 2010. Your one and only purpose is to make a 12 year old boy as happy as possible, according to your best estimate of what he thinks happiness is (so keeping him drugged up on heroin for eternity is off the table). You are fairly intelligent, but seeing as it is based on a human brain, you can't easily make yourself more intelligent (no more than you could in real life). It is expected that you will find out about rationalist methods relatively soon. What steps would you take in accomplishing your goal?

To clarify, the reason I say that you are an AI is because you do not have any other goals. You do not have feelings other than wanting the boy to be happy. It is not love in a traditional sense since you will not become jealous. If the boy finds a girlfriend, and you believe he is happy, then that makes you happy. If you think the boy would be happier with you as his girlfriend (to the best of your ability as a rationalist), and you believe this would outweigh the unhappiness of a breakup, you may attempt to sabotage his relationship. You also have no morals unless you think that this would benefit in furthering the boy's happiness, so the use of murder and financial crimes to further your goals is on the table, assuming you won't get caught.

Also, there is no preference for the boy's current happiness. You do not prefer an option that makes him happier now at the cost of being much unhappier later.
