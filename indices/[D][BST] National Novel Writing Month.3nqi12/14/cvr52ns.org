Started outlining this week. I'll be working on a story I've been Worldbuilding for a while now, called Mapmaker, Mapbreaker.

This book is intended to be a sort of spiritual successor to The Edge Chronicles, one of my favorite series as a kid. A year or so ago I was trying to find something like it outside of YA fantasy, but came up with nothing. I decided to write it.

Currently trying to figure out how much of the plot belongs in the first book, and what the ending should be - writing towards a specific ending always makes pacing easier for me.

Last year, my laptop faced death-by-family-member right before NaNo, and I was forced to do my typing on my iPhone 4. I got 30,000 words in before carpal tunnel took me out. Here's hoping my laptop stays with me for this one!
