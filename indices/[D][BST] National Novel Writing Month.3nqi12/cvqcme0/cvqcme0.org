Personally, I'm writing the second half of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/, which was fully plotted out last year and just needs an additional 50K words in order to be near completion (though 50K only got me a quarter of the way through my outline, so maybe this is just going to be an epic that will take me four NaNos to complete). I've been rereading what was there before, making some small changes as I go and marking down what I see as the promises that the story is making, along with the seeds that need to sprout in later chapters. When I get some free time for it (when I finish the final chapter and appendices of /Shadows of the Limelight/) I'll go back and revise the original 40 chapter outline, which is now woefully out of date.
