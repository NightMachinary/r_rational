I'm probably not writing anything for NaNoWriMo specifically, but I might try to use the month to encourage myself to write a little bit more regularly than usual. Typically, I only find the time to write about one day a week (due to having a day job), but I'd like to try to write more often if I can find a good method of doing so.
