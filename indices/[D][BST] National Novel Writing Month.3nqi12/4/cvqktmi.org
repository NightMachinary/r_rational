I tried two years ago and flunked out a few days in, but I decided yesterday that I'll try again this year. I'm trying the [[http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/][snowflake]] method for outlining this time - last time I went in with nothing but a vague idea, and gave up when I noticed that I had no middle for my story, and no idea for one.

If anyone wants to add me on the NaNoWriMo website, I'm [[http://nanowrimo.org/participants/tayacan][here]].
