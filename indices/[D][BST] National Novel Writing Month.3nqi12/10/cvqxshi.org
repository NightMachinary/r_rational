I already finished what I think will be the first draft to my novel. It needs a ton of work though, so I might use the month to try and hash out some of that. I'm really not sure how far along I am though or how much editing is going to be needed. I'm anticipating a major rewrite. What I really need is a good co-author to bounce stuff back and forth off of, but those seem to be hard to come by.
