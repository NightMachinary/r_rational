I have no idea if I'm going to or not, though I have a few things on the back-burner I'd like to have written by 2010.

I ran into a ton of literary difficulties with what I tried last year, and I still don't know how to resolve them. I basically wanted to take the general setting and premises of an awful Marysutopia science fiction story I wrote in 2003, but make it halfway rational. I had to restructure the plot almost completely, but what I wound up with loses most of what made the original fun--there isn't so much room for exploration of... anything, really, unless I want to drown out characters and elements that I think of as pretty important. [[#s][Summary?]]

But maybe I should try something different? The past weekend resulted in two new ideas: one would be a /With this Ring/-style take on Dragonball (just thinking about all the avenues an unpowered S.I. could explore without breaking the general tone of the setting is fun, but I'm not sure I can write something good with it), and the other was a deliberately nonsensical story about Gingerbread People that suffered a severe case of Cearbus Syndrome (although that one makes so much more sense as a Youtube animation, attempts at deconstructing Magic Baking aside).

(Another appealing option is some sort of Wuxia story set circa Y2K, in what amounts to "the real world, but with more fireballs and robots". I have an explanation for the magic/SF elements, but the story isn't about them, so I don't expect it to be full blown Rationalist. [[#s][Summary]])

I currently find it more likely that, if I try anything, it'll probably be the Dragonball SI, but then I have to go read all those random bits of useful worldbuilding Toriyama released in the past 3 years (at the exact time that I stopped paying attention. I ... was not expecting Battle of Gods to be a prelude to resurrecting the series, so just tried to wait for the discussion to calm down. Oops.) I have no idea how to make it work without dropping the SI somewhere convenient by default, but I like how /With this Ring/ avoided that. DB doesn't have anything quite like a power ring I could use to get the SI moving and motivated, and I'm thinking about following WTR's example and keeping the metaphysical distinctions between our worlds as a serious limitation for the SI (so he would start out super squishy even by Dragonworld Civilian standards). I dunno, it sounds like fun, but if I try to take it seriously, I'm not sure how well it'd work.
