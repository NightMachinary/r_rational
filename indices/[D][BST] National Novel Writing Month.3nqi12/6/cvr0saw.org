I'm in.

It will be an erom novel because they sell and they're easy to write. I've already [[http://nanowrimo.org/participants/dstorrs/novels/autumn-s-acceptance][entered it]] on NaNoWriMo.org, although there's nothing there yet except the working title.

My plan is:

1. Finish writing the first draft of /Induction/ by 9am PST November 1.
2. Spend November writing /Autumn's Acceptance/ while editing Induction.
3. Publish /Induction/ no later than 9am PST December 1.
4. Publish /Autumn's Acceptance/ no later than 9am PST January 1.

So, basically, two NaNoWriMos in a row. This is a test -- I think this is doable, albeit challenging. If I'm right then I intend to keep doing it, publishing a novel every month until I become either self-sufficient or broke, whichever comes first. If I'm wrong then I'll keep publishing but will just have to give myself longer runways.
