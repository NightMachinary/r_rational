I should really learn to plan. I currently have:

- Man finds himself thrown into a forest outside his village to be tortured by fae.
- Woman appears, whose tattoo on her arm is an unholy symbol.
- Lots of politics.
- It's actually the future and posthumans invade from space to rescue their lost comrade (the woman).
- This was actually all a gambit to overthrow Earth's really backwards government. The rest of the Solar System are /fine/.
