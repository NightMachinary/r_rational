I really do recommend Harmon's story circle method. He makes the claim that stories follow that pattern through all cultures for a /reason/ which is that our brains are wired to think in terms of story and even if you were raised without ever hearing a story in your life you would gravitate towards that. So:

1. We start with our protagonist. We figure out why he's being thrown into the forest, but ideally it tells us who he is. If this is a redemption story, he's being thrown there for adultery, in order to show his sins. If he's being thrown there for unorthodox views, it shows us he's a contrarian. Maybe he's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe he tried to do a good deed and it spectacularly backfired.
2. This guy has a need. Need one, not being immediately killed by the fae, but that's obvious enough. Need two, that's what his first thought is when he realizes that he's not going to be tortured (to death? I guess you didn't say) by the fae. Likely options include revenge against the people who threw him into the forest, trying to remake society, trying to help this mysterious woman, or trying to get rich.
3. They cross a threshold together. This is where you finally get to the central plot; it's where there's whatever is on the movie poster. This is the point where the terminator starts chasing Sarah Connor, which occupies us for most of our plot. For you, that's politics. So we need a bridge between our main character's NEED (point #2) and the plot. They get involved in politics of some kind; okay, why? The man is using the woman as leverage for power? The man is trying to change the world? The woman has some plan of her own that she's dragging the man into? At any rate, this is where they go from "not being in politics" to "being in politics".
4. There's a road of trials. This is where your hero gets stripped down and made into something more. Since you want politics as a focus, this probably happens through politics. Our hero has to learn politics. If it's a redemption story, this is where we see the first signs of redemption. If he's a contrarian, this is where he either sharpens the tool of contrarianism or where he learns to go along.
5. Something is found. This is probably where your twist goes. If your hero has some fatal flaw, this is where he realizes what's wrong and what needs to be done. Your big difficulty is in bridging the gap between politics and a posthuman future; if the twist is "this isn't fantasy, it's science fiction" then I guess my thought is that you make the hero a proto-scientist and have his investigations lead him toward this understanding independently. You want good, logical connections between plot points; you /cannot/ have transhumans come from space to change everything with no regard to the plot as it has been, because that's terrible story-telling.
6. They meet their maker. This is where the hero gets the shit kicked out of him. It's the low point of the story. If the transhumans come and take the woman away, maybe that leaves the protagonist politically weak and hopeless. Maybe it's a /literal/ shit-kicking. This is where the break-up happens in a love story. It's where everything is suddenly hanging on by a thread.
7. We bring it home. The hero's been put through the wringer, but now he's /through/ the wringer and has to make it to the boss fight. Sometimes this involves travel, other times it's just about coming out the other side of the crisis. Here's a great place for your protagonist to get in a position to actually challenge the posthumans that have been manipulating him, however he might do that. Or it's where he rallies his political allies toward some action. Or it might even be where the woman lends her aid, since this is traditionally a spot occupied by the cavalry.
8. Change. Here's the absolute climax of the story. You can put a boss fight there, which, if you're sticking with politics, is probably a political manipulation of the posthumans rather than anything material. If it's a redemption story, this is where the hero shows that he's truly redeemed. If this is a love story, it's where they show they're truly in love. If it's a tragedy, it's where the character is truly ruined. You probably have some climax, this is where it goes. Ideally, you fire off every gun remaining in Chekov's Armory.

Hope that helps to flesh some things out. You might want to save the twist for the very, very end, making each point in there more about whatever vague "politics" is going on, but then for the final twist of a transhuman setting you need to repeatedly harp on things like systems of power, consent of the governed, etc. etc. in order for that to be properly foreshadowed and appropriate to the ending.
