My plan as well. :D

My goal is to write a rational-ish story about a time traveler's academy set inside the ten days skipped in Catholic Europe's switch from the Julian to Gregorian calendars (loosely inspired by Faction Paradox's 11-Day Empire). It's a logistical nightmare because the schooling lasts six months but they only have 8 days to work in, so there are about 24 copies of every one person inside the school at a single time. Because loose-restrictions time travel, yo.

Anyway, it'll be about how the universe is surprisingly resilient to containing paradoxes but the administrators are trying to cover that up, and there'll be hints of a giant catastrophic War happening at some point on the metatime horizon ... no idea where to go from there, really, but I'm sure I'll think of something interesting.

Either that, or I'll be working in my 17th-century AI-vs-Illuminati Lovecraftian thriller. I suppose I have a while to decide ...
