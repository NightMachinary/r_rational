For anyone interested in story structure, I highly recommend a book by Robert McKee, and "Save the Cat" by Blake Snyder. These are books about writing screenplays, but they are amazing, and very useful to any writer. Robert McKee structure and explanation makes much more sense to me than Campbell's.

As for myself, whenever I'm trying to start working on a big project, I get stuck with a horrible writer's block, so for now I'll just keep practicing writing short flash-fiction stories, and hopefully eventually one of them develops into something longer and more interesting.
