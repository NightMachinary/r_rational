Some other resources that have worked well or been interesting for me:

- [[http://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/w-plot.html][The W Plot]] A clear and easy-to-do story structure that is easy to identify in many novels and much easier to work with than the following two options, although it provides less support.
- [[https://www.keepwriting.com/tsc/magnificent7plotpoints.htm][The Magnificent 7 Plot Points]] More detailed than the W Plot, less annoying than the monomyth. Easy to expand a W plot into a M7PP, so they work well together.
- [[http://orias.berkeley.edu/hero/journeystages.pdf][Joseph Campbell's Monomyth]] (PDF, because the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth][version on Wikipedia]] is too wordy.)
- The [[http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/][snowflake method]] I suggest not doing this exactly as described -- work on the various bits in whatever order appeals, intersperse writing with planning, and don't let the structure get in the way. The pieces are useful, though.
- [Writing Excuses]([[http://www.writingexcuses.com/][www.writingexcuses.com/]]) A good podcast by good authors; each episode explains one element of writing (narrative voice, worldbuilding, characters, etc). "15 minutes long, because you're in a hurry and we're not that smart!" [The second part is a lie.]
- A useful character design trick I took from Writing Excuses is to rate your character in terms of three attributes: Competent, Proactive, Sympathetic. I use a 5 point scale (1 is low and 5 is high) and give it as a 3-digit CPS number. Hinata is 451 (medium-high Competent, high Sympathetic, very low Proactive). Frodo is 113. Luke Skywalker is 333 in ESB and 453 in RotJ. [NB: If you disagree with my numbers, that's fine as long as you get the idea.]

[Edit: Added new things that I thought of after the fact.]
