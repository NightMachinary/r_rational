Two dark wizards steal a baby from an orphanage, intending to sacrifice him on an altar of onyx. They find that they can't go through with it and end up raising him as their son instead. Some years later, he sets off from home in order to find his birth parents. He bumps into the princess of Donkerk, who has run away from home in order to find a solution to the prophecy of doom that's been hanging over her head since the moment she was born.

That's the central premise anyway. There's a bunch of other stuff as well: witches, battle nuns, the machinations of the royal mentalist, an oathkeeper struggling with the vows he's taken, the spirits of the land being called to their queen, etc.
