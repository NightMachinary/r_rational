I'm not promising anything yet, but I think I'll be posting as I go, because part of the appeal of NaNoWriMo is sharing what you've written with others and the mild 'fear' of disappointing the people on this subreddit with nothing written will motivate me more.

I plan on just posting everything to a Google Docs with a separate one for spoilers and planning out future chapters/plot points. However, I'll only post to this subreddit as I reach the milestones of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 thousand. If I'm lucky enough to write anything after that, I'll only post it again once the story is completed.

I really hope I can get a full 50,000 words this year.
