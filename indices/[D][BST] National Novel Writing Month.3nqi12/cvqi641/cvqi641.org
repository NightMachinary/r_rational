I'm writing some Scooby-Doo fanfiction inspired by [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39986f/q_can_a_dumb_protagonist_exist_in_a_rational_work/cs1m9c3][idea]].

I also had a brief but very thought-provoking brain-storming thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3n8fep/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvlu6fy][here]].

The story will be just making good use of Fred, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo with Daphne as the main character and rationalist (hopefully). I don't plan on using anything other than the characters and maybe a few Scooby-Doo cliches and catch-phrases (Jinkies!). I plan on focusing on solving one mystery which is about a crime which was committed by a normal person, but the setting has a strong supernatural background (maybe something like Supernatural's weekly monsters but better working relationships between the monster species and no direct interference by Heaven or Hell) which the gang has good knowledge about. It's to show how one can still solve a regular mystery with magic as a viable alternate explanation. I would love if anyone can give examples of other stories that do the same thing.

I plan on portraying the monsters as sociopathic towards humans (not necessarily sadistic). This means they only care about what the humans can do for them and they don't really care if the humans live or die. However they do understand that humans can be dangerous in their own way. No 'All humans are killing the Earth!' or 'All humans are weaklings!' here. So the monsters are intended to be rational actors as well.

So far I have a good amount of world building done. I'm working on thinking about how the personalities of everyone should act like as well as whether or not any psychological disorders should be demonstrated (the gang has gone up against some terrifying creatures, yo!). I'm also planning some flashback chapters on how the gang originally first met up over an actual supernatural mystery. The only thing left I really need to decide on is just what to do for the actual mystery itself.
