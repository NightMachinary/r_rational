I wouldn't say that retconning doesn't follow any rules, but those rules are much more abstract than typical stable time loops. I'd say "isn't particularly rational, even if it's not irrational either" is a good summary of my view as well, but I think the deconstructive and meta-narrative nature of Homestuck's 'pseudo-canon' or whatever we're calling everything after Act 7 makes for some interesting rational-adjacent discussion.

Maybe Homestuck^2 shouldn't get linked for every update like an ongoing rationalist work, but I'd love to see occasional discussion threads about particularly interesting and relevant moments. Heck, I've been thinking of something comparing how genre savviness works in Homestuck to how it works in PGtE, both being works where at least some characters have explicit knowledge of the narrative nature of their reality and who attempt to exploit this knowledge for their own goals.
