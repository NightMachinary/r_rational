I would even argue that in several cases, "things happening for plot reasons" WAS "characters making rational decisions which serve their interests" when it was the author, as a character, nudging things in person to bridge gaps.

Conversely, there really weren't any plot holes that were truly ignored, only parts of the story that the villain deliberately destroyed because a) he had that power and b) using it allowed him to achieve his goals. If we don't get to see the part that could make certain developments really make sense, at least it's an intentional cop-out EVEN IN-UNIVERSE, rather than a mere fluke.

It meets the spirit, if not the letter of rational criteria, since the author's effort and attention shows through the gaps, rather than a lack thereof
