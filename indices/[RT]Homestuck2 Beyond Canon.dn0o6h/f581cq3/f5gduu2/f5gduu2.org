Despite the sub being nominally for rational fiction independent of genre, in practice it seems pretty common for people to post works with themes that people who like ratfic tend to also like. Time travel, AI, multiple universes, multiple timelines, metafiction, exploiting the rules of a setting to "break" things, apotheosis...I don't know if it's rational, but thematically Homestuck is crack for at least a subset of rational fiction enthusiasts. And I don't want to spoil it, but the premise of the epilogues and sequel may be even more so.
