I feel like it's similar to Unsong, because the world it takes place in is very irrational. Things literally happen because they need to for plot reasons. Time travel exists with fairly strict rules, but retconning exists and breaks all those rules and doesn't appear to follow any of its own.

Also, a lot of the foreshadowing seems like it's retroactive, ie it literally didn't mean anything at the time but then did later, which kinda goes against the idea of the “fair play whodunnit”. Can't think of any examples though.

Might just be simpler than that and it's just that Homestuck isn't particularly rational, even if it's not irrational either.
