So I read chapter 1 when you posted it, and was instantly interested. I love YuGiOh and I really liked the anime, especially as it continued into later seasons.

But then I noticed that, after chapter 1, you didn't really post anything. I know you said the posting itself was a sort of test, and you weren't committing to anything, so i wasn't surprised, per se, but still disappointed.

That said, I'm happy to see a chapter 2, about to read it right now, and feel free to PM me if you want some detailed commentary about this story. D-D-D-Duel!
