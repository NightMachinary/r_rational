For people just visiting for the first time: this is going to be the James Bond / Yugioh crossover fanfiction of all time.

#+begin_quote
  Knowledge of Yugioh is appreciated but not required. If you've seen the first episode that's plenty. If you've seen Yugioh Abridged that's way more than enough. You should probably watch at least the first episode of Yugioh Abridged if you haven't seen the first episode of the anime.

--------------

I only moved around a few minor things in chapter 1. Minor plot patch: Yugi's grandfather knows where the tomb is relative to a few other tombs which are all very secret and require a guide to get to. The entrances look mostly the same and there are a lot of them.

I moved a few details of Yugi and Yami's first conversation to their second.

A little self-criticism before anyone else starts:

- I don't like my descriptions. They sound a little awkward. I didn't want to get overly detailed with things that don't matter but I don't want to be too vague either.

- The second room is way too hard for the reader. I picked it because I initially thought it was impossible. It took me about an hour to come up with and convince myself of the solution. Yugi solved it faster than I did because he can see the room and I can't. Yami's intended solution was different (and much simpler), which is a large part of why he's impressed.

- Yugi doesn't sound enough like Yugi. I guess I'm hiding behind the fact that I'm making him slightly older in this version than he is in canon, partially so that I can make him smarter without it being unrealistic. I haven't canonized it yet but I'm thinking 16-18 instead of 14-15. I may go back and change his thinking patterns slightly to make him more like him and less like me but all the fundamental facts will stay the same so rereading won't be necessary unless I need to go back and fill a plot hole I missed.

- My internal alarm bells would be going off a lot more than Yugi's are if I only knew what he did but Yugi's a lot more trusting than I am so it should work out.

Let me know any plot hole or fan theories or whatever.

I hope you like reading it!

I intend to update once every two weeks. Secretly I'm going to try and write one a week and just post once every two weeks until I can convince myself I can keep up that pace then I'll switch to posting one a week. We'll see what really happens.
