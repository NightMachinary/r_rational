Really? I'll admit, that takes me by surprise.

Though it could be because of new readers coming in and reading all your chapters at once. Reading your story all in one go is like reading a completely different book, in a good way. Worldbuilding chapters do not make for good web-serial type releases.

Hell, I think I'll do a reread of your story once this arc finished. I get the feeling I'm gonna like it a lot. Keep up the good work.

P.S. I /love/ the interactions between the Fanny, Davo, Nic, and even Brill. That is by far the favorite part of my whole story, keep it up!
