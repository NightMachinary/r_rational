I can recommend this story to anyone who isn't weirded out by bioengineers with different morals for whom humans are just another kind of animal. The story really grows in depth as it does in length and has many themes that fit this subreddit.

The worldbuilding is of excellent quality, really capturing the atmosphere of an alien culture and society.
