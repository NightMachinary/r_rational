  he sounds in this story like the jinchuuriki thing has been going on for a long, long time.

Yes. In canon the conversation went something like this:

Ten-Tails: Grr! I rampage!

Sage: You mustn't!

Ten-Tail: But I will!

Sage: I split you into nine parts! And then I walk away!

Tailed beast 1-9: ...? Really? Uh...okay, thanks! Grrr, we rampage!

I figure it makes hella more sense if he split them up and then sealed them away. In Team Anko-verse they've been passed down for a thousand years from one jinchuriki to the next; sometimes they get out for one reason or another and do their rampage-y thing, but mostly they stay sealed.

(In retrospect, I really should have been spelling it 'jinchuuriki', since I've been using 'uu' to represent 'u with macron'. It was an early-on mistake and I'm not going back through 14 chapters and then re-uploading all of them through FFN's irritating interface just to fix that little not-terribly-important bug.)
