Similar question as earfluff; is Kurama as benevolent as he seems? Normally, I have no problem with a benevolent Kurama. But yours seems a little too eager to please. And even disregarding that, since this is a Rationalist story, and the Kyuubi is an ancient entity, I'd assume he'd be much more....superior, I suppose, from a mental standpoint.

So is this guy an honest good guy or a manipulator? Or should I just wait and keep reading to find out? :P
