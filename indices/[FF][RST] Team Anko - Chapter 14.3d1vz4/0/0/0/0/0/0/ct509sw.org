  Will this be mentioned in the story eventually, I wonder?
#+end_quote

Probably, although I don't have any immediate plans for it.

What in particular are you thinking of? (Not saying I disagree, I just want to see if I've missed anything.)

  Could an S-Rank ninja beat a free Bijuu in this world?

Depends on your definition of 'beat'. Straight power output? Nope. Defeat? Yes, given the right criteria for "defeat."

This isn't quite what you were asking about, but if you look you'll notice that Anko beat Naruto+Kurama in this chapter.
