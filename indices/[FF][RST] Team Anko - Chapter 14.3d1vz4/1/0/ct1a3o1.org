Japanese "demons" of this sort are often two natured. Protective and destructive, nurturing and savage, a little good and a little evil. Given that this is rational fic, I'd say Kurama isn't definitionally "evil." I'd also say he's been locked up more than the less than a hundred years implied by canon having Naruto only be the /third/ container for the nine-tails. But he sounds in this story like the jinchuuriki thing has been going on for a long, long time.

Also, this is an AI Box situation. This is what you should expect from such an entity. Threats got him some of what he wanted, then he switched strategies. I don't think Kurama has actually failed any of his gambits since establishing contact. In fact, it isn't clear he's really as hurt as he appears. Personal illusions are a kitsune's specialty, after all.
