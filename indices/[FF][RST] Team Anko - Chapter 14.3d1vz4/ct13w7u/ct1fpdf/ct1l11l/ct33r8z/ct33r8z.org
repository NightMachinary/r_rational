This one I'll give you as a freebie: Tobi never hypnotized him. The idea that a human could forcibly control the mind of a primordial demon is utter bullshit. Lay a genjutsu on his human host which deceives the bijuu because he is limited to Naruto's senses as interpreted by his brain? Absolutely. Put it directly on an ancient being made of pure chakra who only has physical form when it remembers to and has senses aside from the human? Hell no. You can't create an illusion of something you can't sense yourself -- see Sachi's issues with chakra systems. (Well, technically it IS possible, but it requires some work to set up.)
