One possibility is that Oro is watching Anko through the cursed seal somehow, and that's how he is always able to surprise her. If so, they'll have to start making plans which don't involve Anko. Using Anko as a means to feed Oro false information would also become possible.

I don't understand why Anko would think that Oro will fall for her acting. Shouldn't he already know lots about her personality? Is she running another gambit underneath this? Or perhaps she has a very dark past and really was like this once?
