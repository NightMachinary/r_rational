that might be very helpful, not entirely certain. It might be helpful when Harry tries to figure out why some muggle tech doesn't function right at Hogwarts. and it might be useful for a lot more than that in this story. not entirely sure. I don't know much about engineering, but I'm guessing the type of engineering might be important too.
