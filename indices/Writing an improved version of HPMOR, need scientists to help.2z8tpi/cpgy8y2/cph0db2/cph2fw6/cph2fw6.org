I've always rationalized that the reason magic has such a hard time with tech is that magic causes constant warps in local space, on the molecular level.

A lightbulb is no longer airtight, a circuit no longer complete, and a piston cold fuses to the walls of its engine.

Small things that are relevant to the workings of delicate and complex electronics, but not clockwork, and certainly not overly redundant biological processes (We have healing factors AND pain receptors)
