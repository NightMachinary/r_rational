World building's pretty broad and we do get some comments on the Wednesday threads, but there aren't that many top level comments. For example, there was only 6 top level comments in the most recent thread.

Why not fold the world building and your suggestion into one thread, Wednesday Writing Thread: where anyone can ask any question relating to writing in general or their story specifically?
