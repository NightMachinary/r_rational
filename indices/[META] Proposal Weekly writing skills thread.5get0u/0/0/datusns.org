As I understand the recommended procedure: I should try posting a Weekly Writing Skills thread myself (or find someone willing to do it), for at least two months, after which the mods may decide to automate it, merge it with another Weekly thread, or make other changes. I'm willing to give this a shot.

1. Which day of the week? I'll propose Sunday, as being opposite Wednesday World-building, it'll spread the writing-advice threads as widely as possible.
2. I'm willing to do the posting; but as a FYI, I have non-24-hour sleep/wake phase disorder (as has since been popularized in HPMOR, though I lack a time-turner), so if anyone else is willing to volunteer, I would take that as a kindness.
3. I can throw together some flufftext to describe the thread when it's posted. Anyone want to suggest anything in particular that should be included?

If nobody replies to this - then I'll just do the thing myself, next Sunday, and see what happens. :)
