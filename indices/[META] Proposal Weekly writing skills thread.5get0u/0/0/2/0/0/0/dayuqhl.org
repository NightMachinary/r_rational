I'm sorry that I missed my promised Wednesday deadline, but here's a slightly-late first draft for consideration:

[D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow [[/r/ratfic]] fans...

- Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tropes]]?
- How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?
- Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosidy, and other English-lit topics?
- Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?
- Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.
