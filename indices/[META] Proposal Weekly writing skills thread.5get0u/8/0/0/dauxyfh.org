Well as long as we're riding the slippery slope, I'd much rather go in the other direction and have all communication in this sub go through separate threads. So my comment would be its own self post, your comment would be its own post and so would this reply.

Since this method of communication is obviously superior and allows for maximum information sorting, I don't see why it shouldn't be taken to its eventual and obviously unavoidable conclusion.
