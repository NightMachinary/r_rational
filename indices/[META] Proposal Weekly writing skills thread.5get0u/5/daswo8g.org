I would love this, I am full of questions like the ones you mentioned and it's only going to get worse as I start writing in earnest in January. I would love somewhere to put them and I think an extra thread would be excellent and really encourage people to post.

I know I posted similar sort of questions on a I think friday offtopic thread recently, because that seemed like the best place to put it at the time.

I also think they're questions I might be able to contribute answers to (my own perceived lack of expertise notwithstanding), whereas munchkinry and worldbuilding are not ones I feel I can contribute answers to as much as my brain doesn't work that way.

So I feel when I post questions and get answers on say a Worldbuilding thread, I've got nowhere I can really help in return!
