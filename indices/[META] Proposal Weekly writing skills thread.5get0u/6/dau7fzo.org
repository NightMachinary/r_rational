What about this would be relevant to rational fiction in particular? There are a ton of good resources for general writing, but I'm unclear why you want to do it here.

I'm also unclear that there's a need -- general writing advice can be had many places, and specific things like choosing a better title could be handled either in a "weekly off topic" thread, or in the discussion of one of your chapters, or in the "not rational fiction" thread that you're allowed to post after releasing a chapter.

I don't really mind if it happens, but it seems unrelated to the topic of the sub. What am I missing?
