In a rational fiction subreddit, I see Worldbuilding and Writing Skills as kind of complementary: the worldbuilding is the "rational" part, and the writing is the "fiction" part. Plus, I recently put an excerpt of one of my stories on a Friday thread and got a great comment giving me feedback about how the way the character was acting didn't seem rational/realistic (and I've fixed it).

Probably I'd get the same sort of advice from a writing skills subreddit, but I feel like I'm part of the community here (even if I'm not a prolific poster), so I would feel comfortable approaching this subreddit for advice because although I'm not a top contributor, I do contribute, whereas posting into a writing tips subreddit would make me feel like I was taking advantage of peoples' time and efforts and not planning on giving anything in return.
