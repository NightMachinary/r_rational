  general writing advice
#+end_quote

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs; a budding science-fiction authour sometimes needs advice on how to make an alien's speech sound more alien in a particular way, or how to figure out which sorts of background details enhance the theme they're trying to build. A horror writer might ask for tips on how to build tension when the glowing eyes are staring through the mist.

As for rational and rationalist fiction - well, just take a look at the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][trope list]], and consider how many ways there might be to actually implement any of them that any given authour might not know, or the possibilities that might allow a rational story to be turned into a rational/ist/ one.

Maybe I'm overestimating how many other people would find value in such a thread; but I think it's worth at least trying, and finding out.
