  Do you like footnotes in your prose fiction?

As a rule, no. I find they break absorption. For me, the best stories get me into that flow-state that truly engaging reading can bring on, where I lose conscious awareness of the fact that I am reading a book. The experience of encountering a little number, having to look down to the bottom of the page and find the footnote, then find my place again in the main text, only serves to make it impossible to forget that I am reading.

If notes are really necessary, I agree with some other posters that What If/Wait But Why--style notes in an online text are probably preferable to footnotes as usually implemented on paper. At least there's no difficulty with finding one's place again upon finishing the note.
