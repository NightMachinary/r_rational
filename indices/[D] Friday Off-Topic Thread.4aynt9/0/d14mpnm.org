I'm a big fan of footnotes in fiction, mostly because I love parentheticals. Discworld does it for humor, House of Leaves does it to carry on parallel stories, and Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell uses them mostly for bits of world-building with the occasional short story hidden there.

For the current thing I'm writing, I wanted to frame it as a heavily translated work with footnotes from the translator that give some world-building and/or levity. But unfortunately, Scrivener doesn't allow for proper footnotes (at least in the Windows version), which kind of sinks that plan unless I want to do my writing in a Mac VM /or/ I want to use endnotes instead (alternately, I could hack my way around it, but I don't want to increase my workflow, since writing is mostly something that I do for personal pleasure).

Do you like footnotes in your prose fiction? Or do you just find them distracting and skip over them?
