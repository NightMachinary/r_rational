I do like them a lot. Grew up on a steady diet of Prattchet and translated scifi, where puns were often explained in footnotes. Also a great fan of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_13%C2%BD_Lives_of_Captain_Bluebear]] by Walter Moers. It has great humurous footnotes.

By all means, feel free to carry on this great literary tradition in your awesome writing.
