  With the power of Switch, you can trade bodies with any person within about fifty feet. They do not need to agree to the trade. You may live indefinitely by switching to younger, healthier bodies.

Well, most obvious usage if this Power is to steal someone's life. I'd go close to someone wealthy, take some fast acting poison, Switch, then likely act as I have amnesia. After some time, find someone young and healthy, write off all 'my' current wealth onto him/her, take the poison, Switch... Then repeat last step every few decades.

There aren't much more uses of this power. If you don't kill your previous body, then there is very high chance you will be exposed & executed.

  With the power of Doorman, you may summon, telekinetically move, and fix in place either of a pair of portals a bit larger than your body; the portals are also automatically fixed in place if you get further than fifty feet from them. Functionally similar to the portal gun, but the portals are fixed in place relative to their current gravity well, rather than fixed to a surface. Your pair of portals vanishes with your death.

Could be used for time travel, likely.

  With the power of Network, you may copy yourself and function as a hivemind of the resulting separate bodies. You must put one of your bodies into a hibernation state for a day to copy it; it is vulnerable during this period. Injuries and other damage are transferred over, so try to keep some healthy bodies to copy from. Your multitasking ability scales with your number of bodies, to cope.

Well, with that your mental power can rise exponentially... but there could be small problem with feeding your millions of bodies.
