  There aren't much more uses of this power. If you don't kill your previous body, then there is very high chance you will be exposed & executed.

There's a pretty big use. Rather than just moving yourself you can move other people to. Swap with person 1 then swap with person 2 and then swap with person 1 again. Your now back in your original body and two other people have switched bodies.
