Every day, someone, somewhere gets one of these thirteen /fabulous powers!/

- With the power of Switch, you can trade bodies with any person within about fifty feet. They do not need to agree to the trade. You may live indefinitely by switching to younger, healthier bodies.
- With the power of Assassin, you can kill people instantaneously and unpreventably from anywhere in the world. The only limitations are that you must have encountered the victim in person at some point since acquiring the power, ie, familiarity over the internet or television is insufficient, and there's a cooldown of one day, ie, you can't kill someone within twenty four hours of killing someone else. Death by Assassin power is conspicuous; victims melt like Nazis opening the Ark of the Covenant.
- With the power of Doorman, you may summon, telekinetically move, and fix in place either of a pair of portals a bit larger than your body; the portals are also automatically fixed in place if you get further than fifty feet from them. Functionally similar to the portal gun, but the portals are fixed in place relative to their current gravity well, rather than fixed to a surface. Your pair of portals vanishes with your death.
- With the power of Entropy, your body is replaced with a floating black sphere a foot in diameter. You have no mass and disintegrate any matter that enters your volume into component molecules, spread over your surface area. You retain the senses of sight and hearing, though they too are spread evenly over your surface area, giving you a basically panoramic view of everything. You may move in any direction up to about sixty miles per hour relative to your current gravity well; this is your only way of influencing the world. You bounce off of other people with the power of Entropy. Your power is the only one that may be removed with the power of Switch - barring this, you are immortal.
- With the power of Messenger, you may subjectively freeze time to psychically communicate with a target (within about fifty feet). This line of communication is involuntary in the sense that they may not terminate it themselves, but is voluntary in the sense that they have complete control over their response. You receive one second of Messenger time for every second spent in real time.
- With the power of Hindsight, you may see and hear things from your current position relative to your gravity well at any point in the past. Solve crimes, spy on acquaintances, or just watch dinosaurs; it's up to you.
- With the power of Network, you may copy yourself and function as a hivemind of the resulting separate bodies. You must put one of your bodies into a hibernation state for a day to copy it; it is vulnerable during this period. Injuries and other damage are transferred over, so try to keep some healthy bodies to copy from. Your multitasking ability scales with your number of bodies, to cope.
- With the power of Convincing, anything you say (or sign) will be believed or obeyed by anyone who understands it. This ability takes precedence over any previously held beliefs, and beliefs and directives induced by the power of Convincing may only be removed by further use of the power of Convincing. The power of Convincing only works in person, that is, it doesn't extend to recordings, letters, or phonecalls. People with the power of Convincing are immune to the power of Convincing.
- With the power of Fluid, you can teleport anywhere by turning your body into the fluid you're submerged in (ie, air, normally), sending your mind through the fluid at the speed of sound, and remanifesting your body out of the fluid. You may theoretically stay in your mid-teleported form indefinitely, and are immortal this way, but you may only perceive the world this way (and then only through the senses of sound and touch); to influence the world you must remanifest your physical body. You may be kept out, or in, with a proper airtight seal.
- With the power of Timeframe, you may speed yourself up or slow yourself down, relative to everything else. This causes proportional effects to your mass, for example, if you're moving three times faster than normal, you will be thrice as heavy, and if you're moving a third as fast as normal, you will be a third as heavy. You get one second of extra time for every second of real time, so you may stably spend your entire life moving twice as fast - or you may save up your extra time for bursts of extreme speed and mass.
- With the power of Ping, you may telepathically ask targets (within about fifty feet) questions. You will receive an honest answer to the question, to the best of the target's knowledge. The target will be unaware of the question or answer, so you may use it to collect information on the target without their being aware that anything has happened.
- With the power of Knot, you may reset the universe to the moment of your empowerment, erasing everything that's happened since, except from your own memory. Someone with the power of Knot may only be killed by surprise or by suicide, as they may dispel any threat by resetting. Unfortunately, the butterfly effect is truly strong, so the further they get from the moment of empowerment, the weaker their power is at making predictions. Remembering undiscovered secrets and uninvented technologies is likely to pay off, though.
- With the power of Grab-Bag, you receive two powers. Theoretically, you may receive more than two, up to all twelve, but this is very unlikely.

Powers that target people within fifty feet have an implicit secondary power of being able to detect people within fifty feet.

I'm not going to ask you to pick one; some of them are clearly better than others. Selection of power isn't voluntary, anyway, they're just dropped on people. How would you respond to getting each power? How's the world likely to turn out? (It depends a lot on the personalities of the first few Knots, I think.)

I've been binging Worm, can you tell?
