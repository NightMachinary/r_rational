I've got a GearVR. As an avid PC gamer I dearly wish I could get one of the high-end headsets, but I just don't have the money for that right now.

It's good enough (and portable enough) to show off to the normies, but there isn't much content for it at the moment. The most useful feature is the ability to watch movies while lying down.

I expect things will get better though, because Samsung is heavily pushing it alongside the launch of the Galaxy S7.
