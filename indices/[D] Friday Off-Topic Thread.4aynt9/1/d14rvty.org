Hey, everyone! I've recently deployed the first version of my startup, [[http://lumiverse.io/][lumiverse]], it is a platform for publishing and discovering educational videos. I think you will find it interesting.

One of the people who added their videos is Julia Galef, she makes a really great [[http://lumiverse.io/user/JuliaGalef][rationalist vlog]]. If you haven't seen it - watch her video on Bayesian thinking, it's very cool(you can also find her videos on [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz-RZblnhjXK_krP1jDybeQ][youtube]]).

Also, I would really love some feedback about the website, if you can tell me what you think about it - that would be awesome.
