I like KonoSuba, it's probably one of the better comedy animes I've seen. All of those ideas sound good, but I think that whatever idea you go with you should keep the comedy even if it's more serious than the anime. That's what got people into the fandom and what they'll look for when they read fic of it. Not that you need to have a similar style to canon, but it can help make your story more popular.
