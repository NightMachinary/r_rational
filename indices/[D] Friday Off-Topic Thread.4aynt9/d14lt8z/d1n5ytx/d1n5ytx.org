Ok so I had planned to give my answers to this earlier but somehow forgot. I do think in terms of optimization no-one has really had a near perfect build that's not heavily skewed towards altruism. Before giving my optimal (selfish) build, however I will go over why I think particular choices are good or bad:

Spell Books: Can be used for immortality, however it's just not as good as youth which doesn't have any drawbacks and can even do limited shapeshifting.

Storm Seer: Some aspects are pretty useless (comparatively) like property values and natural disasters for the area of the storm, but the personal storms might be useful however in absence of knowledge about how much info you get, I'm going to say it doesn't make sense to take the risk.

Giga Sword: Well first off laser guns and holograms aren't likely to make the world that much better, robotics advances would probably mean some cool stuff (but it says robotics not AI) but nothing /amazing/. However antigravity could potentially be amazing, however since that's the only really amazing effect I'm going to say this choice isn't worth it.

Fantasy mirror: Come on, how useful is the ability to disguise yourself anyway?

Apocalypse: First off it only guarantees you will just barely live to see a utopia so it's clearly altruistically bent. More importantly however you are killing off probably the majority of humanity to ensure a utopia in 100 years, however for it to be worth it you have to assume that human civilization was already going to go to shit anyways, otherwise the things specified (post scarcity, post conflict and no pollution) would probably end up happening in less than a century anyway (without as many deaths presumably).

Stave Death: First off as pointed out by others inner flame doesn't guarantee you won't /ever/ feel regret and thus get killed, however asylum can totally work though. This may keep you from dying (only really better than youth if you end up in lots of dangerous situations), but it doesn't halt aging or fix diseases, so you will likely end up practically crippled yourself and won't be stave off death from old age on your loved one's forever.

Youth: I'm not sure why this wasn't looked at more, it grants eternal youth and can even allow limited shapeshifting. Since this doesn't need second power to be effective I would rate this higher than stave death.

Inner Fire: How useful this is kind of depends on how lazy you are starting out, for me however this should rank pretty high. Being able to get nearly everyone ideologically aligned with yourself super motivated is really, really useful for getting your political goals achieved. You can also use this to basically take out any competition by taking their motivation.

Troll: Since you can't form any sort of online identity using this to get power would be difficult, however using it to get rich is easy. This can function fairly well as mind control, however for it to work you need to get in contact with the victim using an anonymous account, so there's a lot of difficulty using this on people who don't already frequent online forums.

Christmas Cane: In addition to the obvious uses, I think one great way of using this is actually for /evil/. Effectively drug someone defined as "evil" with the candy and they become temporarily good, that's stated. However knowing that if they don't get more of the candy they go back to being evil, you can basically get them to do anything you want that isn't super obviously evil, in order to keep receiving the candy. However except for the blackmail aspect this is overall way worse than yin and yang.

Yin and Yang: Holy shit this is powerful. Someone else said that in practice it might get nerfed, but even just using the abilities that are brought up as examples you can do a lot, and I can think of a few more that are pretty similar to the examples already given. Ok first off by inverting love and hate you can easily get followers who are fanatically loyal. Using this to invert good/evil would also be a great way to get followers. Here are some axis that would probably work: living/dead, dumb/smart (use on people who are vegetative or severely handicapped, to get genius's for your cause), and lazy/motivated (which could be used to render inner fire redundant). There are other potential applications but even staying within what's already used as an example, and what seems pretty similar to that, this is by far most powerful and versatile choice. There fair chance that this power could switch somebody on the young/old axis which would make the youth power redundant, however I'm not betting on that.

The wish I saved for last is Hierarchy (though upon further reflection I think yin/yang is somewhat better): Effectively hierarchy lets you make the social values of the entire 'flippin world whatever you want, how did people miss that? You have to do it all in one sitting but it doesn't elaborate so you can probably get away with sleeping partway through as long as you keep the (chart? idk how this works) in front of you the whole time. Using this power to create a utopia would be trivially easy. It doesn't say you have to have the one sitting, be right when you choose the wish so you might wait a while. Alternatively you don't have to make your wishes on the spot (presumably), so you could spend months figuring this out, don't worry.

So if I had to pick 3 as it says in the link I would pick Yin and Yang, Youth, and Hierarchy Frankly I think that's the best choice that can be made with three wishes. However the post said 5 so I will talk about those last 2.

Ok so it's actually kind of hard to come up with 2 more given how good the 3 initial picks were. Yin-Yang and Hierarchy just make so many other wishes redundant. Ok so doomsday clock seems pretty useful, it means I don't have to worry about a lot of kinds of disasters and unfriendly AI in the future, depending on how the clocks works I might be able to use them to predict whether certain courses of action will likely hasten personal or global doomsday. Celestial scaffold is hard to use, and it is kind of hard to know what you can do with it. However it is probably fair to assume they understand earth languages (otherwise i'm not sure you could do anything useful with this) as a result you can probably get them to follow instructions that you put in morse code and are probably going to figure it out if you use it to send binary.

I'm fairly sure this represents the best 5 wishes overall, if you are particularly ruthless you might swap out hierarchy for torture. The reason for this is that I assumed the wisher would have a basic level of decency, and would care at least a little about society becoming vastly better (even if only out of self interest), however if they don't then they could use torture to to easily abduct people and make them hate you such that using yin/yang you can turn that into love/fanatical loyalty.
