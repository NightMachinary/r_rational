Rather than Inner Fire, Asylum is probably the only guaranteed way of negating the downside of Stave Death, and also the one with fewest side effects:

- Asylum can just remove the part of you that could regret life, and there you go.
- With Inner Fire, you can power through stray suicidal thoughts, but I'm not sure you can avoid having them.
- Tagged could also do the job, but you'd have to keep refreshing the effect every few minutes.
