I don't have perfect suggestions, but:

- a mind mapping tool can help you organise and associate various concepts ([[https://www.yworks.com/products/yed][yEd]] is a both well-made and free option).
- a [[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki][personal wiki]] can help organise your knowledge (especially if it is technical, cheat-sheet friendly stuff). If you end up choosing a server-based option, be sure to learn how backuping and maintenance works lest you suddenly lose all your data after significant amount of time spent building your knowledge base.
- [[http://alternativeto.net/software/manictime/][a PC time manager]] can help you figure out how much time are you spending on useless crap without realising it.
- a [[http://alternativeto.net/software/anki/][card-learning tool]] can help studying things like words, formul√¶, and the like.

  - for languages there's also [[http://lwt.sourceforge.net/][Learning with Texts]] --- you upload chunks of text (articles, books, etc) to the program and start crossing out words that you already know. Helps keep track of what you've learned and which yet-unfamiliar words are wroth learning because you keep meeting them. Negative side is that it keeping the database update can be time-consuming.

- and things like [[http://alternativeto.net/software/zotero/][Zotero]] can organise research sources, scientific articles, books, etc.
