  By the way: a post on [[/r/DnD]] the other day reminded me of something I'd read once, and on Googling "worldbuilding elves sharp teeth" I realised it was by you. [[/r/DnD]] liked it.

Oh, neat. Always glad to see people liked something I wrote. That one was old enough that I had to reread it. For being one of the first things I put online, I quite enjoyed it.
