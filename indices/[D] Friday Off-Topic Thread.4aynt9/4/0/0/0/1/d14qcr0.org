Eh, I got into rap fairly heavily a couple months ago and Kanye's music is the best in the genre. By a wide margin imo. Rappers reputed for having more technical skill (like the later Eminem, or the now-hot Lamar) are so focused on rhymes and conceits that they're often incoherent, or on speed that they slur, while West's lines have a kind of classical--Dionysian yeah, but classical--elegance. And sonically his music is on a different level. I wish there were more musical development, but I don't think he's ever been exposed to classical stuff. And given that his view is limited to pop and rap, I don't blame him for feeling on top.

I don't know enough about the guy to say more than that.

The medium, though. If this were my book or my album, I'd be glad for more power over the audience, but worry that if every project's still open to be added to my life might turn into nothing but maintenance and tinkering with stuff from the past. As a consumer, as in this case, I'd feel mad when an experience I like gets taken away, but on the other hand you're already seeing a proliferation of remixes of Wolves and all the other songs on Pablo; that's the age we're in. In that way and others, removing a protected, static "garden" of art you like and replacing it with a constant stream of changes you might disagree with might motivate you to actively create things, to be imperial with your taste rather than adjusting it to whatever other people release. A nag in me says there's still value in the preservation and pedestalisation of immortal artifacts but I don't know if that's a reliquary urge; maybe art's now cheap enough to produce that it can become ephemeral.

I think the best solution is just to release multiple versions separately, which is feasible with software in a way it isn't with print. There's no reason you couldn't release 5 or more versions of a single artwork, all with like 30% difference in content. I believe this was what was done with this song on iTunes, though not on Tidal where they're artist-empowering, audience-subjugating egomaniacs.
