The most important aspect to figure out, as it seems to me, is how the Knots behave, in the sense without an accurate assessment of their behavior we cannot make any extrapolation of how the rest of the world will be structured. For instance, if a Convincer compels a Knot to constantly reset, this can freeze the universe for thousands of years or more of subjective time, until some kills them by chance between resets, and this thing is likely to make collateral damage of some sort.
