Barring extreme divergences, two weeks is probably too short to interfere with the seeded random function that assigns powers to people, so Person 2 will probably become a Knot "again" in two weeks. But yes, of course person 2 is no longer a Knot; they haven't become a Knot. The only person who remembers the timeline that Person 1 reset away is Person 1.
