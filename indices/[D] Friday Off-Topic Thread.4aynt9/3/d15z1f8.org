Watched the fourth season of House of Cards. It is much better than the third season, which is good. Still doesn't seem as realistic as the first two seasons, but it was very enjoyable. And now to wait for the fifth season, which I can only assume will take place over the course of three weeks, since that's how long is left until the general election when this season ended.
