Apocalypse, Stave Death, Inner Fire, Flooded Market, Skelly Samaritans.

- Apocalypse because a Utopia is worth it, even if it takes 100 years.

- Stave Death for immortality and the relatively small utility of preventing death around you.

- Inner Fire to make Stave Death permanent by negating its downside, and also help other people with their willpower.

- Flooded Market for "Mundane" things that are actually extremely useful outside of combat, like endless decanters of water or other sources of free energy.

- Skelly Samaritans for the help they give. It's not really necessary with Apocalypse, but it's still nice.

Alternatively, I might choose Kemomimi City and Guardian Deity for the last two.
