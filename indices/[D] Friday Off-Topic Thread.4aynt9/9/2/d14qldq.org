I don't understand the appeal of spreadsheet CYOA. (This isn't meant as an attack; I am genuinely confused.) What am I supposed to do with them? Is it supposed to be an entirely solitary experience? On the 4chan and relevant subreddit threads I've seen, it's usually just someone posting a CYOA and everyone quietly upvoting (or picking out typos or the like), with little actual discussion.
