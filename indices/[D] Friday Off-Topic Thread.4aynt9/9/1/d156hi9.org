/Many/ of the options are worded in such a way that while they /seem/ potentially exploitable (Hammer Space, Yin&Yang, Troll, etc), I'd expect the DM to severely cripple them during an actual game.

For instance Giga Sword, Magical Gathering, Flooded Market, Adventure, Celestial Scaffold, Wizard's Closet /could/ yield scientific or magical breakthroughs, but they'd more likely either give non-replicable low-grade effects or none at all (e.g. if you'd wanted to smuggle magical artefacts from the Adventure reality). Same with immortality options: Stave Death may not work even with Inner Fire (you don't have to be in mood of doing something in order to will yourself do it), Eternity Gem may start deteriorating with time even if good maintenance and care were provided, etc. After these, I'd also cross out Christmas Cane (vague definition of “evil”, mind control, chance for an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Lying][/Invention of Lying/]] scenario) and Apocalypse (one man's utopia is another's dystopia).

So I think I'd go with [[http://i.imgur.com/NxQ5hao.png][these four]] as the default:

- /Inner Fire/ for character improvement and work productivity to me and allies;
- /Demon Dice/ for orchestrating binding contracts with parties who /seem/ to be interested in partnership, as an improvised truth detector, etc;
- /Storm Seer/ for multiscale precognition and as a disaster prevention tool;
- /Spellbooks/ for loli-pseudoimmortality --- if changing the body didn't also significantly alter the mind and personality.

The fifth one would likely be one of those:

- /Fantasy Mirror/ to “cosplay” characters of my own creation, making myself perfect disguises;
- /Nice Boat/ (if it works as a Safe Haven, though probably it wouldn't);
- /Troll/ as a powerful public opinion manipulation tool --- but, again, I'd expect it to be severely nerfed in actual gameplay.
