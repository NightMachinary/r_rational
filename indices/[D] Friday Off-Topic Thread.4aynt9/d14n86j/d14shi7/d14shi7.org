Neat! I think you've just re-invented [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_algorithm][k-means clustering]] from scratch, kudos!

(Edit: it's not quite the same because k-means doesn't require that all the clusters/districts be the exact same size, though they usually end up pretty close anyway. Not sure how that affects things.)
