I was thinking of a rational [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo][KonoSuba]] fanfic. For those that aren't aware of it, its a comedy that parodies common RPG tropes in a fantasy world.

I enjoyed it due to the main character Kazuma being given low stats on everything and a min-max party which he must manage to perform correctly. He does fail a lot in the anime and is kind of a jerk but uses unconventional strategies and pragmatism to beat the odds.

Now I was thinking about his flaws and besides selfishness he is also pretty lazy so I thought how about making that his main character flaw. In most rational stories I've read the protagonist is always willing to implement his strategies and work tirelessly until they're achieved.

While this is a really romantic prospect and gives a certain Renassaisance man vibe, in real life people are hardly that compromised. Even people that were considered "gifted" like Newton or highly compromised with efficiency such as Benjamin Franklin had days where they wouldn't be as effective as they wanted. Or their bodies just wouldn't be able to keep up (Newton reportedly had 3 mental breakdowns through his life, probably product of a lack of sleep).

Procastination, sick days and the like the adventurer overcoming or even failing to overcome those flaws, I think it would be an interesting aspect and show the more human aspect of rationalists. Has this been attempted before?

I think I'll have to brush on RPG know how to accomplish it as I'm not much of a gamer. Also I'm still deciding whether to take this on the parody angle or show a serious story about the lazy adventurer trying to optimize his party so he can do the most with the least effort.

Or maybe a story about Kazuma the merchant. If he discovers that providing technology to a medieval world and arranging peace between the "evil" armies and the gods are a more optimal solution, it could turn into a diplomat's story with plenty of politics. Not to mention that those villains don't look that evil in the anime so perhaps showing their softer side would work too.

Thoughts or suggestions on the matter?

EDIT: due to further thoughts.
