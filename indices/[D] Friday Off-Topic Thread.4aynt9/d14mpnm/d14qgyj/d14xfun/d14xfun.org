What I really prefer, at least on the web, are footnotes in the style of [[http://waitbutwhy.com][Wait But Why]] or [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/][XKCD What If]] where you click them and then they show the footnote in an unintrusive CSS/jQuery popup. But that's sort of a pain in the ass to do if I'm trying to /also/ wanting to keep my text agnostic to the format and compile to epub, mobi, PDF, and for the web.
