If an electronic book has /links/ to the endnotes (e.g., in some [[http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top][Project Gutenberg]] files, though I can't think of any specific examples), the reader will click on the link, then hit the "back" button on his HTML-/EPUB-reading program to return to the text, for a minimum of distraction. Definitely, though, if there are no links to the endnotes (e.g., in /[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898][Look to the West]]/), I typically won't bother to scroll down to the endnote and then back up to the text (let alone keep the book open in two separate windows--one for the text and one for the endnotes).
