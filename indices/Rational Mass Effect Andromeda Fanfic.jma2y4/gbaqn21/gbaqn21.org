i honestly find the idea of this incredibly amusing because..... if you apply any rationality at all to the setting there's only one choice the initiative could make.

with one piece of technology (the tech that allows the initiative ships to dump their accumulated charge mid jump) they've allowed for literally unlimited FTL and sublight travel and completely changed the face of the milky way galaxy.

warp capable defense stations are now common place, every initiative shareholder is wealthy enough to buy entire star systems, the reapers get curb-stomped brutally the moment they arrive on the scene, and the entire population of the milky way doesn't even need cryopods to travel out of system due to the ability to just.....fire ships out of mass relays at distant galaxies and have them arrive in years as opposed to the 600 years that the initiative took to arrive at their destination.
