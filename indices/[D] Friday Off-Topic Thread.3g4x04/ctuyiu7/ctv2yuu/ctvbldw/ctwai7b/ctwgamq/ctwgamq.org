It partially is, but how governments are structured determines whether that problem is reduced or increased. There is no perfect system, but some systems are better than others. Democracy is usually considered to be a better system than absolute monarchy, for example.

There are three problems that every government faces. The first is ensuring that communications between the various layers of government are accurate. Communication that is either intentionally false or incomplete causes problems. The second problem is ensuring that orders are followed. This includes both laws and regulations internal to the government and external to it. This is particularly important when one aspect of government acts against another aspect. The final problem is ensuring that the decisions made by the government actually benefit the people.

I do have ideas of how to fix these problems, but they are technological in nature. (And very far from a discussion about the problems with the CIA in history.)
