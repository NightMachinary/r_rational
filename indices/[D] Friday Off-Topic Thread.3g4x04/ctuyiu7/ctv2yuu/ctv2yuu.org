Practically inevitable incompetence. Statecraft is /hard/, especially on the scale the CIA has attempted. It's many orders of magnitude easier to imagine you already know an answer or have a solution than to actually reveal and uncover the same.

Some problems are not simply a matter of throwing additional resources at them. An unlucky few actually get worse as you do so.
