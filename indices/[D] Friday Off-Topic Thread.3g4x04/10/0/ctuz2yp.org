My brother has recently started a full-time job, in which his life is improved by audiobooks, podcasts, and so forth - and I've ended up as his main curator.

For podcasts, I can recommend Note to Self, Invisibilia, Welcome to Night Vale* , The Skeptics Guide to the Universe, Revolutions* , Freakonomics, Decoder Ring Theatre* , Savage Lovecast, On the Media, Singularity 1 on 1, Planet Money, Still Untitled, Radiolab, TEDTalks, and Under the Influence. (*: Better to listen to from the first episode.)

For audiobooks... there are a /lot/ out there, depending on where you look, and depending on your local jurisdiction you might want to look into a private torrent site such as MyAnonamouse.
