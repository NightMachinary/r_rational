Sneaking around the trademark isn't hard. I just think it's unjust that I'd have to do that, and I think it would result in a weaker story.

Fanfiction (for me) isn't about creating /more/ of the work, it's about /making a commentary on the work/. The very first draft of "The Metropolitan Man" was actually a genericized version of the flying brick superhero and the genius mad scientist, both scrambled enough that they'd be able to slip past copyright claims. But it lost the cultural connections, the dramatic irony, and a good deal of the voice. [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]] writes about a more specific form of this in his [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/other-universes]["Explaining Other Universes"]] article.

The Tarzan books are largely about a rejection of civilization. They're about the wonder and beauty of nature, along with the confidence and self-sufficiency of the ideal man. So the point of writing a book about Tarzan, for me, would be to turn that on its head. Civilization is /awesome/ and nature kind of /sucks/. But without that underpinning of what Tarzan is, you lose some of that message, or you have to spend some time building it up. You weaken the commentary.

I don't know. It always sort of bugs me in movies or television shows when they have to use the legally-distinct-from-but-you-can-totally-tell-what-we-mean thing with a wink and a nod to the audience.
