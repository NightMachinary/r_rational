I've recently been thinking about getting sued by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. I've had this idea for a steampunk/biopunk Tarzan book for a long time, but here's the catch; while a large number of the Tarzan books are in the public domain due to their age, making the character a public domain character (per the Sherlock Holmes ruling last year), ERB pursues people in another way. They claim /trademark/ on the character of Tarzan, not copyright. Since trademark lasts forever, they're not at risk of losing it unless someone challenges them.

So if I tried to write a Tarzan book, even one that was only loosely based on that character, I would almost certainly get sued by them as soon as I tried to sell it (especially since trademark requires that you defend your trademark in order to keep it).

But I kind of want to poke that bear anyway, because I think using trademark law to effectively keep a public domain character out of the public domain is total bullshit. The problem is that no one has ever called ERB on it; the cases get settled out of court, with either the literature suppressed or a "license" agreement reached, which is really nothing more than extortion. It's a very winnable case (hypothetically) that no one has been stubborn enough to weather.

So I've been thinking about how much work it would be to write this book so that I could get into a protracted legal battle with a large corporation. It sounds fun, if unwise.
