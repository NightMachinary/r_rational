I've e-mailed both the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Organization for Transformative Works, mostly in trying to figure out whether the Holmes case applied to Tarzan (which it /probably/ doesn't because it's copyright vs. trademark, but ERB isn't really operating in a known legal area). It's slightly outside the wheelhouse for both of them. I'm still in the middle of a bunch of other writing work, so unless I take this book as my NaNo project it's going to be a ways off. It's mostly something that I've been idly toying with.
