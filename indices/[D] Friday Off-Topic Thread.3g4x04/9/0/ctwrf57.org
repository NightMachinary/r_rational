Skyrim and Kerbal Space Program are great games - the best of the current generation of fantasy RPG and space games respectively, and there are huge communities of mods for both.

I should also probably plug [[/r/dwarffortress]], which is a great game if you love detail, roguelikes, or frustration - but certainly not for everyone.
