*Sex Change Pill*

Was reading some of the culture books, when the idea of a pill that allows you to change your sex got me thinking. (Sidenote: I really disliked how the fact that Culture species can change sex at will; that kind of ability would destroy any notion of gender roles, but the culture still seems to keep them).

Imagine a small, tasteless pill that can change your sex over 48 hours. It induces a harmless, but debilitating fever to do so, but once done, the transformation is perfect. Your organs and your dna all change, and you experience no dysphoria. It's relatively cheap, your sexual orientation stays the same and there's no side effects of changing sex frequently.

What do you guys think the effect this will have on society?

Personally, I think the female sex will be vastly reduced, almost to the point of extinction. The male body has several physical advantages over the female, and many females would seek the pill purely because (they think) they will get more respect as a man than a woman.

Within a few generations, humanity will become sequentially hermaphroditic. Everyone is born a male and dies a male, but some will change into a woman for procreation and certain social functions. I have absolutely no clue how gender roles will change because of this. Thoughts?
