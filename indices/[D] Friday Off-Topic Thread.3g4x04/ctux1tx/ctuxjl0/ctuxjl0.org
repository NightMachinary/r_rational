Fringe benefits: intersexed people can now opt out of that condition, transgendered people can presumably get their dysphoria cured.

Presuming sexual orientation stays constant through the transformation, I don't think that you'd see a substantial reduction in the female population. If people still cared about love, romance, etc. then women would have to stay women in order to be able to have boyfriends (something like 90% of the population is strictly heterosexual).

That's even if I accept the premise that there are substantial advantages to being a man, which I don't. It's my preferred gender in terms of utility, but the world isn't inconvenient to women in terms of physical strength; I can think of maybe two times in the last two few years that my wife required my superior strength in order to accomplish some task. The question of status is arguable; I think it's more likely that the erosion of benefits for men would come to its completion, rather than a mass migration of women becoming men.
