Downside - tons of effort, and expense. Upside - free publicity, and making the world a better place. I would also be willing to throw in $100 for the effort, though I realize that is a drop in the bucket. Not even enough to cover a lawyer for one hour, right?

As others said though, you can change the name just a tiny bit and be OK, I believe. Star Trek is still covered under copyright, yet John Scalzi wrote "Redshirts" simply by using different names. All the cultural references are in tact because it is so blatantly Star Trek that only someone who hasn't ever seen Star Trek would miss it (and at that point, they wouldn't get the cultural references anyway). Though maybe they weren't as hard on him, seeing as he's really popular, and has money, and the Star Trek characters were mostly cameo's in a Redshirt-focused story.
