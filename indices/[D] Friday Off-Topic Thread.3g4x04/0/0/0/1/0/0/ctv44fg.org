That's what I'm getting at. The difference in the way people read a story about Tarzan and not quite Tarzan isn't going to be greatly different. Because there's been so many "we know it's really Tarzan"s.

The other thing you can do is not name anyone, or use a pseudonym in-world that avoids having to use 'real names'. That's what T. A. Waters did with Sherlock Holmes in /The Probability Pad/.
