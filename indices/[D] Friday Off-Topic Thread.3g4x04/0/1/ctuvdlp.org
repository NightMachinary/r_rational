Have you found a large anti-trademark non-profit to work with in making a test case, or do you have the resources for the legal fight? Because, that would be a wonderful precedent.

Alternately are you planning a go-fund me kickstarter or the like because I may be doing the starving grad student, but I'd be willing to throw $100 into the hat for that legal battle.
