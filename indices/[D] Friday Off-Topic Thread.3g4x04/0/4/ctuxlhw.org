I think of trademarks as simply a claim that a particular concrete thing was made by a certain person or company. It is a mark used to establish authenticity against possible fakers. (So I do not think that trademarks apply to abstract things - especially not fictional characters.)

I might be thinking differently than you though because I do not recognize copyright. In other words I think that there is nothing morally wrong with copying a copyrighted (or non-copyrighted) material. I do, however, distinguish between copying and claiming. Copying a work is different from claiming to be the author of that work. The first is fine but the second is not.
