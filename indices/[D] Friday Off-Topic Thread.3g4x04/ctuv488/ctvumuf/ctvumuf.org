I've always found the idea of "beings" which could be meaningfully modelled as large collections of human-level individuals pretty interesting. Culture Minds, some portrayals of Cybermen and Borg, humanoid machines with tiny civilizations operating them ... handwaving it as a "distributed intelligence" with a human-level intellect but vastly different multitasking abilities /works/, but I love seeing the inner workings of these things.
