Speaking as one of the most obsessed fans of Vinge's /A Fire Upon the Deep/ I love this question.

I don't think this trope has become overused, by any means, and there are few if any /well done/ examples. Apart from Vinge's /Tine/ I can't think of a single example that attempts to really examine the internal life of a mind like that.

If you're planning on any fiction about pink-furred bunny hive minds, I'd be happy to proof read it.
