For memories, you essentially just append a record to your memory stream and append association links from concepts to the new memories. Factual knowledge should be about as easy. So merge or rebase, doesn't much matter.

If you want to ensure that your personality can change and that nodes don't end up with divergent personalities, you need a process that yields the same results in each node. You can do that with a non-deterministic, non-repeatable algorithm with master election, or you can do it with a deterministic, repeatable, node-independent algorithm (left as an exercise to the reader) in a more distributed fashion.
