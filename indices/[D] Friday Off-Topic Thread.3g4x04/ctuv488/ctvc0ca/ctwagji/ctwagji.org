  An efficient and relatively fault-tolerant way to go is to fork your consciousness into each node. Then, periodically, you assimilate the new memories and personality changes from each node in an elected master (in the distributed computing sense, not a political sense), produce a new version of your personality and memories, and distribute that to each node. But how long does that take? And can your nodes continue functioning (accruing new memories and personality changes) during this process?

This is sounding like it will start into Git Hell really quickly.

Like, are you /merging in/ new memories and personality changes, or /rebasing/ them?

As with git, the actual time at which something happened might eventually have nothing to do with the ordering and causality of the experiences relative to the subject's consciousness.
