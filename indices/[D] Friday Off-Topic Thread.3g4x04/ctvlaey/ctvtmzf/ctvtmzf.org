Hard to say. Are you looking for rational games? Kerbal Space Program is one I know a lot of people like, and from what I hear of it, it seems fairly rational.

I have also personally been playing The Long Dark, which is in alpha, but has a lot of promise as a solid rational survival game, giving the initial setting of a geomagnetic storm that crippled civilization and apparently reprogrammed wolf and bear brains, removing their fear of humans.
