It is not inevitable because it is hard. The reason incompetence is so common is because of how the government is structured. Governments do not always reward those who do a good job. Sometimes they reward those who know the right people, believe the right things or look pretty.

It is true that adding additional resources will not fix the problem. The reason the problem is made worse sometimes is because poor structure may reward failure. Adding additional resources adds extra incentive and chances to fail harder and in additional ways.

Fixing the structure of government so that it is merit-based is the goal of political science and political philosophy. It has yet to happen. (Although I have interesting suspicions about crowd-based governmental structure.)
