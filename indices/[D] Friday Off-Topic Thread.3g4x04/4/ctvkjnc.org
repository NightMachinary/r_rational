*Tell me what hat to buy*

My usual headgear has been a floppy tan boonie hat, which has been reasonably good at shading my eyes during hikes both urban and rural. It's getting due for replacement; and I'd like a baseball-cap-style hat to replace it.

Due to needing a replacement laptop, my funds are limited. I want to try out some "crache" safety inserts, so an opaque hat would be best. I'm leery about announcing my allegiance to random corporations, so if there's a logo, I'd prefer to customize it, or for it to be as innocuous as possible - maybe the hacker logo, or my provinces's shield.

What subreddits, forums, or other online groups would be willing to treat such a fashion question seriously, without mocking of, say, using a photographer's vest instead of a daypack on many hikes, or otherwise belittling someone with a traditional nerd's lack of any sense of style?
