I have /now/. :) It's a good story.

It doesn't really touch on how the stevelets manage to keep their core directives intact in the face of various evolutionary pressures; there's some mention of developing signatures and encryption when fighting the inoculations, but the implementation seems a bit fuzzy to me. (For Egan's story, that's fine; I'm focusing on a different topic.) It does provide some good inspirational fodder, and I thank you for the reference.
