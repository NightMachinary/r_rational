As the authour, I'm not sure I'm up to keeping that particular character trait as a central focus for very long. Writing the story in iambic pentameter would probably take less effort. (Don't worry, I'm not planning on doing /that/... at least, not outside of dialogue, and not for more than a chapter. ;) )

As for the protagonist, she's trying to treat it like a first contact situation, in much the way she first found a way to chat with the squiddies.
