I imagine something more like the Amoeba operating system when it comes to things like this. From collection of machine running the same 'operating system'. The neurons in another body are no different than the neurons on the other side of your head. Memories would be backed-up RAID-style.

I don't think most memories should be shared automatically, only the really important ones, and the rest would be distributed when a node requests it. I might whimsically imagine a hive where memories and thoughts are shared with the BitTorrent protocol.

In short, I think of something more akin to a distributed computing network than a bunch of clones working for a master. No hierarchy, no distinction between nodes. Not that mine is better, but it's what it think when someone says 'hive-mind'.
