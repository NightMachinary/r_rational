*Multi-bodied hiveminds*

In hard-SF, what do you like or dislike most about relatively singular intelligences housed in multiple bodies? Is there any variation that you've hoped to encounter, but never quite seen? Do you feel any versions have become overused to the point of cliches? Are there any particular details that an authour writing about such things should be careful not to be tripped up by? Are there any other aspects to an idea that a rational/ist authour might want to be especially focussed on?

(Do any of your answers change if the physical chassis in use appear(s) to be a herd of organic, pink-furred rabbits with advanced vocal cords?)
