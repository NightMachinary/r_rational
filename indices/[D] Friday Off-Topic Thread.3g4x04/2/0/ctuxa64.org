I can't claim to be particularly widely-read, but I don't recall ever seeing any sports played between multiply-bodied organisms. I wrote this funny snippet a few years ago:

  "And the first game of the season is about to start--Octopodes versus Men of War! What's really fascinating about these teams, Jim, is their vastly differing approach to the brain-linking that's mandated by the Tines League: While the Men of War use only the minimum level of integration by merging visual fields, location data, and proprioperception, the Octopodes actually sacrifice a member to the sidelines and centralize their brainpower in him, trusting that his ability to view the entire field at once, devise complex strategies and tactics, and forecast the moves of the opposing team will outweigh their lack of his physical abilities."

  "You've certainly got that right, Bob!"
