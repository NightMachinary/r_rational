In this community the idea will be pretty trite, but "the whole world's a Sim" is an easy way to explain a purely newtonian world.

Bonus advantage is it gives a source for physics breaking: X follows certain rules because that's what X does, and getting these rules to interact in usual ways is how you get deathrays and giant orbs of glowing blue energy and why invisibility fields work on you and your clothes but not the ground.
