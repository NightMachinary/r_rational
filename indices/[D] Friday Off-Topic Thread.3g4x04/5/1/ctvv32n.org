Well, in the Girl Genius universe, sparks seem to have some sort of mental advantage. Perhaps this mental difference allows them to interface with the aether at a deeper level than normal humans can.

How does this help your goals?

Let us assume that the aether is the fundamental underlying structure of the universe. Further, living or sentient beings can interface with the aether.

The power and depth of the mental aetheric channel is based on the intelligence and physical characteristics of the mind. A brilliant person might not be a spark, and have only a modest aetheric mental channel. An unintelligent spark might have a powerful, deep aetheric mental channel.

But how does the aetheric mental channel work? Every being influences reality around them to be as they expect it. Mosquitos can miraculously find you three seconds after you step outside because their teeny brains influence reality only slightly, but that's enough to minutely adjust air currents to bring them to prey.

So reality is, in actuality, defined by living beings. Some things are so firmly believed in by everyone and everything that it will not change. The Earth isn't going to poof, because everything on Earth with an aetheric channel expects it to continue existing.

That mosquito might not get a meal because the human they were attracted to put on a mosquito repellent which they believe works with a greater channel to the aether than the mosquito's simple mind can overcome. If the repellent was out of date, or untrusted for whatever reason, the human may not believe it will work with sufficient will to overcome the hunger instinct of the mosquito.

Sparks are capable of aetheric manipulation at a scale that few other intelligences can match. Things work because they THINK they will work. Newtonian physics is all they need to define the world sufficiently to be able to interface with the mundane world. This does not stop them from using the aether in ways that completely defy what we know of as Newtonian physics.

Because humans are visual creatures, appearance is very importance for maintaining and reinforcing reality. A big zeppelin floats because, well, zeppelins are big and float. Steam is a good power source because, well, it's visibly potent.

When multiple sparks work together, they can enter gestalt.

When multiple sparks work at odds, they can sense and intuitively interpret the work of other sparks to some degree. An intelligent spark can likely understand exactly what a less intelligent spark has done with the aether. Their mind allows a fuller comprehension. A less intelligent spark may have no clue what a highly intelligent spark has done with the aether to create a device.

Getting multiple, brilliant sparks into a single gestalt for a collaborative project can lead to amazingly absurd things, as they feed off one another's ideas.

In essence, Newtonian physics exist and are the default, but are not the rule if you have a significant channel to the aether. You could also allow for adrenaline spikes to enhance the aetheric connection. This would explain miracles like mothers flipping over steam carriages to rescue trapped children, and wild animals continuing to fight long after they should have died.
