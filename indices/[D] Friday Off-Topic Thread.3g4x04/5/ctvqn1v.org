I've been trying to work out a plausible set of physics that looks basically the same at human-scale but is Newtonian rather than relativistic. (This is meant for a tightish adaptation of Girl Genius.) Unfortunately, I'm not much of a physicist. Can anyone give me a hand?

Desiderata:

1. Electricity and magnetism must work more or less as we see them. Differing in details is fine, as long as you could still make a battery, electric motor, and lightbulb that would look the same to casual inspection.

2. Mechanics should look the same at human scale.

3. It would also be nice if it could incorporate the luminiferous aether being a real thing, somewhere obvious to stick hacks to thermodynamics (science may obey conservation of energy, but SCIENCE! clearly does not), or inexplicable reasons why steam power and zeppelins are popular.

Any suggestions that feel plausible are welcome.
