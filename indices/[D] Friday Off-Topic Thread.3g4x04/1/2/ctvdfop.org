  (Sidenote: I really disliked how the fact that Culture species can change sex at will; that kind of ability would destroy any notion of gender roles, but the culture still seems to keep them).

Gender is performative and not strictly aligned with notions of biological sex.

The Culture says that everyone should ideally bear one child and sire one child, but you can conform to one gender through both. The Culture also has people who take on bodies that diverge hugely from standard. These bodies don't necessarily have any morphological traits that would allow you to assign a gender even if you insisted that a particular biological sex mandates that you have a particular gender.

  Personally, I think the female sex will be vastly reduced, almost to the point of extinction.

  Within a few generations, humanity will become sequentially hermaphroditic.

That would take a long time. Most people put huge stock in their gender identities, strongly connect gender to biological sex, and view both as immutable. That would be enough to fix most of the current generation once free sex change pills were introduced. But it's more extreme than that. People put a lot of importance on the sex and associated gender of their children, and that starts even before birth.

If you introduced these pills and mandated that children must have free access to them, then you'd see a huge change. (Little girls know it's bullshit that little boys get away with acting out more and doing fewer chores, and they haven't had as much time to become attached to their assigned gender, much less their reproductive organs.) But for the most part, parents wouldn't allow their kids to use them. And then, by the time the kid is old enough to enjoy legal protections, their gender identity will probably be fixed in place and they'll probably firmly attach their gender to their biology.

Realistically, if you can change someone's sex whole hog, you can probably make it so they don't have periods and can alter their breast size at will. Certainly with another couple generations of research. That takes care of the most annoying parts of being female in terms of biology.
