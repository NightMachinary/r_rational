  (Sidenote: I really disliked how the fact that Culture species can change sex at will; that kind of ability would destroy any notion of gender roles, but the culture still seems to keep them).

That the Culture has gender roles is Ian Banks failing at feminism. That they change sex at will is /part of the point/: they can't develop too large an inequality between males and females because people will vote with their genitalia.

  Personally, I think the female sex will be vastly reduced, almost to the point of extinction. The male body has several physical advantages over the female, and many females would seek the pill purely because (they think) they will get more respect as a man than a woman.

This seems to assume that patriarchy (eg: a "standard-issue" favoring of masculine over feminine) is an Eternal Fact.

It isn't.
