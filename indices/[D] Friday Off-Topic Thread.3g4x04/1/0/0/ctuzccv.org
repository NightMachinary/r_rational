I would argue there /are/ more physical benefits to being a man; besides the aforementioned strength increase, you also have no periods, little maintenance, and can pee standing up. Furthermore, I always felt that woman saw being a man as more safe than being a woman; many of my female friends have said many times they wished they were a guy during a scary situation. My male friends tend to want to change gender during social situations, as they see women having greater advantages there.

I do agree that the mass migration may be a bit exaggerated, but I do believe that there will be a substantial shift in gender percentages.
