I would like to offer some advice that people are free to pass along to others, or adopt themselves.

Unless you have experience working within the patent system, or are in a financial situation that absolutely precludes hiring legal help, do not attempt to apply for a patent yourself, even if you buy helpful books.

The IRS is a straightforward and highly forgiving organization in terms of rules and regulations as compared to the USPTO. Seriously.

There are good reasons for most of the tediousness. That doesn't make it any less maddening when you are trying to figure out how to write a specification, claims, or respond to examiners.
