And there we see the unstable equilibrium.

Let's say we have utter equality among the readers for a particular genre. Then a marketing exec gets the idea of segmenting the market. They're not going to change the content; they're just going to market differently to men than to women. And lo and behold, this 1950s ad exec who isn't the least bit sexist puts just a little bit more effort and money into the ads for men. Then the analytics show that the ads targeted toward men get a better response, so the next ad campaign emphasizes the bias more.

The publishers notice this because the marketing companies are contractually obligated to share their data. They inform the editors and agents, who encourage or require authors to pander more to the male demographic. Because women aren't buying sci fi as much.

A decade later, the marketing focuses nearly exclusively on men, and editors and agents don't have to talk quite as much about limiting the representation of women because the genre's traditions have become sexist, and the people writing for the genre are the people who have been buying it, which is mostly the people it's marketed toward. But there are still people who haven't taken the hint, so the agents and editors still have to filter out some stuff. Or they'll go out on a limb and brand something "women's fantasy" and make a new, tiny, neglected market -- because there's no reason to risk the cash cow by selling something off-formula to the existing male demographic.

But identifying for certain whether it's a problem with agents and editors requires some knowledge from the industry, and I don't have that.

LEGO is pretty much a case study in destructive segmented marketing, if you're interested in the topic.
