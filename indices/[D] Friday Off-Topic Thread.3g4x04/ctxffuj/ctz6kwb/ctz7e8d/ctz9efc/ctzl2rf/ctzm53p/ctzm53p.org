I am not an expert in any of the fields one might expect to be involved in the study of a relationship between society and fiction. If I were to try to get into specifics, I'd probably make a fool of myself. I can see a likely trend though, and pointed it out. I believe that is useful, if you want to pursue it.

As for the idea of just letting the issue 'solve itself?' For all we know the problem *might* go away without anyone doing anything. That doesn't mean you can't get behind it and push, if you like.

I've specifically addressed your issue with regards to my own work in a different thread. Please don't take my refusal to engage here, with specifics, to mean that you shouldn't take action, or that I'm trying to discourage you from considering the problem.

I do agree that there is a protagonist and major secondary character gender disparity in writing in general, even if compared to societal norms. It also seems very likely that this is partly due to entrenched thought and established practices in the world of agents and editors. If that is the case, then self-published books may be a large part of the answer as more high quality writers begin to self-publish.

Please do feel free to continue discussing it, it's a discussion worth having. I just don't have the credentials to discuss it at anything deeper than a surface level, and I know it.
