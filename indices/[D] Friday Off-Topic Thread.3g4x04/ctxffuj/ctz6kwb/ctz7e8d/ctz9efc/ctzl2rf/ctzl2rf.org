By being so general and refusing to get into specifics, you make it seem like the problem will go away without any intervention, like there's no way to speed up the process, like no individuals are explicitly or unthinkingly contributing to the problem. By spending so many words on the generalities and trends, you make it seem like you're giving a useful analysis. You're also using this in response to my specific request, as if to say I should not continue this line of investigation.
