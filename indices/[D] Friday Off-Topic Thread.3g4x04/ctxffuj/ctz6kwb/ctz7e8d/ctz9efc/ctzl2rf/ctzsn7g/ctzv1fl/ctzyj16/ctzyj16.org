  Why do you like those books more than his other work?

I don't but I cherry picked them as most meating [[/u/tries_to_explain]] 's argument regarding gender bias in published work.

I'm curious but did you read to Sail beyond the sunset before or after finishing the rest of the History as myth arc? I don't think it is approachable except to studied fans of that mythos. Unless you have read at a minimum: Stranger, Rebellion in, Moon is Harsh, Time Enough, Number of the beast, and Cat*, (I'd recommend googling the recommended order for history as myth, but that might be a good enough order) it isn't approachable. . . that said for an optimistic and early view of a post singularity culture, and I mean really post singularity, not just Time enough for love post scarcity, it's worth looking at, if not worth the high price of admission if you aren't a fan of RAH.

My personal favorite, which I haven't examined the WHY of enough, is *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* despite it's many flaws, probably followed by *Starship Troopers* (please ignore the movie I swear someone made that movie to destroy the title's messages), which only shows my own militant matriculation and development.

What are your favorites by RAH and others, in case I haven't read the latter?

Edit: * some may argue you should take the 3 hours required to read Glory Road before reading Cat, so you actually know Empress Star /shrug/ you don't have to but it is probably one of the best of the: after the hero triumphs reality sets in novels, and its neat to get some scope on the other big players.
