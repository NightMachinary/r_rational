I read it after the others. After reading pretty much everything else hw wrote. I knew what was going on, I just wasn't interested. Heinlein's other work was "wow, cool idea! grizzled main character! emotions I remember sharing, main character from The Menace from Earth!" and then suddenly cat and sunset were "I am RAH and I REALLY like redheads, read my personal erotic fiction!" We get it bob, you and virginia fuck a lot. Cases in point include hazel stone pouncing on richard and lazarus fucking his OWN MOTHER.

I have the same RAH favorites, like a lot of people. /The Roads Must Roll/ was excellent too. My favorites by other authors include /The Trouble With Aliens/, Christopher Anvil, and /On Messenger Mountain/, Gordon R Dickson. This one's a bit more out there, but /Ranks of Bronze/: due to space trade law, you can only fight for trade contacts on primitive worlds with equivalent technology. When an alien trade guild needs the BEST low tech soldiers IN THE GALAXY, they take that roman legion that vanished in Persia.
