Farmerbob1 has discussed the anwser to your question better than I will be able to, but I'd like to offer three books for your consideration, because I'm honestly curious as to your take on them: /Friday/, /The Cat who Walks Through Walls/, and /To Sail Beyond the Sunset/ all, if memory serves, have a plurality or majority female cast with strong female leads, or a strong female co-lead in one case. These are all favorites of mine, and might be of interest to you. If you have or do chose to read them I'd appreciate your critique of how they rate against the evolution of gender equality in the industry.
