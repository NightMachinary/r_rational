I do not see you mentioning that reader demographics are simply a delayed reaction to societal norms.

A relatively short few decades ago, women couldn't vote, and could barely gain access to higher education. They were also extremely unlikely to engage in many strenuous sports, though there were a few socially acceptable sports for women like tennis and various equestrian sports. Even more recently, for decades after they were allowed to vote, most women were housewives, or worked in just a few professional jobs like nursing and teaching.

Real adventurism in women on a significant scale is recent, within the last few decades. In the US, women started to agitate strongly for, and eventually get, more and more social standings and freedoms in the late 1950's and 1960's. It was a long, hard fight to get where women are today in the US, and they still don't have real parity in some measurements.

If you look at fiction from the early 20th century, there are very few strong women characters. This matches the gender roles of the day.

Today, there are more strong women characters in literature. Perhaps less than what would be representative, but there are more.

Writers write what they know, and readers tend to like to read what they are comfortable with. If one tried to sell Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar books in the 1920's, they would flop. Society was simply not ready for gay male and female protagonists in high fantasy.

I would be willing to bet that there has been research done on this beyond what I'm spouting here, comparing societal norms to fiction popularity.
