Mercedes Lackey wrote a lot of female or female-identifying fantasy.

Robert Jordan also wrote a lot of very important secondary female characters in the Wheel of time series. In fact, there were more important female secondary characters than male ones.

The sci-fi and adventure audience does tend to be male-centric. I'm sure there are more female readers of both genres now than there were decades ago, but successful writers tend to write for larger audiences. Market dynamics would tend to be something agents and editors are looking for, I'm sure.
