I've been reading sci fi and fantasy from a number of sources. I've noticed that the cast of characters tends to be very male, even when the author is a woman. Are literary agents looking for gender balance and blanket rejecting anything with more than about 20% women? Anyone have contacts who are literary agents or in publishing or have experience with them that can offer insight?
