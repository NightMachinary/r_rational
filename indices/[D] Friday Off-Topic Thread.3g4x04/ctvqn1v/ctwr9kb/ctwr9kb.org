I would encourage you to use actual classical physics - they get [[http://www.aetherambler.net/strange.htm][very, very strange]] at high velocities.

Set the story on a planet going at very close to the speed of light through luminiferous aether - enough that the speed of light is subtly but measurably different in different directions. Interactions with this extremely strange substance can then fuel whatever you want, and energy pulled from the relative velocity of the planet and the aether in much the same way that Europa is deorbited in /Accelerando/.
