  Electricity and magnetism must work more or less as we see them. Differing in details is fine, as long as you could still make a battery, electric motor, and lightbulb that would look the same to casual inspection... It would also be nice if it could incorporate the luminiferous aether being a real thing

Elektrical Fluid?

  somewhere obvious to stick hacks to thermodynamics (science may obey conservation of energy, but SCIENCE! clearly does not), or inexplicable reasons why steam power and zeppelins are popular.

We-ell, an obvious reason for steam engines would be if the thermodynamics hack was good for creating heat or increasing the expansion rate of steam. My first thoughts are that "coal" is clearly something rather more energy-efficient here, and you can set up some sort of Science! Engine to pull energy out of some background field given enough energy to start it.
