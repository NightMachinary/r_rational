The point of insurance is that the duration that low risks do not demonstrate themselves subsidize the duration that they do. Over time this is ergodic per individual, and costs and benefits weigh out for all parties individually. People pay premiums according to their risk, and an imbalance in that risk means proportionately-imbalanced premiums and payoffs, premiums due to the judgement, payoffs due to the demonstration of the risk. Level off the premiums, though, and lower-risk insurees pay more than they should, higher-risk insurees pay less, and the payouts remain the same according to the demonstration of risks.

Effectively this imbalance means that there are people paying other people money for the sake of 'gender equality,' which makes no sense as equal treatment would dictate that people are equally judged by risk factors. Probabilities are blind. Lower-risk insurees will become uninsured altogether because the premiums are /literally not worth it,/ especially over a period of time. They're being Dutch-booked.

(Hypothetical) A high-risk woman pays an equal premium to a low-risk man. Over time, the woman makes more claims than the man because she is higher-risk. She gains more money than she puts into the system. The man makes less claims and puts more money into the system than he gains. Over the whole population, the money put in and gotten out is the same, but people are individual actors, and lose or gain money due to this system.

A system where high-risk men are charged higher premiums than low-risk women, or vice versa, is /more equal/ than the system where men are charged the same as women. More importantly, it makes sense for everyone in that system to have insurance, instead of the second system where only the high-risk gender has insurance and have higher premiums /anyway./ At that point you are simply depriving the low-risk gender of fair insurance, and probably insurance altogether.

People do not subsidize everyone of the same gender. There are many risk factors and gender is one of them. But when you have a Dutch book like this, it becomes a form of taxation, and not necessarily a progressive tax at all. Assuming that men are being paid more than women, and are higher-risk than women, you have women subsidizing the already-richer men, when the premiums and payoffs were balanced in the first place. Taxation should only be used by the government, and only to reduce market externalities and inefficiencies.
