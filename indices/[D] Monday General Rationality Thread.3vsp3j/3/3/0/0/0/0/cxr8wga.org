That is kinda-sorta the point of insurance, though. If no one subsidized anyone, you wouldn't have insurance and just pay for all your repairs through a savings account. Deciding that all people should subsidize each other, not just everyone of the same gender is only changing the degree of subsidization (or risk pooling) a little.
