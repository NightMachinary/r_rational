It helps women, who are more likely to visit doctors, request medication, and get treatment for their medical issues than men are. Women also get pregnant, by far the most common expensive medical condition in the under-40 crowd.

In the longer run, women live longer than men and, even excepting that, tend to use more end-of-life care than men do.

Note, too, that before mandated insurance in the US, and even when health insurance prices for women were significantly higher than those for men, women were still 15% more likely to have insurance coverage. Much of this was because women were more likely to work jobs with employee health-coverage, but the higher costs did not seem to dissuade either women or their employers.
