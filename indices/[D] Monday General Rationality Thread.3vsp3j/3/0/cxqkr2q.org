The libertarian argument (the reason that Ron Paul opposed specific parts of the Civil Rights Act) is that people should be free to discriminate however they'd like on whatever basis they see fit. If I own a business and only want to allow _____ as customers and/or employees, that should be completely up to me. In other words, it's none of the government's business whether I'm barring _____ from buying meat at my butcher's shop. I shouldn't have to give any reason. If people really dislike this practice, they'll stop coming to my shop and the free market will do its job.

That is/was the argument, anyway. I don't really buy it because the consequences don't seem optimal to me, but that describes a lot of my relationship with libertarianism.

At any rate, I think it's important to distinguish what we mean by a society punishing people. Do we mean the state making laws against discrimination? Do we mean people boycotting? Negative publicity? Something else?
