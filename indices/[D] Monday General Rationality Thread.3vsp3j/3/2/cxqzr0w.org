  For example, we strongly condemn racism and sexism in general, but allow it in specific cases, like insurance companies charging young men more for car insurance.

Consider [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/01/setting-the-default/#comment-273395][this comment]] from Slate Star Codex.

In most areas of society, it's very hard to nail down what the /correct/ level of discrimination is, and anyone attempting to apply a nonzero level of discrimination will almost always overshoot. Furthermore, rules have to be enforceable, and "on average, employers should discriminate only this much" is very hard to enforce. So the enforced threshold for fuzzy, non-quantitative actions like job interviews or etc is zero. The law does not trust you to apply base rates correctly.

But actuaries are /the/ quant profession. It's very straightforward to adjust rates by exactly the correct amount to account for men on average getting in more car accidents than women (or whatever), and not a penny more or less.

I think it takes some contortion to call this "sexism". Men pay more for insurance, as do people with a history of accidents, teenagers, etc. Insurance doesn't even work unless you can accurately account for risk.

You could pass laws that say "you can't charge for different levels of risk based on gender specifically", but then the actuaries just split the cost across everyone, instead of adjusting cost for risk like they do in every other case. It's not clear to me that charging for /gender-based/ risk is less fair than charging for any other kind of risk.
