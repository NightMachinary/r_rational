You might punish "innocent" stereotyping in order to strongly signal that all stereotyping is bad. This becomes an extra good idea if people are bad at distinguishing true stereotypes from false ones.

On the other hand, there might be times stereotyping should be subsidized. Suppose that a generalization is untrue but has useful consequences for people's behaviors. You might promote such generalizations, if you're utilitarian.

Also, we need to consider that sometimes we're not faced with a decision between the status quo and one option, but between the status quo and many different options. Stereotyping might be beneficial or detrimental in some narrow sense, but this narrow sense would collapse if you looked at context more broadly. For example, maybe there are short term negative consequences or inaccuracies caused by affirmative action, but these short term effects are outweighed by longer term effects. Or, maybe your goal is to temporarily make racism worse, so that everyone will unite against it in a glorious revolution, rather than engage in halfhearted piecemeal reform.

Personally, I think it's better to try to change people's beliefs than to incentivize them to suppress those beliefs. So I don't really think we should do much to subsidize, shun, or intentionally manipulate people's beliefs about stereotypes in any way, even in very obvious cases. I prefer removing bad beliefs or social inefficiencies directly over compensating for them with second-order moves. I do concede that there's probably some role for social influences or government propaganda efforts to cause beneficial changes to society, but it's not something I spend my time on. Toying with people's values or beliefs makes me feel queasy, even when it's for a good cause. So I mainly use the tool of argumentation, and leave other tools alone.
