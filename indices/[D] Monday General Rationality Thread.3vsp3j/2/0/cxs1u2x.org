Hmm... the gold standard from 25 years ago was The art of electronics. But that was for college EEs. But useful for course and lab. Still, probably too detailed. Maybe use a library to see. The first 100 pages will probably give you more than enough.

Edit -- This is probably more theory than you want. Not sure if I'm reading too much into electronics engineering vs electrical engineering.
