I have a similar approach when I need to defuse the nervousness of Doing Things In Public, although with a slightly different spin - I try to think in terms of the long-term consequences; most of the time that's "I will never see these people again, their opinion of me will have no material impact on the rest of my life, and they won't give me a second thought once I'm out of their field of vision", which I find takes some of the pressure off even when the anticipated actions could include an unpleasant degree of staring or laughing.
