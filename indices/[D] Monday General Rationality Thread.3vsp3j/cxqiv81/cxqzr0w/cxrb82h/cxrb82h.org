  I think it takes some contortion to call this "sexism". Men pay more for insurance, as do people with a history of accidents, teenagers, etc. Insurance doesn't even work unless you can accurately account for risk.

  You could pass laws that say "you can't charge for different levels of risk based on gender specifically", but then the actuaries just split the cost across everyone, instead of adjusting cost for risk like they do in every other case. It's not clear to me that charging for gender-based risk is less fair than charging for any other kind of risk.

Finally, you have a choice: if we want most people to be insured, insurance must be mandatory or we must allow discriminatory (as in, correlated with risk) premiums. Otherwise lower-risk individuals will tend to be under-insured, depending on their risk profile.

You could understand eg public healthcare as a mandatory scheme with premiums paid according to the tax system rather than risk profiles. This has some issues, but most developed nations agree that the public good of good public health outweighs the downsides.
