I've been thinking about stereotyping and discrimination lately (spiders ahead). Specifically, about when a society should punish/shun those who discriminate or stereotype others.

The obvious cases that should be looked down on are where the beliefs are false or the actions are either ineffective or counterproductive. I can't think of anything that's obvious and non-controversial in the other direction.

I'm more interested in the edge cases, and trying to figure out where they are and why. For example, we strongly condemn racism and sexism in general, but allow it in specific cases, like insurance companies charging young men more for car insurance.
