It's not like it's really that hidden in an insurance premium. The way they function is not a trade secret, nor all that difficult to understand. Whether you have to explain the statistics behind insurance or why there's a 1% increase in the tax bill.

On the other hand, where would this tax be moved to? Income or sales or property tax hardly seems appropriate, because non-drivers would be forced to subsidize. I'm not aware of any practical way to only tax drivers. Fuel taxes disproportionately hit professional drivers, who are on the average, lower-risk. Licensure or registration fees being increased sounds pretty similar to just paying a higher premium, the cost is still effectively hidden though it would hit people with more cars, who might correlate to higher risk but that seems a poor mechanism compared to actuary-driven insurance premiums. I guess you could try to tack on some sort of fee to filing accident reports, though that sounds like it would just encourage people to not notify the authorities and cause more hit and run incidents.
