Okay, but insurance, as people use the term, refers to the risk-pooling entities we call insurance companies. They carry other benefits such as lowering the unit cost of repairs and the like through bulk negotiation. Taxing through that mechanism limits the ability of other interests to squander the money.

You make it sound like taxes are bad. In this case, I'm more likely to be hit by a high-risk driver than a low-risk one. So I want them to be able to pay for the damages. Sure, I get somewhat less benefit when they pay for the damages, because I've subsidized them, but the subsidy makes it more likely they have insurance at all and can pay me anything.

If high-risk drivers had to pay their own way, it seems more likely that without some sort of state intervention, they wouldn't have insurance. Or, they get priced out of the driving game because they can't afford their insurance costs and because of American (though it exists to lesser degrees elsewhere) development habits and attitudes towards public transit, that means they'd get priced out of a lot of employment opportunities. Besides the benefit of more people in the economy ideally bringing prices closer to equilibrium and maybe an increase in things called crime as these people turn to less ideal forms of employment and the subsequent increase in law enforcement costs, I'm not inclined to believe the arbitrary distinction of 'self' that says it's okay to screw over other people because they're not me. Society is a very complicated beast and I can't say with much certainty which parts of it we can just exclude.
