But if everyone just pays exactly what their risk is, you don't have an insurance company. You'd have a collection of savings accounts and loan guarantees. We can reasonably well predict total costs, so you'd just tell people "save $x every month" to cover it and if you have an accident sooner than expected, you'd get a loan, which would be paid back by that $x you're saving every month.

Insurance is a game of risk pooling. In order for it to be useful, some kind of group has to be put together into a shared group, whether that be behavioral, or type of car, or gender, or whatever. You're pooling the risk between multiple individuals. People paying "more than they ought to" is the point. Some folks will because it's statistically unlikely everyone will eventually need it, but everyone is forced to buy it. This is why auto insurance is mandatory, you need the low-risk people to pay in, without taking out to keep it affordable. Insurance is not a good idea individually, it's a good idea collectively. You can make those groups smaller, if you want, but it does it's job best when you make the groups as large as possible. Though I suppose small groups benefit the insurance company entity. Some people are decidedly disadvantaged, because of the nature of insurance. The goal is to get as wide a group as possible so that you minimize individual harm.
