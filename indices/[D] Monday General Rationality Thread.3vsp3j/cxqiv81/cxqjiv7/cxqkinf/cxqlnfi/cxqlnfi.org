I imagine the insurance people having a big multidimensional bracketing system to divide drivers into demographic buckets, so it would collapse one of those axes, so that they have to give [middle-aged, low-income, high-mileage, 1 accident in the last 3 years, no motoring convictions, self-employed people who use their car for social trips, business and commuting and want comprehensive insurance for a newish car with a good safety record and a small engine] the same rate regardless of gender.

Then the price charged to each bucket is based on the total costs generated by people in that bucket. Assuming a gender-skew to those costs, forcing a bucket that's split 50/50 on gender lines to stop discriminating would result in higher premiums for the women and lower premiums for the men, whereas a bucket dominated by one gender or the other won't see much of a change.

My point is that they still have plenty of dimensions to calculate your risk along, even without gender in the mix. Some of those dimensions may even end up effectively recreating gender discrimination through the indirect route of the genders being unequally distributed along other insurance-relevant axes.
