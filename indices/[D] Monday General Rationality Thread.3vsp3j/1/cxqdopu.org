I always thought it would be cool to have a D&D or D&D-like thing online where there are several players (probably with superpowers) plotting against each other and trying to out-predict each other. If information flow is regulated carefully enough then players won't have to worry about separation of character knowledge and player knowledge. Would anyone else be interested in such a thing? Any ideas?
