CÂ°ntinuum, /the/ time-travel-shenanigans roleplaying game, has some solid ideas about how to build game mechanics for precognition fights and the types of "attack" and "defense" skills and moves that one might use to stay a few steps ahead of the competition. It also demands that players keep a very thorough record of their known future.

I think they'd adapt nicely to ordinary superintelligent plotting (for us not-so superintelligent players and GMs), with some slight change in resources and terminology. Even if you don't like that class of solutions, I recommend giving the mechanics a look. So far as I know nobody else has put together as tight a rule set for such things.
