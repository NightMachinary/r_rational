random life thing I started doing when I feel like people are going to judge me and feeling anxiety.

Don't think of what people think of you, think of what they are going to do.

Detach their actions from you or judgement of you and just prepare and act based on their predicted actions.

This seems to help me with the tendency to think other people are always thinking and judging me that characterizes when my social anxiety is acting up.
