I think I've found a world in which Harry's gambit makes sense.

Next Chapter:

  "Of course," said Harry, "a large majority vote by the wizarding equivelant of the house of lords can overturn my decision and dissolve our treaty. So this is your oppurtunity to win them over. I know these people and can offer advice, but ultimately, what you offer them for their surrender is up to you. What, your majesty, would become of magical Britain under your rule?"

In this way Harry puts himself in the "Us" category in parliments "Us against Them" view, but still manages to get a fair deal for wizards, since the Queen is likely to offer /more/ than she otherwise would have as she now has no idea of how much she needs to give up to ensure peace and giving more than she could have is safer than giving potentially too little (in addition, she only has one shot at it, as opposed to the ability to negotiate that she would have had dealing with Harry).
