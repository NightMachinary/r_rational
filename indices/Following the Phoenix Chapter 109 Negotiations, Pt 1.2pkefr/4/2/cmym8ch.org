I think it's meant more as "destroy my credibility and make wizards don't trust 1-person-authority", than "solve the war problem".

The original problem is Voldemort plans around Harry, not the war. Solving the war with Harry as belenvolent dictator for life wouldn't set Voldemort back much, it would be actually playing for his hand.
