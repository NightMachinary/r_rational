I don't really understand Harry's strategy here. There is no way that the Wizegnomet would agree with Harry's surrender to the muggles. Couldn't the just overrule his surrender? I remember Harry mentioning in a previous chapter that that the Wizognemet could overrule him if they had a 90% majority. That doesn't seem difficult at all considering what Harry is proposing.

Honestly if I was a wizard I'd be pretty pissed.
