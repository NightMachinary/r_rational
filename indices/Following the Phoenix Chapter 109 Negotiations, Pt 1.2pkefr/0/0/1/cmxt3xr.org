Or at least he /thinks/ he's fighting voldemorte/Riddle/Quirrell. Remember from Ch. 27: "Harry, smiling, had asked Professor Quirrell what level he played at, and Professor Quirrell, also smiling, had responded, One level higher than you."

The primary source for Harry's perception of Quirrell's motivation is from his speech in ch. 34-35. While there is further evidence that HPMoR:Quirrell was expressing his true opinion in that speech, the majority of that occurs after FtP split off, so it is not really part of FtP. If voldemorte/Quirrell's assessment of his own ability to model Harry is still accurate by chapters 34-35, then this speech (or for that matter the whole related aspect of the Quirrell personality) could have been shaped to produce this very result.

In fact, I would be surprised if a rational Quirrell would let something like this happen unintentionally. By allowing Harry to put a binding on Malfoy and Dumbledore and take them to the negotiation, Harry's surrender has pretty much removed any chance of the government of magical Britain forming an effective response.

Since the bindings and the negotiation team were both widely available information and there was relatively long duration available for Quirrell to act on it, we can only assume Quirrell did nothing to disrupt it because he found it would most likely not go against his plan. So either Quirrell made a significant error in both assessing his confidence in his ability to predict Harry's actions and predicting Harry's actions, or the result was intentional.
