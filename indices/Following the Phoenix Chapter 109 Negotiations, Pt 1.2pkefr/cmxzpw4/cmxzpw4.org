While surrender could be a viable option if it was conditional, surrender in name only perhaps, unconditional surrender is not going to go over very well.

I feel like there is going to be exposition in the next chapter that perhaps makes this seem a better option than it does now. Though I feel that sort of defeats the purpose of a rational story - in that we are supposed to have access to the same information as Harry (in general) so we can follow his thought processes.

I don't know about the rest of you, but this doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Even if he is just doing this as a big middle finger to Quirrel, I think we've got enough evidence now that any blatant confrontation of Quirrell is a *really freaking bad idea*.
