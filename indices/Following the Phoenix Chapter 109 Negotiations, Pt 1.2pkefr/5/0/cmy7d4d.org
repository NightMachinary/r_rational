He is limited in how he can use the time turner. The information he receives from the future limits his options in the past. Our best guess on his previous scheme meant that he would have had false positives on Harry's death in order to avoid any risk. So Quirrel may have up to six hours of prep time, but he cannot have retroactively interfered in shaping this event. But yeah, he probably has a time turner.
