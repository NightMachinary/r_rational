Sasuke what are you planning...

"Like Naruto said earlier, this period of fake peace is not going to last forever"

That's some great paraphrasing Sasuke, except you weren't around when Naruto said it. I might be more inclined to believe that this is something benign like using the Sharingan to read naruto's lips, even though sasuke didn't seem to be in line of sight at the time, if not for the fact that moments later he preforms a similar feat, calling out Sakura for her knowledge of how the first hokage died. She is clearly surprised that Sasuke knows that she knows, so I doubt that she just told him earlier.

I have two theories on how Sasuke knows. He could be using the Sharingan to read their minds. The Sharingan can't do that in canon but the land of waves arc in NTBS sorta suggests that maybe it can in NTBS. Or Sasuke is spying on them, possibly with that hawk summon (we're explicitly told that Tsunade's room isn't sealed against observers).

Further evidence that Sasuke is manipulating Naruto's plan comes in the form of Shino being there, even though Naruto didn't invite him, and Sasuke's influence could serve as an explanation for how Temari/Kankuro found out about it, though there are reasonable alternatives for both of these examples.

Sasuke probably isn't being malicous with these plots. Having a strong trustworthy team of ninja to rely on when he tries to take down Itachi fits with his motives, but spying/reading the minds of his teammates is a bit less benign...

EDIT: Am moron, not only has the author noted in a comment that there is strong evidence that the sharingan can read minds in canon, but in Chp 36 of NTBS it's explicitly stated that kakashi is reading Naruto's mind. "He looked into Naruto's mind once again, trying to see if there was anything else that might alarm him."
