Well spotted! I was actually worried that people would be replying with "I noticed a mistake in this chapter..." since my track record for dropping subtle clues is not that great :p

Without saying which if any of your interpretations is correct, I will note that the Sharingan being able to read minds is very much a canon thing. Not only does Sasuke use it to invade Naruto's mindspace to talk to Kurama, the entire first half of the fight between Sasuke and Itachi is literally them standing there motionlessly while they psychically communicate with each other using the Sharingan. And any rationalist worth their salt would realize that if you can psychically communicate, it's also possible to turn that information stream into one-way traffic with a bit of cleverness.

Of course, you might point out that that's not so much a function of the Sharingan as it is of genjutsu in general, but the effect is the same either way.
