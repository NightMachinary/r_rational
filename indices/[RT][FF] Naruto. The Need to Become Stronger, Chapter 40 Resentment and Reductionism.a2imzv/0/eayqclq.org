Whenever I write one of these chapters where a piece of science or rationality is explained, I'm faced with a problem: First of all, HPMOR style lectures tend to slow down the pacing and takes the reader out of the story. But secondly, there really is no good justification for why Naruto would even know that kind of science to begin with. So instead you get the more realistically jumbled explanation you see here, which kind of hints at the principles behind reductionism but unfortunately doesn't really explain it to readers who don't already know what it is.

If I had been writing a more scientifically advanced setting, I would have liked to explain the concept of a scientific explanation: Namely that instead of trying to think of reasons for why a phenomena should exist, the goal is to describe in the simplest possible terms what's going on at a fundamental level. The idea that describing *how* something works is exactly the same as explaining *why* it works is an incredibly important insight which I think even people with a scientific background don't really grog intuitively.

There is another important rationalist lesson in this chapter, though: Whenever you want to explain something, start by asking yourself what your students want to actually use this knowledge for, and then take them through it step by step by showing them how to get there. If you don't, you end up with the kind of meaningless theoretical mumbo-jumbo that Naruto nearly subjected his audience to before Sasuke intervened.

If only my past student self had been so lucky.
