As an addendum, it's unlikely that Hinata/Neji was reading Naruto's lips, since Neji didn't seem aware of Naruto's plan even though Naruto described it when he said the fake peace line. It's possible that I'm misinterpreting his statement, or that Hinata told Sasuke about Naruto's conversation non-verbally, but that wouldn't explain Sasuke knowing about how the first hokage died. (Hinata's byakugan can't possibly keep track of Sakura during all of her meetings with Tsunade).
