It sounds more like you're the authorial equivalent of a serial start-up founder. You want to do the fun parts (getting the thing off the ground) and then leave someone else to the drudgery of actually piloting it where it needs to go.

Which is to say: ever thought of working with a ghostwriter---the kind that turns chapter outlines + a world bible into finished books? You could be the next [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Drake#Works][David Drake]]:

  In addition to his solo works, Drake has co-authored novels with authors such as Karl Edward Wagner, S.M. Stirling, and Eric Flint. Typically Drake provides plot outlines (5,000--15,000 words) and the co-author does "the real work of developing the outline into a novel". He does not "consider [his] involvement to be that of a real co-author."
