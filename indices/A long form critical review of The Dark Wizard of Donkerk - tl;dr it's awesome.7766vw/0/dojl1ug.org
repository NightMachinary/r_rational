I think being a dad suits me well. It's been about twenty months since I quit my job as a software engineer to be a stay-at-home dad, and for the most part that's been great. We have less money now (more because we're now on my wife's income alone rather than the kid), but I have a lot less stress, and watching after my son is something that I actually take pleasure from. We go visit the many parks our city has on offer, take hikes through the woods with him on my shoulders, read books together, and in general I get a lot of enjoyment from watching him grow and develop, both in a fatherly pride way and because of my interest in neurological development.

As for Glimwarden ...

I got way too invested in the 2016 US presidential election. I ended up devoting a lot of time and energy to telling people on the internet that they were wrong, which isn't terribly out of character for me, but I did it with a lot more intensity and anger than I normally do, in part because it seemed like 95% of the people who were nominally on my "side" were more interested in seeing how hard they could smugly signal their (supposed) virtue and tribal affiliation than they were in either talking intelligently about the issues, engaging with opposing viewpoints, or actually winning the election. As the election progressed, I was devoting more and more time and mental energy to that, rather than writing.

Eventually I realized that I was just making myself angry and unhappy, and started the process of carving real-world politics out of my life, dropping all existing relationships to the people I normally talked politics with, blacklisting news sites, enabling a bunch of filters, etc., which has generally made me happier.

I've had three problems with writing Glimwarden again:

1. The story is grim in a lot of ways that I don't want to feel grim, and talks about or features politics in a lot of ways that just leave a sour taste in my mouth. This was especially the case for some planned plotlines that couldn't/can't be easily reworked. I guess I want more optimism than was planned for Book I of Glimwarden.
2. I sort of consider myself unsuited to serial fiction, in some ways. If you really want to /succeed/, then I think you need to have a consistent update schedule and be willing to pump out thousands of words per day, you have to be willing to accept a lot of imperfection, /and/ you need to stick with one story for a long time, partly because the key to success is just slowly grinding out the building of an audience. Glimwarden was planned to be that -- and still is, in a lot of ways -- but the longer I've been writing, the more I might not have that in me.
3. I have a problem with monogamy. I see an attractive story idea walk by in a short skirt, and especially when I don't have a set update schedule to stick to or promises that I've implicitly or explicitly made that people will hold me to ... it's like that new story idea will just worm its way into my brain, and I'll start first thinking about what kind of characters I would want, then what the structure would be like, and then I start jotting down some notes, and finally I'll just write a scene or two, and then before I know it I've "wasted" a month where I was working on this new thing rather than putting in time with Glimwarden.

My intent was to write in private so I could make chapters that all worked together and didn't introduce flaws that couldn't be fixed, but that hasn't worked out so well. More and more, I think that to be a proper serial author, you have to just fail at your story sometimes and hope that the good is good enough to make up for the bad, and that sort of grates at me, because I want to be a more polished, professional author than that.

I'm not writing Glimwarden right now, I'm writing this other thing that's captured my attention, and my plan is to keep going on that while I have the momentum. Once I either (hopefully) finish that, which will be a few months, or flame out and die, I'll go back to Glimwarden and probably start publishing what I have and just return to a weekly update schedule rather than my original plan of writing in private until Book I is complete and then going from there.

*tl;dr: Glimwarden is on indefinite hiatus, but not permanent hiatus.*

You know, I went searching for my own post-mortem of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ and apparently I never wrote one. I would do that now, but I'd have to sacrifice writing time for it, especially since I would have to reread the thing, and in rereading would probably want to fix some things.

I don't know if you've read them, but posts [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][1]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html][2]], and [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html][3]] on pre-writing it (from 2014) might be illuminating. I'd be happy to answer whatever (non-interpretation) questions you have, to the extent that I actually remember what I was thinking. There are large swaths of it, especially in the back half, that I wrote but never read, and writing for me is more ephemeral than reading.
