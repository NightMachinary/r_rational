  two people who are at each other's throats finally have each other in their sights, it seems like they would just go for it, rather than talk first

Oh yeah, I definitely see how Sofia would be at Rowan's throat immediately.

On the other hand, it doesn't mean they have to jump to physical violence. Henri could act as a mediator of sorts, be a voice of reason.

Or Rowan could arrange a private audience, dismiss his guards, and make a point like "Dad isn't there anymore, we don't have to have guards watching our every breath" before they start to throw accusations.

At that point, I'd also expect Rowan to have some deep insecurity, and want some sort of emotional validation from his sister: if she recognizes how bad she suffered from her father, it absolves him of the guilt of killing him, and if she recognizes the usefulness of dark magic, it validates him as a wise ruler.

  That's the intended reading. I think I was going for having it be more terrifying because of both the reader having to figure it out on their own, and the dramatic irony of the reader knowing something that Rowan doesn't.

Yeah, that was kind of ominous. It would have been more ominous if he'd gone full SCP, with increasingly more references to decisions he's forgotten, and the implication that he did /something/ he didn't fully understand. Maybe in the climax Sofia could have told him "remember when we did X?" only for him to go "what are you talking about?".

Although, while I'm on the subject, I liked the whole "King Scar on Pride Rock" theme the story struck at the end. Rowan has built his power on a foundation of lies and shortsighted decisions, and you get the sense that his rule will be extremely unstable no matter what happens. Legalizing dark magic to get more dark magic books in particular seemed like a nice "jump off the sanity cliff" move.

  (This is, I feel, the primary problem with The Last Christmas, and the part that I keep meaning to rewrite every time Christmas rolls around.)

Sort of. Right now The Last Christmas is basically 2/3 of a story.

But I don't think detailing out the fight between nice!Santa and evil!Santa would be any better. My main problem with the story was that the transition between "the elves do whatever Santa wants" to "the elves dump Santa" was way too abrupt. It probably needed one or two more chapters.
