I think I have a tendency to rush confrontations, because when I get to a scene where two people who are at each other's throats finally have each other in their sights, it seems like they would just go for it, rather than talk first. But this is one of those things where I might need to suspend my own disbelief a little bit, in the interests of paying off tension and narrative better. (This is, I feel, the primary problem with /The Last Christmas/, and the part that I keep meaning to rewrite every time Christmas rolls around.)

  This is never explained, but my assumptions were that: he'd sacrificed the memory in a ritual; which implies that he's done a fair bit of self-modification, and liberally sacrificed parts of himself he really should have held on to; which in turn explains why from that point on his sanity seems to be in free fall.

  Is that what happened?

That's the intended reading. I think I was going for having it be /more/ terrifying because of both the reader having to figure it out on their own, and the dramatic irony of the reader knowing something that Rowan doesn't.

It's mostly that every time I came to this subreddit I was made to feel bad about not working on Glimwarden, and since writing is my primary release from the stress of parenting (and everything else), I wanted to change it up so I didn't feel bad about writing the thing I was enjoying writing. My flair on [[/r/HPMOR]] has been "Keeper of Atlantean Secrets", which one of the mods there gave me, and I've always liked that title. I might add an adjective in, I don't know.
