  I don't know if you've read them, but posts 1, 2, and 3 on pre-writing it (from 2014) might be illuminating.

Wow. Yeah, those are interesting. In a sense, they confirm my reading on some of the story's parts. I've read the story, analyzed it, thought "Okay, this character represents X, this character represents Y", and it's funny to see it confirmed or denied in the notes.

There are differences between the notes and what you ended up writing, mostly in term of pacing. The story as planned in the notes would have had a way shorter arc 1, and moved on to Henry and Sofia on the run. It would have focused on their adventures, and maybe have them fight monsters and stuff?

The story as published spends more time on Rowan, and has him as a protagonist before he becomes a villain. We see all three of them develop, how Henry and Sofia become socially starved (which probably helps their teenage romance), and Rowan's start of darkness. Honestly, I like it that way. The stakes are emotional more than physical, which is something I'd rarely seen before; it felt more grounded and realistic than "and they had various adventures and fought monsters" would have.

The notes said Rowan was intended as a mirror for Henry, which I think came across well. Henry as written in the notes strikes me as a first draft for Sander Seaborn. In the finished version, Henry feels more competent, wiser and generally more on the ball than Sander.

Also, the notes says the story was going be about a dark/evil dichotomy. I like that it went into a more nuanced commentary on utilitarianism instead. The "dark != evil" thing strikes me as haggling on labels, and I've had enough of that with Star Wars fics already.

I'm surprised that the magic system stayed exactly the same. Also, it was pretty interesting to see a system that I'd discovered through world-building and exposition be laid out as pure authorial text.

  especially since I would have to reread the thing, and in rereading would probably want to fix some things.

Yeah, that's a slippery slope. I you find time to do it anyway, I'd recommend focusing on a specific part: the sequence between "Sofia inherits the magic crown" and "Sofia and Henry retreat, and meet Henry's parents". Here's how I see it:

The story mostly revolves around Sofia and Henry's growth as characters. At the end of the second arc, Sofia learns a ton of information, about her mother, Henry, her brother, the prophecy, the abduction, etc. She should be given the time to process that information before she confronts Rowan.

I feel like Sofia and Henry confronting Rowan should be the climax of the story, where everyone proclaims their beliefs and draws lines in the sand. There should a scene where Sofia begs Rowan to renounce his mad ambitions, and Rowan lets out his insecurity about her being the favorite, etc. The actual battle should be an afterthought, like the battle between Lex Luthor and Superman in TMM.

  I'd be happy to answer whatever (non-interpretation) questions you have, to the extent that I actually remember what I was thinking.
#+end_quote

Sure, here's one: when Rowan is confronted by Amelia (the first servant girl he stole memories from), he has no memory of the incident, which is weird, because it was pretty memorable, and a mentalist isn't supposed to forget things anyway.

This is never explained, but my assumptions was that he'd sacrificed the memory in a ritual; which implies that he's done a fair bit of self-modification, and liberally sacrificed parts of himself he really should have held on to; which in turn explains why from that point on his sanity seems to be in free fall.

Is that what happened?

  The story is grim in a lot of ways that I don't want to feel grim, and talks about or features politics in a lot of ways that just leave a sour taste in my mouth. This was especially the case for some planned plotlines that couldn't/can't be easily reworked. I guess I want more optimism than was planned for Book I of Glimwarden.
#+end_quote

That's a shame.

For the record, I thought Glimwarden was much more optimistic than your other stories. It feels like reverse Attack on Titan: humanity is progressing, building infrastructure and weapons (minigun!), and the protagonists are mostly trying to make things better. It's the little things, like when Philip mentions they've developed a new type of lantern in the past decade, and now that it's field tested they might deploy it.

And I don't want to tell you what to write, but I'd just like to say that I loved the political analysis in Glimwarden, and I hoped to see more of it.

As a French person (normally) living in Paris, I was particularly interested in how the refugee crisis arc would evolve. It's a theme that hits close to home, to stuff I see happening where I live, and that I don't really know how to parse or how I should feel about. Some of the stuff you wrote felt like it helped me understand the political situation of my country.

I hope you don't drop it completely.

  I'm not writing Glimwarden right now, I'm writing this other thing that's captured my attention

Is that related to your new flair?
