Alright, alexanderwales bibliography time:

- The Terminator fic

- The Last Christmas (original)

- Two HP:MoR crackfics

- A Bluer Shade of White (Disney's Frozen)

- The Metropolitain Man (Superman)

- Shadows of the Limelight (original)

- The Dark Wizard of Donkerk (original)

- Instruments of Destruction (Star Wars oneshot)

- Glimwarden (original)

- A few other stories you can find on his blog (the Randi prize, the one with the teleportation accident, etc).

My favorite is The Metropolitain Man. That one is basically the fic you use as an example when you need to explain "what is rational fiction" to someone.

Otherwise, I'm not a fan of the Frozen fic and the MoR fics; I like The Last Christmas and the Terminator fic, but they're kind of... gimmicky? As in, I don't really feel like they have a deeper message, something meaningful to say. All the other fics I cited are great, and I recommend them. Glimwarden is in hiatus, the others are complete.
