If we're doing typos I have a few.

"If Henry could make it to the bridge ahead of Sofai" Sofia.

"The bulk of Ibrahim's mindscape was held in tunnels down beneath the sands, but Ibrahim knew little more than that." should that second Ibrahim be Rowan?

"He had begun to slow down when it collapse" should be collapsed.

“I can tell you what you saw, but I don't understand any of it.” what I saw?

"brown dog that they'd own" owned

"There can't be all that many destination" destinations

"there were hundreds of matter of utmost importance" matters of the utmost?

"There were two many of them" too

"Seventy years of oaths, and more power than most men could hope for in their lifetime, gone in an instant" Isn't it 50 years?

"Hirrush stepped out from beneath the eaves had hidden him, and approached the woman and the boy." Seems like you're missing a word here.

"Venter spun around and dealt the last of them a killing blow" Ventor

"Sofia was certain that she looked ridiculous in a shift and trousers" shirt

"he quietly slip the ledger back into its spot on the shelf." slipped

"The bulk of Ibrahim's mindscape was held in tunnels down beneath the sands, but Ibrahim knew little more than that." but Rowan knew

"no one would know that she was gone for hours, by which time she would be twenty or thirty miles from Marurbo" more like a day than hours but this is kind of pedantic.

"the Nethian output that became Marurbo" outpost?

  “Excuse me, said Sofia, but do you have a house spirit here?”
#+end_quote

missing quotation mark

#+begin_quote
  the only thing she had ever seen that was faster than Ventor was an arrow in flight. Ventor could move more quickly than every other point of comparison; he was faster than a river's rapids, he was faster than a falcon diving toward its prey,
#+end_quote

A falcon in a dive and an arrow in flight are roughly the same speed, but I suppose she could just be perceiving the arrow as faster.

#+begin_quote
  I'd ask that you not wander, so as not to disturb the other sister.”
#+end_quote

Did you mean "sisters" either works but I think the plural makes more sense in this context.

#+begin_quote
  She older than her years
#+end_quote

missing word between "She" and "older"

#+begin_quote
  The spirit of the Lenten River killed three oathkeeper,
#+end_quote

oathkeepers

#+begin_quote
  Rowan's claws hi the armor
#+end_quote

hit

Is Henry permanently barred from Sofia's mind?
