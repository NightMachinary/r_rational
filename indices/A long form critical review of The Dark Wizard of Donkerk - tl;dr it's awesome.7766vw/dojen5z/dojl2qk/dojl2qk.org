If you want my /personal/ ranking:

1. Dark Wizard of Donkerk
2. Glimwarden (incomplete)
3. Metropolitan Man ([[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-metropolitan-man-post-mortem.html][post-mortem]])
4. Shadows of the Limelight ([[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2016/01/shadows-of-limelight-post-mortem.html][post-mortem]])
5. Branches on the Tree of Time
6. The Last Christmas

That's ignoring shorter, single chapter things, or writing challenge responses, of which I think /Instruments of Destruction/ or /The Randi Prize/ are probably the best.
