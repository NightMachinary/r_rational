First off, I found DWoD a fantastic read; certainly one of the best rational fiction stories that I've come across.

Some minor criticisms I had (some of these were from a comment I made in an embedded thread a while back; reposting here where it's more relevant):

*WARNING: SPOILERS AHOY*

- I agree with OP's points on the title

- It would have helped to plant the seeds for Henry's unique personality earlier on. Besides a few scenes with his fathers (such as the discussion about going to work for the Sisters), we don't really get much insight into his character until the last third of the book. Maybe more conversations early on between himself and Nathan would help (which might also help illustrate why Henry's so drawn to the princess's intellect, if her answers and logic are more quick witted than the small-town friend he normally talks with)?

- The magic system was excellent; I liked the trifecta of dark-oath-mind magic, and how they (or at least, dark and oath) were just facets of the much deeper and more ancient spirit magic. However, there were a couple mentions to other types of magic (elementalists? eloists? denialists?) that I thought should be removed. From a worldbuilding perspective, including so many systems breaks Sanderson's Laws of Magic (not that these are hard and fast rules, but I think he has some good reasoning behind them), and from a logical perspective, if these magics are worth talking about, why are they never explored, or seen practiced by anyone in the entire kingdom?

- My biggest complaint was with the “savior” section of the prophecy, which never really made sense to me. As far as saving the princess, Harry probably contributed the least there - his father and Sister Marigold help way more than he does in the mentalist realms, and his other father and the princess's spirits do the heavy lifting in the physical realm. Plus, the princess ultimately ends up saving herself from the villain by her own power! What little fighting Harry does, heavily relies on Ulf-armor and Ventor's sword, not his own strength (plus, he's never shown to be much of a fighter anyway). Or, if “savior” refers to saving the kingdom, we'll never know, as the epilogue ends far too early for us to see if he'll actually have any positive impact.

- An interesting twist, I think, would be if the prophecy were rewritten in such a way that it could be interpreted for the /princess/ to actually be the savior. It's a cool multi-layered twist: she's her own “savior” (in that she saves herself from being killed by her brother), she's the kingdom's savior (in that she saves it from being ruled by a madman, and hopefully improves things with her logical mind and advice from the sages of sages), AND it inverts both classic hero-saving-princess tropes and protagonist-as-the-chosen-one tropes. Everyone expects Henry to be the savior - and its those expectations that pull him into the story in the first place - but he ultimately ends up a red herring, at least as far as the prophecy's concerned.

But again, all minor complaints. This is still my favorite Wales work, and I loved Metropolitan Man.
