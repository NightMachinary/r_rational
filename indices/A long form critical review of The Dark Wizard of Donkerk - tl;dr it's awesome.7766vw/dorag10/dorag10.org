I finally got around to reading this over the weekend, after [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5w9prq/the_dark_wizard_of_donkerk_alexander_wales_rthfc/de95qx2/][implying I would]] some 7 months ago. Incidentally, I didn't see any overt connection to The Dark Lord of Derkholm, at least not beyond the superficial, e.g. the general fantasy setting. Actually, I saw more of a resemblance to Gaiman's Stardust, which was also a vaguely episodic Bildungsroman with romance brewing between its two teenage protagonists. So there's some relation there at least (Gaiman and Jones were good friends, and I've always felt Stardust to be the most Jonesian of Gaiman's books).

Some scattered thoughts, comments, and criticisms, in no particular order:

  Speaking of Stardust -- and my memories here are plenty distorted, having read it last a decade ago in my teens -- I felt it to be a much more colorful and eventful story than Donkerk, whose main events can be summarized in a shorter handful of lines. But that's understandable, given how much longer Stardust was... except wait, Donkerk has 3.5x as many words. Puzzled at this (and with the above caveat), I think it's because Stardust doesn't aspire as deliberately towards internal consistency -- things happen on a much more ad hoc basis, which hints at a much deeper world underneath. However, given that Wales' imagination pales before the richness of the real world (no offense!), this greater internal consistency to me served partly to pull back the curtain and expose the shallowness of everything outside the main plot. While the focal characters seemed dynamic enough, the background seemed fairly generic, with hints of the broader world (e.g. guns, scheming royal sages, Nathan, etc.) falling a bit flat. It's sort of like if Stardust gives you a dozen puzzle pieces, and they're all different colors showing parts of different scenes, only you have but a vague inkling of how they fit together; Donkerk, meanwhile, gives you 50 pieces, and while there's plenty of variety you can tell roughly where they all go. But perhaps the comparison is unfair to make (given Gaiman's greater fame and different target audience).

  That said, I think I'd have still welcomed greater exploration of the nature of different superpower sources. Of the main ones (disregarding eloism, elementalism, and denialism, whatever those actually entail) it was ultimately revealed that oathkeeping, dark magic, spirit calling, and magic item use come from agreements made with the spirits -- but they're different spirits in each case? The oathkeeping spirits seem to care about personal sacrifice (it was suggested that greater temptation and resistance led to greater powers, but maybe that's not the case), but the dark magic spirits dgaf, since you can sacrifice others(‘ memories, lives, etc.) non-consensually. Personally, I'd have preferred dark magic to work in proportion to the caster's personal sacrifice and in relation to their personal effects (else why bother saving Henry's baby teeth? and not just acquire some elsewhere? convenience, I guess), though that's a bit more munchkinable given mentalist self-modification.

  And so, it was hard not to come up with possible experiments exploring easy paths to OPness by exploiting more the disparities in spirit values and typical human values. If spirits care enough about strands of hair to lend humans their power, could you find one that also cares about my promise to, say, never eat precisely than 1000.01kg of bread in a single day? If there's some minimum boon value then it should be trivial to take a hundred thousand oaths and reap their additive benefits. Additionally, can mentalism be used for recursive self-improvement? Can I sacrifice trivial memories? Can I make an oath to fast only during daylight hours, and how does it compare to an oath of never eating ever? (Ventor's oaths in particular seemed exceptionally ill thought-out, as were others' given implied attrition rates. Since they're trusted to not break their oaths anyway, why not trust them “act in the best interests of Sophia, but also weigh kingly request strongly” or something. Given the rigid wording of some of these commands/oaths it seems you'd quickly run into no-win scenarios).

  Prophecy likewise was pretty underexplored -- it motivates so much of the plot, but we just hear that it “had come crashing down”. So why do people trust it? Where does it come from? Does it happen often? Does it usually play out in the expected manner, or usually subvert expectation? Everybody seems to take it seriously enough, but my first guess would have been some bloke has happened upon a voice-projecting magic artefact and is playing silly buggers. And whatever prophetic spirit delivered it seems to care about an ababcdcd rhyming, but not so much metre (it's a bit clunky on my tongue read aloud, but that could well just be me)? Where the other magics felt integrated into the broader world, prophecy seemed more a plot device -- but not even deconstructed in an especially clever manner (I'm fond of the “satisfy the letter of the prophecy on your terms” trope -- so if your son is fated to kill you, do your best to love him deeply, raise him well, and invest strongly in competitive virtual reality video games).

  Also, when Henry and Sofia were fleeing Ventor, they changed their names well enough -- but not so much their appearances or demeanors? Passed through town alone at times? Feel they could have laid a more muddled trail that way.

  There were a good number of typos scattered throughout, but that's understandable given Donkerk's lack of beta readers/editor. Most of them involved the wrong name being used (e.g. the first line in the epilogue reads “Hirrush sat down on the bed beside Hirrush”, which, while possible in the mental realm, would imply a layering not yet introduced ;]). Sometimes words are doubled doubled (which is easy enough to correct). Other times I felt word choice a bit dodgy (e.g. reticent/reticence is used 2x as often as reluctant/reluctance, despite the latter being imo much [[http://grammarist.com/usage/reluctant-vs-reticent/][more appropriate]]). Overall though I found the writing to be technically quite good.

  I'm very partial to the “sometimes people are gay, but that doesn't mean it's the first thing worth mentioning about them” point regarding ambiguity in the Omarr and Hirrush relationship, and insofar as they are gay am certainly happy that they're not stereotypical flamboyant gay men, whose entire identities are wrapped around their love for loud clothing and cock. /However/, I think an uncharitable reader could draw from their depiction the message that it's ok to be gay so long as you never do anything to remotely indicate anything “icky” (assuming they weren't just meant to be aromantic/asexual life partners not fond of physical touch). I remember this criticism being levied against Dumbledore back when, but where his role in that story is “wise old wizard-mentor”, the nurturing relationship between Omarr and Hirrush is a fairly central focus of this one. And while plenty of intimacy, care, and commitment is implied, I don't recall ever reading about a single act of physical intimacy between them (even something as chaste as handholding). Maybe I just missed it. Regardless, while their lives shouldn't revolve around their gayness for each other, if they're at all neurotypical I'd still expect them to show a bit more affection, at least in the privacy of home.

  The last half of the story felt a bit rushed, compared to the slow burn of the first half. Which is odd, since the former takes place over orders of magnitude less time than the latter. Maybe I was just more aware of the time-skips since they were more connected -- where initially it flows from standalone scene to standalone scene, wrapping each one up before moving on, later it goes between connected parts of the same substory, e.g. Sofia resolving to rally the troops, and then immediately afterwards assaulting the castle (having already gathered various spirit allies). I would have liked to see that gathering!

  I liked the characters overall, and was especially pleased when e.g. the chekhov's badass grandmas were fired (Marigold and Constance). Henry and Sofia were both quite pleasant, and their repartee enjoyable, and I wish there were a bit more of it (e.g. re: the ethics of non-human animal slaughter for meat consumption, though I'm a bit biased there, as my generic exclusion might imply ;] it's also hard not to imagine the arguments I could give for various positions they discussed and read theirs dissatisfied). I think Henry could have done with more explicit flaws (e.g. instead of being “impossibly charming”, give him poor social skills, make him stumble over his words; instead of giving him so many practical talents, from “expert foraging” to “incapacitating most full grown men with [his] bare hands”, make him bookish but only to the extent that his meager resources would allow; instead of him denying his fathers' pseudoimpartiality, have his cold, robotic heart by melted by Sofia's competent compassion). His development would have had a bit more room to work with, then. I guess it's realistic that he be so Gary-Stu-ish, given eidetic memory, supernatural emotional control, etc. So I guess it would be good to do away with some of those aspects altogether (plus, if “for a mentalist it was nothing to simply keep a copy of sensitive material in the mind instead of on paper” I'd expect society to be rather dramatically different, even if most people have hard limits w.r.t. the flashiest mentalist powers. Perfect memory would I imagine drastically accelerate rates of technological progress, say, and be one of the first things to learn if not tabooed).
