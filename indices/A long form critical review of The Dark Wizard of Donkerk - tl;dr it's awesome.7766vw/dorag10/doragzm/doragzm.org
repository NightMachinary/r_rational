  Would Rowan become a good guy were it not for his father's negligence and emotionally abusive parenting style (repressed anger at Ariel's infidelity?), coupled with Ibrahim's less-than-upstanding influence? Was he just starved for some morsel of human decency and attention the whole time? It's mentioned that he “cut off a bird's wing just to see what would happen”, but color me unsympathetic, since animals are killed violently throughout this entire book, including by e.g. Henry, and the pleasure of satisfied curiosity seems if anything more wholesome a motivation than the pleasure of meat. Obviously Rowan disrespects human autonomy often enough later on, but if e.g. Aldric were less an asshole would have grown differently? I was half-expecting a Peter Wiggin scenario to play out for much of the book.

  I agree with OP that reading it on alexanderwales.com is pretty obnoxious, but it only took a minute to convert it to epub and toss it on an e-reader, which made everything much smoother. It was quite convenient that everything was one big text -- no webscraping required!

Annnnyyyyway, those were some of the thoughts I had while reading this thing. I feel they tended towards the negative, so I should emphasize that they were not representative! and I really did quite enjoy this story and had a lovely time making my way through it. Big thanks to the author for putting it out there! Any critical bits above are not to be taken too seriously, unless wishing to cater specifically to my tastes alone! Hopefully there's a sequel or two forthcoming eventually! I'd love to keep reading about Henry's and Sofia's adventures, travels, and world-fixing machinations.
