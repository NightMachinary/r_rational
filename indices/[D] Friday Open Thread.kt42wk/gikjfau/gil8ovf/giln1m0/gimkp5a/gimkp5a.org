That's a big JP site for indie works. 400,000 novels over less than 2 decades is decent, although I'm assuming its counting the 95% of works that are unfinished in that number.

To be honest, I'm assuming the onslaught of trashy publishrd novels coming out of Asia is just a product of what media formats are popular rather than any inherent result of capacity for quality. I mean how many shitty reality tv shows come out in Western countries? Between the economies of scale factors and people growing comfortable with a particularly accessible media format and/or genre, I figure its just how the avenues for creators have ended up.

Also there's probably a larger audience for "western"/English stuff than any specific Asian country's works, because language barriers and internet access, meaning there's more accumulated energy, money and refinement thrown at the Western stuff. The more feedback on and resources in a medium/community the faster that medium/community can grow past awkwardness.
