I believe the commercial incentives are definitely poison. And there isn't anything inherently bad about cliches, just /do something/ with them. Or the characters. It's honestly criminal to me that I'm The Main Character Of A Harem Manga, But I'm Gay So Every Day Is Hell For Me didn't get picked up for a year or two.

The reclusive safe space where nothing bad ever happens to the MC, the MC is special, and everybody loves everybody else and gets along just great... *that* is the core poison in their scene. 100% conflict aversion. I get that "sad" thoughts aren't the kind people like to dwell on...

It's just weird that I can't think of anything non-shonen that's a huge franchise with a protagonist-shaped ball of mayonnaise as its lead or zero conflict. Evangelion was supposed to be a deconstruction of these old tropes, decades ago. Madoka Magica is nothing *but* suffering. Konosuba's protagonist is a wonderfully accurate and realistic reflection of the fans that like this stuff, an actual caricature of a person who actually exists, rather than an imaginary mayonnaise person that could never exist.

The Korean scene seems more aligned with our tastes on the whole.
