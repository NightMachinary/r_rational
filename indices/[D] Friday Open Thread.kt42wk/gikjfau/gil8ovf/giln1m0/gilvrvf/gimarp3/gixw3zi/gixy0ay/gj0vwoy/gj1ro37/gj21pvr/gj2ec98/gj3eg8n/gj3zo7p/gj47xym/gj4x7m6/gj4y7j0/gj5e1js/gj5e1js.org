At what point does it become a semantics discussion? To me it's measurable, humans can rate it and by their ratings we can fairly accurately tell it's quality as far as current human perceptions go.

If you think an average distribution of people isn't good enough to judge quality, then the test could be subdivided by level of education, specific degrees, income level etc. Then we could easily compare them and see if there are meaningful differences, what those are and decide whose opinions are the 'best' or most accurate.

An authors general intelligence level is, imho, very highly correlated to the quality of the content (s)he can produce. If you look at IQ research you'll see that in general it doesn't just apply to math or test scores, it tends to correlate to a lot of things we'd generally not expect like musical ability, language capacity, learning speed, painting ability etc.

You might say that then IQ doesn't measure intelligence, but then we get back to that semantics thing..
