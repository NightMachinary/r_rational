I was going to point out that we westerners are very eurocentric and that people in china, india and the middle east were doing similar things at the time, but most people ignore it.

You make some very strong conclusions from what less than two actual exceptions? Which btw I'll get to shortly.

To get to your points, there's a limit to how intelligent humans can get before it becomes counterproductive.

Most artists, philosophers and the like become famous or relevant posthumously.

Have you actually read many classic works? They aren't that good compared to what we have today (specially in writing). What we find good today is great when compared to things from even just one century ago, because people build on top of what others built before them. Meaning art gets better overtime.

This also implies that artists that aren't experiencing this innovation and development at an equal rate as those that are find themselves less likely to be able to innovate than those that do. Which BTW explains away ancient Athens, 15th century Italy and virtually any example you can come up with before consistent high speed communications were set up, but even still those that have to wait for translations get behind.

Of course authors in close proximity to the people that innovated would have the chance to build on top of what the best works at the time were. Specially when others far away would need to wait years to even hear about the innovations that were first made.
