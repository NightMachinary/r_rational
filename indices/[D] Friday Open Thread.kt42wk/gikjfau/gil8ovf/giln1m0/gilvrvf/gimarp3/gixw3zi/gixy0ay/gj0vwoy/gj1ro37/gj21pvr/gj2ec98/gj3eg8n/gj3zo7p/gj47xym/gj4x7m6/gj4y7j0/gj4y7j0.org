That doesn't really make sense. If you're getting people to judge those things, you're involving audiences and gauging their reaction. You're just breaking it up in little pieces, now, but that's not removing the subjectivity, merely obfuscating it. Their judgement will /still/ be largely affected by their culture and expectations. It will still be biased towards things they understand and can relate to.

Of course, you can implement this system. It's what review sites do, after all, though more sophisticated. It will probably also give a good measure of something like the probability of a certain work gaining acclaim and success in the current culture - which /is/ a well defined quantity. But that's not a measure of the "quality" of art. It's merely a market research. The fundamental problem is that the "quality" of art is an ill-defined quantity; it doesn't mean anything at all! Everyone is going to have their own sense of what it is, that's what makes it impossible to measure objectively. Basically, it's like asking "give me a number for the mass of the proton" without specifying the unit of measure. I can say "43" and be right by definition, because in my system, I'm using units of mass that are each 1/43 of the mass of the proton.

Also, remember that the original post was about intelligence or skill of the authors themselves. But intelligence or skill do not correlate directly with your metric unless an artist sets out /specifically/ with the goal of being a crowd pleaser, in which case, sure, they'll maximise your metric to the greatest extent of their ability. But most artists don't set out to do that at all.
