  If you're going to go 'all art is equally valuable just to different people' and 'there's no way of defining, rating or categorizing it by quality', then that's that. We've different base assumptions about reality, which interestingly it's also what political differences break down into.

I'm generally a reductionist too, but I don't see how can you possibly define "absolute" standards of any sort for art. Sciences deal with our understanding of the phenomena of nature; in that sense, nature is our impartial arbiter for any and all scientific discovery. That's why we perform experiments; any theory needs to be measured against how well it predicts the behaviour of nature.

With art, the aim is to communicate to other humans. Art in a vacuum - e.g., the Mona Lisa ejected in the interstellar void of a Universe without intelligent life - is meaningless. Art is a medium of communication. If you want to define a purpose to it, it is "to elicit emotions or transmit thoughts and ideas to certain humans". Possibly in a /majority/ of humans, but given the concept of a target audience, which can be a niche minority one (we should know well in this subreddit), not necessarily even that. So I have a model human in my mind that is "my audience", and my goal as an artist is to convey certain feelings to them as well as possible. And that's even discounting the possibility that instead my goal might be to simply /express/ myself, regardless of who understands me or not. At best, you could argue, a good artist is one who has a (conscious or intuitive) understanding of the interplay of human psychology, culture and so on that their works will mostly succeed at achieving exactly what they /want/ them to achieve - which may be to please as well as to disgust, anger, or bore, depending on one's objective, though the latter aren't that common.

Now, let's consider the issue of comparing art from very different historical eras. In 2020, a scriptwriter sets down with the objective of writing a movie script that will move, excite and enrapture people all around the world, and ultimately win him the Academy Awards. In 460 BC, Euripides sits down with the objective of writing a tragedy that will move, excite and enrapture the free citizens of Athens, and ultimately win him the Dionyisian games. Which one is the better artist?

We could take the movie, re-enact the tragedy, put them both in front of a modern audience, and see which one is most liked and appreciated. If we did it this way, it's all but guaranteed that if the movie isn't positively awful, and the audience isn't hand-picked among literature historians, the movie will win. But that's a bit unfair to Euripides. Euripides didn't set his skills to conveying his message to /us/ - he had a completely different audience in mind! It's like saying I'm a bad programmer because you can't run my software on your Windows PC, ignoring the fact that my software is a binary compiled for Linux. But then again, we can't go back in time to check Euripides' audience or show them the movie, because, well, they're all dead. And they would hate the movie anyway (possibly run in fear from it, in fact). All we can do is look up what we know about the reactions. In that sense, if Euripides consistently achieved victory in the Dionyisian games and gained great acclaim, we might consider him roughly an equal of the scriptwriter if he too consistently achieves victory in the Academy Awards. But it's a very rough comparison. It's unlikely they are orders of magnitude far apart from each other, because both are acknowledged by their peers as extremely skilled but neither's work produces supernaturally powerful effects - at best, it gets people moved to tears and clapping loudly, and that's about it. Would Euripides have been able to write for an audience of millions or billions rather than thousands? Well, who knows? But we don't have a good reason to rule it out; after all, modern culture is also overall more homogeneous, which is why people from very disparate lands can all watch the same superheroes beat up each other and have fun with them. We share a lot of tropes and codified knowledge.

So basically this is my point. I don't think it's contrary to the principles of reductionism. I think trying to establish a ranking between artists is a fool's errand not because there aren't objective differences, but because time erased all possibilities of drawing direct comparisons, and in general, not all artists are even trying to do the same thing, so it's an apple and oranges comparison more often than not. I would also note that the idea that there was an absolute canon of beauty to stick to was prevalent for a lot of the history of Western art - that canon being exactly the one set in antiquity - and if anything, it stifled creativity and vitality in the arts for a long time. Modernity was defined by the moment in which artists really went "you know what, fuck those Greeks/Romans" and started doing their own thing. While this has not necessarily always led to great results, it certainly has led to a lot of innovation.
