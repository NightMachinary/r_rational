Now that you mention it, that's very plausible. English is definitely the most important and prominent language, that I'm certain most intelligent or intellect-seeking people would learn. My parents grew up poor in China and always told me that I'm so lucky to be able to live in America, that America is the land of opportunity, and so on. Fits in with the concept of the American Dream too I'd imagine, with people seeking education, opportunity, and wealth all studying English and aiming to live in America. Or perhaps this all just my American-bias speaking.
