  IMHO One of the potential causes we see so little translated works be good is that people anywhere with a high enough intelligence level will given the chance choose to consume and create content in english.

By this logic you wouldn't have foreign literatures. It doesn't make much sense, each country is full of its own creators, some good, some bad. And writing in a language you're not a native speaker of doesn't come easily or natural to everyone (I should know...). If anything you could see light novels closer to fanfiction: in many cases, if you're good enough, you might start asking yourself if it wouldn't make more sense to go one step further, aim for a more "respectable" literary career and thus leave the art form to amateurs. The big difference is that fanfiction isn't publishable because of copyright issues and LNs are. But hey, we STILL got "50 shades of grey", which was fanfiction with just the names changed. Anime LN adaptations are like if TV networks made a really successful "50 shades" show and then decided to go dig into everything else and now we had a massive "My Immortal" serial.
