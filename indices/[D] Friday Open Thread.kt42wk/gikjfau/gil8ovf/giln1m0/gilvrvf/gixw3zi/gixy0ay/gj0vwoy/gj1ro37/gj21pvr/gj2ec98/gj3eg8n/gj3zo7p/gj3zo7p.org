My points also include the fact that the hubs were a function of distance and communication delay, rather than culture or race. I guess you'd agree with that.

Ultimately my theory implies a more egalitarian distribution of art, explains it's absence / rarity in some areas without implying inherent superiorities or inferiorities in people or cultures. That's valuable imho, and likely more accurate at explaining reality than what's currently available.

I'm a bit of a reductionist, many people in this sub are. Our discussion breaks down if you reject the notion things can be better, it's what my initial point was.

If you're going to go 'all art is equally valuable just to different people' and 'there's no way of defining, rating or categorizing it by quality', then that's that. We've different base assumptions about reality, which interestingly it's also what political differences break down into.
