Yes, in the sense that if you're looking for someone world class in writing, then it's more likely that they'll emerge from a population of one billion than from one of ten million. But first, for something like this there's multiple cultural factors at play, because a small population might produce a disproportionate amount of writers if the environment is especially culturally fertile (consider how many writers and philosophers were produced in the space of a mere century in ancient Athens, which had only something like 40k male free citizens - slaves and women being ineligible for literary fame at the time). Second, there is no perfect objective metric of what constitutes "good writing", but even if we could establish that for example Writer A, English mothertongue, is overall better than Writer B, Italian, it is still entirely possible that B will be more appealing to other Italians due to writing e.g. things that are more relatable or relevant to their interests. By the way I'm not making the comparison by chance, as I'm Italian myself, and interestingly, I can tell you we have a lot more writers tackling that sort of realistic setting than we do fantasy or sci-fi writers, genres which indeed tend to be more easily "international".

In other words, it's wrong to paint this as a matter of who's better and who's worse, or what's more successful and what's not. It's instead a matter of niches. My objectives as a writer could be various, but there is no such thing as "wanting to be the Best Writer in the World". If I wanted to make a living with my writing, I'd consider my own strength and weaknesses; one might have better luck for example writing in their own mother tongue and aiming for a smaller but safer public than trying to strike it big worldwide but competing with a comparatively larger market.
