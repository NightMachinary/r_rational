  Greece, and Athens in general was likely at the time one of, if not the area with the highest number of people that were literate. Meaning if there were good writers they'd very likely come from there.

Well, at least in that part of the world. China says hi. But regardless of that, today pretty much EVERYONE is literate, and would you expect even just three major writers like Aeschilus, Sophocles and Euripides, AND three major philosophers like Socrates, Plato and Aristoteles, to all emerge from any average 40k inhabitants town in the space of 60 years? We're talking the kind of people we still talk about and study 2500 years later, though I guess one could argue that there was more low hanging fruit even in the arts at the time. The point I'm making is, your "brute force" argument of more people = more rolls of the dice = more chances of someone emerging from the long tail of the distribution would imply that today there should be literary geniuses born at a rate thousands of times higher than in a past in which not only the world was less populated, but most of it was illiterate. And while sure, the overall artistic production has much increased in volume, the proportional /quality/ of it doesn't really hold the comparison. We don't have today someone you could honestly say is a thousand times better than Homer, than Virgil or Dante Alighieri. By which I'm not saying that the arts are declining either; just that the best tend to be more or less as good as they were back then. And my point was, IMO what really matters is not some sort of talent you're born with and that follows a typical probability distribution, the bottleneck is the development of potential. It takes a lot of stars aligning to get an environment that fosters great art, but when that happens (Athens in the 5th century BC, Florence in the 15th century AD, Paris at the beginning of the 20th century, and so on), then a lot of people with potential get their chance to bloom. And for that reason, language isn't all that important and there's great writers all over the world. Because people /with the potential/ to be a great writer are common enough that even a country of ten million will have many every generation; all that matters is when and how that potential is unlocked and allowed to flourish.
