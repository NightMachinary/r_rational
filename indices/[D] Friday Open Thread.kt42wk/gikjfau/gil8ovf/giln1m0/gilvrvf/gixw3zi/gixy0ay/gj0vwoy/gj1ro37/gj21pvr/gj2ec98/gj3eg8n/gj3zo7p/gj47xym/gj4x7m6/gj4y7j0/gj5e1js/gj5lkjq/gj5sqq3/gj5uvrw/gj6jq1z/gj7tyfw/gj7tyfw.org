  We could with enough interest find a proper highly accurate method for measuring quality of art, but it's not really something to be done in a short comment.

I would be really curious to see what that looks like.

In the end, I see it as a foundational problem. "Measurement" always implies comparison of something to something else. If you are trying to measure a length, you are saying how that quantity compares to some standard - be it a platinum-iridium alloy bar stored at SÃ©vres or the distance that light travels in the time it takes for half of a bunch of excited cesium nuclei to decay in your rest frame, it doesn't matter. It's a standard. Nature is one, and you are always comparing your results with nature. Because nature is consistent and singular, that provides an absolute reference.

Art is a human construct, made by humans, for humans. To nature, art is nothing; there is no special property in the pattern of atoms that make up a copy of "To Kill A Mockingbird" compared to the pattern that make up a copy of "Twilight". If there was, we'd have something like magic, where human words and symbols can summon up natural effects. To understand art, it takes a human. If you do pick a certain human, at a certain moment in their life, then certainly the amount of enjoyment or stimulation they would get from certain works of art should have a definite ranking. But even then, the measurement difficulties are intrinsic to the process; if you wanted to compare two works, A and B, reading A first would change the human, and thus affect their interpretation of B; vice versa if you had them read B before A. This sort of error is implicit in the process itself; to have even the same human in the same state rate two different works of art is a counterfactual. But admittedly similar problems exist with a lot of natural experiments too, so we can at least go and assume that reading them in sequence is a decent approximation.

But if you start trying to decree an /absolute/ value, then all this breaks down. Because unless you can give a good reason to explain why some humans are more special or better than others at defining this, any sort of ranking system, no matter how contrived, will still depend on /some/ degree of subjectivity. And while an average taken over the entirety of humanity is theoretically possible, if unfeasible, and could be replaced by a well enough chosen statistical sample, when it comes to comparing present and past works (and thus the skill of present and past artists), we can't even do that; the relevant information has been lost as everyone from that time is now dead and dust. To me it feels like you were saying "well, Heisenberg's indetermination principle notwithstanding, all we need to do is to measure position and momentum with more precision!". You're failing to see how these quantities aren't just difficult to measure for practical reasons, they are /intrinsically/ impossible to measure together, because in practice you're asking the wrong question to begin with.
