I do agree that things are subjective and exceptions exist, if this was a doctorate thesis instead of a quick comment I would have brought those up..

I do have a few caveats though. Greece, and Athens in general was likely at the time one of, if not the area with the highest number of people that were literate. Meaning if there were good writers they'd very likely come from there.

Keep in mind the only real difference Greece had at the time from the rest of europe was the fact that it was the closest and therefore the first area to get exposed to the relatively new invention that was writing (and technically civilization in general). They were the ones that spread the alphabet to most of europe.

The Greek city states were also the first large city centers in europe, and it's safe to assume most farmers or hunter gatherers don't really have much free time to be doing thought experiments, recording events or to do math.

Fair comparisons using population numbers get more accurate as more people have access to education and in general similar starting points. It still works somewhat in strange scenarios like the planet +2k years ago but you tend to get weird results that require extra analysis. If we compare City state Greeks with hunter gatherer tribes in Germany there's an implicit understanding that things will be unfair as far as their artistic outputs will be.

It works now when most people are educated and literate. But if for instance tomorrow a country instated universal basic income they'd have an inherent advantage to their artistic output until other countries followed along.

PS. If you want to be a writer, I'd recommend reading War of Art. Recommended it yesterday on the rec thread. You can check my comment there if you're interested.

PPS. My ancestors were from Italy, from a region called 'Facio'. Hence my last name Fassina.
