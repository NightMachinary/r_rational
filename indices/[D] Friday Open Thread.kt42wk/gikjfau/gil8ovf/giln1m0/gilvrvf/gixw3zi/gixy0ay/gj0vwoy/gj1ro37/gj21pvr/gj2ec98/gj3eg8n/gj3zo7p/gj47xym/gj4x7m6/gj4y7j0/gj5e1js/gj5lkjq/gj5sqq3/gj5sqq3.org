That is true, I agree that's why I didn't say guaranteed, or is always better. Assuming most serious artists are interested in producing works that others will appreciate and like, then likely most of them will produce works that fit general human preferences.

But yes an artist could create something incredible that only her or very few people would appreciate and to them it'd be great. That's possible, I'm not saying it isn't.

There are exceptions to almost any qualification or measurement system, that doesn't mean attempts at measuring are impossible, pointless or hold no value.
