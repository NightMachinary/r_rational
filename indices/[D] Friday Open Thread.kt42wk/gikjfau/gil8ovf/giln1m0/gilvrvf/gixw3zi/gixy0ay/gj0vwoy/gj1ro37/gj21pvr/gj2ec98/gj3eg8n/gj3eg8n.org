  To get to your points, there's a limit to how intelligent humans can get before it becomes counterproductive.

My problem is with reducing creativity in the arts to something like a single axis. I think it's way too reductive. An Ancient Greek would not enjoy /our/ art right off the bat because there's no better or worse, it's more about being in tune with your audience.

  Have you actually read many classic works? They aren't that good compared to what we have today (specially in writing). What we find good today is great when compared to things from even just one century ago, because people build on top of what others built before them. Meaning art gets better overtime.

I've read a few, including extracts in their original language. I agree with your point about innovation, but I think that's not a matter of art getting “better” in an intrinsic manner. Rather, the modern writer has a vaster toolset that they know the modern reader will relate to. Modern art is more varied as a result. But about being better... If you could bring back in time a fully armed modern battalion, you'd win any war. If you could bring back your favourite modern novel, odds are no one would “get it”. That's why I say it's not a linear thing. Ancient art is simpler, but because it also existed for an overall simpler society.

  Of course authors in close proximity to the people that innovated would have the chance to build on top of what the best works at the time were. Specially when others far away would need to wait years to even hear about the innovations that were first made.

Sure, that was my point too. That the rate at which great artists emerge isn't a function of population as much as of the formation of innovation hubs which reach past a critical mass (and said hubs today don't even have to be /physical/ anymore).
