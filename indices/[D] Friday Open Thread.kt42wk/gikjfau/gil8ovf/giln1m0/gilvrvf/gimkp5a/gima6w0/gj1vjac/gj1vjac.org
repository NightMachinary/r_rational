As an avid watcher of harem garbage I have to offer some small resistance.

The charm of the "turn of your mind" atmosphere of these stories is not actually that you get to turn off your mind. Its that you /mostly/ get to turn off your mind. See, the trick of doing harem garbage successfully isn't to throw women at your protagonist in an appropriately light-toned color pallette. Its to shrink the pace to such an imperceptible extent that the viewer barely notices that things are happening.

Take the recent /Hensuki: Are You Willing to Fall in Love With a Pervert, As Long As She`s a Cutie?/ anime. Its quintessential harem garbage, with an entire episode devoted to repetitive gags of the girls visiting the protagonist's home to have him pet one like a dog or be tied up by the other. You can just waste hours of your life adoring the simplicity of it all. And yet before you know it the story suddenly becomes a well-told romance for the side character Koharu. Its not so much that its new or exceptional as that, /in relative terms/ the shift is so effective that it takes you along with it. Its an art form to softly lead your reader or viewer to see your characters at what feels like an apex of their potential. Its even better if you can succeed at that balancing act of making something beautiful or astonishing seem perfectly normal and unserious.

I don't think its an isolated phenomena. /OreShura/ is a classic in this strain which ended with an unusually passionate harem route. There's /HxH/, which morphed from being the cringiest pseudo-hentai into a low-key meditation on Aine's soul. Of course some do it explicitly with semi-serious stories, like /Maburaho/ which takes a whiplash change of pace, but its the same idea- its one of the best I've seen.
