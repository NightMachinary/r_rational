  Of course it's also possible japan has a thriving indie webnovel/webcomic scene full of original, avant garde works which simply don't get translated

It's certainly possible but probably not likely. If they ever made something like MoL it'd be the best thing of the decade and be everywhere with hundreds of loop stories popping up for years afterwards.

​

IMHO One of the potential causes we see so little translated works be good is that people anywhere with a high enough intelligence level will given the chance choose to consume and create content in english.

​

This leads to a drop in the quality of the content produced there and a boost to the overhaul quality of EN works in general..

​

It could be me projecting, but take for instance my country. 200kk people, more than England and Germany combined and I've seen no good stories coming out of here virtually ever.

​

Why ? Because if you're intelligent enough you learn the current trade / intellectual language and use it instead.
