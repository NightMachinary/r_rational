Assuming this is more complex than the likely "Microphone in a boombox" scenario:

- A hopefully intuitive understanding of internal biases and motivations. I'm imagining something like Paul's sense of his desires in With This Ring after he becomes enlightened

- With practice, an easier way to change your mind with evidence; It might not make it easy, but if you have a ladle stuck in a drawn it'll be easier to get it out if you a glass countertop.

- In a scenario with more fictional powers, like subtle mind control or other telepaths, being able to recognize foreign interference would be a big bonus
