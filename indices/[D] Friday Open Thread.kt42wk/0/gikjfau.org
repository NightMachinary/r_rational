So the "So I'm a Spider, So What?" anime has just released episode 1, and it's looking quite optimistic, apart from the more egregious CGI frog. Especially the opening chock-full of light novel spoilers, oh my. Had me smiling like a buffoon after waiting for it for almost 3 years.

I'm a huge fan of the series, as it's essentially the only straightforward isekai that isn't a complete mess. Every element and plot device in the story has a purpose, sometimes even 8-9 volumes later, without feeling like an ass-pull or coming out of nowhere. It's what I consider the perfect isekai, although it requires a lot of knowledge and background in isekai to fully appreciate what it does. It's the most rational of all the isekais I've seen with a highly competent MC(comedy aside), although I will admit that is a very low bar to surpass.

There's a lot of other amazing and competent anime series coming out this season too like Re:Zero S2 Part 2 and Attack on Titan S4, all of which I'm excited for.
