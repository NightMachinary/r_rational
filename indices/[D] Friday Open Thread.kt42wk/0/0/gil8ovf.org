All I'm planning to watch this season is Spider and Mushoku tensei.. I enjoy spider, but I've only read the manga and I must say after that demon king and now this new arc, where it seems she'll be involving herself with human matters, have lowered my interest on it substantially.

​

Mushoku Tensei is a bit of a popcorn read I've done and eventually dropped years ago. The author is definitely a discovery writer that doesn't really have a plan. It's very much a 'this story isn't going anywhere, what should I do? ... Oh! I know I'll teleport everyone to a dangerous continent and see what happens'.

​

The author had to pull a portal fantasy inside a portal fantasy just to add a plot to his follow along story, how crazy is that? *inserts comments on lack of creativity, and plot formulation skills* And this is one of the most successful and highly rated webnovels from japan.

​

It's interesting as a study on how bad an author can be and still be successful. Although if you can't stand the usual loli harem nonsense commonly seen in japanese works it's a definite pass.

​

But I must say my overhaul impression and expectation for any japanese novel / manga have been fairly low in the last couple years. It annoys me how good novels on RR many made by amateurs are all virtually better than anything I've seen japan produce in a long time that isn't a comedy..
