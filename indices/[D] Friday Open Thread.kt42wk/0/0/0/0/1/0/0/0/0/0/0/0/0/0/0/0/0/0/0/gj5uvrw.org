  Assuming most serious artists are interested in producing works that others will appreciate and like

But I think that is not just an exception, that is /regularly/ wrong. The most broadly appreciated movies - in terms of sheer numbers - are not high art movies, they're Marvel blockbusters. The most appreciated literature isn't Nobel Prize winning novels, it's stuff like Harry Potter. When it comes to the history of art, it's absolutely full of creators now considered geniuses who in their time were met with sneer or were ignored as too obscure or weird for the common taste. So either you make a serious argument that Harry Potter is a better novel than Joyce's Ulysses or even Dante's Divine Comedy (after all, today, more people read it and like it), or you decide to hand pick your jury, which is just an oblique way of putting your own bias and spin on the evaluation.
