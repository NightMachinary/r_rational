Except statistically countries / languages with higher population are going to again 'statistically' have a higher number (not percentage) of highly intelligent or talented or whatever attribute you deem important to the creation of art.

Meaning we should, all things being equal, see languages that have a higher number of speakers produce a higher number of 'great works'.

Nations with higher populations produce a higher total number of scientific discoveries and innovations...

It's like the most beautiful women in a small town, in a big city she might just be considered pretty or cute, simply because of the total number of people involved. In a way the literature scenes of such small countries likely suffer the same fate.

In their home country it might be great to the 40kk people that live there and speak that language, but it might be just above average to an english speaker.
