We can measure human experience, there are entire scientific fields built around that fact. I don't see how the experience humans have from art can't be measured, it's surely been done before with music and other mediums.

There's no need to measure everything that could be considered art ever. There's going to be a cut off, maybe it's published works or finished works, but it's going to exist. If some piece of art can't be measured because it's been made inaccessible then it doesn't get measured. For a measurement to be useful it doesn't need to account for 100% of things.

  Information theory recognises that all data are inexact and statistical in nature. Thus the definition of measurement is: "A set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity."[20] This definition is implied in what scientists actually do when they measure something and report both the mean and statistics of the measurements. In practical terms, one begins with an initial guess as to the expected value of a quantity, and then, using various methods and instruments, reduces the uncertainty in the value. Note that in this view, unlike the positivist representational theory, all measurements are uncertain, so instead of assigning one value, a range of values is assigned to a measurement. This also implies that there is not a clear or neat distinction between estimation and measurement.

The book I talked about goes more in depth but the wiki page does a decent job. The goal of a measurement isn't necessarily to get to a perfect map of reality, an approximation is enough if it gives you an advantage at making predictions of future outcomes.

By measuring you could for instance predict what type of audience would like something, or what would be best to consume given the fact that time is limited, what would be best to consume depending on what your current goal is, for instance when having a date, dinner party, or spending time with friends..
