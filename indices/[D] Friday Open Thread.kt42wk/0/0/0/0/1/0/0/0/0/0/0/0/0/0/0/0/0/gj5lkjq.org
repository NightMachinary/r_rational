My point is more, if an author with high intelligence (measure it with IQ or whatever) set out to write an highly experimental novel that uses partially made up language, nonlinear narrative, and a number of other oddities, they may succeed in their goal, but the result may be so obscure and weird most people would NOT like it. Intelligence may allow you to better achieve your objectives, but if your objective is not "produce a work of art that rates highly on the Fassina Scale of Art Quality", then it might rate very poorly even if the artist is perfectly satisfied with it and has achieved exactly what they set out to do.
