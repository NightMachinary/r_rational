Quantum mechanics isn't the best example, but the point is that Heisenberg's principle isn't just a measurement error, it's intrinsic to the maths of the theory. In order to surpass it you'd need to find some sort of deeper, "more true" theory than quantum mechanics that completely goes beyond it. With QM as it is, it's as unavoidable as the speed limit c in relativity.

(by the way I agree on the correct interpretation of QM probably being deterministic, but again, unless we go beyond QM altogether that can only be accomplished by postulating hidden variables, and the indetermination remains)

But regardless of this, you keep talking about it as if it were a matter of just making measurements better, when my point was that the question itself is ill-defined. Particles governed by Schroedinger's equation don't have distinct position and momentum /because they're not little balls/, the kind of thing that would have distinct position and momentum. And works of art don't have an absolute worth independent of people /because they don't work like that/; what we rate when we rate art is the /experience/ it produces, and the experience emerges from the interaction between the object-art (the book, the movie, the picture) and the subject-person who takes it in and interprets it. For an extreme example: if I wrote a novel, then encrypted it with a would-take-multiple-times-the-age-of-the-universe-to-crack strong algorithm and threw away the decryption key, would that novel be good or bad? You couldn't possibly tell, because no one could read it. It would be functionally indistinguishable from a random string of symbols.
