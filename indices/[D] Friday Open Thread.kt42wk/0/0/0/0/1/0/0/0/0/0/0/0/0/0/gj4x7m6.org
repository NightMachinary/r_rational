I believe everything can be quantified, and sorted by virtually any reasonable applicable metric.

If to rate art we need to rate it by it's individual components and give it than average that number out to get an overhaul score that's perfectly reasonable.

I wouldn't compare things by showing it to two audiences and gauging their reaction. I'd show it to a large number of people have them rate the subparts deemed most relevant to that particular type of art, then I'd average that number and sort it.

The authorial intent, target audience, and goals don't come into account. For instance a story, you'd rate the plot, characterization, pacing, prose, themes, execution etc. Average those numbers out with lot's of other 'reviewers', then average the overhaul score out and you'd get a rating for that work.

It might not be perfect, or objectively correct, but it's a good enough approximation of reality for most purposes. Meaning it's been sorted and ranked. This is something possible to do, so in my view art can be sorted, ranked and compared.
