The problem to me seems to be how we define measurements, and how correct they have to be before they start being useful. I'd recommend checking out the book 'How to Measure Anything', at least the initial parts where he defines measurements. How surprisingly accurate and able to predict outcomes they are.

We'll never know some specific things from the past, unless some insane technological development happens, so we can either measure how people feel about it know and reduce the weight on the accuracy in those reviews or just add an addendum like 'measurements unavailable for it's contemporary audience'.

It's the best we're ever going to have, as far as we know. If we don't measure now people in the future will have the same problem with our art.

We don't need 100% accuracy to start with. Our measurement methods can be optimized as we go. Your view would be like physicists going 'oh there's uncertainty in quantum mechanics as far as we know with our current equipment. No point in studying it further, trying to measure it with better equipment or using different methods. Our measurements will not be perfect, so why bother'.

PS. Just last year scientists were able to measure quantum leaps and surprise, surprise! Matter doesn't just teleport, it transitions from one energetic state to another gradually. Our previous methods simple weren't able to see it happen.

PPS. I believe in the future quantum mechanics will lose a large percentage of it's apparent randomness.
