That's what rating individual parts is supposed to fix. The plot in a marvel movie is likely simple and shallow so it'd get a low score on that, which would bring it's overhaul score down. Characterization isn't particularly strong either..

But yes no measurement is perfect or 100% accurate. The point of that silly measurement method was to show that quality is measurable, and comparable. You just did it. Accepting that means it can be quantified and measured, and that it'd likely follow some logical distribution formula.

We could with enough interest find a proper highly accurate method for measuring quality of art, but it's not really something to be done in a short comment.
