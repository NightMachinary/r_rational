It seems to me the problem is that every webnovel or lightnovel or manga creator in japan is desperately trying to get picked up as an anime. So they're all replete with every single stupid, obnoxious trope that exists in popular works , like boob envy, cute critter companion, hair color== personality, incest tension, yanderes, tsunderes, non-emoting==cool, feckless harem lead, neet isekai, and so on and so on. It is basically the ultimate commercial pressure pitfall.

Of course it's also possible japan has a thriving indie webnovel/webcomic scene full of original, avant garde works which simply don't get translated because all the translators are pathetic loli obsessed incel weebs.

Anyway, it leads me to wonder if the western scene is less susceptible to commercial pitfall somehow, or if its going through something similar and I can't see it.
