Ermahgerd, Evangelion. I've had an idea for it kicking around in my head for gotta be weeks going on months now, so I need to re-watch it, but it's /finals era/ over here[[/raritydespair-in][]]!, so I've been kicking on way too many music videos instead of acquiring episodes.

Sorry. I've just got Eva stuff in my head and I really want to talk to someone about it, but I've been holding myself back because my usual crowd hasn't seen any of it and /oh my odds, is it messed up/.
