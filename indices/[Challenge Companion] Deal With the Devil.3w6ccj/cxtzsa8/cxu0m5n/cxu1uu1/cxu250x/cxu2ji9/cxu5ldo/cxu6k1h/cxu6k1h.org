that depends on what do you mean by "arranged".. i don't remember him ever forcing anyone to do anything..

Its like getting a rich person to drive by poor people with an expensive car, thereby causing them to play the lotto. sure its not very nice, and technically it is "arranging" but its not -really- the same as putting someone in a position a rock will fall on them.
