  All sorts of magic may be offered in exchange for a deal, but only minimal magic may be used to push the deal, and no mind magic - mind magic would defy the point of the archetype, of corrupting people through their inherent moral flaws.

Hmmm... actually, I'd find a reverse-Kyubee more interesting at this point: entirely willing to use large amounts of magic in the process of persuasion, but also able to be repelled simply by saying "no, fuck off." Dealing with him becomes a puzzle: figure out, via observing his avoidance behaviors, what can actually make him leave you alone.

Or another subversion, like in /C: Money of Soul/, in which the Mephistopheles character isn't /actually/ allowing any choice whatsoever, and supplies only an illusion of choice to keep main characters from coming after his head.

There's also the question of what's being sold: a Faustian devil inclined to offer a fat compensation package full of things the victim already wants is going to have an easy time of it (after all, giving people stuff they want in exchange is already the ordinary, civilized, rational way of persuading others to do things you want).
