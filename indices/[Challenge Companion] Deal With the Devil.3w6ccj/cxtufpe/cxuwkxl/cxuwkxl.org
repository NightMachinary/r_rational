Yes, and I'd argue that the strongest Faustian bargain stories are ones where there's no need for the devil to deliberately undermine the protagonist's choices. The individual /is/ corrupt, or they wouldn't have taken the bargain, so the decisions they make are necessarily corrupt decisions. Deals with devils are tragedy and farce.

Cruel devils are more comforting, they let us imagine that we're not responsible for the poor outcomes of our choices. We had free will, sure, but somebody else was still the architect of our misery. At worst we're only to blame for not thinking things all the way through.

The best devils are /fair/. They give the hero what he thinks he wants, and then watches as he destroys or devalues it. The grass isn't actually as green on the other side of the fence, and unearned success is fickle and fleeting.

The hero wasn't unhappy because of his worldly trappings, he was unhappy /because he was already corrupt/. No magic power could comfort or satisfy him.

Perhaps not an outlook particularly suited to Rational Fiction, but an extremely common one in the whole of human storytelling.
