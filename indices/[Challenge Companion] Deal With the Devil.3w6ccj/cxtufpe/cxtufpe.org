The utility function of a Faustian devil either is or is contingent upon persuading people to make taboo tradeoffs of their own free will. All sorts of magic may be offered in exchange for a deal, but only minimal magic may be used to push the deal, and no mind magic - mind magic would defy the point of the archetype, of corrupting people through their inherent moral flaws. In this sense, the Faustian devil is a foil to the common conception of God as a being who values humans' virtuosity, but values their free choice more highly - the Faustian devil also apparently values humans' ability to freely choose, but wants the opposite choice.
