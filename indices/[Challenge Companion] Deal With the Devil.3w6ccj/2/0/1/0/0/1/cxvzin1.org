There's several examples of him deliberately saying things that would put them into situations where Madoka is forced to contract. For example when Kyouko asks him whether she and Madoka can reverse Sayaka's 'condition' he says they should go ahead and try, and later admits to Homura that he knew it would never work. The whole point was to thrust Madoka into another life-threatening situation.
