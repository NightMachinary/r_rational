i am making the distinction between him actually actively(as opposed to talking to other people in a way which cause that to happen) making things life threatening. while talking to two people that hate each other and suggesting to meet in a particular place where there is someone who you want to put in danger is not very nice it is not the same as hiring thugs to come and threaten the person.

i will admit though that my memory of the series is no longer that fresh so possibly i just forgot.
