They asked him if they could save Sayaka. If he told them that people have tried that exact method many times and it never works, he would have stopped them. He acknowledges that he /would/ have stopped them if there was no benefit to it. Instead, he "answers" their questions with about the same honesty you normally get from him. It's technically correct, but deliberately misleading.

It's like if someone desperate for money who trusts you asks for your opinion on the lottery, and you tell them that you have no way of knowing if they'll win, but someone has to. Sure it's technically correct, but you really should be telling them that they're going to lose.
