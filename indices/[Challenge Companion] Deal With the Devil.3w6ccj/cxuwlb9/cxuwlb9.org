Probably not RatFic, but the prompt reminded me of it:

[[/u/rpwrites]] has a little tale with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rpwrites/comments/36nu1m/response_to_wp_the_devil_promises_you_everything/][an unusual Deal with the Devil. Instead of your soul, he wants you to take his daughter on a date]]. There's also sequels, adding +more of+ a plot and a Clever Twist.
