To be fair, you could make a devils that run on that- ones whose only price is that you already be corrupt.

And then see what the most good a person could do with that would be. A person who's corrupt, but whose goals aren't. a person who'd want to bring about world peace, just to prove himself better than everyone who failed before. Someone rational and evil, but with enough likable traits that that doesn't matter. He'll never be satisfied, but that just means he'll try to do even better things for the world.

EDIT: I just realized i almost described ventanari, but without the intelegence.

Maybe he wins, for a given value of victory. maybe he loses, but we get to watch the fall. Maybe it's neither, or both.
