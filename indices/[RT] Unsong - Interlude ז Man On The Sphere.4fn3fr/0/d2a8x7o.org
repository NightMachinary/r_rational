  There had been a brief debate in the Nixon White House over whether or not it was tasteful to plant the American flag on the giant crystal sphere surrounding the world.

The argument in favor of planting the flag was, /America/.

  Neil Armstrong stepped onto the crystal sphere and planted the flag.
