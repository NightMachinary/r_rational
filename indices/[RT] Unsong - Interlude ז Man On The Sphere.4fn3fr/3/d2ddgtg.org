So, it took me a couple days of scattered reading to catch up, and I'm sorry my input probably won't be that good.

1. This book is fucking hilarious. I don't know what I laughed at more while reading: this, Catch-22, or Seventh Horcrux. It might be about the same amount for all three.

2. I haven't checked any of the previous discussions, or looked at the comments, but does Uriel remind anyone else of Death from Discworld? Speaks in all caps, has a weird sense of morality and human behavior, has a strange fondness for cute things (Sohu and cats, respectively), oversees reality at the behest of grander things. In fact, Unsong in general reminds me of Discworld.
