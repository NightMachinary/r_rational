  She probably took up Uriel's offer to increment her age a couple times.

And become Asian?

I mean, it's possible, but Sohu was described as having "light brown skin, dark brown eyes, braided black hair," and the fan art has her as most definitely not Asian.

It's a little bit of stretch to say "They are both from Colorado, therefore it's basically confirmed that they are the same person." Especially considering Colorado is where the CometSpawn have control, and so it's likely that there will be more than one character coming from there.

And last of all, there's no point (plot wise) for Uriel to stop her aging, and then to immediately start her aging again, unless Scott, for some reason, wanted to be intentionally deceitful.
