  Now everything starts to come together. Harry (= Ha'Ari) bemoans the shattered nature of the universe to Liza (= “my god is seven” = the seven shattered sephirot down in our vessel with us, the only form of God accessible in our finite world).

  With what shall I fix it, dear Liza, dear Liza? With what shall I fix it, dear Liza, with what?

  In theory, we ought to be able to swim around the bottom of the fountain, hunt for the debris, and build it back into functional God-deflectors. Then we need to take the sparks of divine light and use them as an energy source to power the deflectors, and finally arrange the whole system in exactly such a way as to correctly channel the power of God at a human-bearable level. In practice we are sex-obsessed murder-monkeys and all of this is way above our pay grade. The debris and sparks are stuck in the spiritual world and we probably can't even find them, let alone start building complicated metaphysical machinery with them. So Henry/Ha'Ari asks Liza/God for help: with what can we effect tikkun, the rectification of the world?

  And Liza replies: “With straw, dear Henry.”

  Straw is a kind of hay. Hay is the Monogrammaton, the shortest Name of God. The universe can only be made whole through divine intervention.

  But the straw is too long; even the shortest Name of God is too big to fit. Any dose of God would burn the universe to ashes; that's how this whole problem started. With what shall I cut it, dear Liza, dear Liza? How can God be channeled and applied to the universe safely?

If we cannot cut the Hay, perhaps we should patch the bucket with something else. Something shorter than the shortest straw (that sounds a little ominous, but ignore that). What we need is the nilgrammaton: the divine name so short it contains no letters at all. That's exactly the sort of thing a group of monks dedicated to balance and harmony might be able to use.
