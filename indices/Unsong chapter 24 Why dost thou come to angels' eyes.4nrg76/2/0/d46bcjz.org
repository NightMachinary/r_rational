Seven dragons for seven demons is [[http://www.nyior.com/acupuncturenewyork-www/om/acupunture/styles/5e/5.1.%20gui%20or%20demons.htm][an acupuncture thing]], but it would be a little weird for Unsong to start in on Asian traditions at this point (not /that/ weird, but a little weird).

[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12&version=KJ21][Revelation 12:3]] describes a dragon with seven heads.

Isaiah mentions dragons multiple times, usually in conjunction with owls for some no doubt significant reason that I can't remember right now, but I don't think that's the connection either, since the dragons are never numbered.

Edit: Owls are apparently often found in ruins (is this true?) so it's a symbol of desolation. In Isaiah, "dragon" is perhaps better translated as "jackal", so it's two creatures known for being something like scavengers (the cultural spot that vultures hold today). Also "owls" is sometimes translated as "ostriches", which I find hilarious.
