It's here:

>"And what, you're just going to continue in the time loop alone afterwards?" Taiven asked. "Or are you just going to create new temporary loopers once we're gone? And then get them out too? I don't know about the rest, but I think the world doesn't need three different Taivens."

The conjecture is: if they physically walk out of the loop via a Primordial tunnel, they have multiples of everyone walking about except for Zach. If they unlock the Gate and let everyone out, same deal. However, If they use the Guardian of the Threshold as a typical looper, then what you say happens (as it did with RR).
