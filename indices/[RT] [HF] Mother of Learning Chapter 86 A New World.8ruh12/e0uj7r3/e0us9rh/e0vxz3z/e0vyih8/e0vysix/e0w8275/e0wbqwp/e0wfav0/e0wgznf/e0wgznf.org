regardless of relative scale of the problem, it's still a problem nonetheless. simulacrums cause people enough issues as is. not everyone can live with a copy of themselves (most wouldn't even be able to confidently say how they'd react until such a situation, hence why Zorian was told to always dismiss simulacrums quickly).

there's inheritance, living space, current positions, relationships. this is not only a huge problem to solve for those accommodating the two, it's also a headache for the two people. who gets what?

how does the government hold people accountable for any crimes? even if the situation in which the government must check never happens, they have to consider it ahead of time. if one is convicted, how do you know which one did it? must you jail both of them since they're "exactly" the same person so the "innocent" one would/could do the same?
