  This is also a world in which Zach and Zorian want to remain as low key as possible.

They do? How would that work? When they exit the time loop, they have to deal with the Invasion of Cyoria by QI, the soul trap of Sudomir, the Cult of the Dragon Below and its connections to the Mage Guild, possibly the Primordial they unleash, and worst of all: Red Robe, who has gone through tons of loop iterations without having his mind messed with like Zach, and will help out all of the above enemies.

If they do nothing, the Primordial is almost certainly going to be unleashed and wreck havoc on the entire continent. And it will never stop or go away on its own because it isn't a spiritual summon. The only way to stop that is to go fight all the enemies, which seems impossible to do so while remaining low key. They aren't going to have any privacy unless everyone dies or Zorian forcefully regains their privacy by mind wiping everyone.

  Thirdly, what does this mean for everyone with copies? I'm sure original!Zorian would take the offer to forget his family and go do his own thing, but not everyone will be willing to live in anonymity and hiding.

I don't see what the big deal is. They don't have to live in anonymity or hiding. The duplicates are just like having finding a long lost identical twin. Just tell the truth or call it a magical accident caused by the planetary alignment. While it may cause some difficulties adjusting to life with duplicates, it's a minor issue compared to the invasion of Cyoria.
