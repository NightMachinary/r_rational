This is a world where mana signatures are kept and it's hard to fool identity sensors.

This is also a world in which Zach and Zorian want to remain as low key as possible. If they have two of a few people running around, with those people nowhere near as powerful or able to keep their minds protected, bye bye to Zach and Zorian's privacy.
