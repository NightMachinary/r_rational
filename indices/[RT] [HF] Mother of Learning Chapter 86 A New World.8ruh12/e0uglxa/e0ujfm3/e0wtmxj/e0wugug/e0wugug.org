I'm not sure where I read this theory, but someone said it'd be funny (read: annoyingly funny) if Fortov has a really useful clue and turns out to be key to them getting out. That would burn Zorian like nothing else haha.

I don't think he's Red Robe, although that does have a nice symmetry to it (in order to live up to Daimens shadow, the two brothers both use the loop but in a different way altogether). However, Fortov does seem to be good natured (checking up on Zorian and Kiri when Zach punches, has a believable excuse for Ibery purple creeper scene, and when offended at Daimen Zorian notes that the normally easy going Fortov was quite angry with Daimen) so I don't think he's RR.
