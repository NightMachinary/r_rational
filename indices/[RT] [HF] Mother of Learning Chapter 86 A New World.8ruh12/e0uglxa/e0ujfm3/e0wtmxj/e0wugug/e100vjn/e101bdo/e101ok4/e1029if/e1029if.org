Well they needed pocket dimension expertise, and they are too goody two shoes to not drop her after they got it. I'd have made an exception to use her for her knowledge and drop her, stat.

Honestly, I'm glad that RR is still a mystery. nobody103 has played this pretty close to his chest, I'm looking forward to seeing the reveal at the end. I'm guessing we won't find out until ZnZ leave the loop, and even then it might take a while as everyone would want to lay low to begin with (apart from using information to make opening moves like the cranium rat swarm hunt, save Alanic et al, etc)
