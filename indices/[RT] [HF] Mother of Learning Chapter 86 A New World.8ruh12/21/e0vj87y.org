I'm kind of surprised that he hasn't picked up the pace in releases a bit. 3 weeks is, like, little side hobby pacing.

The reason this seems odd to me is that his patreon shows him as having an income from each MoL chapter comparable to the average monthly wage for workers in Croatia. If he can get that much from each chapter, it seems like the logical thing to do would be to make this his full-time job and up the speed, and thus his income. It's what Zorian would do!
