So, we have Xvim & fellow teachers working on modifying the markers, Ilsa helping politically & with golem-making, & Daimen's group looking for the staff.

Not what I was expecting but still very good to hear. I still want the aranea to experiment with the Bakora Gates & for Zorian to learn aranean webcraft.

Also, now is a good time for Silverlake to betray them. She just needs to leave the loop without telling anyone; possibly messing up the Z team's own plans.
