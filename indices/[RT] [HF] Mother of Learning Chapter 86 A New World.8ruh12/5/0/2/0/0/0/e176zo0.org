  I thought she wasn't immortal YET, or at least not an ancient immortal? Hence she's still working on better immortality potions?
#+end_quote

It is never specified how old she is exactly, but she /is/ immortal.

Her problem is just that her current immortality is somewhat defective: Although her lifespan is now indefinite, her body is still that of an old woman, so she suffers various symptoms of old age like wrinkles, random aches, etc. Nothing that would kill her, but annoying nonetheless. She is working on a potion that allows her to regain her youth so she doesn't have to endure all these old age ailments anymore.

  And as I said in another comment - I was under the impression the loop wasn't a physical recreation with physical bodies, just souls etc being simulated

Hm? Where did that theory come from? As far as I remember Z&Z have been treating the loop as an actual physical pocket dimension that is massively time-accelerated, containing total copies of everything (souls, physical bodies, etc.) except the spiritual planes.
