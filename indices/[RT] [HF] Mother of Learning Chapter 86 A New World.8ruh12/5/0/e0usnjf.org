  She just needs to leave the loop without telling anyone;

I'm pretty sure she has already been doing this every loop she has been informed. After all, she knows how to get out of the loop: just open up a tunnel through a primordial cage and walk through it. Dangerous as heck sure, but since she would be destroyed at the end of the loop anyway, she might as well chance it.

And so when Z&Z finally exit the loop, they are going to find a whole bunch of Silverlakes outside.
