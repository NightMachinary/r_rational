That makes sense. However, from Ch 1- Ch26 (Soulkill), Fortov keeps pushing Ibery into the patch. Also, there are a few restarts when Zorian takes Kirielle with him. Even if Fortov during Ch1-26 is a simulacrum, he should note these changes because they occur so early in the loop. So my guess is that he isn't RR.
