Not to my knowledge! However, knowing how many things showed up in the first loop (cranium rats, Nochka, etc) that only became obvious later, I'd bet on him already being there. That lawyer friend of Veyers is a good shout. Keeping in mind that the nobody103 had decided everything before starting the story (non-plot critical elements notwithstanding), I think it's fair to say that RR is hiding somewhere, if not in plain sight, at least in view somewhere.

At the same time, there are characters mentioned that show up suddenly (Mage Guild rep who was also with the Cult of the Dragon Below, Alanic, etc) so it can happen. Plus it'll be a new character to understand etc as well.
