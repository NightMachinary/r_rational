things still to do this loop:

- find the staff

- acquire pet hydra

- study hydra further to learn how to synchronize himself with his simulacrums

- study how to fake the marker

- contact 2 other pocket dimension mages that QI told them about

- more study of blood magic and enhancement rituals to assist in learning dimensional magic (especially for Zach)

- learn soul magic from QI (were the cranium rats able to report that Zorian was killing them? If so, I don't know how they can approach him for lessons)

- another vault robbery with QI (again, iffy. also don't try to kill him this time?)

- explanation of what he pulled out of QI's memories

- utilize black room to increase their study time for dimensional/soul/blood magic

- try new tactics to get ring (ally with other tribe to draw them out)

- get Kael governmental support

surprised he took Kirielle, not sure what they're going to do with her while gallivanting across the world

Enough emphasis on Fortov that you suspect something is going to happen there ("He's useless and I don't like him." - no way that can backfire)
