In this specific case, it kinda does...? It's his natural ability. The lessons were only to hone and control it, not activate. He doesn't have to actively discriminate different signals to check if they're open. They simply show up differently to him. Remember back to when he first Opened. His teacher told him it'd be easier with other Open around rather than non-Open, thus implying there's an inherent quality that his senses will passively recognize even without any training or effort

Also by the time RR killed all the Araneans, he has had more than “just a few lessons”
