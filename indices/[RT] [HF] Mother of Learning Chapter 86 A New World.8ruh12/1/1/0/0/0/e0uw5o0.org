yeah so I was trying to get as was something like the following: (i) Normally, Fortov pushes Ibery into the bush, for the reasons he describes (ii) if Fortov becomes RR, he continues to do so just b/c he did the first time and feels he need to be consistent

ummm but yeah, as you point out, he continues to overly-consistently do the bush incident, even after RR leaves (i think? zorian never says otherwise, but zorian doesn't do the normal school-route much after RR leaves), so yeah, it doesn't make any sense to say that his over-consistency is evidence of fortov=RR.

I mostly think fortov=RR is a funny theory, in the sense of the story saying "yeah, you didn't think RR was going to be someone close to zorian because obviously they would notice each other, but don't you remember how much zorian and fortov ignored each other?" I'm not putting any money on it.

But actually I dunno where else the story would be going with Fortov, other than a classic "brothers make up and learn to help each other" arc, which hasn't even begun yet
