Yeah I totally agree that it works well from a logical perspective. It just means that there's no way for the reader to have a hope of figuring out who read robe is at chapter 39 when he leaves the loop so it doesn't work so well from a narrative perspective.

Some people (like Veyers) were mentioned once or twice in passing which is a little better.

I guess ideally with a known character there could be some subtle clues based on them acting differently after red robe leaves the loop.
