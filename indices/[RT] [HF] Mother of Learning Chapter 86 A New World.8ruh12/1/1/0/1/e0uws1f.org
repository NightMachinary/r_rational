In the past I've discounted Fortov as a possibility of being red robe as I thought he had no possible direct link to Zach except through Zorian which means pre-Zorian entering the time loop it'd be unlikely for Fortov to find out that Zach is looping (I also discount people like Silverlake, and Zorian's parents for the same reason).

I find the possibility of Fortov being a natural mind mage and having somehow acquired some basic training in it super interesting because it provides a potential path for him to find out about Zach and so become red robe.

It still seems like a pretty big stretch but it makes him a bit more likely. If by leaving the loop Red Robe Fortov has been replaced with an oblivious copy then at least the natural mind mage ability is something testable to determine whether he has the potential to become red robe (unlike say Veyers who it's probably impossible to tell whether he's red robe).

For what it's worth here are my current possible red robe candidates:

- *Zach* - a rogue simularican, then mindwiped Zach's memory of the ability to create them and do mind magic. Requires some pretty hefty details like a simularican that's a (perfect?) clone of Zach's body that somehow gets his soul marker.
- *Veyers* - 'obvious red herring'
- *Spear of Resolve* - this one is pretty reachy, but with their crazy mind magic abilities they could easily have found out about Zach and used a random human pawn to do their bidding (a plus side is they don't even need to turn temporary markers into permanent ones - just copy a mind packet into your pawn and mind control the human into giving you the packet at the start of each restart. After 6 restarts, select a new pawn. Requires being able to get the Lich's crown every 6 restarts and a few other crazy things and the Zorian interactions don't make sense anymore (unless there was a human that somehow didn't return a mind packet so spear of resolve accidentally left the time loop for an unknown amount of time until Zorian stumbled into it).
- *Eldemar prince* - would be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing
- *Rat controller* - would probably be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing - could be shenanigans similar to the Spear of Resolve stuff. Rat controller seems to be QI, so it implies that in this case he probably did the pawn control type stuff that I said the spiders could do. One point towards this is that it seems super unlikely that the rats wouldn't find out about Zach at least some of the time. One point against is QI not seeming to be in on it when Zorian got bought into the loop.
- *Dragon cult member* - would be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing
- *(now Fortov too)* - strange loop stability, something happens on the train, tenuous link to Zach

In picking Red Robe I'm assuming it'll be following the usual 'rationalist' literature theme of it being an actual solvable problem and also that it'll actually be a /good/ reveal which eliminates a bunch of minor possibilities that'd just be pretty dumb. Honestly I've reviewed every named character in Mother of Learning and I'm a bit stumped for answers that fit perfectly.
