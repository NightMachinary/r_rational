I like Veyer's lawyer as RR.

Has contacts with the cult. has a connection to veyers *and* possibly zack if we consider zack might have tried to get a lawyer to help him with his caretaker (it's said he sought help in this very way)...who he might then explain 'hey I'm a time traveler, I can totally get more info, let me set this up' which would have quickly backfired on him with *this* lawyer. this would also explain the veyers being 'soul killed', it cuts the link between zack and the lawyer/RR. After all, imagine you have finally gotten into the loop and the only connection between you and zack is this veyers kid...who also starts to loop each time in your damn house when you are trying to get your learning groove on. The moment you have the soul kill ability? you use it! (then discover the new issue).
