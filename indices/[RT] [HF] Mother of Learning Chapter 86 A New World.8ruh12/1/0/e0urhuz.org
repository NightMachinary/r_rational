I like how a lot of insanely difficult things are mentioned as a one sentence throw-away. Bits and pieces that used to be the focus of a chapter are now paragraphs. I wonder if they can eventually reduce this entire list down to a single paragraph of 'oh, then we broke the world over our knee so it'd listen to us'?

Hell, even the reactions of other people to the loop are great. Taiven's fussing over Zorian's arm, Ilsa's concerned about Zorian's mental state (and ethical, I guess, because mind mage), Daimen is a little bit shocked at his brother being able to pull together an obscene amount of money. ZZ just look at all of this and go 'oh, my arm, well, next loop I'd better figure out how to touch my teacher with an obscenely powerful cosmic artefact so she can mass manufacture puppets for me' or 'Heh, that's funny. Let's go beat up my caretaker for stress relief.'.

The first time they told people about the loop, their reactions added a lot to the story. This is even better - it's not even 'real' character development, but it's a great way to illustrate how bizarre it all is.
