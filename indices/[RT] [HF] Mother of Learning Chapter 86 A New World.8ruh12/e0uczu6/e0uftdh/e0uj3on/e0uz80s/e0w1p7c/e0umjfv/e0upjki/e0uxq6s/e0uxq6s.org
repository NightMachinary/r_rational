Average mages a decade out of school don't get to experiment with magic in essentially suicidal ways and just get a redo if they die, while simultaneously being encouraged to desperately improve as quickly as possible due to various life-threatening circumstances. They also don't get to game people by repeatedly interacting with them until they learn how to act with someone to make them teach them everything they know, or get to rob other people to have it undone next loop. There's also all the exceptional teachers he would have never interacted with under normal circumstances, as well.
