copy!Taiven and copy!Xvim are the same as original!Taiven and original!Xvim with some more experience and memories. "Melding" with the original is topologically identical to "overwriting" the original.

It would be an issue if the original versions had experienced anything independently from the copies, so a "meld" would have to involve duplicating and merging memories, but nothing is lost in simply overwriting them.
