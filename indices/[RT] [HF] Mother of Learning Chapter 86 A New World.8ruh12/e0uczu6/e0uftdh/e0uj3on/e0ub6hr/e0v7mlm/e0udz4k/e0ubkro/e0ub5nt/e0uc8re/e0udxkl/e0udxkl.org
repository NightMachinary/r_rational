I disagree wholeheartedly. If you do that, the characters might as well be dead, in unfeeling and unthinking sense. Getting a glimpse into how they cope with new reality shows they're indeed living in the story.

edit: I believe it's not necessary, but it's good to add that /conservation of detail/ is of higher priority when including supporting character's reaction into a chapter. Or, like Zorian opinion on Neolu's naivete, it's cute in small dose.
