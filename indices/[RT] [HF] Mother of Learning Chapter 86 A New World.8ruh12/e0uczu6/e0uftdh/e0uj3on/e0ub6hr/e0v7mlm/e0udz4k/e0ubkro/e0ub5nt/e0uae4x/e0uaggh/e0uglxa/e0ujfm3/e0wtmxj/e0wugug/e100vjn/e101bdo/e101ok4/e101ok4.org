Logical. I don't want Fortov to be RR but I did want to point out the soulkill revert logic since it applies to several powerful characters. Hell RR could be Silverlake and she could have engraved a message on the wall lot the primordial cell for herself to find. She could do that now even without being RR.

Have I mention that bringing Silverlake into the loop was a terrible idea.
