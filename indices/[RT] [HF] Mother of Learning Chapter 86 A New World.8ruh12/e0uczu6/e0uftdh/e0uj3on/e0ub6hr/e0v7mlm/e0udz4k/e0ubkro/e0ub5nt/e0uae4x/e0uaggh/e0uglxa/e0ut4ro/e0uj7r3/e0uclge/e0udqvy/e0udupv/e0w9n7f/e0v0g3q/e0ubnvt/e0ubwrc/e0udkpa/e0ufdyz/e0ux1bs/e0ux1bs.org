It seems that you answering some of the concerns raised by comments on the next chapters. Is this coincidence and if not how often you opt to clarify some things due to comments?

Was there ever anything in the comments (some points/ideas you didn't come up yourself) which you've liked and included in your creation? If there was - would you admit to it? :)
