Every solution I think of ultimately implies that the Gate has some security measures implemented for temporary markers, but not for the permanent markers, which would be extremely odd.

But now that I think about it, that oddity can be explained by Red Robe. We know that Red Robe has messed with the Gate's mechanisms somehow, tricking the Gate Guardian into thinking that he is the controller and allowing him to leave. It is possible that Red Robe simply disabled all the security measures that the Gate had for permanent markers (without bothering about the temporary markers), and thus unintentionally allowed Zorian to join the loop.
