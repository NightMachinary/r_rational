Hmm? Now that I think about it, the temporary marker mechanism is really strange. At first, I thought the marker's degradation or removal would permanently scar the target's soul in some way, making it impossible to mark them again in the same restart. But since everyone without a working marker gets a new soul in the next restart (thus losing all their magic growth and memories), their souls should be markable again in the next restart.

Yet now we're told that it is impossible to mark a target again for 12 restarts. So some other mechanism has to be keeping count for those 12 restarts, and it can't be a part of the target's soul since their souls get replaced every restart...
