Your solution is basically the same as mine; store an information. The problem is, where is this information got to be stored? I proposed a new layer of instruction on top of the template, but later I was shown that controller marker and other artifacts can work without it. This imply a rule that information can only be stored by either marking the soul or by directly tamper the template.

By the implied rule, storing crown information on soul should deny 12 turn cooldown period, because you will get pristine soul after the temp marker run out or revoked. Storing crown information on template should deny recreation of pristine soul.

Also, /rule of fun/ stated that you can still enjoy a work even if you don't exactly know the nitty gritty of why things go certain way. But this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]], where future reveal must not invalidate rule established beforehand. This 12 turn cooldown rule invalidated the implied rule.
