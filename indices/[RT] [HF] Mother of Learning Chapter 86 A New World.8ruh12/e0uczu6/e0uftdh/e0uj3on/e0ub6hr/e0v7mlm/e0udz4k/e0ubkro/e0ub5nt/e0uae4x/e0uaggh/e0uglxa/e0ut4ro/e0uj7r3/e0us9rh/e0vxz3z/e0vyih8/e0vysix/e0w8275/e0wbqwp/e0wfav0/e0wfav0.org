I'm comparing the state of the world in which there are duplicates of people, and the state of the world in which the duplicates are merged with the originals. In both cases, Cyoria is going to be the site of a large-scale battle between time loopers and their allies, and battle that will potentially unleash a freaking primordial to cause destruction across the entire continent. The problems caused by such a battle far outweigh the problems caused by having duplicates of people. The former may even solve the latter because tons of people (including originals/duplicates) will die.
