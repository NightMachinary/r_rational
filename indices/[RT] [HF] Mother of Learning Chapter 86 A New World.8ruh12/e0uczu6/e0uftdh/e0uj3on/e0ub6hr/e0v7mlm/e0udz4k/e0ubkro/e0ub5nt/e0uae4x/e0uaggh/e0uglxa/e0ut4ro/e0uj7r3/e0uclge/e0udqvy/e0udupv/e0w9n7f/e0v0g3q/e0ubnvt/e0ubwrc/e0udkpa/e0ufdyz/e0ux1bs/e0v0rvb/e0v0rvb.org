I do sometimes clarify things based on comments from the readers. I'm not sure how common it is, but I don't think it happens too often.

Yes, actually. Nothing that is truly story critical, since important stuff has long since been decided, but I remember at least one thing I changed because I liked the fan speculation better. I'd be willing to admit it but not until the story is over. :)
