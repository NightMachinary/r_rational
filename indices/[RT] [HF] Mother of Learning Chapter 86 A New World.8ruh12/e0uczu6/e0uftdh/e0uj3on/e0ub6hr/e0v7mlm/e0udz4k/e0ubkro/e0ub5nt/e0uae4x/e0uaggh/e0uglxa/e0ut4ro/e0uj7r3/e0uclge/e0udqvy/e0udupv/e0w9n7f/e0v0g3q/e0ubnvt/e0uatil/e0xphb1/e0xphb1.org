I don't know if it's allowed but I'll ask anyway.

I started reading Mother of Learning way back, maybe 4 years ago maybe and I stopped. I would like if someone here remember the chapter where Zorian first learned he's an empath. I remember something about a mansion burning and the spiders coming to help but I forgot. I would like to start reading again.
