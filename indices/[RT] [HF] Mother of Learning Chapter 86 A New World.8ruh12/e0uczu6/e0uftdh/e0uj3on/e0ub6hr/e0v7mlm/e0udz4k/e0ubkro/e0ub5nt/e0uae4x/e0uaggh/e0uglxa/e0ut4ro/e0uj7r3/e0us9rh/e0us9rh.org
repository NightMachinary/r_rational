  How easy will this be when not everyone is Zorian and a soul/mind mage (ie, they can't do a mind swap/soul eject)?

My understanding is that there's three ways out of the time loop: either you trick the Sovereign Gate Guardian into thinking you are the controller and ask him to let you leave, you use the 5 keys to force the controller to let you leave, or you open up an a tunnel through a primordial cage from inside the time loop to the outside.

If the last method is used, anyone can leave the time loop, regardless of skill, since they just need to walk through the tunnel. There just needs to be some skilled mages "carrying" the party, maintaining the tunnel and casting spells to prevent whatever primordial is in the cage from killing them all.
