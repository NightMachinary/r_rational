The Gate is capable of altering the template; that's how soulkill is implemented, and also the ring's tracking function. It's not unreasonable to suppose that when a temporary marker is placed, it makes a reversible alteration to the template, marking that soul as ineligible for re-marking until the counter runs out.

Of course, if you found some way to extend the life of a temporary marker, rather than placing a new one, you could bypass such a check...
