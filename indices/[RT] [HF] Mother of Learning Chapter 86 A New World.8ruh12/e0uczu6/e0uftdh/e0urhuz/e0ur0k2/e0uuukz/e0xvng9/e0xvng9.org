Other than the fact that Fortov's narratively a bit of a Chekhov's gun at this point, is there any reason to believe he's important in any way?

(My shot in the dark guess is that he's somehow a looper who became a good guy through the experience who has to pretend to be his past bad self to stay in character, and his goodness will complete Zorian's growth arc)
