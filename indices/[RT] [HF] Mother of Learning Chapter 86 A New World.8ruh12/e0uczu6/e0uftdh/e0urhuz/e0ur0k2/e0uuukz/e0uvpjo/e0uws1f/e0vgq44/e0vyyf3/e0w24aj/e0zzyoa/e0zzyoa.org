If RR leaving causes a "normal" person to be left behind then it could absolutely be someone who didn't show up on the radar until after RR left. RR was to busy to play with ZZ and any interest the showed would have given zorian away. Based on zorian successfully remaining hidden thay increases the prior probability that zorian never interfaced with RRs civilian identity prior to RR leaving the loop
