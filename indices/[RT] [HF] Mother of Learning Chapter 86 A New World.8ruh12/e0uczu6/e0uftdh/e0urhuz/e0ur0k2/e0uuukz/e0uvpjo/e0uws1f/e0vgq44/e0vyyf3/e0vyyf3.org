I found it interesting that you listed

- doesn't appear in the story before RR leaves the loop

As a good thing.

I've always considered people who aren't in the story until red robe is gone to be very unlikely for narrative reason but your logic makes a lot of sense.

I had listed Sudomir as 'no real reason to suspect' just because I didn't think he really had a good direct connection to Zach, but I suppose he was reasonably likely to interact with him when Zach is messing with invasino stuff.

Mostly I agree that he's not really an interesting character and wouldn't be a very satisfying answer. He'd basically be someone that'd fit the 'random cult of the dragon below' bullet I had listed. I wouldn't be surprised if the real read robe used QI's and/or Sudomir's knowledge to turn the temporary marker permanent though.
