What about Tesen Zveri, Zack's caretaker? He has an obvious connection to Zack and the Noveda family, he is a powerful mage, he cheated Zack out of his inheritance and seems shady in general, and he is responsible for donating the Sovereign Gate to the Crown. It's possible that he has special knowledge about the Gate and he might even be connected to starting the time loop in the first place. In that case, he would be in a good position to become Red Robe.

On the other hand, it's strange that he would allow himself to be beaten and humiliated by Zack repeatedly (which happened before Red Robe left the loop). But we only know that indirectly, and I don't think Zorian ever met him when Red Robe was still in the time loop.

Is there anything in the story that obviously exonerates him? Or maybe more hints that he is Red Robe? Couldn't find anything.

(Related: What about the two researchers in the time magic facility? Did Zack interact with the Sovereign Gate in the real world to start the time loop? If yes, they may have been there.)
