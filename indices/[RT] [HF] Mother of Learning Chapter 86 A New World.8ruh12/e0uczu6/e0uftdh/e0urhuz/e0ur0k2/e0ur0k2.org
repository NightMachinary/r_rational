yeah I really wonder where the narrative is going with Fortov. So far he is pretty flat; Zorian has this image of him as a good-for-nothing asshole, and the conversation between Fortov and Daimen just... kinda confirmed that.

I'm kind of considering the possibility that Fortov is RR now:

- RR "piggy-backing" off the time-loop and being an asshole fits with Fortov's character.
- If Fortov were RR, he would want to mostly avoid Zorian (Zorian might notice something is off). Indeed, Fortov and Zorian mostly avoid each other during the month. Fortov might literally never notice that Zorian was acting differently restart-to-restart. The only time they interact is when Fortov wants Zorian to make the rash potion; he might attribute Zorian's different reactions to minor variations. (That said, it's hard to see how he wouldn't notice that sometimes Zorian takes Kirielle, which is a big strike against this theory.)
- There's been a strange emphasis on how Fortov pushes Ibery into the bush with striking regularity. Why could this be? If Fortov were RR, he would try to act mostly the same in every restart. He might overcompensate, say, by always acting /exactly/ the same way.
- Zorian has no idea what Fortov does during the invasion. He has never seen Fortov during the invasion once, and I think someone drew attention to this at some point.
- The difference in train car occupancy (near the end of Book 1) could be caused by Fortov doing something different.

On the other hand:

- No reason Fortov would be connected to Veyers.
- No reason Fortov would want the invasion to succeed.
- When is he spending all his time getting more powerful, if he's acting like a student all the time?
- If Fortov were RR, why wouldn't he just wipe Zach's memories of Fortov and disappear? Is it because doing so would create too many ripples (e.g. through Zorian) and he wouldn't be able to change Zach's memory that much? ... maybe?
- Presumably RR needs to be an expert soul-mage to tamper with the temp-marker, or able to reach soul-magic proficiency in 6 restarts. It's really unlikely that Fortov is this, unless Fortov is a natural soul mage in the same way Zorian is a natural mind mage, or something. That's a complexity penalty (although I wouldn't feel cheated if this were suddenly revealed at the end).

I'd assign very low confidence to this theory, but it's not that unreasonable, I think.
