Can confirm! Discovered this on Friday night, and just caught up. This was a relatively nice place to be left off.

The only thing really worth noting from an archive reader perspective is after arc two everything really picked up in pace, which makes sense. Most of the mundane is gone, which made me slightly worried about the ending. Having the revisit here and in the post-soul damage reset really help the story flow better and eased my fears.
