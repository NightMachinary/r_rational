This chapter was about 6.5k words, and the last chapter was about 10k, so it's shorter than last chapter. Overall, though, most chapters are closer to 6-7k words, so it's not shorter than /normal/.

There was a lot of dialogue and not a lot of new things, since a large part of the chapter was Zorian explaining things to Ilsa and Ilsa wrapping her head around it. Necessary, but it eats up a lot of words on stuff that, from our perspective, has already been trodden.
