well, it's more like a transition chapter than a filler chapter. It's not supposed to describe them believing the loop so much, but their curiosity now about the implications of the loop and their temporary ability to gain from it.

And yes, it feels similar to every other ride with Kirielle - this portrays how everyone has an immediate desire to satisfy Questions about the situation, but such discussions are limited by the need to preserve the quasi-secret nature of their situation within public contexts.

I'm sure we'll get to people conducting efforts with new allies, but we barely knew who was receiving markers before, and spending some time with their concerns about being included also signals to us that they aren't viewed as tools by Z&Z, as explicitly described in the chapter as well.

Can't really say I had a handle on Damien's personality to expect something specific from him, and I think interactions with Ilsa were meant to be representative for all the people they don't have close relationships with. These people are now going to have to start 'opening up' but are understandably somewhat wary at first and spend more time initially observing Z& Z to see the effect /implications of the loop.
