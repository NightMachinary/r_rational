  Character development isn't filler.

I completely agree! Many of the chapters where we learn more about Taiven, Xvim, Kael, Ilsa, or others are fantastic.

But we didn't really learn anything new this chapter. If this was a sitcom or anime, this chapter would be the equivalent of a flashback episode. Every section was essentially a recap.

Ilsa's huge section felt nearly identical to the earlier train rides with Kirielle, just with a couple interjections of things we already knew. Unlike when Taiven or Xvim first started believing in the loop, her reactions just didn't feel right.

Daimen's section, which made up most of the rest, was even worse in that regard.

We learned that Z&Z are planning to take other people out of the loop with them, and that they're mounting a new expedition. That's about it.

If MoL was released as a book, I doubt anyone would really notice, but when it's released chapter by chapter, it hits a little harder. You have weeks of built up anticipation for each chapter, and they don't all measure up the same. Especially with the level of hype other, more interesting chapters have created.

I think people were hoping to see people interacting with others they hadn't really talked to before, conducting raids, or even just sharing new backstories. The fact that people can develop inside the loop was exciting.
