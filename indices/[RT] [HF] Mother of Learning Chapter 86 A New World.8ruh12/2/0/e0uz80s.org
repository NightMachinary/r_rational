Makes you wonder if he would be another 'world class' talent if he discovered his natural mind magic in time to prevent it greatly affecting his social development. Or if Daimen helped him, the sod.

Also god I hope Fortov turns out to be something interesting in the story rather than the world's biggest red herring. Maybe he soulkilled Volkov with the knife and leaving the loop just replaces your soul outside while removing the internal you's marker. The entire thing a massive fuck you to Zorian and Daimen for being cleverer than him. The ultimate fucked up family.
