That is an interesting thing about Zach's personality. Even when he was a crazy good combat mage in class 8 years ago, he treated Zorian as more of a peer than arguably Zorian treated Zach before the month began. Zorian has grown a bit, but it's still an interesting contrast that I don't think would have happened had it been the other way around.
