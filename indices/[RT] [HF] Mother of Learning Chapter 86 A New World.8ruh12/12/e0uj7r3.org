1. Taiven's throwaway comment re there being 3 of her, meaning there will be at least 2 of her walking around if they just walk out of the loop. How easy will this be when not everyone is Zorian and a soul/mind mage (ie, they can't do a mind swap/soul eject)?
2. I liked Ilsa as a conduit into the thought processes of other people who are not members of the conspiracy. Although in the edited book (when it's released etc) this scene should be really fun to watch as they ask questions and get a temp marker in exchange.

Weird that my other comment didn't show up, I thought I posted it..
