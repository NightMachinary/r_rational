other things (for other people):

- silverlake to brew and test her potion

- acquire the other beast (worm) from sulrothum and store it along the hydra in orb - make sure they don't attack each other. They may even know each other. Use them as meat shield on royal vault assault to defend while investigating ward stone or to fight off invasion/primordial summoning

- test what happens if they drill the well by Bakora gates Silent Doorway Adepts live and see the effects (preferably by the end of restart first to work out kinks. If it works in short term - check what are longer term consequences - drill the hole at the start).

- putting tracker on QI. This is kinda risky. The lich is very sensitive and would notice it and after he finds it after restart things might get hairy. Also to be used in tracking his fall back place (mark him while starting fight. After he leaves the current body, track/capture his soul/phylactery. Remove tracker to not cause suspicion on hm. The potential whereabouts of the lich sounds very lucrative, but too risky. Getting hold of his phylactery would open a lot of options / bargaining points.
