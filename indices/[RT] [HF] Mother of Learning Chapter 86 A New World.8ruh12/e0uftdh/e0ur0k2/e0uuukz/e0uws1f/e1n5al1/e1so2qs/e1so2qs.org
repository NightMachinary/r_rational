I like your idea of RR making a mistake with the dagger, perhaps he edited Zach's memories so he wouldn't go looking for the now dead Veyers.

However, I don't think he is RR. He is too unskilled to alter his marker within 6 months (is he even a mage?), and on top of this, we know RR was able to more or less shrug off bullets (from Zorian) on day 1 of the timeloop, so he likely had a bloodline before the whole thing started.
