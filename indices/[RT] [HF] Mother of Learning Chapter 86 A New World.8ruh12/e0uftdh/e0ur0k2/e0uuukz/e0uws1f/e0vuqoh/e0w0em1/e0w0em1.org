That is true. I guess the only thing I could add is that Tesen wouldn't really be a very satisfying answer.

I've been wondering for a while if there are any hints in the story about how Zach got in the time loop. I certainly haven't found anything concerete. Tesen is one of the more likely people to have initiated it if Zach was inserted as a necessary pawn because of his heritage or something (which is pretty likely). I think the story implies that the sovereign gate ended up with the Eldemar because of Tesen selling off all of the Noveda belongings but maybe it was on purpose...

I've been leaning towards the gate turning on 1 month early being some sort of divine failsafe because of the imminent primordial summoning (and sucking Zach in because of his heritage) but there isn't any hard evidence for that either.

In terms of the researchers (Krantin Keklos and Aread) , they're first introduced in Chapter 54 and they're only ever mentioned by name in that chapter. Seems super unlikely that they'd be anything bit bit characters for narrative reasons but it's possible.
