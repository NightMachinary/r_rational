Stumped is how I feel as well.

What about Sudomir? I feel he checks the most boxes.

- skilled in soul magic
- has incentive to help the invasion and make it as efficient as possible (to kill more people and collect souls)
- is connected to the cult
- doesn't appear in the story before RR leaves the loop

It would be a bit disappointing (he's not that interesting of a character...) but it makes a lot of sense
