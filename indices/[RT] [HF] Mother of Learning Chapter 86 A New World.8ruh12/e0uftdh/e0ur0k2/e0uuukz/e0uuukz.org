  If Fortov were RR, he would want to mostly avoid Zorian (Zorian might notice something is off). Indeed, Fortov and Zorian mostly avoid each other during the month. Fortov might literally never notice that Zorian was acting differently restart-to-restart. The only time they interact is when Fortov wants Zorian to make the rash potion; he might attribute Zorian's different reactions to minor variations. (That said, it's hard to see how he wouldn't notice that sometimes Zorian takes Kirielle, which is a big strike against this theory.)

He only did that after RR left, meaning Fortov would go back to his loop-standard self.

  Presumably RR needs to be an expert soul-mage to tamper with the temp-marker, or able to reach soul-magic proficiency in 6 restarts. It's really unlikely that Fortov is this, unless Fortov is a natural soul mage in the same way Zorian is a natural mind mage, or something. That's a complexity penalty (although I wouldn't feel cheated if this were suddenly revealed at the end).

Fortov could have done exactly what Zorian did to become a good soul mage, use his natural talent as a mind mage to mind-rape soul mages for their knowledge. We don't know if he's actually psychic or not, we just know that he's charming. In fact, we *very explicitly* don't know if he's psychic or not, since Zorian never took an interest in him.
