  But this is already present as Gate already have record of controller ID,

But it doesn't! The fact that Zorian is in the loop strongly sugggests that the Gate just looks for markers, and does not actually record which souls have markers. After all, Zorian joined the loop via a botched soul magic spell on him and Zach, which transferred a piece of Zach's marker onto Zorian. If the Gate had any kind of record used to confirm who the controller is before allowing the controller to keep his soul in the next restart, it wouldn't have let Zorian join in. And if the Gate doesn't even record who has the permanent marker(s), why would it record who has temporary markers?
