Yeah, and given motivation and effort is a big part of what makes someone average or not

Zach had decades before zorian, and he had some mad combat skills but was otherwise a pretty useless mage. Even Zach, since zorian got on board, improved exponentially. And the only reason he learns SOME things faster than zorian, is he has a magnitude larger pool of mana to draw from.

It's pretty clear that improved mental state zorian is a pretty highly talented mage

So it's a pretty small leap of logic to assume that fortov likely has some natural talent too?
