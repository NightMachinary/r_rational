I think the best part of this chapter was Ilsa asking Zorian if he was an average mage. He responds that he is, however, from his perspective everything seems normal to him.

Even Damien pointed out that even if you accounted for the years spent in the time loop, Zorian is only a couple years younger than him. However, he has had practically exponential growth in nearly all magical fields. I think Ilsa is also starting to take notice that Zorian isn't an average mage. Even taking into perspective the extra time and resources an "average" mage wouldn't be able to accomplish what Zorian has.
