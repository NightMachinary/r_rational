Mm nope. Xvim doesn't have keen sense about soul. They most likely take over some task out of Zorian's to do list; freeing his time so that it be used for tinkering marker. Xvim also supposedly coax other mages into sharing their most prized expertise. We haven't got mention of him having a break on that matter.
