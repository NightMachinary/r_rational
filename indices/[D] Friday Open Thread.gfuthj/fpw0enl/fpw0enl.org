So looking at the chapters for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation]], it looks like it's been marked as complete.

I wanna cry a bit at seeing such an amazing story being finished.........

Does anyone have any idea what the fudge bit in the title was supposed to mean?

EDIT: Before anyone asks, it wasn't marked as complete when the last chapter went up back on April 17th. Here's the link to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g33qfy/rtffwip_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_chapter/][discussion]] about the last chapter if it helps.
