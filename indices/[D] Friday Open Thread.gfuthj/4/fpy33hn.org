Anyone else like listening to lectures by The Teaching Company/Great Courses? They have been my constant companion for 14 years now. Sometimes I try out a new lecture series on a whim and end up falling in love with a subject I never thought I would. Last one was about the Arthurian legends. There's a surprisingly rich history there.
