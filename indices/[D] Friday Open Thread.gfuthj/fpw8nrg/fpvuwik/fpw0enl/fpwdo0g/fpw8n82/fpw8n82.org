Your memory /may/ be playing tricks on you, but in either case you shouldn't assume that the story is actually over.

Chili was marked as 'complete' on [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200225042916/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/12/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][25 February]], when the kids were rescuing Wonka from the VIPs.

My original theory was that gaze never removed the 'complete' status after his initial fakeout, but the chapter where we are introduced to the VIPs is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200222081117/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/11/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][/not/ marked as complete]]. Nor is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200213184606/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/10/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][the chapter before that]], but then, on 24 Jan, the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200124133044/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/9/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][contract-signing chapter]] /is/ marked as complete, and so is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200110111754/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/7/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][chapter 7]], which followed the fakeout, and [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200104232215/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/6/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][Chapter 6]], the fakeout in question.

Unfortunately, whoever was logging these chapters stopped doing so after Wonka was rescued from the VIPs, so we don't have further data to analyze.

Two possible scenarios:

1. Gaze is fucking with us and a complete archive would show that the 'complete' tag had come and gone multiple times.

2. Gaze meant to tag it as 'complete' the whole time but accidentally untagged it as such and only fixed this a couple chapters later (not unreasonable, given how user-unfriendly FFnet is), and we're misremembering. Certainly, /I/ don't remember the story being marked as 'complete' during the VIP debacle.
