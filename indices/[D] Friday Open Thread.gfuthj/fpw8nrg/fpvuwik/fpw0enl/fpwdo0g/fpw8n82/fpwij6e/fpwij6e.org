It was marked Complete when I caught up, and has updated once or twice since then and still been marked Complete. Or rather, whenever I /checked/ while I was catching up and reading new chapters, it was marked complete, as I cannot vouch for what it is like when I'm not looking. Either way, I don't put much stock in the label.
