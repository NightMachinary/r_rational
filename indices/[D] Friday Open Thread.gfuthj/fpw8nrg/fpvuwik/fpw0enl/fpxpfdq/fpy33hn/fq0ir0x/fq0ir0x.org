I've started watching the Voltron remake, with my only prior exposure being a bunch of people saying it was really disappointing. So far I've watched season 1 through 4.

Season 1 and 2 are okay. Lots of robots blowing up, story-wise it mostly feels like the writer is going through all the "kids with superpowers fighting aliens" cartoon tropes.

Season 3+4 is both the most interesting and the most disappointing so far. The part where the team has to adjust to the absence of a dead member only for that member to come back almost immediately is a little jarring, but whatever, it's not like I expected him to stay dead. Also, the red guy gets to join a black ops commando for good, and that part is just awesome.

What really disappointed me so far was the new villain. I feel like after two seasons of Darth Vader, I was promised Grand Admiral Thrawn and ended up with Kylo Ren. Seriously, his intro episode is amazing, and it does a ridiculously good job of hyping him as a main antagonist... and then he does almost nothing interesting for the entire season. Same thing for his bodyguards: they were incredibly interesting and got dropped almost immediately.

Going into season 5 now. I'm a little anxious.
