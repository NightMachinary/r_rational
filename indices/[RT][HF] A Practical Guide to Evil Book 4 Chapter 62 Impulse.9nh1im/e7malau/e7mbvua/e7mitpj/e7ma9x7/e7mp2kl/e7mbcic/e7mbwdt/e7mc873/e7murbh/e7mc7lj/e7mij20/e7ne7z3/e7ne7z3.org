Presumably they can't bid more than a lifetime of service in total, and they have Ivah to call bullshit of how long that is for a dow.

Additionally we know that not all night is created equal. (amount and utility of the skills it includes varies)

​

So the bidding probably works somewhat like a draft in that they're essentially taking turns. They will all end up sworn to Cat for a lifetime provided enough night goes up to auction, but the auction determines what they get and in what order they make their deal.

​

For personal bidding strategy, given that they're moving towards the center of the drow's power-base it's reasonable to expect that the night at auction is going to get better in future battles, and that they have more foes ahead than behind. So for now it'd be unwise to bid your whole allotment, unless you are that desperate, and just want to make sure you get in on the oath now rather than possibly missing out later when the more patent players start bidding more seriously. Unless a particularly choice bit of night comes up for auction, or they reach the tipping point where sigils start folding rather than fighting most drow probably won't want to bid their entire allotment on one auction.
