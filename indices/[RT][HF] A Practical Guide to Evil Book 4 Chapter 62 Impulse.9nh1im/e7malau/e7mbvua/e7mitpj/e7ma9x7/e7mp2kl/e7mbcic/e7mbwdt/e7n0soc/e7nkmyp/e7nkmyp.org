I suspect that pre-fall Drow culture was more-or-less before the magic cannibalism was promoted; imagine being able to pass down your skills to your next generation. Nothing (or much less) is lost; you can much more literally "stand on the shoulders of giants".

Then maybe the mantle of the Sve Noc changed hands, of the Sve Noc changed their mind, and started encouraging the back-stabbing and what not... so now everyone's trying to take what exists, instead of making more, and it all goes to shit.

(Notably: Sounds like problems we have here, too! In corrupt places, there's no point in accumulating wealth, since someone more powerful than you (or sneakier) will just come and take it).
