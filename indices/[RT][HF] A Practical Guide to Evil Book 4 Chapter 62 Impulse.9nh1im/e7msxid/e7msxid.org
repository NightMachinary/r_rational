So this was awesome, but I always feel like the other shoe is waiting to drop when things start going so well for Cat. Any thoughts on what that's going to be? Off the top of my head, potential issues (sooner or down the road) could include:

- Sve Noc is the biggest immediate issue. Cat's new army is being bound with oaths of both Night and Winter. That means Sve Noc withdrawing her power could shatter Cat's new forces, and significantly weaken the ones who remain. So Cat needs to recruit, dominate, or harvest Sve Noc for her power... and if drow culture is any indication, her morals are going to be a bit conflicting with Cat's. Each of those options has drawbacks - recruitment means Cat needs to offer Sve Noc something valuable. Domination means always having a dagger at her back, as betrayal is the bread and butter of the drow. And harvesting means Cat takes on Night, which she is (rightly) very reluctant to do.
- No matter how Sve Noc turns out, her power brings issues too. While the drow army isn't entirely Evil, it definitely has significant Evil parts to it. Which throws it back into the narrative flow and potentially calls for a bolstering of Good's forces in turn.
- Cat's drawing on Winter quite a bit, and that seems like it HAS to have large consequences at some point. On a more meta level, it brings Callow closer to Winter... who knows how that'll turn out. But it also means that Cat becomes less human, and even if she's shunting off the alienation for the most part, that will also have some effects on her minions. And it is pretty much stated as a certainty that Larat will eventually betray her, so that's a hurdle that will approach at some point. And then there's the deal with the seven crowns... what happens when she fulfills that? Does she lose Winter? Does she become Fae in truth? Or... what happens if she reneges?
