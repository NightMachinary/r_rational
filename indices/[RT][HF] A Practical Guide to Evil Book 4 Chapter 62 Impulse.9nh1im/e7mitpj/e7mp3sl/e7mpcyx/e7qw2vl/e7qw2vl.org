Possible resolutions?

Cat needs an army now, more than she needs them in ten years (with the crusade over, her intention to abdicate, etc.). The rules of the auction could be set up to reflect that by making the first years of service bid worth more than subsequent. The further Cat goes, the stronger the enemies are meaning more Night and (possibly) more who will attempt to fight rather than surrender. So do you bid now to avoid being left behind, or hold your valuable first bid until there's a larger prize?

Or if Cat/Akua is capable of dividing up Night, the auction might be "pool the bids, and divide proportionally" rather than "highest bid takes all". In this case, there would be a point where after enough bids are made, the amount of Night gained is not enough to raise you out of the left-behind class and you're better off waiting for a less contested auction.
