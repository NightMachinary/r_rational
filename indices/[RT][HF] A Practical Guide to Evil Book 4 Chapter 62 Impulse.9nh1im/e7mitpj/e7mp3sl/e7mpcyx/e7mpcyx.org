Yeah, but there's no reason any of them would back down from a bid. They'd all desperately want the shares of night offered, and they're all used to serving someone else; so there's no reason they wouldn't promise ridiculous durations like "I will serve 10'000 years!", because as far as they're concerned, it's either "get the night" or "get shafted down the line".
