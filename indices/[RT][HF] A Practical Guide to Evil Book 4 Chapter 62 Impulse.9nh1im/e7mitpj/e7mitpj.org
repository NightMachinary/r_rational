So... Cat is holding auctions where people, who were recently uprooted from their way of living, and had their clan destroyed in a way that, in their culture, is synonymous with death and slavery, are offered permanent and temporary power-ups and status upgrades, that are basically the only way they know to escape the old "you've outlived your usefulness" treatment. There's a lot more candidates than there is power to distribute.

They're going to bid centuries of service, aren't they?
