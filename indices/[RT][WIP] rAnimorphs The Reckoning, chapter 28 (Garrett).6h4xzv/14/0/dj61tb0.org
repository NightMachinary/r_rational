Thanks for the comment!

1. An attempt to verbalize the thought-ideograms, plus a simple nod to canon because you can't change /too/ much or people give up/riot. Aximili's name is described in r!Animorphs to be the sound of a particular small creature on the Andalite homeworld.

2. They stockpiled enough for two years. Wasn't mentioned on-screen. The assumption was that at that point, the war would be over, or they'd have bigger problems anyway.

3. It was engineered by the Arn, yeah.

4. There's a size limit---eventually, you overwhelm the pocket dimension's power requirements and just die on the spot.
