Finally up to date, which means I can get involved in the comment threads!

First: Many, many thanks for such an incredible story. I've read similar comments previously, but this has snagged me in a way nothing has since HPMOR and then Worm.

A couple of questions:

1. Why do Andalites have verbal names? Yeerks I understand, since their only way to communicate outside the pool is via hosts' mouths, but Andalites would never have a reason (or, outside morph, the ability) to speak an Andalite name aloud. Was this in consideration for non-telepathic species? Or are their long, complex names an attempt to verbalize the thought-ideograms that likely compose native thoughtspeak names?

2. Did the Animorphs really only take two weeks of oatmeal before destroying the factory? I sure hope they stockpiled a bunch more offscreen for Essak and Temrash's sake...

3. What the damn hell is the fake-Andalite body Visser Three used?? At first I assumed he was holding himself halfway between Alloran and a human morph, but that obviously wouldn't work for a bunch of reasons, not least because there's no way he'd give over his real body. Was part of his deal with the Arn that they engineer him a custom body or five?

And finally, the thread I've been waiting to start since I started reading: Munchkinry! How would you hack the near-infinitely hackable morphing power to live forever, attain godhood, etc.?

-Sleep way less frequently. I'm glad we saw this onscreen in this chapter, it's something I've been hoping would be mentioned for a while. Canon says one full night's rest every 4-5 days, but if you're only ever out of morph long enough to get back into it, that's ~180 seconds every ~1.5 hours (to account for extra mass morphed), that's 48 minutes of real-body-time per day. If not sleeping were your goal, you could feasibly go a month without.

-Similarly, this extends your lifespan by a factor of about 30. If you're not constantly morphing this is maybe more like 10. Still damn good.

-Is there a size limit on what you can take into morph? If not, the Animorphs have a pretty damn good kamikaze option--focus on taking i.e. the atmosphere into morph with them, then stay past the (at that mass level negligible) time limit. Obviously at this point all they have to do to destroy the world is nothing... but what if one of them managed to touch V3's ship?

-We've already explored the potential of using human/Andalite morphs for increased processing power. If they ever figure out how to morph a Yeerk (hypothesis: acquiring a full pool?) this is vastly augmented.

I'm pretty sure this story ends with one or more characters reaching godhead, smart money being on Ax or V3 at the moment. All the parts are there, they (and we, if [[/u/TK17Studios]] decides to pull a Big Yud riddle) just have to figure out how to put them together.

Thanks once again for making me think. Great stuff.
