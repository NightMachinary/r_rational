yeah. I can think of a few story events that serve as natural climax points, but you've kind of got that rolling "worm" thing going on most of the time.

Not as many of the big self-contained plot points (blowing up a supply ship via hawk with gun, pushing kandrona generator out a window, successfully extruding a crocodile, etc), and the ones you do have are structured to drive the plot forward, rather than creating a denouement.
