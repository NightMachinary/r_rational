  "Serenity's responding with almost arbitrary sensitivity, down to the width of a helium atom. The limit is our ability to measure it. Right now, we can get readings that are accurate to within about a hundred meters or so as far out as Europa---there's at least one ship out there---and timestamps down to as long as it takes to light to cover that distance."

  "Which is---"

  "About three ten-millionths of a second," I said. TOBIAS looked over at me as if he wasn't even seeing me, but looking right through me at something else.

Light takes at least 40 minutes to get from Earth to Europa. In 300 nanoseconds, light travels some 90 meters. I take it that delay is only due to distance from the sensor to Serenity'sâ€‹ helium tank? Shouldn't the time delay to Europa factor in there somewhere?
