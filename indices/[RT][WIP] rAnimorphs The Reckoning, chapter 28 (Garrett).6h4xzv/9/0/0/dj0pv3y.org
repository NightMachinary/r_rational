  Thàn (at least as presented) is not just a random individual---note that someone in his position is already more likely than base rates to be smart and agenty, and that if anyone were to catch on to the invasion, you'd expect it to be someone with access to Serenity or similar, <snip>

Oh agreed and acknowledged absolutely. The problem is that most of the factors that make him capable of deducing this on his own just mean he's a good target that would be easier to nudge onto this particular line of research without him noticing since it requires less nudging. This hypothesis is less "Thàn is a +witch+ spy! BURN HIM!" and more "Hmmmm, we don't have enough data do come to any solid conclusions, but it's something to keep in mind as the story progresses." The bit about him just /happening/ to be in Tobias' and Garret's path is admittedly a big weakness of this theory. Nothing stops V3 from attempting this on multiple fronts, limited only by how common the quantum physics experiment in question is. I'd say a bigger weakness is that this presumes that V3 is deliberately counterplaying around the morph test, which requires him to currently be aware of it's use (I don't think he is. Most of these chapters I only read once, with long breaks in between so I might be forgetting something). Also, this requires V3 (or someone who works for him) to have come up with the idea for a device which A] only works due to the weird and mysterious Z-space barrier which B] only exists around Sol (so the device only works here) and the device C] has to be buildable using rare but not too rare earth tech so that D] they can "nudge" someone into discovering it themselves without overt influence, and finally E] they decide the best use of this isn't "Track and locate the Animorphs" or "Determine who they have given morphing ability to, then infest /them/" but is instead "Tempt the Animorphs with it to get someone inside their group." That is just too many things going exactly that particular way for it to be a likely scenario.

Of course, all of this in no way precludes infiltration of non-Thàn individuals as passive watchers with no nudging at all, so even if Thàn is clean, the morph test has a security hole.

Oh and the logistics behind the B&E are probably the easiest part. For the initial break in [[https://gizmodo.com/any-key-you-can-photograph-is-a-key-that-can-be-copied-1522264272][photographs of his keys]] mean you don't need to actually break anything, and some remote activated canisters of knockout gas in the vent along with a pinhole camera to watch to see if he's in bed or even to look for the eye movement indicative of REM sleep (because why not check for REM sleep). The biggest problem is how to "signal" the yeerk to exit the brain without waking the subject. Have them "listen" for the smell of the knockout gas then count to 300? I suppose it depends on how "awake" the yeerk is compared to the host, a morse code tap on the forehead could work if the host is drugged.
