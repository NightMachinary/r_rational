That would work, as described, provided you actually surmounted the logistical challenge of never-waking-up-the-host-during-your-B&Es.

Neither confirming nor denying, but since I gave some weight to your theory above, here's some counterweight: Thàn (at least as presented) is not just a random individual---note that someone in his position is already more likely than base rates to be smart and agenty, and that if anyone were to catch on to the invasion, you'd /expect/ it to be someone with access to Serenity or similar, and that while you didn't /see/ Tobias and Garrett doing ten or fifteen different morph batches a day for ten days straight, filtering through ten thousand people to get 1000+ recruits, remember that it was only /then/ that they connected with him, and even then it was indirect and required an introduction (because Thàn was telling his trusted allies that he was on the lookout for the resistance).
