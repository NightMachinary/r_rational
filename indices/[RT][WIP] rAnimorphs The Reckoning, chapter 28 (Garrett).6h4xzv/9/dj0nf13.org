So, as far as I know, V3 doesn't have "sleeper agent"/"manchurian candidate" capabilities (or even memory modification capabilities) but the whole "hey, here is some /suspiciously useful/ technology that will provide a massive tactical advantage when the time comes" makes me think Thàn is a plant. But then he passes the morph check and I start to wonder how /I/ would do the sleeper agent thing if I were Visser 3.

I don't know if this works but I /think/ it's consistent with how Yeerks function. A controller with a stasis thermos containing a Yeerk breaks into Thàn's house while he sleeps and infests him (possibly with a injected sedative beforehand). The Yeerk in his head just sits there passively though, like someone in the driver's seat of a car who doesn't touch the controls, so Thàn never notices that he's infected. He then goes to work and whenever an opportunity to nudge him in the right direction with z-space tech arises, the Yeerk whispers in his head. It could probably even distract him when he starts to get suspicious. With another B&E every few nights to swap Yeerks so they don't starve (or possibly "hey that brand of oatmeal looks pretty delicious") this could continue indefinitely.

If you have full control of a brain like the Yeerks do, the scariest scenario isn't a hard override where you become a passenger in your own body, it's starting to wonder if your thoughts are actually your own and if you're as alone in your own head as you thought you were.

Please tell me I missed something obvious in previous chapters and I'm wrong about how this works. Would this pass the morph test? Even after the Yeerk leaves the head?
