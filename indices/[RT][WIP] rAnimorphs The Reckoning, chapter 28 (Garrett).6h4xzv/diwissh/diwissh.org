Alright, great chapter! All the chapters where the Animorphs are on a mission are nerve-wracking, because I expect everything to go horribly wrong at any moment. I scroll down sentence-by-sentence on my iPad, and it's like solo Russian Roulette as to whether everything will explode in the next sentence.

More speculation on technology for this chapter. The first question is: why doesn't Visser 3 have the same capability as Serenity? (If he did, everyone would be dead already). Given the trend of previous responses to questions about tech in this universe, I think I can answer. It seems like the Yeerks just don't have sufficient resources to create and use their best technology, due to their isolation. Even if they did, creating a Z-space radiation detector as accurate as Serenity might just be infeasible unless the detector is extremely stable and buried deep underground, which takes a lot of time and effort. Also, the Yeerks certainly weren't expecting a perfect Z-space sphere around the solar system, and so they didn't have anything prepared on this front.

Visser 3 does have limited Z-space radiation detection ability, though, as we saw in the school. But it probably requires a lot of preparation, and is only sensitive enough to work in a small area. Although he does have the ability to map the Z-space structure of the solar system, using what I assume is a combination of passive radiation detection for large-scale structures and scanning bursts of radiation for smaller-scale structures (I also assume that those devices use the same kind of radiation as what's described in this chapter). Why these detectors are not capable of doing what Serenity does is a bit of a mystery, but ultimately they are probably just not sensitive or isolated enough by comparison.

It looks like the Gods are setting up the Animorphs for one of their classic space missions. Will they team up with Telor and assault Visser 3 [and his secret cloning operation?] on Mars? Anything could happen! Will they make the mistake of bringing David, who, if canon is any indication, will probably try to defect and join Visser 3 in order to survive? And what is this strange caveat to morphing that is facilitating strange events and interventions from the Gods? Find out in [unspecified amount of time later] on r!Animorphs!
