My favorite chapter in a while, except for the part where the character with my name DIDN'T ANSWER THE CALL!

Super cool to see Tobias and Garrett's procedural competence/rationality. Also interesting to see Tobias struggle with the identity thing. I'm sort of unimpressed with his thinking, but I notice now that we haven't seen him do this sort of abstract reasoning very often (so, like, it isn't out of character for him to be less "rational" here than Garrett).
