Though now that I think about it further, I realize I'm still kind of assuming that this is all going to be resolved by some morphing battle + maybe lasers/guns/grenades between the main cast and V3 + some goons, or something along those lines, when in fact it's probably more likely for them to just coordinate some military action with stolen/adapted alien tech and essentially watch from the sidelines as others finish fighting the war, if it ever advances beyond a certain point. There's no particular reason V3 has to be defeated in person, face to face, rather than just have his ship blown up by some random Captain Steven Hiller type characters.
