Woo, another Garrett chapter! The idea of him getting an inside look at how others think/feel by morphing them, and then having that insight help him even in his own normal state, is really cool, and made me wonder all over again about how the Z-Space-Brain works compared to a Meat-Brain. It must essentially copy everything the Meat-Brain is, not just in terms of "pure thoughts" or "logic" or whatever, but down to its basic structure and unique reactions to bodily chemistry/hormones/etc. Which makes sense if your original body is being teleported/recreated to Z-Space too, though that brings up questions of how it survives there in order to keep feeding your brain enough to keep Garrett actually "Garrett," with all his idiosyncrasies, despite the body/brain he's "inhabiting" in meat space.

Also neat to see a human taking independent action, after having some early clue that weird things were going on. Not only is the data he provides them invaluable, it seems like the Animorphs may finally get the technological trump card they need to be able to maneuver against V3 when they finally decide to take action, since animals generally don't fare very well against space ships. Particularly if they're in space.
