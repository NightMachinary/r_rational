I'm also curious to what degree an inherently higher level of respect and confidence in the professionalism and competence of military/police/professionals-in-general might be reflected in stories. I feel like I have a slightly higher-than-average one for them compared to others in the intellectual/rational spheres, and it's somewhat reflected by my Rangers and Leaders and whatnot all being hyper competent. Not just because a world as dangerous as Pokemon's would require them to be but also because I tend to dislike the Adults are Useless trope, but there definitely seems to be a higher level of that going on in this story, and I model the author as someone who has an even-higher-than-average respect and confidence in the above institutions than I do.

Not that I'm complaining at all, since as I said, Adults are Useless is a trope I think is actually fairly annoying in most incarnations, unless the adults are in some respects purposefully being useless like in Ender's Game. Whether it's more /realistic/ or not is a different case than what's narratively satisfying, of course, but I'm pretty happy with it here in all respects.
