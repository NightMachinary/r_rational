The Animorphs themselves are not random members of the population, but were carefully chosen by the Gods. President Tyagi and other high-ranking individuals are also not random members of the population, but are much more likely to be competent due to what it takes to get to that level of influence. In the case of Th√†n, his competence and agency are what caused him to make contact with the Animorphs in the first place. So a variety of selection effects are going on here.
