So, R!Animorphs has always been unusual among rational!fic in terms of the number of competent, intelligent characters, simply as a consequence of the shifting viewpoint. As this difference becomes more prevalent (see Tyagi, and now the officer group and Th√†n) we're learning something about the author. I'm currently unsure whether he thinks this sort of competence and agency is more prevalent than do other rational!fic authors, or if just thinks it's an important part of the world we're trying to build, in a way that e.g. Eliezer doesn't seem to, in a "revealed-priorities" sort of way, looking at HPMOR. This is exciting to me for reasons.

(Less interestingly, it may be that [[/u/TK17Studios]] is just better at modeling these sorts of multi-agent scenarios, and writing a story that takes advantage of that.)
