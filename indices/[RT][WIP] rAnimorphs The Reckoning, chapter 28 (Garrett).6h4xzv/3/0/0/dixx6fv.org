I really like the view from inside his head, and I particularly liked Rachel's observations when she morphed him. I've never been diagnosed with anything myself, but I recognize similarities with the way I think, and it reminds me of conversations with various people about how I'm not exactly neurotypical (whatever that actually means).

Anyway, I'm really glad to see Garrett learning to cope with everything, and his friendship with Tobias is particularly touching and inspiring. Thank you.
