oh no! Another Garret chapter! I get why the author is writing his inner thoughts like he does, but Cheezus is it annoying. I can barely make out what he is thinking, wall of text doesn't help when you cant select it (thanks oba-err Fanfiction.net).

Plotwise speaking I can understand why he chose to hide the truth from team on the basis the Chee might be bribed, but if that was a problem why not go up to Madame President, tell her whats happening and then watch as tax money of US dwarfs any puny sum that Esplin can scrounge up.

I am not sure what to think of the new scientist guy, this seems too convenient to be true, either story wise, or "Author warned they might not win at all" wise, or science wise. I get why he can pick up particle emissions of Z-space activity, but recreating similar events on local scale with out a particle accelerator or some sort of exotic matter is dubious to me. Actual physicist please tell if I am reading this whole thing wrong.

The plot point of having a reflector in Jupiters vicinity to detect echoes of particle emissions, is both convenient and troublesome. Who is hiding there? And how long before Yeerks stumble on to a particle scientist and figure out he can help with tech reproduction?
