Try reading on Ao3?

The intended interpretation is that the Z-space barrier is what's reflecting things back. Also, I expect that V3 can offer the Chee way more than Tyagi can (such as a whole planet that's a dog paradise).

I think it'd be far more unrealistic if there was literally nobody else who'd picked up on things early on. It's lucky for them that they got somebody agenty and well-placed, but note that the really big contribution is the locator stuff, not the crappy disintegrator rays that are nowhere near as good as even a handheld shredder.
