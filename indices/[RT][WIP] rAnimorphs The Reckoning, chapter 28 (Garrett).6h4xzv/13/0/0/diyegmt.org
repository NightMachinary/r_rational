Oh yeah, forgot someone always posts an AO3 link right after posting fanfiction link.

V3 is already streched as it is, no way he can outdo a nation/political agrement of all global nations (Tyagi: Pls dont kill or harm dogs, we need it for alien allies to work with us) ok maybe not so easy but still easier than V3 could ever do.

Forgot about the Z anomaly thing. And yeah the locator is miles ahead of any weapon they can, in which case I am not bugged by its existence since exotic particles would be appropriate on exotic tech use. i am bugged at how easy and out of the left field it arrived, and I am bugged at how late it arrived in story once you accept the fact that particle detectors could see whats happening. I guess I am sort of undecided between a "Hard difficulty, no significant help from outside factors" story type and "Global ammount of resources in brainpower being united by a common foe" rational type.
