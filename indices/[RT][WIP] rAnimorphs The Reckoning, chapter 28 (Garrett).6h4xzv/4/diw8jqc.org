I'm guessing the thing around the orbit of Uranus is the Z-space anomaly? I wonder how close to spherical it is and where it's centered.

Whatever it is I'm a little surprised Thàn can work out where it is - did he use a known location of a Z-space event to calibrate the location of the reflector, and then use that to get locations of historical events? (edit: I guess this would actually need to start with several known locations of Z-space events?)

Also, given that it reflects these signals, should we be surprised that it reflects them such that we can pinpoint their origin? I think not (and I can argue why not if we reduce to 2d), but I'm no physicist. Thàn doesn't seem surprised, at least.

Also also, this chapter didn't confuse me with things left unsaid like previous chapters did, so good work on that front. And I appreciate the pronunciation guide.
