Various science experiments of course! Since they are anti-light and anti-heat, check if they have other anti-properties. Do they have a (very weak) anti-gravity field? Could they be related to the dark matter in the universe? When electric current runs through the darkbulb, does the electromagnetic effect have reversed polarity? Are there any supermagnetic effects? Since they are some kind of negative heat energy, can they be used to reach temperatures below absolute zero? Is it more energy efficient to cool temperatures with darkbulbs as opposed to other cooling technologies? Do they allow */backward/* time travel?

If all those experiments fail to produce anything useful, these darkbulbs can still be super useful, so find a way to mass produce them. Shining darkness has all kinds of uses, especially for war. There's a reason why night attacks were so common in wars, because darkness is awesome for hindering your enemies.

You can even launch satellites with lots of solar panels to collect sunlight to power super strong darkbulbs, and place those satellites over enemy countries, creating a permanent night where they live. Without sunlight, their crops will fail and they will slowly starve to death without you needing to send in a single soldier.
