I've been thinking about a magical system that would allow for some magic users to have Skitter-esque abilities and I'm looking for ways to exploit the abilities or minimize things like latency. Let's say certain magic users can only make their magic interface with the cells of biological organisms of a certain “kind” (this part isn't that important). To make physical alterations to an animal physical contact must be made at which point any changes you want to make on the cellular level can be made (no genetic changes except through breeding). A different form of magic (mind magic) can be used to copy and/or induce neuronic functions which does not require physical contact but travels slowly through the air, this can be circumvented to some degree by attaching the magic to sound or light waves. Most animals can produce sound waves so that tends to be what animal users utilize to send intentions and sensory information from themselves to their minions and from their minions back to themselves and between minions (but this means they have a pretty large amount of lag when using animals at long range). So some obvious exploits are using an animal that produces light (like fireflies) to reduce latency but with some drawbacks like not going through opaque objects or if the “kinds” of animals one is using allow for it, sending sound through water would increase the speed sound travels.

​

Something I'm currently brain farting on is if animals with faster reaction times could have some effect on latency or perception of time (Dolichopodidae has been shown to have a visual response time of 2-5ms, human VRT is .25s). I'm also kind of curious if all these interconnected minds would create a low-level superintelligence, maybe not with insects, but if you had one human and a bunch of dogs all communicating their senses and intentions between one another what would be the result?
