With the changes, I still think it's one of very few emotions that wouldn't cripple humanity. Productive direction of hate if people have to stay alive might involve becoming a group that hunts down the apostle of necessary/positive emotions to make sure that they remain available. Still, I expect that if too many good ones are taken, it would be hard to sustain for devotees of hate.
