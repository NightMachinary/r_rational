  With that in mind, I choose "Desire to Become an Apostle" as my emotion, ensuring that no one else will accept the deal and humanity can continue mostly unharmed.

It wouldn't really work, since there are plenty of ways to get the same result using different emotions. Even if you feel no desire to be an apostle, you could feel extreme apathy and just accept because you don't really care one way or another. Or feel impatience and accept because you just want to get things over with. Or feel fear about letting other people become apostles and so accept to be one yourself. Or feel disbelief and say yes to challenge the mysterious being to see if it can really make you an apostle.

  But let's not think in such absolute terms. Maybe apostles are merely masters of emotion, and while other humans seem muted in comparison, they aren't actually brain damaged.

Good idea, I've changed the setting so that the dominion over emotions is gradual, so other humans are merely muted in comparison at first. An apostle must stay alive in one body for 10 years before the dominion is complete to the point where other humans are actually incapable of feeling that emotion.
