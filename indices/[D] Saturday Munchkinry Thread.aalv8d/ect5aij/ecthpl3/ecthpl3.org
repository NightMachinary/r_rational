I looked over the list of emotions on Wikipedia. Any of the choices seem like they would resemble brain damage. The least-bad one I could find was interest, but even that would resemble brain damage if you are always interested regardless of appropriateness for that emotion. Should you feel interest in every advertisement you see? Every bit of gossip? Every meme? Every idea or plan? Every drug? There are times when it is reasonable, appropriate, and even necessary to be disinterested to avoid getting dragged into stupid, useless, self-destructive crap.

Depression and anger without reason for it are both studied as psychological disabilities. I suspect that you would be unable to pick any emotion that could be present at all times and not appear to be a form of brain damage.
