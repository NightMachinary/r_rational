A mysterious being appears in your dreams, and tells you that it is selecting 10 randomly chosen humans to be its apostles in collecting human followers. Each apostle gains the following abilities:

1. Whenever a human swears an oath of devotion to an apostle, that oath is magically binding. From then on they are magically compelled to obey any command given by the apostle to the best of their ability. The oath of devotion is irrevocable (even the apostle cannot cancel it), and can only be sworn once (a human cannot be devoted to multiple apostles).
2. Dominion over an emotion. When you become an apostle, you must choose an emotion that hasn't been chosen by any other apostle. Henceforth you and your devotees will only be able to feel that emotion, while all other humans are unable to feel that emotion.
3. Whenever an apostle dies, their consciousness takes over the body of one of their devotees (randomly chosen). So an apostle only truly dies if there are no more devotees to take over. But even then they can be revived if someone later swears devotion to them.

​

Note: An oath of devotion can be given to an apostle even if the apostle remains anonymous, the potential devotee just has to identify the apostle indirectly in their oath. For example, they can swear an oath of devotion to the nearest apostle, or to the apostle with dominion over emotion X, or even to the apostle that their friend A has sworn devotion to.

​

By chance, you are the first human this mysterious being has contacted. If you refuse its offer, it will simply find other humans until it has 10 apostles. Do you accept its offer? If so, what emotion do you choose and why?

​

EDIT: It seems the original rules had effects that were too drastic to properly munchkin, so let's make some changes:

1) Total dominion over an emotion takes time. An apostle that chooses an emotion gets only 10% (additive) dominion over it per year. What that means is, if the apostle chooses an emotion like "hate", one year later, all non-devotees will feel 10% less hate whenever they feel hate. And 10 years later, only devotees of the apostle will be able to feel any hate.

2) Apostles and their devotees can feel every emotion except those claimed by other apostles.

3) Whenever an apostle dies (even if there are still devotees to take over), the dominion of the emotion resets to 0%. So an apostle has to stay alive in one body for 10 years in order to gain total dominion over an emotion.
