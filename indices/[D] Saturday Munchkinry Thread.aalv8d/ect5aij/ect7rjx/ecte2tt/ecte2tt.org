This sounds like one of the more evil mysterious beings.

An apostle chooses happiness. Every human not sworn to them...becomes depressed? Until they and all their followers die?

Fear. Sadness. Awe. Love. Joy. Curiosity. Nostalgia. Grief. Remorse. A desire for change. Complacency. Contentment. Enlightenment.

The only way an apostle exists and humanity still exists is if

1. The apostle says "humanity" or "human" and they get the full complexity of experience - and everyone else loses it until they swear to them. (Humanity is reduced by a current scale factor of several billion.)
2. An apostle meets aliens, and chooses one of their emotions that humans can't feel (already).
3. An apostle makes up an emotion humans don't feel, or finds a way to make the deal without the emotion aspect - just ~immortality + control of those sworn to you (after they become an apostle).
4. Someone manages to come up with an emotion that doesn't exist anymore, or currently exists only in nonhuman animals.

#+begin_quote
  the potential devotee just has to identify the apostle indirectly in their oath. For example, they can swear an oath of devotion to the nearest apostle, or to the apostle with dominion over emotion X, or even to the apostle that their friend A has sworn devotion to.

1. Instead of specifying the emotion directly, the apostle uses a condition like one of the ones above or "an emotion which humanity is not reduced without, if any".
