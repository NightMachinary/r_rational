You're probably right. :/

This made me think about what it means to want something. Say I was hungry, and I was going to go buy a sandwich--until I noticed I had no money. In that case, do I want money, or a sandwich, or just to not be hungry? Perhaps I want all three?

If I stole the emotion of "desiring to be an apostle", would people be incapable of wanting be an apostle even to fulfill other goals?

Anyways, the other important thing I should remember is that the absence of desire is not desire of absence.
