Are tribalism or uncooperativeness emotions? In either case, this would result in a perfectly unified world after 10 years, which would have a few decades to figure out the Tower of Babel situation when I die and the dominion resets. I would accquire a few apostles younger than me just for the immortality and ability to reorder things if we can't figure out the Babel problem, but getting an army of followers doesn't really appeal to me.
