To repeat everyone else, using this for the being's purpose probably can't go well. With that in mind, if I'm limited to things most people would consider emotions (i.e. nothing incredibly specific), the only thing that seems moral would be to pick hate, attempt to direct it at the being, and kill myself immediately to combat its plans. This would still have a huge impact on humanity, but at least I think it would be a change for the better. Now, the other 9 would be likely to ruin the world, but I have to hope that they would also do their best to limit the damage from removing an emotion entirely.
