[Dungeons and Dragons 5e]

I posted in here a little while back about defending the town, but that endeavour was ultimately successful. By turning the enemies on their own siege engines and decapitating the leadership, the opposing army was turned away and the city saved.

Now, we are the effective rulers of a badly damaged city of 8000 people. With the /Fabricate/ spell, I'll finish rebuilding the destroyed houses and walls in about 4 weeks, but that's not a very time-consuming endeavour. I personally have about 4400gp of wealth, and even that is flexible as I can /Creation/ up gold to give to shopkeeps.

I have about 7 weeks of downtime. I can either [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLdgN05CeM1ZTIInmorsBhDkOdz6RIS-/view?usp=sharing][craft magic items]] or alternately [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RavNnZ3eyD6K3Yosz6dph5vZdotORVvThZI8IXaSl3U/edit?usp=sharing][conduct spell research]]. Crafting magic items (according to the existent ones from WotC seems fairly useful, as for instance a Broom of Flying provides permanent non-concentration, non-attunement flying at the cost of one hand used to hold on. On the other hand, conducting spell research /potentially/ has new and incredibly useful effects. In the spell research document above: * I first list out all the spells I have and brief comments on how they can be used. This is probably not useful to you. * I then list out how those spells can be slightly modified or combined for more effective results. This is what I need help with. Given the base spells that I have available, what avenues of research would be most valuable? What creative applications of old spells in combination or with slight alterations could lead to powerful results?

There are two objectives in particular to optimize for. First, at some time during the downtime, I need to destroy a castle. It's filled with Cthulu cultists who are doing bad things to spacetime, so ideally the destruction of the castle also kills all the cultists but I'm okay with a 2% survival rate. This would be trivial but for the fact that my wizard has sworn to do no harm (hit point damage) personally, so it needs to be outsourced to proxies. Second, the next section of the campaign will involve fighting dragons. A lot of dragons. Anything that's optimized specifically towards that is helpful as well.

So yeah, in summary, I have a lot of free time, and I have to either make items or make new spells to let me destroy a castle and fight some dragons. Any ideas?
