... Uhm.. Fighting lots of dragons, means you need the clone spell, like, yesterday. Or some other way to get back from the dead, because you are going to need it. Repeatedly. Seriously, a campaign to fight dragons in job lot would be challenging if you are a /lich/ - for a wizard... uhm. yhea.

Dragons are smart, rich, long lived, and oh, yes, also enormous fire breathing flying lizards. Those facts are ordered in /descending/ order of threat. Best bet if you cannot render yourself unkillable would be to try and craft a spell that turns this into a campaign of "Lies and Deceptions in caverns" - that is, a disguise as a dragon that will actually hold up to a dragons sensorium and magic, and even then.. Uhm.
