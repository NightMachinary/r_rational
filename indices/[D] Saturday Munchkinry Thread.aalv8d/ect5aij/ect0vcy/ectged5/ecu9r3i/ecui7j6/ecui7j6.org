10th level, so all I've got for now is 5th level spells. Dragons would be incredibly easy to fight if they weren't smart. I've stocked up on techniques to deal with dragons, mostly limiting their 1. Ability to breath weapon, 2. Senses, 3. Ability to flee. With those limited, the first dragon should be possible to fell. From there though, we'll need to keep on pulling new tricks. If these dragons are worth their salt, nothing is going to work twice. Part of why I want to stock up on tricks.

On the other hand, illusions are explosives for socials. If we knew what the dragon in question wanted, we could easily be anyone with the promise of anything at all between the illusion magic I have on hand. And mechanically, the senses that a dragon has aren't different from other senses, things that fool a human with 120ft darkvision and 60ft blindsight and a +12 to Perception will fool a dragon. High bar to hit, but doable.
