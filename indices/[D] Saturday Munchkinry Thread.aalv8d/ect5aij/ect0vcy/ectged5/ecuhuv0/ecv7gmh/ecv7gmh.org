  Yup, that's right. Creation cheesing supplies for research, etc, out of shopkeeps is fairly doable, but more nuanced cons won't work. Still, with Disguise Self, I can do the transaction with any face I want and get away with it.

Not exactly, at least not the easily getting away with it part. If you brush into anything or if anyone touches you with an illusion around you, the illusion will 'clip' through. If you use it to change your apparent height, then merely breathing on a cold winter day or in a smoky or dusty environment could also give away the illusion. As a first-level spell, I suspect most merchants would be fairly aware of it and alert to it.

Creation is a higher level spell, so less common, and I doubt most people capable of casting it would use it to cheat people, simply because of the likely consequences. As such, most merchants will probably be less aware of it. However, once a few merchants start having gold coins disappearing, they'll likely start to understand the scheme and refuse large sales until your money has sat for at least an hour. If you cheated people out of enough money, they might even hire specialists to track you down and force you to pay. You can probably get some use out of this, but don't expect that you'll be able to con people out of 5,000 gp without repercussions.
