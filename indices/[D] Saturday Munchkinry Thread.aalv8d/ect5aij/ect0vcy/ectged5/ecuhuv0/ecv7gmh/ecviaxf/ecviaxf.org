Sure, but I can trivially keep my apparent height the same and use a different face, skintone, hair color, and pretty much any other identifying trait. I doubt there are 21th century level forensics in a fantasy setting. And with MI, I can (without any gesturing), turn the corner into a shop to become a new person, and as I'm leaving become a new person as well.

You're right that cheating people out of any significant amount of money with Creation has negative consequences though. Would it be better to try to run many cons quickly so people don't have time to adapt, or use Teleportation Circle to run cons in many towns at once spread out over a long period of time so that it doesn't draw much suspicion? Either way, seeing as the evidence literally disappears, I'm not sure how exactly I can be tracked down.
