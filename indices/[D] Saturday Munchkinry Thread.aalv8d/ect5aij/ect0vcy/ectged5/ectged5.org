Unless you're using some weird house rule, precious metals made with [[http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/spells/creation.htm][Creation]] only last one hour, so they're worthless for most purposes other than cheating people. Your idea to use Fabricate should be fine though, as long as you have appropriate raw materials to work with.

Your best munchkiny usage of Creation is probably to create vegetable-based fuel materials, like coal, wood, etc. and burn them. For example, a five-foot cube of coal would weigh about 6,250 lb. You could burn it for about ~85 GJ of energy (~24 MWâ‹…h), enough to continuously sustain about a megawatt of output if you cast the spell once per day. You could use that to run a lot of smelters, forges, and kilns, allowing the town to produce large quantities of weapons, armor, tools, and pottery at somewhat reduced cost. The 5E SRD doesn't list a cost for wood or coal, but in 3E and PF it's 1 cp for 20 lb. This would make the spell worth about 3.12 gp in terms of money you could save by not needing to import or locally-produce the coal or firewood.
