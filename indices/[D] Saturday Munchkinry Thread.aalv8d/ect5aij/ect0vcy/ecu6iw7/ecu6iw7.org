You have come into possession of a box of "darkbulbs" - lightbulbs that radiate darkness and shadow instead of light. Specifically, they emit scotons: elementary darkness particles, that counteract photons.

The darkbulbs resemble common household incandescent bulbs, but where one would expect to see a wire filament, there is a small lump of black glass. When the bulb is powered, everything within line of sight of the bulb becomes visibly darkened, with the darkness falling off over distance just as light does, and also reflecting off objects. The darkness feels cool on your skin, and the bulbs become very cold after extended use.

The box comes with 8 bulbs, each rated at 60 watts and 800 fuscens. The brand name is "Moon King", and there is text on the back of the box explaining how to install and use the bulbs, and a support address for somewhere in New Zealand. The package design is functional yet amateurish, and lacks any legal information about the product or company.

What do you do with these bulbs?
