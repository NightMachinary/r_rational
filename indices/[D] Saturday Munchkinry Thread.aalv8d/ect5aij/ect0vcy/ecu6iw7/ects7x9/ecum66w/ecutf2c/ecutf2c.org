Well, I'm thinking of having the "kinds" of animals a magic user is limited to be a subsection of the animal kingdom and how narrow/wide that section is is determined by average brain size (neuron count) within that section. So, someone might get access to the entirety of the phylum Arthropoda and someone else might only get access to a specific family of animals in the phylum Chordata. Also, the number of minions you can control decreases depending on how intelligent the animals are (more complex brains require more magic). You basically either have a large number and variety of dumb animals or a relatively small number of more specific smart animals, so you couldn't have smart animals directing dumber ones.
