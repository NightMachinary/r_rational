/Extremely/ crippling, because even the apostles get shafted. The first apostle to get joy/happiness is going to give literally the entire human race depression, the first apostle to take fear is going to give the human race the capability to commit suicide without second guessing themselves to say nothing of the other stuff that happens, etc.

Emotions are basically how we weight decisions: does this make me happy or sad, will this lead to happiness or sadness, how guilty will this make me, how does this affect other peoples emotions, etc. I'd say that it's impossible to make logical decisions without properly working emotions (see: depression, drugs)

As to the prompt: I'd ask whether the being defines joy and happiness as the same thing, and then take it. I'm probably going to horrifically die from compromised decision making, but at least noone is going to take my happiness away. I'd also hope that contentment is covered under that, or that noone thinks to take it.

Another strategy is which emotion would cripple the other apostles to the point that they're incapable of choosing an emotion. Happiness is probably too general to do that, so hope or excitement might cut out large swathes of the populations. That still leaves anger, spite, and hatred as motivations for choosing an emotion, which might not be the best if you're trying to keep yourself as unmodified as possible.

How fast is it? Is it instant, takes real time, or something else?

I'd also use the fact that I have a monopoly on happiness to get the other apostles to swear an oath to me, simply to find out if killing them will end the curse they inflicted on humanity.
