As others have pointed out, losing emotions is crippling. With that in mind, I choose "Desire to Become an Apostle" as my emotion, ensuring that no one else will accept the deal and humanity can continue mostly unharmed. Hopefully those closest to me take good care of me, thinking I had a stroke or something, but I worry that anyone too motivated to help me will accidentally swear an oath and become another victim.

But let's not think in such absolute terms. Maybe apostles are merely masters of emotion, and while other humans seem muted in comparison, they aren't actually brain damaged. In that case, choosing something like "willingness to work hard" or "intrinsic motivation" seems like a safe bet. Your enemies will have a harder time working against you, your followers will all be effective, and a random person has an incentive to join your slice of the cult because it makes them a more capable human being. And, should you ever be exterminated, there is a decent chance people will accidentally revive you by wishing to be more motivated in the future.

Of course, that selection sort of depends on the human experience requiring intrinsic motivation, which might be a modern development. I'm not sure.
