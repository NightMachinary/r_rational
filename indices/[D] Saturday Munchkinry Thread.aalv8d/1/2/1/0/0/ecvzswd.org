It's about the letter of the law, not the spirit ;) I'm not a pacifist character, quite the opposite. As far as I can tell, as long as I don't personally do harm, anything is kosher, seeing as I've Hold-Person'd people to be killed, trapped monsters in Walls of Force, buffed allies/Slow'd enemies and generally helped my team be better at killing.
