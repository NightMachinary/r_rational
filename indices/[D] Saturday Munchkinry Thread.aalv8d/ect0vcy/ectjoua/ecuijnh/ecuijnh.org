Yeah, transmute rock was my big idea. The castle is on a cliff, so if I can subtly Transmute away most of the cliff face, then the castle would presumably collapse. Though I can't cause the collapse myself, so I would just have to render it dangerously unstable and make someone else collapse it. I wonder how bad of an idea it would be to make a small tunnel in the cliff face to start working on that.

I feel like +1 to saves won't be that much. We sadly don't have a paladin to boost up our saving throws, and not everyone has Wisdom save proficiency or wants to get Resilient (Con). I will have Absorb Elements prepared and I will probably try to produce items of Absorb Elements for my allies so that they can take half from the breath weapons.
