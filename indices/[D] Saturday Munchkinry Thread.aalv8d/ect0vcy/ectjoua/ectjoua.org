transumute rock, a 5th level spell from xanathars(p.169), will help you with the castle. turn a 40' cube of stone wall/tower into mud from 120' away.

for the dragons, 1st suggestion would be a ring or cloak of protection for everyone on your team. the +1 to save is a nice bonus, and everyone will be making wisdom saves vs fear and dex saves vs breath. generally you want to find solutions that help solve those two problems. there is a level 1 reaction spell that will give you resistance, absorb elements (xanathars, p.150). have that prepared and you will be able to take half damage when the dragon breathes on you- it can save your life (unless its a green dragons poison).
