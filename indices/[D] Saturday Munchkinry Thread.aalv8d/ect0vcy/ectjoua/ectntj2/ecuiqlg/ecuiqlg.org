Beacon of Hope is a really good spell, huh. We have a Warlock (Celestial) 5/Sorcerer (??) 6 in the party, and I'm really hoping that said Sorcerer levels are in Divine Soul, so that we can get Beacon of Hope. Unfortunately, we both lack rogues, and people with decent Dex/Con saves. I'm thinking of picking up the Lucky feat just to give myself a second chance on those.
