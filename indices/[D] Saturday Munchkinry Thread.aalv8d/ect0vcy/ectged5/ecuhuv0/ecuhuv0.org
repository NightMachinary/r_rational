Yup, that's right. Creation cheesing supplies for research, etc, out of shopkeeps is fairly doable, but more nuanced cons won't work. Still, with Disguise Self, I can do the transaction with any face I want and get away with it.

I hadn't thought of using Creation to produce coal for fuel. Because I'm an illusionist with Malleable Illusion, I can refresh the coal ash into fresh coal /every round/, so the potential for cheese there is waaayyy higher. If I spent a 6 level slot, I can get a 10 ft cube of coal, or 50,000lbs by your measurement. That's potentially 8000lbs of coal fed into a furnace /a second/, supposing all of it gets burned. What munchkinry is available with that kind of matter throughput?

The main Creation-cheese idea I had was (spoilers if you want to chew on the problem)producing tightly wound up springs and using them to fire projectiles, which according to calcs might hit Mach 15, so definitely in the range of castle-demolishing. More ideas there are always helpful though.
