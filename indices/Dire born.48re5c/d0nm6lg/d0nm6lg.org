I liked it. Solid superhero fiction. Definitely not highly rational, but you can follow most of the decisions and actions made by the characters, and a significant amount of the content is foreshadowed sufficiently, but not too openly. As mentioned by others below, there is a lot of off-screen data finding it's way on-screen, but the writer is attempting to emulate a thinker AND tinker super.

Think chaotic good female Doctor Doom with no magical ability.
