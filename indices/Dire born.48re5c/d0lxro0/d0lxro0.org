As a fan of superheroic written fiction, it's incredibly good, and well-recommended for anyone who could stomach or even stand the genre in the slightest. Very well-grounded and human characters, lots of background detail, an interesting world, and a lot of stuff to make you care. My only complaint from that perspective is that, like Swann's /Forests of the Night/, it tends to be /too/ comicky, throwing in too many different sources of Weird Stuff and doing too varying a level of homework for each. It does so better than Swann, though.

I read it in a day, and went looking for the next (currently unreleased?) book.

As rationalist fiction, I'm not sure I can recommend it so heavily. The main character's willpower/psuedo-rationality is an explicit superpower, while almost all other characters operate at a significantly lower level of reason. While seldom so bad as to break suspension of disbelief, probably not a good way to think, and lends to the aforementioned Weird Stuff coming out of nowhere.

It also tends to have the character lose for reasons the character did not and could not have predicted. That's an in-genre convention, probably necessary when the main character is a superhumanly good planner, and Dire: Born does it significantly more lightly than Worm or even Erfworld. But it does break the "fairplay whodunnit" feeling.
