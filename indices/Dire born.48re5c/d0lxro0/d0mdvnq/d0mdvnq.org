I also find this an incredibly fun read, but not explicitly rational.

Dire solves problems a lot of the time with super-tech or planning with information she is given offscreen which is revealed in flashback after the fact. And there is a lot of hidden information and diabolus ex machina that requires a bit of seat of your pants improvisation (something it is explicitly mentioned that Dire excels at, and this is where she starts to learn it).

There are some well placed and clear Chekov's Guns, good foreshadowing, and while I figured out /what/ the antagonists really were almost immediately, /who/ it was still a good reveal and an interesting read. I'd recommend it highly.
