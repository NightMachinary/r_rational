Just came in over the extropy mailing list, it might be that Dark Matter mystery is solved. Primordial (directly from the big bang) Black Holes in the correct mass range of 10<X<100.

Basically <10 and >100 solar masses (SM) Black Holes have been ruled out otherwise. Remember the big press in february? "LIGO detects finally existence of gravitational waves" - a two BH merger 29SM+36SM. Right dab in the middle of the necessary band.

And the kicker? Nobody expected that observation so fast after LIGO went online - could be coincidence but is also evidence that such mergers happen much more often than expected, eg. there are much more BHs in the correct range.

And heres the paper: [[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/823/2/L25]]
