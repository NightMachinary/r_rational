  What is true is already so.
  Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
  Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
  And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
  Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
  People can stand what is true,
  for they are already enduring it.

  If I* survive the teleport,
  I desire to believe that I* survive the teleport;
  If I* do not survive the teleport,
  I desire to believe that I* do not survive the teleport;
  Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.

Epistemic rationality must pursue truth above all else, or it cannot be useful! Giving up truth for utility is a /very unsafe/ area of instrumental rationality, and likely to be bad for your health (by, eg., inducing suicide-via-teleport).
