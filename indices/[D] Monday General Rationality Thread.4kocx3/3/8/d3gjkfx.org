  The thing I now don't understand: How could we possibly know which theory of identity is correct?
#+end_quote

What's the effective difference between them? If there isn't one, then whether you define it as dying-transporting-living or deconstruction-transporting-reconstruction is not really important. They are effectively identical, minus the emotional value.

#+begin_quote
  It might also be, that there is an objectively correct theory of identity, but I'm hard pressed to come up with even a hypothetical experiment that could test this.
#+end_quote

It might be that there is an objectively correct answer to Theseus's ship, but, like the transporter problem, it's much more probable that's it just semantics, and there isn't really a reason to think otherwise.
