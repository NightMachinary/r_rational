This is always been something that bothered me about the idea of uploading and copying a person's mind, how do we know how this will effect their sense of identity? One exploration of this idea I REALLY liked was in the webcomic El Goonish Shive: One character was permanently split into two people and they ended up identifying as two different people with distinct personalities despite their shared memories. One of them decided they weren't the original, they were a new person that came into existence during the split. Not that it wasn't really difficult to accept, but it worked out.
