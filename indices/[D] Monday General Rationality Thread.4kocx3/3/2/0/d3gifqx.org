One could argue their new perspective on their identity was already given by the beliefs of the character before the split. But I agree that having decided on a theory of identity is one thing, but actually being in a situation where that's relevant is another. I think I would react in the same way as the character, but I don't really know that for sure. I can imagine changing my mind quite fast when suddenly seeing a person that looks exactly like me.
