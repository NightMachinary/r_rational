I'm of the opinion that you die, but the other you at the other end is 'you' in every way that matters. They have the same memories, the same experiences, the same physicals, etc. The only difference is the atoms that make up the body, and if that is enough to bother the new you, then they just have to remember that, ten years down the line, pretty much all of your atoms have been replaced, the only difference being the timescale.

I'm much more worried about what to do with the gaseous human on the transmitting end.
