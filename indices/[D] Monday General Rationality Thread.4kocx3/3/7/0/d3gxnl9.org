  I'm of the opinion that you die, but the other you at the other end is 'you' in every way that matters.

I've been a bit confused about this, personally. I agree with pretty much everything, but I can't wrap my head around the part where it's okay to end my subjective experience because another version of me is running around. That's the part that matters to me. I picture being scanned and a copy constructed somewhere else, but I can't figure out why I should then deconstruct myself just because the copy might as well be me. We'll have differing subjective experiences the moment that we "split", right? Shouldn't that be taken into account?
