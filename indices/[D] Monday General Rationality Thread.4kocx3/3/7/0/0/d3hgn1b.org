Yeah, there isn't really a reason to deconstruct the original, other than it being stated in the premise as a teleporter. Maybe there's some reason why it can't just scan you and reconstruct somewhere else, but has to deconstruct to scan. Anyway, the original not dying is clearly the better option, but I think that it's only upon the reconstruction where the two 'you's start having differing experiences, so you start becoming different people in a personality sense of things.

This is reminding me of a game I recently played, Choice of Robots. If you make certain choices in the game, then you're able to scan your brain and upload it into a robot body, keeping or losing your original dying body. The question posed is whether it's you or someone else with your experiences and personality. I'm of the opinion it's still you, built upon the same base personality and experiences. If there are two versions of you and one moves to Asia and the other stays in Europe/America, then will they become different persons? I don't think so, I think they'll become two of the same person, with differing experiences.
