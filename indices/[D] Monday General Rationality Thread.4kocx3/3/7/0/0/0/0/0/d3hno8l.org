Right but that implies if you got sudden amnesia you would die since you lack any experience to link prior you to you.\\
However there's no reason to think from a subjective perspective you would suddenly cease experiencing.\\
So the important distinction is between your identity which is what you seem to be talking about, and continuity of your minds experience.

When I said your body I was including your brain, so I was talking about a situation where your brain is rewired so you are basically a copy of someone else, however you remain conscious for the entire process.

The importance distinction here, is that if you have a copy of you somewhere, that doesn't mean that if the copy that is you explodes, that you somehow continues experiencing, and so that's still for all intensive purposes subjective death.
