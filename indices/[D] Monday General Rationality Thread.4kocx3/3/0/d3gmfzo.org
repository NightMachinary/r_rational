Or, to put in another way, does the world work differently if different theories of identity are correct? What would you expect to change, depending on which one is right?

Nothing. "Theory of identity" isn't a prediction about reality, it's not epistemic rationality. It's instrumental rationality, it's a question of how /you/ should behave, and you need to answer it like it's a question of how you should behave.
