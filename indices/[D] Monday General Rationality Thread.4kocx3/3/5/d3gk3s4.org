  The thing I now don't understand: How could we possibly know which theory of identity is correct?
#+end_quote

This is not a question of objective fact, but a question of categorisation and values. Such are usually confirmed or busted by revealed preferences.

Which theory of identity is more useful to you, in the 'provides most value / least distress' metric?

(and why do you insist on killing the poor non-teleporting sap? Live and let live!)
