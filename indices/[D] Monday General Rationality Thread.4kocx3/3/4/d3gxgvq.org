See the problem is it still deals with a situation that has only one answer. Either your experience ends from your perspective or it continues, and your feelings on the matter should have no affect on the outcome so picking the option most pleasing to you is a horrible idea.

Obviously few people here are going to seriously suggest that it matters whether the copy is made of the same material as you. I think it can be similarly argued, that it also doesn't matter whether the scan is destructive or not, since that shouldn't affect whether the copy is you or not.

A transporter that doesn't disassemble you, and just scans you and makes a copy of you on the other side is the same except it doesn't disassemble you. So I can't imagine how you would argue that the person on the other side is you in one scenario but not another.

I think a lot of confusion arises when people fail to distinguish between different definitions of "/you/" for instance if you only care about your personality persisting then amnesia is death, but similarly if you believe a multiverse probably exists then you shouldn't fear death since there will nearly certainly be exact copies of you who didn't die.

I can't seem to really find any remotely satisfactory solution to identity except that you are simply defined by your continuous mental process, and should that ever cease you would die. To preempt a common response (though whether it's scary has no bearing on it's validity), I don't think sleep means death. I used to suspect it might, however I now think some experience almost certainly happens during sleep but you just don't generally remember it.

For instance plenty of people don't remember ever having a dream, however we know that dreams are universal. We also know that people have dreams during non-REM sleep, but few remember them because they are less vivid and disjointed, often replaying recent experiences.

So we already know from this that we have massive chunks of our experience that we are unaware of, so I can't be so sure that any part of sleep is really a true cessation of experience, after all you get a sense of time having passed whenever you sleep as opposed to anesthesia where it feels like you just skipped forward in time.

On a personal note I can't really deny that I vaguely experience things during all of my sleep, because I can remember the vague sort of thoughtless experience of deep sleep, the more relaxed and incoherent it is the more unpleasant it is if you are woken up.
