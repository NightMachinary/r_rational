Really interesting. I have to imagine there's somewhat of a spectrum though.

I can definitely visualize a beach, but I wouldn't exactly describe it as anything like looking at something and I'd be hard pressed to say it was in color at least not unless I specifically tried to think of colors. I also don't seem to ever really have visual dreams, though that might just be the way I remember in general.
