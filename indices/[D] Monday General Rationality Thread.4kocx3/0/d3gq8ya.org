This [[http://www.vox.com/2016/5/19/11683274/aphantasia][article]] on aphantasia was interesting reading to me. I know, intellectually, that a lot of people think and interact with the world differently from the way I do. Reading about someone whose mind works in such an unusual way is an interesting experience, and has me wondering: what parts of my own thinking are as strange and I haven't noticed it, because I assume all people think like this?
