This article made me aware that the quality of my visualisation is severely lacking. I visualise things in very low detail, and often there's an awareness of a visual fact more than there is any sensation of specifics.

To put it another way, when I visualise something it feels like I've seen a blurry picture of it and there's somebody with corrective lenses explaining the finer detail to me.
