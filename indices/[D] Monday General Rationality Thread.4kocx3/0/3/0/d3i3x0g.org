Eh, I think you just have a misconception of what this actually means. Just because I don't visualize things doesn't mean I can't imagine the things I read in fiction, or daydream. It just means those activities skip the visual layers, and jump directly to the processing level. So I don't 'see' things but I still feel things similar to what you feel when daydreaming. Just without the visual impressions.
