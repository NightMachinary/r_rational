  (is that a thing that happens to people who can visualize things? Or is the imaginary visual experience lower fidelity, and doesn't have any things you haven't noticed previously? I'd be suspicious of making things up there though...)

This is a tricky question, as it's possible to describe the details of a painting from memory with increased fidelity the more you concentrate on doing so, but there's also a risk of suggestibility (if someone prompts you to remember it a different way) and natural error. It usually would sound something like this:

The Mona Lisa is a lady looking at the viewer while smiling slightly with folded hands.

/imagines Mona Lisa for two minutes/ Okay, so the Mona Lisa is a lady looking at the viewer, with a slight smile on her face and her hands crossed in her lap... she has dark hair and dark clothing, with a splash of color at the chest, either a different piece of clothing under her dress or bare skin, can't remember. The background... I want to say earthy? Like she's in the woods, or a cabin or something, something behind her has dark brown colors, the image keeps shifting in my head between a wooden wall and actual trees right behind her.

/googles Mona Lisa/ Lady, smiling, dark hair and dress, bare chest-area, hands folded, woods in the background but farther back than I remembered, with a winding path closer to her and what looks like mountains in the far distance, which I completely failed to remember.

Memory doesn't bring up perfect images, but impressions can still form an image in new or familiar ways, and cross checking with others can be used to either increase fidelity ("Was there a bird?" "I don't think so, that doesn't look right." "I think there were trees in the distance." "Maybe? Yeah, that looks familiar...") or introduce error ("I'm sure that she's in a building." "Yeah, I think you're right, it was a building... maybe with a window?")
