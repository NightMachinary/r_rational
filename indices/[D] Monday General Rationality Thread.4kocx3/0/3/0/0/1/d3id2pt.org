Hm, well, this is generally hard to describe because I definitely don't have specialized vocabulary. But for example I have the same internal experience viewing a painting in real life and remembering viewing that painting, in terms of what mood it puts me in and what it makes me feel. But I don't 'see' the painting, the visual aspect is removed, and I couldn't for example notice something I didn't notice before. (is that a thing that happens to people who can visualize things? Or is the imaginary visual experience lower fidelity, and doesn't have any things you haven't noticed previously? I'd be suspicious of making things up there though...)

So unless we perceive things differently in general, not just in imagination, I think this can't have that much impact.

And imagination works similar to recall, except the thing you're recalling didn't actually happen.
