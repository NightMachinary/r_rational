I don't wish to make you feel bad about your experience of the world. If you say you "just skip the visual layers," and that nothing substantial is lost from that (or the loss of the other senses in memory/imagination), then I'm okay with just accepting that for the sake of politeness. But in the back of my mind, it's like hearing someone with complete color blindness insist that they can enjoy a painting just as well as anyone else. Intellectually I'm glad to hear it, but deep down it rings false.

Perhaps that's just my bias, for now, or a lack of understanding. In any case it's clearly not as important as I would have thought before learning this was a thing.
