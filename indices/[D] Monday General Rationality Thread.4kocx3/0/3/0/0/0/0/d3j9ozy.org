Yeah : / I'm sure there are other more specialized skills that I myself am missing and just don't feel the lack of because they're not as "common" though.

For example, I've always wondered what it was like to compose music: I can read notes and even memorize songs, but feel utterly incapable of creating new ones. I've tried before and it's like reaching my hand into a void, like imagining a new color. I can't even imagine what it might be like to do so. Someone very musically inclined who writes songs would probably feel a similar sense of horror at contemplating my inability to do what they can.
