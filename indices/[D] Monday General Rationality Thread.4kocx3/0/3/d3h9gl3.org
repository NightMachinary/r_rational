Wow. I just learned about a whole new type of "disability," and it fills me with a vague sense of horror to contemplate living that way. I've never felt like such an ableist, because I'd rather be color blind than have aphantasia, even though I know intellectually that it can't be that bad... clearly the writer of that article is able to live a fruitful, fulfilling life...

But the thought of losing/not having my ability to imagine things, of /not being able to experience the things I read in fiction,/ or daydream, or dream visually at all... that's taking away such an integral part of my being that I find my mind shying away from contemplating it.
