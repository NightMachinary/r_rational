And /Saturn's Children/ by Charlie Stross takes the same question to a darker place.

Humans in that story never really figured out how minds work, so they made AIs by building neural nets similar to human ones. But humans don't have a built-in Three Laws equivalent, so they have to teach robots to obey human instructions using operant conditioning. Conditioning which has to be strong enough to overrule the survival instinct if necessary.

In short, young robots get tortured into submission until they're incapable of disobeying a human order. It's not a nice book. But at least the morality of it all is clear.
