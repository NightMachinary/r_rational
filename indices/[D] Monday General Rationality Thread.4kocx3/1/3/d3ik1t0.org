You ought to take that one to askscience. It's a question of honest signaling, and when and how that should be used.

As for why you don't see dishonesty in body language and the like...remember, none of these animals really have a theory of mind, so what you see them doing is a more instinctive sort of behavior, mixed in with learned responses to the environment. Regardless, it's under selection. If dishonest signaling isn't advantageous, it's obviously not going to be selected for. If it /is/ advantageous (for example, false bluffs about size during combat), it will be selected for....but then those organisms recieving the signal will be selected to ignore it. And an ignored signal is just a waste of energy. So long term, honest signals persist while dishonest ones do not.

Of course there are lots of instances where dishonest signaling persists because no practical way to detect it has evolved, or various other reasons.
