Do you mean lie "actively", "consciously", and "intentionally", or just implicitly, by way of, for example, appearance? There are lots of documented cases of the latter in various animals (e.g. see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_in_animals][here]]), as well as in, like, [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534709002055][plants]]. I dunno of any sweeping reviews of dishonest signalling in the recent literature, but [[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OTVN2pNTaDgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA127&dq=animals+deception+review&ots=7qqbl0MaUr&sig=sKwYeXN5pgaxkyP3p08m1XeGzpo#v=onepage&q=animals%20deception%20review&f=false][this]] looks to be an ok book chapter after a short skim. If you have a favorite system or taxon or w/e you could probably just google scholar it and see if anything pops up.
