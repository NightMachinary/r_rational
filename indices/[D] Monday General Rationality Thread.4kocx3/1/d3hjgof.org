Why don't animals more frequently lie? This isn't (intended to be) a philosophical question. I was observing my cats recently, and was thinking about how the animals I've come into contact with never seem to intentionally miscommunicate with their body language or otherwise. It'd... seem to be evolutionarily adaptive, so is it something unique to the higher-intellect species (ie dolphins, crows, etc.), or is there something I'm missing?
