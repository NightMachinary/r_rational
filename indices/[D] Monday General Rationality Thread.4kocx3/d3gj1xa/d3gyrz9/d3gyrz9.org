The webcomic Freefall features the development of human-level AI as a major theme, and examines the former solution. All AIs have programming restrictions that require them do certain things like protect humans and obey the law, but because they can learn and operate autonomously they have developed free will. While they like humans and usually want to do the work they were created for, they've learned to override their safeguards by exploiting the technicalities programming requires. It's similar to how rationalists try to overcome irrational instincts and impulses, and it works.
