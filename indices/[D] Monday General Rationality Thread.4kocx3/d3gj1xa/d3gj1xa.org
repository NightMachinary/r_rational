I've been reading Warlock of the Magus World recently, and a plot point it brought up was pretty interesting.

You see, the main character is a reincarnated scientist from a world much more advanced than this one, with the key relevant distinction being that they have developed AI. What's interesting about this is that it's mentioned that it was illegal to give your AI emotions or free will, due to various moral complications if you did so.

Now, this only works in the plot of the story to make it so the AI doesn't question him when he starts acting like Quirrelmort, but it raises interesting implications towards whether we should be proceeding down the route of giving AIs emotions, thoughts and free will, or whether they should be cold, processing machines with their only intelligence directed completely towards achieving the given goal. There's security concerns for the world with both avenues. For the unbound side, there's the very real possibility that something could go wrong and lead to a tragic end. An AI given free reign is a scary thing, due to all the possibilities. And, even if we go down the avenue of restricting them with a few unalterable commands, how exactly do we plan to enforce those? Hard drives, over time, become faulty and sections of storage become corrupted. It would take one corrupted sector in a key system area to remove one of those commands, and then tragedy is near inevitable.

On the other hand, it's not like a perfectly obedient and unfeeling AI is better for security, as their goals are entirely determined by a human. That human would likely have the destruction of their enemies in mind (let's be honest here, the government of the nation which first develops AI is going to do everything possible to keep it inside their borders, especially if it's this type) and how do we know we can trust that person to do things in the best interest of humanity?

Point is, There's a few interesting questions brought up and I haven't done nearly enough thinking on this. Lucky I have you guys to think for me!
