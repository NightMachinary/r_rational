As an aside, I'm one of the people with no real visualization capability.

The specifics are a bit different then what appears in the article, I generally have a pretty good sense of direction, as an example.

I noted it about myself before that article made the rounds.

But it does bring up the point that I think I might be slowly losing the ability to do the same with sounds.
