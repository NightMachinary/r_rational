On the other hand I just imagined myself losing the ability to do a similar thing with sounds, and I do get a similar sense of horror and loss as you mentioned. Obviously amplified by general aversion to change, but still.

And someone claiming they can enjoy imagining music without actually being able to hear it I would treat with similar polite scepticism.

So hey, maybe I am missing something valuable; not much that can be done about it though.
