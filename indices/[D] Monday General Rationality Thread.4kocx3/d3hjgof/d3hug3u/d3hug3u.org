I think its like skyshayde described and also may be related to their difficulty connecting cause and effect across long temporal periods. Its said for example that dogs in training need to be punished or rewarded as they're commiting the deed so that their brains can associate the action with the desired outcome.

If they are punished or rewarded afterwards, they only get confused as the cause since they can't associate having commited a deed some time in the past and the reward/punishment they are receiving in the now.

There's a big chance most animals can't correlate things either and as such won't consider creating more complex lying actions beyond the immediate fight/flight impulse.
