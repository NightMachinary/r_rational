SPOILERS AHEAD FOR A STORY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND

A significant fact to take into account is that the two did look different. In fact, the "clone" was a different gender than the "original". It could have been a pragmatic decision to think of them as different people, and it had been a very intense couple of days when they did, but over the course of the story they both believably found happiness and self acceptance.
