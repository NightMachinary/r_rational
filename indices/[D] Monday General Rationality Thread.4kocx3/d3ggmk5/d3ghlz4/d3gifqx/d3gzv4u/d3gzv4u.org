I forgot to explain how the person reacted. The split was accidental and the original's immediate response was to try to comfort the confused panicking girl claiming to be him. He was far more worried about how long she would live if her body was artificial, and even claimed to be the clone to protect her without a second thought. He didn't care which of them was which, he just acted like they were both their own person and she needed help more than he did.
