There is one thing about the Teleporter Problem, that I don't understand and maybe someone can help me with that.

In the Teleporter Problem we have a hypothetical teleporter machine, that works by scanning your body down to some arbritrary scale (let's say atoms), disassembling your body in the progress and then reassembling you from different atoms at the target location.

There are variants of this, without the disassembly or sending your atoms to the location at near-lightspeed and so on. But I guess the base variant is enough here.

Now, if we apply different theories of identity to this problem, we might get as result, that this machine does not in fact teleport you, but kills you and creates a copy at the other end. With other theories, everything is a-okay and you can enjoy your day trip to Mars.

The thing I now don't understand: How could we possibly know which theory of identity is correct?

It might be that the "correct" answer is subjective and we can choose any theory we like. Yay, death-free teleportation!

It might also be, that there is an objectively correct theory of identity, but I'm hard pressed to come up with even a hypothetical experiment that could test this. And given the lack of Noble Prices for presenting a correct theory of identity, I doubt someone else has.

So, what? How can we try to resolve this? The Teleporter Problem itself has reached broad audiences but any video/article/whatever I've seen conveniently skipped the part about deciding which theory of identity to use.
