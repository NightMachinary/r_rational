Such interpretations can't be right or wrong. The question "Do I die when I use the teleporter?" is vacuous - even if you somehow knew the answer, it wouldn't actually tell you anything. And that's the same reason why you can't devise an experiment to test it.

It's a pointless question with a pointless answer.
