I'm not sure of the answer but I wanted to point out something I think is important.

You used the word Reassembled. This word is already loaded with an assumption that conserves identity across the timeline of the teleportation, implying causality in a way.

I think it would be more accurate to say a person is disassembled, then, a person is assembled.
