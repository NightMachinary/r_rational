There is no "correct" theory of identity. It's purely a categorization problem, like [[https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/]["is #e03803 red or orange?"]] or else [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/]["Is a whale a fish?"]]. The only question left is which theory produces useful results.
