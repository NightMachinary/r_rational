Yes, I was being a bit facetious. Just picking whatever theory I like is a horrible idea. That leads back to my original question: How could we even know?

If identity is really just a categorization problem, then there is no right and no wrong answer and we're back at "pick what you like". If there is a kernel of objectivity somewhere, then we can talk about weeding out the obviously wrong ones.
