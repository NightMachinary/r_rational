  Mwhahaha, catch me if you can!

  I can still be naughty. Wheee!
#+end_quote

But apparently not out loud? Another thing pointing to how her mental censorship is speech-focused instead of general.

#+begin_quote
  How uppity can I sound? “Maaaaybe?”
#+end_quote

And "no" is not in her vocab anymore even when she tests its limits. Someone better be spiked for this until the spikes grow spikes for him daring to not gracefully receive them.

#+begin_quote
  if I was an animal like that cacodemon we saw,I'd take one taste of you and it'd tear me to bits.
#+end_quote

Huh? Why's that? Did I forget something?

#+begin_quote
  separated separated
#+end_quote

Duplicate word.

  ‘Expecto Patronum', you have to go look the words up to really know and yet it kinda feels like you know what the spell's going to be as soon as you hear the words
#+end_quote

I somehow feel like HPMOR readers will have a more intuitive understanding of this feeling :D

#+begin_quote
  Ugh, listen to me, who's topping this? It's just, I know what I'm doing...
#+end_quote

Oh girl. A sub is allowed to teach an inexperienced dom how to tie knots that are both secure and riskless. Would be useful to be able to let go of who's topping at least during conversations that are both constructive /and/ vital, wouldn't it?

#+begin_quote
  I wish I could just hand you an iconography sampler. Is there a way to communicate this so you'll be coming up with the idea on your own, instead of following instructions? That'll help so much, if I can just...eh, nothing for it.
#+end_quote

So the dislike for teaching seems to e her own personal personality trait, not tied to an actual dislike of being taught by her master. Maybe the first distinctly independent trait I noticed. Interesting. If only it weren't such a sad and annoying one ;P

#+begin_quote
  “Try to remember you're not in church, Altar Boy.
#+end_quote

Wait, what? So all that forced 'Master' speech even when she didn't want to just required that she try a bit harder? That's definitely not how it seemed in the previous chapter.

#+begin_quote
  below (I thought, before, that the ship must have leveled out as we boarded, but no: we've been diving straight down the whole time, Lyra and I have just been standing on impossible artificial gravity rocks as we are now) us
#+end_quote

I would recommend against separating the phrase "below us" in the middle and in favor of instead putting the parenthesis after the "us". As an attachment to the "below" the "us" seems to lose its meaning in the flow when one has read so many other words in between.

#+begin_quote
  “That's waterfalls. From the back.”
#+end_quote

I have difficulty understanding what you're going for here It doesn't seem as simple as a waterfall flowing in the wrong direction.

#+begin_quote
  “Dont keep me...” Blech, pillow-stuff. God, so picky.
#+end_quote

So... did the censorship allow her to start the sentence and utter enough of it to be a demand of some kind but then somehow not finish it into a meaningful command?

All in all another fun chapter. I hope I didn't come over as too nitpicky. I pretty much just quoted and commented as I read through whenever something peaked interest or otherwise made me mull. Kind of neglected to point out the parts that simply made me go "wow!" or "cool!" or "hot!" but rest assured that those definitely existed.
