I read that more in the sense of a teasing "Is that why your imaginary friend hated us back when he existed?", Not "Is that why Jahova hated us back when he was a tangible entity?"

On the other hand, Lyra started as an imaginary friend, and most polytheistic deities are anthropomorphic, I would not be remotely surprised if most known deities were originally succubi, and heroic humans or demigods being their hosts.

I would absolutely love to see this world's version of Orpheus and Eurydice.
