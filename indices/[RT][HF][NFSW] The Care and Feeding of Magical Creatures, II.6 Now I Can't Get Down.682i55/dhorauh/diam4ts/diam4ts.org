  And "no" is not in her vocab anymore even when she tests its limits. Someone better be spiked for this until the spikes grow spikes for him daring to not gracefully receive them.

I feel the need to word-of-god this because it seems like what's going on with the voice bondage stuff isn't clear: she could have easily said anything from "don't wanna" to "fuck no" to "Okay Master." here. "Maaaybe" was just what she calculated to be the SAMmiest thing she could do in the circumstance.

  So the dislike for teaching seems to e her own personal personality trait
#+end_quote

Word-of-god on what's going on: yes, she dislikes teaching her master even though as you say there's no reason a more experienced sub can't to say nothing of shouldn't teach good and safe technique whenever it makes sense (as it very does here). What this reveals (although its been a bit buried in the text) is that although she has quite a lot of book learning and knows the language, as we've seen just in the previous exposition-orgy she's been avoiding actually /playing/ very much and so is a well-educated but inexperienced submissive and didn't really believe all the people who told her what you just said about teaching.

  not tied to an actual dislike of being taught by her master.
#+end_quote

Did you mean "actual dislike of teaching her master" (which preference she's going to get mighty much opportunity to reconsider as things progress), or what you typed (in which case I've misunderstood something)?

#+begin_quote
  Wait, what? So all that forced 'Master' speech even when she didn't want to just required that she try a bit harder? That's definitely not how it seemed in the previous chapter.
#+end_quote

Word-of-god: it happens when she's not paying attention or actively working against it with concentration. This and the next hing you called out...

#+begin_quote
  So... did the censorship allow her to start the sentence and utter enough of it to be a demand of some kind but then somehow not finish it into a meaningful command?
#+end_quote

...may give some more idea of what's going on with her voice. Thus indicating that whatever is doing this isn't doing it at the level of rewriting her thoughts, but rather responding to her actions. She was talking fast here because of rattling off instructions, and so outran it for a moment.

And it's unfortunately not clear from the text whether she's responding to a powerful negative experience or something more like a somatically expressed surfacing of unconscious knowledge (see Blindsight by Peter Watts, which is itself excellent rational cosmic horror).

  I have difficulty understanding what you're going for here It doesn't seem as simple as a waterfall flowing in the wrong direction.
#+end_quote

Seeing as I had a hard time imagining it too, I'm not surprised, especially since several impossible things are happening. What they're seeing is a freestanding airbubble submerged in the Sea, several miles along its longest dimension. There are some asteroids stuck on its boundary, and gravity is arranged paralell to the boundary so that where the water interfaces with the air bubble there's a net flow that creates the appearance of waterfalls from within the bubble. They're seeing all this from a viewpoint outside the bubble, submerged in the True Sea.

...that's not any clearer. Fuck.

/waves hands/ it's not how gravity works

  I hope I didn't come over as too nitpicky. I pretty much just quoted and commented as I read through whenever something peaked interest or otherwise made me mull.
#+end_quote

Not at all! I've already filed you under "useful mostly negative criticism" but /much more importantly/ you're asking the kinds of questions I'm trying to get people thinking about overall with this book and I really appreciate your attempt to take what's going on as an actual scene an actual dominant and submissive played out and not just a hot fantasy. I'm trying to write that - real BDSM with fantastic situations, toys, and characters with certain superpowers, but real play and real consequences (which we haven't had time in the story yet to see really, keep in mind they're still on day 0).

So I really, really value your commentary.
