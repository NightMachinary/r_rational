Nice update. More world building, with tie ins back to real world religion stuff, and of course the standard, kinky sexual byplay we've come to expect from this story. I must admit, I'm still more than a bit confused by why Lyra seems limited in what she says, but I suppose I missed something or I'll simply learn why that is in time.

Any plans on what sort of update schedule you'll be looking at moving forward?
