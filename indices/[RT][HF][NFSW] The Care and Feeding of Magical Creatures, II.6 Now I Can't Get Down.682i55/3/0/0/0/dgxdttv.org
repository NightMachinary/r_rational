I can't say a lot without being spoileriffic (PM for details), but I can say...let's think about the True Sea and how that works, and what our narrator may have missed looking at it and the fact that "Spirit" is a thing you can distill out of it.

I will also let slip that you can definitely find electromagnetism and baryonic matter in the the True Sea, but we've already seen this.
