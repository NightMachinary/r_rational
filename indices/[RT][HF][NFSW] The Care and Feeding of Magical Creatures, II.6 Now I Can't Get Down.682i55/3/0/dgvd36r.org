This was something I almost actually took out because I think it's unclear to the reader. The answer, of course, is that he's /wrong/, but that his obsession with this issue tells us something about what's happening to him mentally at this moment and represents something that I've noticed to be a pretty common mental failure mode for people (e.g., myself) who end up in extremely out-of-context circumstances. I'm curious to see if anyone's unpicked what, before I go posting about it.
