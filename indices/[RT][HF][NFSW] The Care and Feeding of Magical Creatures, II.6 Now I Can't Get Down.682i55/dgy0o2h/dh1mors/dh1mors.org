I'm really trying to get back on the Fridayish thing, where 'ish' means 'hopefully Thursday night really'.

As to the speech limitation thing, it's sort of a riddle about /either/ how magic works in Pandemonium, how our narratrix is made, or both. The answer is there in something she says all dramatically talking to no one in particular at one point...but all will be revealed soon enough. On a Fridayish.
