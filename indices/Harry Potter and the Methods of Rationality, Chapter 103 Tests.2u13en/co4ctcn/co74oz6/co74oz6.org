He got a sufficient number of answers right on the test.

There's no indication that he's adjusted anyone's grades other than Hermione's (to keep her from getting a second troll) or probably Harry's (to mark him as his equal).

There's a parallel that Hermione died and failed and that Neville escaped and got the highest grade, but I think it's more likely that Q sees the lesson there and implies it to the class, rather than makes it happen in order to force the lesson to exist (which would be less clever on his part).
