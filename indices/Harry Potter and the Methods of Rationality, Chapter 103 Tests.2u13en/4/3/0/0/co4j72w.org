I don't think dead care about their score. Also, Quirrel is not canon Dumbledore who gives people zillion points for being brave or friend or something. He is making some sort of point here methinks.

Dumbledore: The dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students.

Except for detention.

Where you will be forced to wander around when it's darkest and scariest.

Doesn't that make so much sense.

I'm so good at rules.

Ten points to Dumbledore.
