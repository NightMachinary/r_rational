Our special attitude to kids is just artifact of culture, that clearly isn't shared by wizards (and wasn't shared by many historical cultures IRL - there are some nice quotes in Old Testament for example, teaching that parents should sacrifice kids if they can't both live, because kids won't live without parents anyway, and parents can have another kids - quite rational TBH).
