  Also - the fact that it is incredibly dangerous contradicts your statement that their offensive capabilities are pathethic.

Dangerous, in the way that it's way more probable to kill yourself and all others around you with it. It's not "offensive", it's darwin award worthy idiocy.

Yes, I know fireball is kinda stupid. Did you miss the /s? It means sarcasm. Why not tell me something fancy about nukes too?

  why waste huge amounts of energy to create dangerous, highly visible and slow projectile
#+end_quote

Because it's magic. It doesn't even have to be slow. Magic in that universe doesn't care about how much energy you waste.

  if you can just transmute someone's tooth into cyanide

I'm pretty sure you need to touch it with your wand, this is why the transmuting isn't good offense. Also, it's damn slow if you don't train very hard. That kid who just got his wand does not suddenly become proficient with it. They do not teleport. They do not know cutting hexes. They stick the wand through someone's eye socket if they want to kill someone with it.
