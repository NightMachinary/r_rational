By such grading Quirell is attempting to teach people "you should protect yourself and fuck the others".

If people adjusted their behaviour because of this, and fewer people were ready to sacrifice to defend others - in my opinion total utility (and survivability of the group) would decrease.

Also this is unfair mark, it was "defense against dark magic", not "self-defence against dark magic".
