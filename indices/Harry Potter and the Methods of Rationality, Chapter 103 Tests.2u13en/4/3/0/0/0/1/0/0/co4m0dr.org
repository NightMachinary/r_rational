He caring if some random first-year lives is irrelevant. He taught them all survival skills. One could even argue he cares more about their lives than the ministry!

How is it unfair to other students, that he gave Hermione a bad grade? It does not affect /anything/ else, except teach them a point.

If he has a system for grading, and he sticks to it and doesn't play favorites or anything, it's pretty damn fair.

Also, do we really want to teach young kids to play hero? That it's ok to be the one who fights the trolls?
