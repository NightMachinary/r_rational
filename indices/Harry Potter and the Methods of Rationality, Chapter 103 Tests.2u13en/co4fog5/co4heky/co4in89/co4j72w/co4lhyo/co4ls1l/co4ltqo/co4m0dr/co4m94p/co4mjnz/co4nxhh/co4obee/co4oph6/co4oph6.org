I wouldn't be happy with half the thing they did in HP and not much less they did in HPMOR.

The fact that transmuting stuff into air is stupidly dangerous was my whole point - they give kids wands, teach kids transmutation, and then say "don't do this, that and that, cause it's dangerous".

It's like we gave loaded guns to every kid the first day in primary school, but told them "never shoot unsupervised". Good idea?

Also - the fact that it is incredibly dangerous contradicts your statement that their offensive capabilities are pathethic.

BTW Fireballs never were particulary good idea for offensive magic spell - canon HP got much better idea with avada kedavra, but evenwihtout it - why waste huge amounts of energy to create dangerous, highly visible and slow projectile, if you can just transmute someone's tooth into cyanide, cut his vein with small cutting hex, teleport him to deadly place, both teleportation on purpose, do 1000 things that are deadly and have way less property damage.
