I'm not saying he is a good guy. I'm saying he is pretty rational, wanted that job and is a damn good teacher. I don't think we have any reason to think he would grade unfairly.

I think the argument that he wants to teach people to not be heroes fails completely, when we remember he tried to raise the whole nation against a singular threat. He is just cynical because he failed.

You are apparently arguing from the point of view that his main identity is "mass murderer Voldemort" instead of that identity just having some utitily value for him in history.

Being possessed is irrelevant as it looks obvious that the original owner of the body hasn't done anything the whole year and the possessor is in the complete control of the body. The teacher for all intents and purposes is Riddle. He just might be a bit more complex person than you apparently think.

edit: I'm also not argumenting from authority there. My argument is that you have no way of knowing his real grading system. The author does. You are kinda saying "In my opinion this works like this, but grades don't reflect that and it's unfair", when you probably just don't know how it works.

Also, we have gone pretty far from my point, which was that grading Hermione whatever is not unfair to anyone.
