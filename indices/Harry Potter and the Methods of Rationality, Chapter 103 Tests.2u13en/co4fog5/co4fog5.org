Man, Quirrell is such a dick. "Hur hur, I docked her points for getting killed by a troll." Even if he hadn't been the one that used the troll to kill her, that's like failing someone out of driver's ed because they died after getting hit by a drunk driver. And Harry's apparently totally fine with that.
