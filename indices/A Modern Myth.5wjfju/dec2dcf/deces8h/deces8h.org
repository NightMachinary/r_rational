it's an amusing burn, but also bruises my delicate ego a little. I recall there being a bit much /swoleshaming/ in that pill cyoa thing from this author, too. The degree to which life is video-game-y like this is certainly an empirical question, but generally the more systematically investigated fitness/strength and intelligence* associations /I've/ seen have been quite positive (plenty confounded by e.g. health and nutrition, however, I'm sure).

That's consistent with my own experiences, too (the heavy lifters at the gym are generally well above average in smarts; then again, I've only a) worked out at university/hospital gyms, so most everyone there has or is getting some advanced degree, and b) nobody there would really qualify as an "elite" lifter or athlete, e.g. >450 Wilks). I imagine it levels off at the extremes, though (Mariusz Pudzianowski and Brian Shaw perhaps possessing no special genius). D'y'all reckon it'd dip back down (perhaps a function of how much time you have to devote to improving yourself in various respects -- after a few hours a week it cuts in to your learning?)?

It's not a literature I'm too familiar with; anyone here know it better?
