  Well, I think that there is some truth to that stereotype. But it's not a stereotype about body-builders and the like, that stereotype is very different, and includes being a fussy eater. It's a stereotype about people who abuse steroids.

I think /abuse/ is carrying a bit of the weight here (har har), insofar as it can be distinguished from "perform a reasoned analysis of the costs, risks, and benefits of hormonal supplementation and proceed accordingly". /Abusing/ something is clearly a hallmark of thoughtlessness, but undergoing, say, TRT in old age could be quite thoughtful (or if you find it really, really fun, or can make a lot of money by dialing in your body composition a certain way, like with most action movie stars). As for imagining the typical IFBB (or IPF, etc.) pro, my impression is that they're generally well-adjusted but very dedicated to their job/sport, at least from videos I've seen (again, having never met anyone at the "elite" level).

  Also I read "It implies that I'm very strong" as being very sarcastic, especially with that follow up.

I thought so too from the quote (it's a solid retort -- "I note your story and affirm no further implication"), but their characterizations in the rest of the story put me more in mind of [[https://i.imgur.com/fGMj0Be.png][this]].
