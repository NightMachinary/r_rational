A hundred years ago, when the internet didn't make copying any work instantaneous and trivial, I would have gone with stance two. Now I go with stance three. The ideal copyright term would probably be five to seven years: enough for the creator to make a sequel if they hadn't already. I think a creator should be entitled to the money they ask for to create their work and nothing else - in the era of digital transactions and instantaneous communication, that suggests a patron model rather than a publishing one. Copyright was created in response to a need that doesn't exist now, which is the need for the ability to stop rival publishers from printing identical manuscripts without the additional overhead of supporting the creator. Nowadays the creator can distribute the work themselves with a small enough amount of money as to be unnoticeable, and make up the rest with patreon style donations. Any further extension of copyright isn't just harmful, it's intervention in the free market to protect an establishment (big publishers and conglomerates like Disney) from dying off once they've outlived their usefulness. Yes I understand that without copyright we wouldn't have the economies of scale Disney offers, but I feel like that's a small problem that will be overcome with technology in astonishingly little time.

I know you didn't mention trademarks, but I'll say that I'm against them anyway. We don't need a logo to identify a product when a computer can; we definitely don't need trademarks based on fictional characters to determine whether or not a work of fiction is genuinely created by the original author. And "ruining the brand" is bullshit - in any world where it's legal to draw Mickey Mouse being fucked by a rhinoceros or somethig else sick, it's already been done to every other character on the planet, so nobody would care, just like only nutcases care about the existence of rule 34 art right now. Fiction isn't snake oil, or a dangerous machine assembled in a sweatshop, and we haven't found any /real/ memetic hazards yet, so any law that restricts the output of fiction for no other reason than "consumer protection" is absurd. And it's fair for an author to compete in a market like that because if they were capable of it, they would do it themselves, and if they weren't going to do it themselves, then it's unused economic /and/ artistic potential laying around.
