I mean, I don't think anyone is a sociopath for disagreeing with me, but I definitely don't think we /need/ copyright so people make good things, in theory.

There are plenty of copyright-free works that are just as good as copyrighted ones. I used WinDirStat (an open source disk analyzer) just today, for example. Saying we need to encourage the "self-interested creators" feels like treating the symptom. Maybe we should try making people less self-interested instead?

But yeah, /right now/ maybe some degree of copyright makes sense, because most people suck at the moment.
