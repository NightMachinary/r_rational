Flip side: a young nearly homeless JK Rowling writes a little book named /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, it gets good reviews and a little bit of traction, and before you know it a big corporation (say, Disney) swoops in with their power and influence and sells exact printed copies all across the globe. Young Ms Rowling has no way of challenging this and perhaps might not even have the resources to /know/ about how extensive it is, and years later Disney's total profit has crept into the eight digit range and Rowling has had to take on more hours as a waitress to make ends meet, and the series is never finished.

I agree that the current status quo is not great, and that Disney in particular is completely unjustified, but copyright does play at least a small part in protecting content-creating individuals from unscrupulous megacorps. Disney /can't/ just keep their finger on the pulse and pump-and-dump every halfway popular piece of media that someone else made that gets traction, and that's a /good/ thing.
