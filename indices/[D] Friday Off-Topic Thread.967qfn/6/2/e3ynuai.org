I adopt the middle stance as well.

I recommend MacCaulay's speeches on copyright from 1841 and '42, especially the first. You can find them [[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2170/2170-h/2170-h.htm#link2H_4_0018][on Project Gutenberg]] (link is to first speech; the second immediately follows). They're long and verbose, but worth reading and make a number of interesting arguments.

I'm pretty sure copyrights at present are far too long in the US especially; however, I haven't done any sort of survey of the literature to even start to see what sorts of terms would maximize the public good. The current state of affairs, where Disney keeps pressuring US legislators to extend copyright every time their fucking cartoon mouse looks like it will enter the public domain, so that nothing will ever enter the public domain in the US again without dramatic and far-reaching reforms of the entire system of government lobbying is ... pretty sub-optimal.
