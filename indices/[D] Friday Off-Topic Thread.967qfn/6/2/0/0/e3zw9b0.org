I'm not convinced that Hollywood wouldn't wait out copyrights. Of the 40 movies I saw in theaters in the last year, 25 were based on existing properties. A quick survey of the adaptations of more recent works shows that they were usually about three or four years (ex. /Love, Simon/ was a 2018 adaptation of a 2015 book, /Annihilation/ was a 2018 adaptation of a 2014 book, /Molly's Game/ was a 2017 adaptation of a 2014 book).

From that, three years seems like it's probably the lower bound for how long it takes a movie to be made, backed up by [[https://stephenfollows.com/how-long-the-average-hollywood-movie-take-to-make/][this]]. So how much does Hollywood pay the average rights holder, and how much does it cost them to simply delay another year or two? If X > Y, then they'll wait. Add to that it takes some time for a work to "make it", and factor in that a five year claim means that rights are essentially worthless if not sold in the first year or two, depreciating rapidly as you get to the point where the movie would already have been started for the rights to matter.

Now, granted, most movies will hire on the author as a consultant, or give them a hand in writing or revising the script, and the author's goodwill is worth a fair amount. I don't think most authors get paid too much for the rights to their films, and mostly the impact would be at the top 0.0001% or something like that ... but maybe those dreams are what are pushing some writers or artists.
