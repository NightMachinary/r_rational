Currently I've been so focused on coding that I haven't really actually built at the game part much, my test scene is just a 3 way battle royale between AIs that tends to be over in under a minute because of that one guy with the AoE spells who gives zero shits about friendly fire and a physics testing obstacle course. Once I get the next 20 stories in my backlog done and grab/make some better combat animations, I should have enough that I feel like it's worth the time setting up an actual demo to get control feedback.
