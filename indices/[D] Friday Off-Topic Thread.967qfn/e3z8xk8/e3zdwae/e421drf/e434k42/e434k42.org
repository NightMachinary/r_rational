It's hard to give fully generic advice without taking goals into account -- someone interested in casual, physical intimacy would do better to cast the widest net at their disposal, to appeal to the largest cross section of their intended audience that they might maximize their total number of encounters. Someone with precisely known preferences intending to find a long-term partner might do best by giving their profile much more targeted filters, that they might sooner exclude those with insurmountable incompatibility.

Otherwise I think I'd largely agree with [[/u/whywhisperwhy]]'s and [[/u/MagicWeasel]]'s advice, and additionally emphasize that it's best to show, rather than tell. Self-description is cheap, and explicitly attributing to yourself various desiderata sends something even worse than a (very) easy-to-fake signal -- it suggests that you can't actually manage the genuine article. Any man who must say, "I am an awesome and kind and smart lover of adventure", is no true member of that group at all.

I also think it's important to reflect on what sort of picture each statement you write paints in your readers' minds, and make sure each picture contributes something valuable -- omit needless words, since the large selection means your audience's attentions are fleeting. The profile is less a tool to convey direct biographical information and more something to capture the interests of those viewing it, (usually) that you might deepen that interest via instant messaging and secure a face-to-face meeting, where you evaluate each other further.

(and as a general disclaimer I'm making all of this up and only used OkC for about a week 5 years ago and only met a single person from there. Also, I had to reactivate my profile to see OP's, so [[https://www.okcupid.com/profile/DerBerggeist][here]] it is, fwiw. It's not the best and not at all fitting for my current position and place in life, though for a 20/21 year old fresh out of college I think it served me well. At least for what little I put into it. My wife /did/ describe it a few months into our relationship as pretentious and confusing, but interesting -- and tbf that's not far off from who I am, so in that sense it did it's job)

edit: also, if your goal is to get lots of unsolicited messages, having plenty of "easy" hooks is good. I think most of the messages I got quoted some Whitman at me, or asked what I currently had written on my arm or if I liked kissing any other animals, or made dinosaur noises, etc.
