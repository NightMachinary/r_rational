I think depending on your intentions and the intentions of your would-be advisors, you might run into a paradox where those with the most experience are ~least~ qualified to give you advice, because they've managed to survive on the market for so long without pairing off. Of course, if both are interested primarily and casual sex then age on the market (with accompanying experience) could well indicate competence.

Of course, I only really used OkC for around a week before meeting my wife, so ofc I would fashion a framework that makes myself look best. ;] And advice I would give would probably regress extensively to the mean regardless.
