While reading TwentySided today, I learned about this webcomic named Dominic Deegan, that was apparently kind of /the/ typical early 2000s webcomic (lackluster drawing, fragmented gimmicky story), and had a fandom that... apparently collectively decided they hated the story and its author over the span of a year.

Instead of just moving on to something else, they formed a hatedom type of group, with a level of vitriol and dedication you'd expect from the audience of something like /Game of Thrones/ (as opposed to an obscure poorly-drawn webcomic nobody had any reason to care about).

Looking at a [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?285193-Dominic-Deegan-Mk-L-The-Snark(ie][GitP thread of this hatedom]]-Alive-Death-Actually-Is-Zombies&s=373b393f21013c47bdb6bb84448c0b3f), all I can say is “Holy shit this is so toxic, how have the GitP moderators not shut that monstrosity down?”

  But just because Mookie is done with Dominic Deegan, that doesn't mean we're done with Mookie. Check out Star Power for more of Mookie's writing. The art is easier on the eyes, but that's because Mookie isn't doing the art. Will he improve as a writer? Debatable (probably not). New ways to fail? Already underway - see the lorem ipsum.

What the fuck?

And you know, this feels kind of personal, because it's pretty close to the kind of reaction I had to a few online works (mostly Worm and Drowtales), mostly when I felt like the story with its bleakness was trying to send me a message I didn't like. I guess I'm glad Wildbow (probably) doesn't have an anti-fandom that size dedicated to hating him.
