Well I won't be able to touch on all those things, but hopefully (if I continue the project) I should still get to cover a few.

As for the main character, I've decided to drop the "SI" part entirely; They're still going to be a college student because students are particularly convenient viewpoint characters in the time between may and august, but I'll be giving them a very different backstory from my own that gives them a good motivation to go out and interact with all the who /aren't/ reader proxies.

Thanks for all the feedback!
