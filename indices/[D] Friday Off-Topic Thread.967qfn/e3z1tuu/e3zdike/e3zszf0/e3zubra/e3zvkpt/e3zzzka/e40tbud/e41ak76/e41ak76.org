I guess if you're telling the story of how nuclear war was averted by everyone turning into pokemon, I would be asking why an Average College Student SI has any relevance to this story: unless he's like the head of bulbapedia or something, it would seem that everything he can do, someone else can do better. (The benefit of being an SI a lot of times is having access to secret information).
