The sentinelese would be great, but probably hard to write without coming across as Bad Colonial Ideas.

How do the literal neonazis take it: now that you can't tell what colour someone used to be, what form does their racism take?

Children starving in war-torn parts of Mauritania suddenly turning into a plant creature that lives on sunlight. People you see on World Vision ads who have to walk 10km each way to get a jug of water having a Blastoise in their village. Victims of sex trafficking escaping - or getting their revenge.

The furries are obvious lowhanging fruit, but I want to know about the rest of the world: how do kinky people and sex workers deal with the change? Do they think of new services? I'm imagining a dominatrix turning into a bulbasaur and incorporating bondage.

On the topic of racism, what form does humanity's prejudice start to take now all the skin colours are different?

Pokemon all speak Pokemon-ese. So is there now a universal language, or are the pokemon speaking their native languages somehow with their pokemon bodies? They can shoot fire out of their mouths so I'm able to believe they can have human-like larynxes.

Sport. What happens with sport? MMA fighters would lose their livelihood overnight, or have to come up with new techniques and rules. Good luck getting a machamp into an arm bar, and if Daniel Cormier turned into a Sunkern, well, there's no hope for him anymore.

What jobs become redundant? What jobs are formed? That's a further time horizon than 3 months, though.

I think that the Average American College Student is about the /least/ interesting person in this world for me to read about. I can put myself in that mindset and think about what I'd do. I want to know what people with different situations than me, more weaknesses, more grudges, what /they/ do.
