How's this for a hook?

--------------

Civilization is saved, and nobody notices.

Amidst the sirens and alarms, the blinking lights and blaring klaxons, Nuclear armageddon is barely averted by the barest happenstance. One ICBM operator turns his key. The other, turned into a Meowstic, a feline barely two feet tall, cannot reach the keyhole.

By the time he figures out how to use his psychic powers to telekinetically manipulate the key, the alarms have stopped blaring, and the order to stand down has come through secure channels.

And related to that, should I just drop the third paragraph?

I'd like to tell a story about the immediate aftermath of the event, happening over the three months after it or so (not-so-coincidentally matching up to summer break for college students.) I'm thinking about different possible MC-scale conflicts to have the story focus on, but haven't decided on an overarching one.
