Also I was thinking about this again today and I'd want to see what religion did.

One scene with the pope; another scene with a cult leader.

I'd want the pope scene (or equally, an imam/rabbi scene) to be well-researched though, ideally teaching me something about the theology in question. There's plenty of /askreligion subreddits that would entertain questions about how their theology would react to the pokemon thing.
