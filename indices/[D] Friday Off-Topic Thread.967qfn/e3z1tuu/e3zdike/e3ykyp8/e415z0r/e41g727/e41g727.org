Oh no, I wouldn't use a /centralized/ server. Think dedicated server, like minecraft or just about any networked game from the 90s that had a host.

In fact (like minecraft) it's likely that most people won't even realize they're /hosting/ a local, private, dedicated server when you hit "new game". Power users however will likely be able to take advantage of this in various ways, the most apparent being able to heavily mod the client (==presentation) without affecting the server (==simulation).
