I really liked [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXSZMIiUfFSVTX8z2Xl5vt-PV4Fi17w1][SB Nation's Weird Rules]] series, even though I don't really like sports that much.

I've been thinking about my planned battle school fic in this context, and have been trying to narrow rules weirdness down a bit. Generally speaking, I think that separating it into "well, I guess no one said you couldn't" and "unintended consequence of existing rules" works well as a starting point.

Naturally, a work about game rules, their consequences, abuses, and expected outcomes can work as a microcosm of wider societal issues that stem from societal rules and/or laws.
