On a similar topic, I recommend looking up the concept of an "oral consitution" or "uncodified law". Such rule sets are significantly smaller and more flexible precisely because they can shift as necessary to avoid exactly the awkward situations Weird Rules is about. They can genuinely deal with disputes on a case-by-case basis.

They also /must/ deal with disputes on a case-by-case basis, making them slower and more contentious and requiring regular judicial action in a way written constitutions solve with bloated sub-paragraph infrastructure.

"I guess you win because it's not against the rules" becomes "No, that's ridiculous and the judges agree you're cheating." In the former case, a new and more specific rule is written to eliminate the option. In the latter, the interpretation stands as "case law" (or just "tradition") but can be readdressed again at a later date.
