My main issue with copyright is not about file-sharing or whatever but about fan works. Personally I think people should be able to create fan works without requiring permission from the author so long as they're not outright plagiarizing from it. If the fan work or adaptation is sold for a profit then the author should get a large cut of the profit, but shouldn't be able to say 'I don't like what you're doing with my characters, so I won't let you play with my toys'.
