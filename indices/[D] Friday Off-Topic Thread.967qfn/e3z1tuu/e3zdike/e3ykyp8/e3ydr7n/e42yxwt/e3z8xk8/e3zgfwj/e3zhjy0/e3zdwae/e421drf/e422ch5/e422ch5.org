Tell you what, I've done a couple of profiles on here, and I'll anonymise my feedback and post it below the quick answer I've just come up with. [[if you are one of the people whose feedback i've republished below and you have a problem with it, let me know asap and I will remove/edit it]]

tldr: photos have to make you look interesting / fun; you need to not look like a jerkwad; compatible with my personal requirements (in my case, polyamory/rationalist/vegan-friendly); whether their profile makes me want to ask them a question.

my number one piece of advice which you'll probably see below: in hetero online dating, women should filter their messages ("don't message me if you don't bleed Mavericks blue"; "if you're under 6 foot don't bother"; "if you are just going to tell me I'm pretty don't bother"; "make sure you ask me a question about my profile"), men should try to keep their options wide open (i.e. not put anything at all controversial in their profiles). I get the feeling men see all these "standoffish" profiles and think that they should emulate them: they shouldn't, they are playing a different game than the profiles they look at.

TAKEDOWNS OF ACTUAL /R/RATIONAL PROFILES BELOW

describing yourself as a hipster is redundant: it provides no useful information and looking at your pictures / reading your description should tell people your level of hipsterosity anyway. especially not good as the first thing someone sees about you.

  QUOTE FROM PROFILE: I work at a job I dislike and am currently looking at how to become a [profession].
#+end_quote

sounds depressing: i don't want to date someone who is miserable in their life. inject a little more positivity or at least tell us what the job you dislike is. Tell us what you're doing to become a [profession] - are oyu in night school? or do you just wistfully watch [related movies]? You're 30 you're "meant to have your shit together" - assuming you're looking for wife material, that means you have to look like husband material. replace "[profession]" with "literally a rock star" and you sound like a loser, right? But if the "literally a rock star" guy also says he's in a band, he's touring, doing session time, whatever, then he suddenly looks like a better catch. Does that make sense? So you gotta make it look like you have your shit together in this [profession] goal of yours.

examples:

"I work at a job I dislike (seriously, I put ferret poop through seives in a lab - don't ask) and am blah blah"

"I'm currently a data scientist but I've realised my real passion is [profession], so I'm saving up to start my [profession] degree next semester" / "and I've started doing an online [profession] course" / etc

I like this. I want to ask you where you've been and what your favourite one is. Maybe include an aside, like, "- seriously, ask me about how I think $LESSER KNOWN MONUMENT shits all over macchu pichu if you want to hear me go on a rant"

my golden rule for straight male profiles: your profile is to get women you message to write you responses. it is not to get you new messages (those are bonuses). It is purely for "retention".

A big "don't" in a lot of profiles that you haven't done is saying something like, "if you can't handle long conversations about philosophy, don't message me" or other things designed to filter people /out/. The online dating marketplace supply-demand curve means straight men should be trying to capture as much as they can, and not try to filter anything until after messages are being exchanged. (I suspect that even women who love long conversations about philosophy would be turned off by such a disclaimer more than they'd be turned on; and a woman who was otherwise perfect but maybe only tolerates long conversations about philosophy rather than likes them might be scared off altogether). Anyway, you aren't doing that at the moment, so good job! Just keep an eye out for things you might want to add, and make sure they are not aimed deterring messages.

other golden rule: life sucks but people are shallow. you want a good photo. your current main photo doesn't work well on the screen because it's dark. none of your photos are particularly good and may be your main problem: you don't seem to be smiling or having fun in any of them, and none of them are super flattering. With 8 photos, I'd expect there to be one group photo of you and friends, so the fact there isn't feels odd.

Are there some candid shots friends have taken with you as the primary focus that could work?

Photo recommendation: I'd put them all on tinder, swipe around a bit (don't swipe all left or all right, there's some optimal ratio), and then let tinder's algorithm tell you which photo is best.

  I'm making a new OKCupid account. Any tips?
#+end_quote

Don't answer the really obvious profile questions: none of the "what is bigger, the earth or the sun?" type questions. Anything you think is really obvious, don't answer. High-probability hits will only cause you to have an artificially high match percentage with anyone with half a brain, when you want to try and target people with more specific things in common with you. The questions that hint at rationality will automatically weed out the people who think the earth is bigger than the sun anyhow. If that makes sense?

--------------

Photos are tricky. Tinder will automatically move your "best" photo to the front of your profile, so for no other reason you might just want to upload some candidate photos to tinder and swipe a little bit every day and it'll tell you which photos are best.

  Could you expand what you mean when my profile says I don't look interesting? What do you think I should write?
#+end_quote

It's hard; it's a je ne sais quoi, you know? Looking at your profile, it's like, you're listing solitary stuff: computer games, books, some popular TV shows. It doesn't give me much of an idea about the sort of person you are. If we went on a date, would we go to a trendy wine bar you know and eat tapas, or would we drink a milkshake out of a jar at a hipster place where the furniture is made out of milk crates? What are you like? Are you funny? Are you a know-it-all? Are you warm and friendly or cold and reserved? Do you like spicy Indian food or will you only eat cheese pizza?

Basically I don't feel personality in your words and I know that's probably infuriatingly vague of me.

Few general points:

- You talk about video games a lot more than is probably necessary. It makes it look like that's a major area of interest for you - if that's true then leave it but if it's not true and you're just interested in video games about as much as any other man in his early 20s (which is quite a bit) then I'd just cut it to having a section on your favourites in the "favourites" section. If you focus too much on video games it makes you look like a "lives in mum's basement" stereotype.

- Good at section: "programming" - back into the "what would we do on a date?" question I was asking myself earlier, I'd recommend keeping the programming (if you want) but adding something social. Are you good at bowling? Are you good at guessing peoples' star signs (ha)? Do you never spill a drink when you're clubbing? Preferably something unique and quirky that says something about you as a person rather than something like "programming" that applies to hundreds of people. It doesn't have to be something you're best at.

- Typical Friday night: include one friday night activity that your date would be able to accompany you on. Doesn't have to be a literal Friday night, could also be Saturday. (Some people seem really married to the idea of it being a Friday and say "working because I work Fridays" the question is basically "what do you do at night for fun?" so keep it in that spirit)

- potentially might help: make a blank female profile and answer about 10 or 20 match questions in the way you'd prefer. Browse the guys on the site and see what their profiles look like. Figure what's better than yours and what's worse.

- Remember your profile is for the women who you message to look at, not for you to use to get a woman to message you. Harsh but true. Send lots of women messages, and make sure they're good.
