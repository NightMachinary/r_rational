Well obviously. Harry Potter isn't /just/ "boarding school plus magic." It's a specific combination of hundreds of individual elements. Specific combinations of plot/story and character traits and setting/worldbuilding ought to be protected, you can't just copy a work wholesale and pass it off as your own. On the flip side, you can't just plant a flag in the idea of "a young hero is the Chosen One who restores peace to the world by defeating his fated enemy" and then declare that no one is allowed to use that specific idea ever again.
