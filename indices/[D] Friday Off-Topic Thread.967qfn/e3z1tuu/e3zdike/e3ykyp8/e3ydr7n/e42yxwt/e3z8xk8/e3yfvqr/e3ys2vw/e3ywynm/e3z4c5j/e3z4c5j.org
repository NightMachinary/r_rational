If it bothers you you can replace "plagiarism" with "fast follower problem". However I think that is stupidly pedantic as in practice most cases of piracy are also cases of stolen work they're just a bit more meta. Like, the works the editor took refining the manuscript, that the publishing house spent publicizing the work, or the risk on the initial run, the redit for sponsiring the work financially, etc. Take a pirated TV episode. If you remove the commercials then upload it to pirate bay you have expunged the fact that the company that payed for the ads ultimately sponsored the original airing that you recorded. That's not all that far removed from republishing a scientific paper with the name of a co-author you don't approve of removed.

However you're wrong about trademark. Trademark doesn't relate to plagiarism much at all. Especially not as you've defined it. If I make a purse that looks identical to a famous fashion designer's new line but put my own tag with my own logo on it instead of theirs I have plagiarized their design passing it off as my own but have not infringed on their trademark. The reason there exist "knock offs" with look-alike-but-legally-distinct or forged logos is because as a result of trademark law marketing has convinced people the trademark is required to make the item fashionable, as there is no equivalent to copyright for clothing.

Similarly overt plagiarism is rare in media that have copyright protection because it is trivially prosecuted under copyright law. If for example I reproduce the text of a popular novel and publish it under my name with my publishing houses trademarks taking care to avoid any issues like the title font that may also be part of a tardemark I'm still guilty of copyright infringement for reproducing the text and putting my name on it just makes proving i did it in court trivial.
