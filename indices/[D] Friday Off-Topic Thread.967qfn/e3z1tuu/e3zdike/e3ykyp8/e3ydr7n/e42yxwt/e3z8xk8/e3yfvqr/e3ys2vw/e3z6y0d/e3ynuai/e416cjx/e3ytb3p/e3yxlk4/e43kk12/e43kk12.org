My stance is somewhere between (2) and (3). Copyright is troublesome in a number of ways (mainly, I feel, when applied to software); but, at the same time, encouraging a very temporary monopoly to a first mover can encourage innovation, thus improving society. On the other hand, leave copyright too long, and it stifles rather than encourages innovation.

So I can see a good argument for copyright in lengths of up to a year, or two at the most. Beyond that is, I think, too much.
