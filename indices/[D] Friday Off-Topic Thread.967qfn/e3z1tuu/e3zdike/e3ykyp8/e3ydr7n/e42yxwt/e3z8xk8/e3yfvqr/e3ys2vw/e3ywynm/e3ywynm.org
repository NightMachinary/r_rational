  The core problem that copyright is intended to solve is that it is easier to plagerise somone else's work than to create your own in artistic fields like literature or music, and that creates a disincentive to create new art but society benefits from having new art.

No, plagiarism is a /trademark//fraud issue. The point of copyright is to make creation profitable by giving a monopoly on distribution to the creator and labeling unauthorized distributors as perpetrators of piracy. Pirates are rarely plagiarists---they generally don't try to pass off pirated creations as their own.
