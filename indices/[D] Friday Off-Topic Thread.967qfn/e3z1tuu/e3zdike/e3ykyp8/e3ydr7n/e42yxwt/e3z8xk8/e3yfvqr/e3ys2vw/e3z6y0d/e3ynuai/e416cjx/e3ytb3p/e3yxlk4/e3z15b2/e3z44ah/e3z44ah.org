I think that's a rather reductionist viewpoint of Everything is a Remix. I've watched it several times because it's such a well done video essay, but the main point he makes about copyright is not strictly that /copyright law/ is damaging to the creative process, but that indefinite copyright /is/. The difference being that the initial time period of a product or idea being copyrighted allows the creator to recoup the costs of developing the idea in the first place as opposed to the act of synthesizing ideas somehow giving you complete control over it.

That being said, there is a lot that is currently wrong with the American system of copyright law that is pretty evident in the way that corporations have been able to lobby against allowing their old intellectual property into the common domain. The obvious example of that being Disney.

I think I tend more towards the middle viewpoint that ToaKraka presented in that I think copyright is a necessary evil that is needed to allow creators to recoup the cost of gambling on new ideas, or inventors to recoup the time sunk into developing a new product.
