****** What (in your opinion) is the proper basis of copyright?

- Copyright represents the natural, moral right of a creator to own and control what he creates, and should be perpetual. Anyone who advocates the reduction or abolition of copyright is a greedy, entitled sociopath who wants to leech off the work of his betters.

- Copyright is a necessary evil, meant to encourage self-interested creators to create things that will benefit the public in the long term. Copyright terms should be based on economists' analyses of the creation inspired by the promise of temporary monopoly vs. the public benefit gained from free use.

- Copyright is an infringement of creators on the natural, moral right of all people to share in the fruits of any person's work, and should be abolished. Anyone who advocates the creation or extension of copyright terms is a greedy, entitled sociopath who wants to extort people for the use of what should be free for the benefit of all.

I adhere to the middle stance. (It's my impression that the other two stances are NOT strawmen. The Songwriters Guild of America and several members of the USA's House of Representatives are quoted in Justice Breyer's dissent in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft][/Eldred/ v. /Ashcroft/]] as having advocated perpetual copyright, while [[https://questioncopyright.org][QuestionCopyright.Org]] advocates the abolition of copyright.)

Obviously, you should feel free to adopt an intermediate stance.

****** How long (in your opinion) should copyright terms be?

One [[https://rufuspollock.com/2007/07/09/forever-minus-a-day-some-theory-and-empirics-of-optimal-copyright][economist]] has [[https://rufuspollock.org/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf][estimated]] that the ideal copyright term is 15 years. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service][The Congressional Research Service]] (as quoted in Justice Breyer's dissent in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft][/Eldred/ v. /Ashcroft/]]) has [[https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/98-144.html][estimated]] that a commercially-valuable work has a 3.8-% chance of losing its value every year; this figure implies that a 20-year term would cover the /entire/ commercially-useful life of /half/ of all works and a 50-year term would cover /85 %/ of all works---and, obviously, the first few years would be much more lucrative than the last few years. In light of these (admittedly rather sparse) numbers, I think that a 20-year copyright term sounds reasonable.

Obviously, you should feel free to adopt an intermediate or a more-complex stance.

- This post is NOT about patents and DEFINITELY NOT about trademarks.

- This post should NOT be construed as advocating unauthorized copying (piracy). Criticizing a law is NOT the same as advocating disobedience of that law. I've spent hundreds of dollars on DRM-free [[http://www.warehouse23.com][books]] and [[https://www.gog.com][video games]] that I could have pirated with ease. A person who wants to avoid supporting government-sponsored monopolists can get public-domain books and movies from [[http://www.gutenberg.org][Project Gutenberg]] and [[https://archive.org][the Internet Archive]] and can [[https://i.imgur.com/iZXoSec.png][donate]] to those institutions the money that he would have given to Hachette and Disney.
