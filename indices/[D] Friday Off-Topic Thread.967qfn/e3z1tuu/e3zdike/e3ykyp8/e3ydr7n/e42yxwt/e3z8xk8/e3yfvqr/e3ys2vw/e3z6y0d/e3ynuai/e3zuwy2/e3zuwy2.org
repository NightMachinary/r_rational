Almost all earnings are in the first five years. You want it to be a bit longer than that to avoid creating an industry of datum -5 publishing, and to prevent hollywood from just waiting out copyrights, but 15 years would prevent both of those, because people (and movie makers) are not generally going to want to wait that long, and will pay up instead. Of course, at that length, you will get people making derivative works to cash in on nostalgia.. but that is a feature, not a bug. That copyright prevents this currently earns writers no money, but does impoverish our culture.
