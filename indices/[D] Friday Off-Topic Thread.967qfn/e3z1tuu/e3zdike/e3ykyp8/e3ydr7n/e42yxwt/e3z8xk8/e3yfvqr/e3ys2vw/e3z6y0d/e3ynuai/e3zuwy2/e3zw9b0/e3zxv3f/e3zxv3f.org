Movie deals can be big money to an author. A /lot/ more than they get from the publisher, most of the time, depending on genre. Heck, there are authors who made more money on options for movies that never got made than they ever saw from the publisher of their book..\\
However those rights and option payments are chump change to a movie budget. A million is a rounding error if you are making the martian, and the monetary value of the free pr from making a movie of a book which is fresh in peoples minds is not a small sum. Thus, I am quite confident noone is going to delay a movie for fifteen years to avoid paying up. Well, noone sane.

Some low-budget movies will be made of various crime novels that old, but that is not money out of any authors pockets, because those are movies that would just not have been made, full stop, under the current terms of copyright.
