It's creepy and I don't like creepy things and they should be suppressed for my safety (and that of my children)!!!

Leaving aside how unhealthy this is, most forums have rules against harassment and bullying, which this is somewhat close to and encourages; and there are probably borderline cases buried in there where a poster goes "OMG this last chapter is so dumb! I don't get how nobody is telling the author the 20'000 ways this is stupid" which isn't an explicit call to harassment, but is likely to engender some.

If I were the BDFL of a GitP-like forum, I think I could make a decent case that the forum is dedicated to fandoms on enjoying works, not repeated teardowns of work you don't like. It's a little vague, but part of being a BDFL is saying "I don't like this and I think I can point to general principles why, but until more things like this come up, I'm just going to ban the thing and not write down the principles."
