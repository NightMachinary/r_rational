I'm currently considering two very different Pokemon SI/OCs. Neither are /explicitly/ rational, but of course I consider myself a rationalist and try to make decisions according to my enlightened self interest. Meanwhile, I'm aware of the fact that other people aren't cardboard cutouts and have their own internal motivations.

Can I get a simple vote for which once seems more interesting?

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17SoWtyyzqwM_Y-lhmyNfTv81AapgkNglf6Nh-O4c-Vs/edit?usp=drivesdk][Number 1]] (placeholder name: With or Despite Him) is an SI-into-pokeworld where the OC SI "reincarnates" into a Riolu, and about his (and his trainer's) journey to beat the pokemon league. Or at least, that's the impression I intend to give until the last few paragraphs of chapter 1. This is intended to be your "typical" pokemon story with trainer battles and catching pokemon and all that good stuff. It would be dark, but not pointlessly so.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/18OjZ3yGCyZlI5JO4GO-PNwZiehtb263olkmSyZG0cyw/edit?usp=drivesdk][Number 2]] (placeholder name: Things Happen for a Reason (And Other Lies we Tell Ourselves)). The premise for this one is pretty simple: everyone turns into pokemon. Obviously, this has implications for just about every aspect of society, culture, and politics. This is more social sci-fi-ish; another installment in my quest to write a story about modern society encountering "magic" and going nuts all at once. The narrative wouldn't be explicitly dark, but messed up stuff would be going on in the background.

Incidentally, I got some feedback for Number 1 that the pre-reader wasn't invested in any of the characters, which I think is a fair criticism. Does anyone have any advice about that? Both for these stories specifically, and writing in general. And not just for the main character, but the side characters.
