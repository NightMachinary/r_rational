I've been working on a game in Unity. It's gotten to the point that I've actually bothered to set up a git repo and a backlog for it. It's been really surprising how quickly it's come together. I've got a basic drag and drop slot inventory, which allows you to actually place items in the world in a sane manner (I'm looking at you Skyrim), Skyrim/Dark Souls style combat with rolling/comboes/hitboxes/blocking and everything, a pretty well architected magic system that supports a whole variety of spells, and an AI that's now bordering on not totally retarded, and is capable of using melee weapons, telling friend from foe, running away when injured, minion style following, and also standing still and firing spells off with no regard for friendly fire. It still looks terrible because I've put basically zero effort into the art side of things and I'm using mostly placeholder models, but it's already rather fun to play. I'm really excited to see how far I can take this, my original inspiration was to try to combine the replayability of ARPGs like PoE and Diablo with the enjoyable (For me at least) combat of games like Dark Souls, Skryim, and Darkfall. I'll try to record a video next week.
