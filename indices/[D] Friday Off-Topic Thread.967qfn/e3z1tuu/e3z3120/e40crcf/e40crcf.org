Git logs say 4 months, but I spent at least 2 before that just dicking around learning Unity. I've only really gotten serious the last three weeks though, since then I've been putting in 2-6 hours a day of coding. Probably ~150 hours total, but that's for someone who had no Unity experience, but plenty of professional experience with C# programming as well as 3D/Animation.
