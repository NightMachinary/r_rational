I think copyright is a pretty arbitrary solution to a complex problem. But that the curent "life of creator +70 Years unless Disney gets it extended again" is a self contradictory implementation of that solution.

The core problem that copyright is intended to solve is that it is easier to plagerise somone else's work than to create your own in artistic fields like literature or music, and that creates a disincentive to create new art but society benefits from having new art.

The basis of the deal with curent copyright law is that you have to publish your work to get it protected but in exchange you hold sole legal right to make copies of it for some time. The advantage of this system is that it expends the body of art availabe over time, and it doesn't disadvantage artists who only ever produce one really good work (compared to patronage where you need enough of a rep to get people to pay you for future work in advance). The disadvantages are that it is difficult to enforce, and it interacts weirdly with works that are collaborative in nature. (Also "life of the creator plus arbitrary period is a stupid duration, and extending the period in responce to specific influential copyright holder's copyrights being about to expire is clear corruption).

I think now that crowdfunding is a thing it might be possible to restructure copyright to instead of focusing on the right to make copies focus on the right to claim authorship. This would mean that creators can sue anyone trying to build a competing reputation on plagiarism which would still protect business models like "I worked for big companies to prove my skills but now I'm doing my own thing" and "If my kickstarter is funded I'll publish a PDF anyone can downlaod/share/have printed, etc" However this would still have some down sides. Most notably you can't ever make money on your first success. That may well discourage a lot of artists from starting down the path of publishing their work. And it's only real upsides are that it solves the term issue (a work never needs to be reaccredited to s new creator) it scales better with collaborative works (as crediting multiple people for their specific contribution is pretty easy), the former of which could alternately be solved by changing the term to something not-stupid (say 50 years, or "life of the creator") and the later is a pretty minor problem in practice.

[edit] IMO "life of the creator" is a sensible term for copyright, as the first installment of a series entering the public domain has a pretty serious impact on ability to control copycats, and the lifespan of a modern work can easily involve several re-imaginings in different media, sequels, spin-offs etc. which require their own creative effort over longe periods of time (think book -> movie -> TV spinoff -> novel series spinoff -> Video game based on the TV series, etc.) which can make setting a fixed term difficult to do fairly.

But extending past the life of the creator is dumb as the point was to ensure the creator didn't get screwed by plagiarism but if they're dead they can't really "get screwed" anymore.
