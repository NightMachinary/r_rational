My opinion is closest to the third option.

[[https://vimeo.com/139094998][Everything is a Remix]] and there is nothing new under the sun and all that jazz. There is only that which is, and nothing comes from nothing, so there actually /can't/ be such a thing as "creation;" what we refer to as "creation" is simply the rearrangement of preexisting materials and/or concepts into a "new" form, and "original" ideas are simply a synthesis of concepts which share only a weak association with each other.

Look at Harry Potter. There have been an unknowable number of "British boarding school" stories written over the last two hundred years. Rowling synthesized that idea with the idea of magic. Does Rowling now have a monopoly on the concept of "boarding schools for magic"? Should no one ever again be allowed to write a story set in a magical boarding school?
