A little more than glossing over the people who do freak out, I expect very very few people would not freak out in a 'I understand what's going on here but it's really freaking me out' sort of way. Personally, I would have sat on my bed for at least two minutes just processing the wrecking ball this turn of events took to my worldview, and then a couple more wondering what parts of my life suddenly became extremely difficult, and a last bout about just how badly the rest of society is going to take this. By the time I stood up I would be shaken, mentally overwhelmed, and emotionally vulnerable. I'm more introspective than most, but I figure pretty much everyone who's not literally on fire would go through something similar.

As for your characters... I don't think I ever became /really/ attached to any characters within one chapter, but looking at your stories I don't see much personality standing out. It's a little too close to 'blank slate protagonist who has no initiative and just reacts to things' for my liking. I've heard that shonen protagonists (who to a fault have a large force of personality one way or another) are even more excessive at the beginning because it impresses on the viewer that's what they're like. If these are to be SIs, I'd consider taking the most stand-out parts of your personality and phrasing the situation so that you can show off more than usual what makes your character worth paying attention to (standard writing rules apply, show don't tell, act instead of just react, etc.).
