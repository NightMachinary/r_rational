I think the premise of Idea 2 is great, but I think you need a hook. If you don't want to tell the story of society adjusting in the immediate aftermath, then I'd start it, say, six months later: everyone's still adjusting, but people have made peace with themselves being machamps or whatever.

It'd make a good starting sentence, "/We all remember where we were on October 2nd, 2017, when we first woke up in our new pokemon bodies/", or "/It's now been a year since we all became pokemon, and things are finally looking up for this savvy young zoroark/"

I don't know the /story/ you're trying to tell, beyond the premise, though. I think that would inform my feedback a lot.
