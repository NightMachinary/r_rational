A few things I noticed:

- Both stories seem to be about exploring a fundamental societal change, but Number 1 seems to be character-driven in equal portion. That may be good or bad, easier or harder to make work, I can't really tell.
- Sapient Pokemon in Number 1 can't be left unexplored. We saw the SI communicate with a keyboard, at the very least other Pokemon should be doing that too. This means you also have to consider the societal implications of a world where Pokemon can in fact speak for themselves with total clarity.
- People seem really nonchalant in Number 2. Like, /really/ nonchalant. Our MC shrugs it off after a couple minutes with only confused panic and little to no body horror, existential terror, or shattered worldview. His roommate doesn't even care, and the next person we meet seems to be just having fun. It's almost uncanny how little anyone actually cares what happened to them.

I'm not an experienced writer to be able to say which one is a better or easier story to write. I feel like Number 2 would by nature focus more on the worldbuilding with the protagonist as a viewpoint and commentary on the world, while Number 1 would be a character-driven (even if not grand in scale) story, and that some writers might find one easier to write than the other.

I can't say I really have a preference between the two stories: I'm not invested in any characters after all of one chapter, and while Number 2's premise is a touch more interesting the execution is a bit uncanny as I mentioned earlier, while Number 1 is a bit less interesting of a premise but had a more solid impact so came across better.
