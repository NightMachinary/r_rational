Thanks for the feedback!

I've been having the MC's viewpoint gloss over the people who /are/ freaking out because angst isn't the point of the story (and honestly I'm a pretty self-absorbed person anyways), but you're right in that I should have at least some focus put on them.

  I'm not invested in any characters after all of one chapter

Is this just a factor of you not getting attached to characters quickly, or are there stories where you /did/ get attached to the characters within a chapter that I should be trying to replicate? I feel like I have trouble laying out a "hook" to the story separate from just having a cool premise.
