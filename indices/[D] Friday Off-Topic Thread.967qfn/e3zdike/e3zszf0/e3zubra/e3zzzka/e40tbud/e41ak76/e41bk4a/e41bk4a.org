That's a fair question. This isn't a story about an averted nuclear war, per se (I've decided to leave it intentionally ambiguous as to whether nuclear war was averted by the change, or almost caused by the change), but "why is the bog-standard SI the main character" is still something I need to handle. Plot aside, what viewpoints would be interested in seeing this event through? I'm planning on finishing each chapter with a 3rd-person-limited viewpoint of a news broadcast or article or whatever to get an outside view of the story.
