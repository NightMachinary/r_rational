I know tons of religious people who would enjoy something like that if it was well-researched: I discussed with a Jewish friend for about an hour what prehistoric animals would be kosher or not. (If animals change into pokemon too - maybe all cows become Miltank or something - then it's definitely something rabbis would need to comment on).

As long as what you do is realistic in the context of "everyone becomes pokemon", and /well-researched/, I don't see why it'd become a shitfest. There's a difference between "Catholic extremists have started assassinating people who smash eggs they lay" and "The pope issued a statement from the Vatican today that people who have taken the form of pokemon that are only able to digest meat are still required to abstain on Fridays in lent; this should either be done through pure fasting or through the consumption of fish and/or beaver, which are acceptable."; the first one feeds into "bad stereotypes about catholics"; the second probably teaches people some catholic doctrine, and is just what I thought up real quick: there's probably something better that you could find by going to [[/r/AskChristianity]] or whatever.
