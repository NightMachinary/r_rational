I can't write for shit, but I'd like to suggest tackling this from a slightly different angle. There's a anime called Chromartie High School made on such a low budget that the animators intentionally left in bugs like parts of character's faces moving independently or would draw characters standing on the ceiling in the background because they couldn't afford to insert them into the conversation by cutting to another shot. It makes an already funny and weird show hilarious and surreal.

Is it possible to do something similar with text? You obviously can't pull off purely visual humor in prose, but I wonder if it's possible to take elements of writing that are technically bad and turn them into a style of comedy or surrealism. It wouldn't be easy to pull off, but it'd definitely be something unique and memorable. Make the writer lazy, arbitrarily stick to a word count, leave in bad grammar and punctuation, or make it a school writing assignment with other dumb requirements.
