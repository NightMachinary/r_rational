I like this one a lot! Although to be fair, I might be slightly biased because my fiction tends to naturally devolve into "several people sitting in a featureless room talking" anyway.

I decided to go for a story that could plausibly have been shot as a low budget student film (takes place entirely in a classroom, only one adult role).
