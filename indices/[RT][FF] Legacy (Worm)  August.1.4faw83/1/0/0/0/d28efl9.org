It's pretty unfortunate, there's [[https://ficsave.com/][ficsave]] (which is great for Fanfiction), and a couple others that work sporadically on other sites, but I still haven't found anything that works on Spacebattles or Sufficient Velocity.

Meanwhile, the [[http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule][20-20]] rule and taking frequent breaks were lifesavers once I learned about them.
