We had exhausted the possibility of encountering any uncontacted civilization on this Earth. Alas, there's nothing more exotic than the oriental. No lost civilization or big grand mysteries.

But what if we made Earth bigger? Ginormously big that uncontacted civilization became possible!

Big enough for parallel histories to play side-by-side until contact in the 21st century or later.

That's the idea behind this world.
