I definitely felt that him comforting Emma was just a play to wrap her even further around his finger. Unless he was just posturing to make Angelo think better of him (which is unlikely given his other behavior), it's pretty clear that he thinks of the female players as sex objects and nothing more.

I think he's your run-of-the-mill misogynist. He might be an upstanding guy in other areas, but his treatment of women is abhorrent.
