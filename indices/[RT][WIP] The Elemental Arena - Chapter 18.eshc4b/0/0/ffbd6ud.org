Yeah, this chapter was a conga line of humiliation for Nathan, mostly by his own hand. It was a painful read.

I think Maya's probably wrong about the various firsts because they're all individual achievements worth 2 NPs. You'd think that the participant awards would be far weaker in this case, and that Maya herself with her high Mental stat would have stumbled upon one of these. For that matter, Nathan has a knack for uncovering skills, and he hasn't triggered such an award, either.

The 5 NP awards we've seen were based on surviving an interval, so a first done achievement for those seems unlikely.
