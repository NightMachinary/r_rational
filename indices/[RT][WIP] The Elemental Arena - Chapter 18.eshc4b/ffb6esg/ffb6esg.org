Well my prediction about item crafting being a wood prime skill was correct, not too surprising. Gotta say I didn't really care much for this chapter. Reading people get mad on behalf of another person's "honor" or "dignity" or whatever makes me cringe like I'm watching a particularly awkward episode of the Office.

Really though, there wasn't much that happened this chapter. We got one team decision (and not even the actual implementation of it, just committal), a character being berated for being dumb, then that character being dumb again in a slightly different way. It's not like I hate characterization chapters, but this one felt devoid of anything meaningful.

It's interesting to me how they assumed that every single other action they took that net EPs would have granted them affinity, because that honestly hadn't even crossed my mind. I took for granted that only significant actions would give them anything, the only other one I can imagine them having missed would be the first to kill a monster. The rest are more fundamentally individual activities, which would conflict with the bonus being awarded to the contributing group.
