I don't feel like I know enough about Harrison to really get a grip on the guy. He's got a mouth on him, sure, but you get these moments like him comforting Emma in the last chapter.

If the Immortal Collective's selection process can admit true sociopaths, this guy may well be one. It's also possible the guy is really stand-up and just doesn't know any better than to be an ass.

Regardless, Nathan's attack on him was in no way the right thing to do. It was a tactical and strategic blunder. He's at best alienated a handful of people, and at worst made himself one of the most dangerous enemies possible in his situation, with no good outcome possible.

The protagonist clearly wasn't thinking right when he did it.

I wonder what the long term result of this situation will be for Nathan. Lilly was right to point out that he's got some great potential as a leader. He really needs to get his head in the right place, though.
