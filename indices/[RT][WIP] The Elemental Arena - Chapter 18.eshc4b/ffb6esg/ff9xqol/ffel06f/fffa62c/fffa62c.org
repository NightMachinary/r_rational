Whatever benefit they get from the building will likely be pretty secondary to the first-in-zone reward. A vendor costs 200 NPs, or 125 NPs more than an outhouse. That's nearly 10 NPs per player, and NP distribution isn't exactly even. Once a vendor exists, players will be using NPs as currency, meaning they have to spend additional NPs to gain any real benefit aside from seeing lists of gear and maybe being able to sell items.

Also, players with more NPs would carry the burden of purchasing a vendor disproportionately.

- If they're close to the amount of NPs they'd need to upgrade a skill, the outhouse gets them the first in zone settlement reward and leaves them closer to purchasing their next skill upgrade.

- Alternately, players with low NP totals such as Johanna could feel guilty about making others carry them.

Keep in mind as well that the NP total isn't currently high enough to get any other building along with a vendor. The group can just barely afford a second medical tent and the outhouse (which is actually what I think they should do). Since the reward is time-sensitive, there's a big reason to get something immediately affordable rather than something with better innate long-term utility.

The coming encounter could well turn all of this on its ear.

- Players may learn something during the battle. (Admittedly, this is not likely.)

- NP awards could get them to the threshold where a vendor and outhouse are both affordable (multiple players harvesting monsters would provide a windfall of NPs).

- Player casualties (including unconsciousness) could net reduce available NPs.
