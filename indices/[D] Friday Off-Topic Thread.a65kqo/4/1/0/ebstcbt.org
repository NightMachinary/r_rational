  The shield hero manga is pretty solid, although not spectactular.

I agree that it is not spectactular but so far it is the best out of the five I have read. That is why I praised it so highly. I also honestly think if it had a good editor it could be as good as full metal alchemist. But I doubt it will ever reach that high. The ideas are there the execution is lacking.

  Amateur translated LNs almost always piss me off because the authors try to stick really close to the original work, and sacrafice entertainment for accuraccy.

That explains the super formal language I have seen in a few of them. Lol kinda throws ya out of the story.

  Pretty much the only amateur translation I've seen done well is for Kumo Desu Ga

Thanks for the recommendation. I have see this one a few times and passed over it. I will give it a look next.
