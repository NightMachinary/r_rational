I have been reading light novels again. This week it is The Rising of the Shield Hero. I highly recommend it. It is not rational but it is smart. It can be found here [[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ht04kyuro88vmf1/AADXv2rgLQBcrZ7MN3_a9rFFa?dl=0]]

If you want to get into light novels check out [[/r/LightNovels]] and/or pm me. If you have read shield hero tell me what you think of it.
