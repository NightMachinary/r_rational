Slay the Spire is a wonderful deck-builder roguelike game (and as it's exiting early access with a price hike next month, I can highly recommend getting it now or during the winter sale before then). Some time ago, the devs decided that they wanted to include a "beta art" mode to allow players to use the shitty mspaint placeholders that the devs had used, but there was a problem: some art was unusable due to copyright concerns, some art had been misplaced, and some cards had never had shitty art to begin with.

So the devs held an open contest and let people submit shitty mspaint art for any cards that needed it. I made some eight submissions, and six of them made it in.

Here are the submissions I made ("real" art on the left, beta art on the right) :

I have to say, it's pretty fuggin cool to see something I made be immortalized into an actual game like this.
