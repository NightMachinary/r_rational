/sideways glance/ Uh... yeah... Good thing that never happens... /coughs/

Five or six hours is extreme, but I've definitely had runs terminate in some bullshit that incensed me enough to start a new one and at least get back to where I was. I clearly lack discipline, and once I beat Ascension 15 on everyone and checked out Act 4 I decided to uninstall. Super fun game though.
