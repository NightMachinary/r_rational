I'd like to un-recommend Shield Hero, personally. It feels like the setting is designed purely to justify the main character's hatred/fear of women, to the point where it's unreadable without making me wonder what the hell happened to the author. Everything bad that happens to the MC is either directly done by a woman or caused by a woman (in extreme ways to boot), and it's just... gross the way the story deals with that.

Especially bad but more subtle is when the slave the MC has purchased is freed by the people who hate him because they think he's mistreating her. Her response is to tell them off because he isn't, which is fine... but instead of going on to experience character development where the two of them can interact without the control of slavery, she GOES BACK TO BEING HIS SLAVE, and it's presented as a good thing.
