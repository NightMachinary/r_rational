I liked it. It was kind of ridiculous, making characters exaggeratedly cruel just for the purpose of making his revenge more justified, but fine, I can tolerate that given how good the story is most of the time. I like stories with main characters who have clear and consistent character flaws that skews their perceptions in ridiculous and funny ways. I liked "The Seventh Horcrux" Harry Potter fanfic for similar reasons.

If you haven't already read it, I recommend Mushoku Tensei, as it kind of felt similar to the Shield Hero story, though without all the revenge stuff, and is less gamified.
