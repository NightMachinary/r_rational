The shield hero manga is pretty solid, although not spectactular.

Amateur translated LNs almost always piss me off because the authors try to stick really close to the original work, and sacrafice entertainment for accuraccy. Pretty much the only amateur translation I've seen done well is for Kumo Desu Ga. In all honesty most manga translators aren't that much better, but the visual humor carries more of the story's weight.
