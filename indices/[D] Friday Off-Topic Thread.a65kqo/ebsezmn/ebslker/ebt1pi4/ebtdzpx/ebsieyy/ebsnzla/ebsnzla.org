[[https://www.toothycat.net/%7Esham/Access_History.html][This]] got buried in the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a3j2yi/looking_for_a_certain_kind_of_story/][other thread]] so reposting here for more visibility; a translation of "Access History", by Maria and Sergey Dyachenko, at least rational-adjacent.

Two poems have been left untranslated, the content is not plot-significant.
