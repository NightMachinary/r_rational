Hmmm, it's a bit of a genre bait-and-switch, and also a short story, so it's actually surprisingly hard to summarize without spoilers.

In their work, the authors like to use settings that initially look like fantasy, but turn out to be sufficiently advanced something else, then put rational characters in those worlds and give them strong incentive to try to make sense of what is happening around them.
