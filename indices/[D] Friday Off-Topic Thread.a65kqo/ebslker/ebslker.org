Only 7 chapters in so far, but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][RE: Trailer Trash]] is pretty good. (Congratulations to the author for making the best rated page on RR! Well earned.)

The title pretty much says it all as far as the plot, and like many redo stories it could be considered a little Mary Sue like, but it's well done and doesn't go for the silly/comedic feel that you might think it would.
