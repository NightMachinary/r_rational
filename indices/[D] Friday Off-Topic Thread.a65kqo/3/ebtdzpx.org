Anyone else have literary pet peeves? Parts or styles of literature that you understand but hate?

Two for me are: too many points of view and non-linear stories.

Too many points of view: stories with a large number of characters is absolutely fine with me but I tend to highly prefer books with one point of view character and actively avoid any with more than five. Something about the constant character swapping, usually during cliffhanger moments, makes me go through phases of "I'm really interested in this character/part why leave?" and "I don't care about or enjoy this character, do I really want to read their part?" Books that have multiple points of view but don't swap back and forth don't bother me as much but can still get into this.

Nonlinear stories: This one kills me with Kurt Vonnegut specifically. I understand the point of it but this really makes me want to sit down and try to create a timeline to place each of the stories on but I'm not going to do this and I think looking one up shouldn't be needed to better enjoy the story. Even for nonlinear stories I enjoy this ranges from "Huh this must be before/after this other part" to "Ugh this doesn't seem to make sense based on this other part?!"

Having written this out I think the common denominator is that I believe these styles detract from the reading experience itself in order to enhance post reading enjoyment. These styles are also commonly used to create cheap shocking moments and tension, but I don't think that's an inherent part of them.
