I have several pet peeves with Heinlein. mostly his approach to military discipline being shoved into stories where it makes little or no sense...

the 'moral anvil' where the author hits you over the head about how their viewpoint is the only right one. hate that, and it was too common in the sword of truth series (one novel can be summarized as 'communism bad')

in regards to multiple viewpoints, i think the biggest problem is when every chapter switches between them in order... why not just break the book into sections about each character instead? because when it happens, you almost never see them cross aside from the very beginning and the end, which may be different books. so a good chunk of the novel is a B-story that isnt very important or interesting on its own (and may target a different demographic than the rest of the work). its filler in an already long series.
