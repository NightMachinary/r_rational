My problem is almost never with the fact that there are too many characters, it's that one of them is boring, unlikeable, or just not my thing. /Normally/ if I ran into a problem like that, I would just put the book down and move on to something else, but in the case of a book with multiple viewpoints, I feel compelled to slog through the thing that I don't like so that I can understand the thing that I'm reading for.

I think my biggest pet peeve with books is when they take too long to get going. I'm fine with a slow burn, at least to some extent, but that's somewhat distinct from spending too much time on setting things up, or just a stylistic choice to be slice-of-life for eight chapters before the plot actually gets moving.

Opposite this, I also tend to hate action prologues, especially if they're followed by a flashback to the actual start of the story. To me, that just smacks of bad pacing and a lack of faith in the reader. (Much more common in movies than books though.)
