I want to take a moment to point out that this was a very well-executed reveal.

So far, everything has been pointing to some sort of "conflict" between Zorian and Zach. But how could that be? We knew their goals (stopping the invasion and the primordial) were aligned. And it didn't seem right either to just have Zach be a super-amazing actor hiding all his evilness (that would have completely undercut the themes of the story regarding trust).

And now we have it. This reveal both explains the conflict and sets up a new obstacle, while also not retconning Zach's entire personality. It's something I'd never have thought of - and yet it makes complete sense.
