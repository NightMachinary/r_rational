#+begin_quote
  Thus, Red Robe could quite possibly know that the third looper is Zorian.
#+end_quote

Probably excessive. Zorian is making no secret that he is hanging out with Zach. What Benisek knows, everyone knows.

#+begin_quote
  It's still a big question how RR joined the loop.
#+end_quote

Is it? Maybe the primordial did it? If he was able to smuggle people out of the loop, why not sensible to suppose he could grant them markers. Temp marker -> corruption by primordial -> permanent marker -> exit. Silverlake just skipped the 3rd step.
