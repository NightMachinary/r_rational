There is no way this is finishing within 5 chapters without a Deus Ex Machina. Well, not literal one, a literary one.

I'm pretty certain he'll be able to do with hard work though, or at least has a decent chance. Clearly, divine magic is just another type of magic, and Zorian, Silverlake, and QI all have some experience with it. There are options.

I definitely didn't expect this though, but a divine geas does make a lot of sense. I'm curious what Silverlake has been doing, though, and I'm worried about her sanity. I doubt that whatever she thinks is 100% true, though. That said, the angels do have a really high focus on limiting loop repercussions, including extra loopers, so it makes sense they'd make a pact. There has to be some sort of loophole, though.

--------------

At the instant the fire drake attacked, my instant thought was this: it's a canary. In the original loop, no one helped Ilsa, but then Zach started to. Then, at whatever point, RR erased Veyers from the loop and Zach's mind, so that anyone who helps Zach could be an extra looper. Thus, Red Robe could quite possibly know that the third looper is Zorian.

It's still a big question how RR joined the loop. I still like the idea of someone being constantly befriended by Zach in the beginning, until they temporarily allied with QI to give RR a temporary marker. RR learned from QI to give himself a permanent marker, quite possibly with divine magic. Then, RR betrayed Zach, erasing his memories and Veyers from the loop. Perhaps Zach met RR through Veyers (I still like the Fortov theory, even if no theory fits perfectly), and deleted Veyers to make sure Zach would never have a plot thread to meet RR.

What would be even cooler would be if it was a double betrayal. RR agreed with Zach to get around the angel's pact, but still wanted to stop Panaxeth. They would totally want to work together if they were great friends; Zach really would want RR to not forget. So maybe RR learned the mind magic in order to remove himself and the original pact from memory, to work more in the shadows in preventing Panaxeth from coming out. The biggest problem is why would he constantly improve the invasion. My answer is to make sure Zach thinks they're super great, but easily beat them by the time he comes out unknowing.

I dunno, this is wild speculation. It would be amazing to see a double betrayal of the Antels and the Primordial. It would be even crazier if QI was once a looper with RR and left (though unlikely, because then he'd need the tools to leave, which would delete Zorian from the loop, but Panaxeth could have interfered; who knows).

Also, Angels are not good. They just want to enforce a lack of gods/divine intervention. Thus no Primordials, and super limited use of the gate (for worse case scenario). Especially since the gate's breaking.

I was also in the middle of making a theory about something weird going on with the fire drake, but that plot thread seems done. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
