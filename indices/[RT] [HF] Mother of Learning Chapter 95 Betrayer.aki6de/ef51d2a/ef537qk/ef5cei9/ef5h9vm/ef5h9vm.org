  IIRC angels can't actually manipulate divine energies, only the gods can do that. Angels just use things like artifacts and abilities given by the gods. Pre-built mechanisms.

Angels can manipulate divine energies, hell even Z and Z can do it to a limited extent after training QI. Nobody but the Gods themselves can /create/ divine energies, like the blessing mechanisms are from objects the Gods left behind.
