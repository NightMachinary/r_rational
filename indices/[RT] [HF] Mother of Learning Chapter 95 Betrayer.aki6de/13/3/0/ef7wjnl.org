I bite the complexity penalty in positing that this simulacra works differently than others. It's got some parsimony restored by the fact that one person entering the loop and splitting into two people makes more sense than one person entering the loop and some temporary looper managing to force themselves into it. (Of course, in fairness, that's exactly what happened for Zorian - but reasoning from that scenario we can at least be confident /some kind/ of soul magic is necessary to inject people into the time loop, and positing that it's a simulacra specific form of soul magic does not seem too bad.)
