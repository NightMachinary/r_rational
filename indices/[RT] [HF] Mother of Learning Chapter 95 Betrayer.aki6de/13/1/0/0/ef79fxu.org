Zach is less than 100 years in the loop and he is nowhere close to QI levels of soul magic (loop safeguards prevent the controller from being able to experiment, remember). Zach isn't creating new souls. And it doesn't matter how much experience with simulacra you have, it's not going to grow its own soul -- it shares one with the host (which is why you share your mana across all your simulacra).
