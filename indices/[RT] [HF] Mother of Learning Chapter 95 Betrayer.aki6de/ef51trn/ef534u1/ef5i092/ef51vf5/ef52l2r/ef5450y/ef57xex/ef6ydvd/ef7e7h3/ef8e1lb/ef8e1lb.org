As Z&Z have noted (and as the narrative has shown time and time again), QI is a very honorable lich, but he's also a pretty driven one. Over the course of all the loops we witnessed, very, very few things actually stopped the Ibasans from invading, and if QI has troops in the field, he shows up to defend them.

Who knows what will happen at this point w/r/t the invasion, but when you set up a villain like QI, you either knock him down or you make him good. He'll show up to bite it or help Z&Z, one or the other.
