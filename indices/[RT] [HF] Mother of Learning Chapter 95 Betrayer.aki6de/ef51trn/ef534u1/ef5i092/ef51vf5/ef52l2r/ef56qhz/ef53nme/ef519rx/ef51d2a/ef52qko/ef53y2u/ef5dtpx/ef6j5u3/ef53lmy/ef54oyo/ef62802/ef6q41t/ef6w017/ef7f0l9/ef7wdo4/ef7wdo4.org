I agree it's a bit unsatisfying when new magic is introduced late into a story, but more unsatisfying would be if Red Robe was not any encountered character so far. The only other reasonable candidate is Zorian's other brother, and we've got little evidence for that, and thematically I like it being a splinter version of Zach better. At least this would basically be an extension of other things about soul magic we've already seen, and not something entirely new.
