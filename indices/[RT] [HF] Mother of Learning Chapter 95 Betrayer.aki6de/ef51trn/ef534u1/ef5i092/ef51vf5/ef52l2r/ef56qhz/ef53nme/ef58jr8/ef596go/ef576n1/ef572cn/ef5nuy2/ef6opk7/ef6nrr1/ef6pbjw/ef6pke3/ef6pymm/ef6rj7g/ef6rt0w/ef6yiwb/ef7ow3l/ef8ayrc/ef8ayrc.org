I actually went a really long time without googling the title, so I didn't actually know the idiom it was based on: repetition is the mother of learning. It's a very clever title, and it's a theme reinforced by the stuff SlantedSlash brought up. I think the fact that RR is someone who would probably only become evil in the context of the loop will be important, or at least it will be someone who the main characters have interacted with and consider an ally (or one of themselves!).

And frankly, it's just sloppy storytelling if you set up a big, novel-defining mystery and then it just ends up being one of the bad guys all along. nobody103, who has never shied away from fun cliffhangers and excellent plot twists, doesn't strike me as that kind of writer.
