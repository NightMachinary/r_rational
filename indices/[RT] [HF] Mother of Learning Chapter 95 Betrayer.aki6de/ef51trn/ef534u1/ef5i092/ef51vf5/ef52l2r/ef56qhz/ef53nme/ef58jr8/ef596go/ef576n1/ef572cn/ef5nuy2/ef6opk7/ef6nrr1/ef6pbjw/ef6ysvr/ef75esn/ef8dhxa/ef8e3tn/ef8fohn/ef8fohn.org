  You can't hurt Zach's soul significantly without triggering a restart.

You're not supposed to be able to do mind magic either; as Zorian has mused, RR was pretty clever to have managed it. Given that he was that clever, if he's Sudomir, why not do something similar with soul magic? (Also, if he's that skilled, why did Zorian never have much trouble reading his deepest memories?)

  necromancers make shitty snap casters

And yet Zorian is in the loop because he and Zach were the victims of a powerful soul magic attack that had an effect that persisted between loops. And then it happened again, knocking them both out for a few more loops, with Zach in a state he might not have recovered from had Zorian not been there to intervene.

  I'll admit I have no clue how anyone gets their hands on the royal vault dagger without making a huge ruckus though.
#+end_quote

Presumably, if you asked some servant, they would just go grab the dagger for you because an angel told them to do it before the loop. If they did it for the Ziggurat of the Sun, why not do it for the capital?

In any case, like I said, it's theoretically possible---you can come up with a story that results in RR!Sudomir. It just doesn't line up with what we've seen so far.
