When he first meets Damien, Zorian talks about how by then, he was good enough to tell if someone was psychic quickly; when he encountered RR, he wasn't nearly as far along, and I don't recall him ever explicitly saying RR was a non-psychic, just that he wasn't very good. Which, as this chapter helps confirm, is a huge mistake---RR had to be damn good to manipulate Zach's memories without triggering the death pact's terms or the marker's safeguards. Just not as good as you can get by actually working with the spiders instead of against them.

And if Panaxeth can make Silverlake a new body outside the loop, what's stopping it from making a new one inside of it? And if it can get your soul through the gate, can't it hold onto the soul between resets, or manipulate it with the same kind of divine energies that the death pacts use?
