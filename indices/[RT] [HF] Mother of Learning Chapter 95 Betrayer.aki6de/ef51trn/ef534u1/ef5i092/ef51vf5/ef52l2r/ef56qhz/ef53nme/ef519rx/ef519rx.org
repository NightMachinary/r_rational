Holy shit. That was something else. Now Zach is the one on the chopping block. I knew Zach was hiding something but damnnn I thought it was something sinister. God damn. Zach is more altruistic than I thought he was. Also Silverlake finally making a reappearance is interesting. It's crazy how I can never predict things in this story. I still have no idea on how it's gonna end. The next few chapters are gonna be great
