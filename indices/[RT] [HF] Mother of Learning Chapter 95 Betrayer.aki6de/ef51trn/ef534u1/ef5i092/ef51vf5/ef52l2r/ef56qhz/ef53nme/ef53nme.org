Well, this was an informative chapter.

The letter says "Thank you for showing mercy." I wonder what that means? It sounds like RR expected ZZ to harm Veyers. Why would that be? Perhaps Veyers learned about the time loop and so RR knows that Zach needs to kill him?

"You know how to contact me." ... Do they? They don't seem confused about this line, but I have no idea how they're supposed to know how to contact RR.
