We need to know the complete terms of the contract in order to plan saving Zach. All we know that Zach probably got a divine blessing with the contract.

If Zorian can remove it from Zach, then perhaps Zach can deny the divine pact. If Zach could technically claim that the angels didn't fulfill their part, then they might not be able to collect. After all, Zach & Zorian collected the 5 keys by themselves to unlock the gate.

Or maybe Zorian can make the claim that he is exempt (& can be spared by Zach) as he made his own way as a looper & out of the Sovereign Gate without any angel's help.
