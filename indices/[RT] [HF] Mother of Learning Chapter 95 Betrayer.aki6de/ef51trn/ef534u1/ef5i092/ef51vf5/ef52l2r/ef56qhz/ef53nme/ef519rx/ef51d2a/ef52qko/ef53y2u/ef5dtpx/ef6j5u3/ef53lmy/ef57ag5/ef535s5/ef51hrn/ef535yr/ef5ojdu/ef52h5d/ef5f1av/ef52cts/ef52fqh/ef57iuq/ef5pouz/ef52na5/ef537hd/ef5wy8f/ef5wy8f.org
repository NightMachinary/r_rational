Alanic knows. Xvim possibly knows, or will know as soon as Zorian hands him his research notes. None of those notes can remain, if Zach is to fulfill his part of the pact. Zorian would have no valid explanation to give to Daimen to explain his skills other than a time loop, and even if Alanic, Xvim and Daimen were willing to be mind wiped for Zach, there would still be the matter of all the rest of the Taramatula being aware of Zorian's visit.

There are already too many variables, and there will only be more, as time goes on. A simple memory wipe won't solve this, or change how Zorian has soul sight. His soul itself is a creation of the time loop, just like Silverlake's and RR's bodies. Zach has to die.

Time to look into lichdom, I guess.
