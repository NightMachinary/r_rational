I find it strange how passive Tesen has been. Never showed up during the fight at the mansion, never showed up afterwards or looked for Zach, didn't grab the envelope from the porch (unless RR or Silverlake, whichever one placed it, somehow /knew/ that Tesen would not use that door before Z&Z walked by). That, plus the fact that he could be someone young Zach would go to for help, and the fact that he's one of the few people that could be granted permission to borrow the dagger, just makes him seem suspect in my mind. I have no idea what the connection with Veyers could be, though, if so.
