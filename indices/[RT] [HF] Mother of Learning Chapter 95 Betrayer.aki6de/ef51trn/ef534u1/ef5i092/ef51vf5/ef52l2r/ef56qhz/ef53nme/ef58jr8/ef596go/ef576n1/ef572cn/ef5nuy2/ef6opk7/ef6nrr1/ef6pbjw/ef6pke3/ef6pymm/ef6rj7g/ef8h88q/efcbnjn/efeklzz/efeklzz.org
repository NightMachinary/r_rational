+At some point I've lost track of+ e: In chapter 63, Zorian muses over the fact that doing any mind magic on Zach at all was pretty remarkable. The marker is a lot like QI's various protections, and should trigger if any major modifications start. RR was clever enough to bypass those, though he may have had Zach's help by convincing him it would be a way to bypass the death pact; Zorian doesn't dwell on it despite it being very weird.

Also, when Zorian sees Damien again for the first time in chapter 66, the narration points out Zorian “had gotten good enough at his mental powers to immediately tell when he was in the presence of another psychic individual.” Since he wasn't that good back 40 chapters before, in a terrifying life-or-death situation against a much stronger mage, I'm comfortable saying he could've made a mistake.
