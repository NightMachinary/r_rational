Wait wait wait, Silverlake just said that the Death Pacts are inscribed on souls right? And that they are frustratingly impossible to circumvent? But we know that in soul terms, Zach and Zorian are really Zarian and Zoriach, because they got pieces of each other's souls from when QI tried to soul meld them together. Zorian clearly isn't instinctively feeling the death pact even though he has a piece of Zach's soul, and Zorian has examined his own soul countless times without noticing anything like that, so something is off.

Hypothesis A: Something about the soul meld ritual QI used can be used to void death pacts.

Hypothesis B: Zach actually doesn't have a death pact, but Silverlake mind magic'ed him at some point to make him believe he does. The fact that Zach instinctively feels that he can't let anyone mind magic him is extra suspicious, since that is a clause that only makes sense to have if the control over him is mind magic related instead of a soul-scribed death pact.

Hypothesis C: Somehow, the time loop marker, which is supposed to be absolutely guarded against spreading to other souls, got spread over anyway thanks to the soul meld. Yet the death pact marker, which is supposed to be absolutely guarded against being removed, didn't get spread over. This makes little sense.
