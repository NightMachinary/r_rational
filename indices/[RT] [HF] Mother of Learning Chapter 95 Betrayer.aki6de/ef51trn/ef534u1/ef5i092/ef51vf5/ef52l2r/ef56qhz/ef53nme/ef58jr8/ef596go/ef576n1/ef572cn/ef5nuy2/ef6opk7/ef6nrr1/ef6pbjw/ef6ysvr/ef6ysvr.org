Why would Zach either a) use the crown to give him a temporary marker to a necromancer despite knowing that soul magic is one of the most dangerous things he faces (esp. given that the angels presumably explained why the ring was important if they also arranged for him to get it) or b) take Sudomir down to the gate where Panaxeth might talk to him?

What motivation would Zach have to do either of those things? Sudomir isn't just a boring solution, there's no plausible way for him to get into the loop.
