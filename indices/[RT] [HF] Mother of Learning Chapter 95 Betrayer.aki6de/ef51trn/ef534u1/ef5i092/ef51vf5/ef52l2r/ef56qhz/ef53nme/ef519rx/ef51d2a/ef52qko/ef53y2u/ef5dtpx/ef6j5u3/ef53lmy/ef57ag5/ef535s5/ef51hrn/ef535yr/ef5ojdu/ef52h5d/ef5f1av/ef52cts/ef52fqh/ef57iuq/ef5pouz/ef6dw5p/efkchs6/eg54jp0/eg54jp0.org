Every 3-4 weeks. You can find the next chapter target date on the author's bio. It always starts as three weeks after the last chapter, then about two weeks later either gets pushed back a week or stays the same. Once the target date is less than a week away, it never changes and the chapter is always released on that day, though time of day isn't consistent. For about 20 chapters I was trying to ignore the story long enough for two chapters to come out so I could read more than one at a time, but by now I've given up on that.
