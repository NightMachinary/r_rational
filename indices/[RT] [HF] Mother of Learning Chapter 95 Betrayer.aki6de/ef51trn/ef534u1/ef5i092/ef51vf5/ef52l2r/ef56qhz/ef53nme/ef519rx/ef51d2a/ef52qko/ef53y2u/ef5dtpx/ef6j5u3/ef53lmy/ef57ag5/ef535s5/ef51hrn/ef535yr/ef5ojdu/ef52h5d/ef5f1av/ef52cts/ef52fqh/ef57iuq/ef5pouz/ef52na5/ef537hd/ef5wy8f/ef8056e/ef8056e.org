  Alanic knows. Xvim possibly knows, or will know as soon as Zorian hands him his research notes.

Weren't they lost? If I remember it right, only some of Kael's note survived the escape. Also, Zorian hasn't reached Koth yet. Negotiation to make use Bakora is still underway. So, Zach admission will save him some trouble -- Zorian need to make up new excuse when he finally reached Koth.

Lichdom: I'm absolutely enthusiastic about it. If the pact is indeed about dying, not staying dead, lichdom is cool. Resurrection is much better. Especially after we know from Alanic soul training regime, that temporary death only caused a slight life-force damage. 2 minutes dying = inconvenience; hahaha.
