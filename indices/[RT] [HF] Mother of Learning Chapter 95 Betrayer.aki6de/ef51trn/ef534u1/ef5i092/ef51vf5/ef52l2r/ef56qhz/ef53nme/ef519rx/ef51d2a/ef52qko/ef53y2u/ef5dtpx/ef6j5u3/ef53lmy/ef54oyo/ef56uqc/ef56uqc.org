Is her model of Zach and Zorian bad enough to think that'd be a good use of her time, or was she doing something else simultaneously?

Edit: I suppose that she might be opting to try to waste Zorian's time, since if he doesn't cooperate he's the type to try to overcome the geas. And if he does find a method, maybe she can even use it herself.
