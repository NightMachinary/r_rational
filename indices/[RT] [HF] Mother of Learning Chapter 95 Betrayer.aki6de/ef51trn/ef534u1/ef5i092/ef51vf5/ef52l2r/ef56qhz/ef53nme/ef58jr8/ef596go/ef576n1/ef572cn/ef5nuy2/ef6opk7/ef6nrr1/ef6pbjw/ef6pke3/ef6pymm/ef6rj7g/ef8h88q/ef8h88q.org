How? For one thing, Zorian is my leading RR candidate, and he's there from the very beginning. But if you don't like that theory, there are lots of characters introduced in the first loop who Zach would've considered as somebody to bring to the gate and who might be persuaded by Panaxeth.

Alanic and Xvim are awfully distant from Zach, however, even though they both often come up in these discussions. Zach claims that Xvim never believed him about the loop until Zorian showed up, and Alanic is someone Zorian only knows because Kael tipped him off. For Zach, Alanic is just a guy who gets killed by Sudomir early on. Given that pre-mind-wipe Zach presumably already knew that most aspects of soul magic were out of reach for him in the loop (and the angels made the ring something he could just go ask for), he's not going to go rescue him just to find a teacher for a subject he can't learn.

And frankly, six months isn't long enough for Alanic to give up his moral code. He actually had a religious debate with the primordial monstrosity he was living inside of at the time, mere months before the scheduled end of his existence. And given his apparent power with both church and state, the idea that he would betray Cyoria would be very, very out of character.
