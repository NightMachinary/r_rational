Anyone being RR is going to be satisfying. For once we will have an enjoyable chance to compare and contrast time loop personalities. Sudomir could be completely different after experiencing the loop.

Alanic has already experienced his redemption and it would be weird for him to backslide like that. Sudomir has a gripping goal with his wife where we can end up seeing his labor towards that end.

Alanic has no further gripping reasons to be a malicious actor. He is a reformed necromancer. It would be an interesting case of when nobobdy is watching how one's ethic roll. 6 months doesn't seem viable for Alanic to decode the marker when he couldn't make much of the marker when he examined Zorian.

I still like the cut of your jib. Who was your suspects list before the Alanic conclusion?
