Oh shit, Zach is screwed as he is right now, because even if they defeat Red Robe and Silverlake, and Zorian wipes his mind, Alanic knows about the time loop, and Red Robe and Silverlake can just start telling people about the loop. Zorian could mind wipe them, but if they just explain it to someone random so Zorian didn't know, or use magic to amplify their voice and tell people during the invasion, then that's it.
