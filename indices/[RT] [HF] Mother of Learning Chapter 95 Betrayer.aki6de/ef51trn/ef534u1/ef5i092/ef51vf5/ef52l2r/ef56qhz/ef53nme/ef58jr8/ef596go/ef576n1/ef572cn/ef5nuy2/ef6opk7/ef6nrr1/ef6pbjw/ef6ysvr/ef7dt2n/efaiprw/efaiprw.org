Okay, even assuming that Zach treats Veyers as a project, and starts hanging out with him and Jornak. That's not unfathomable.

But why would he then either a) turn Jornak or Veyers' guardian into a temporary looper or b) take them down to see the gate? One of those things has to happen for RR to form a pact with Panaxeth, and given that we now know that Zach had a damn good reason to avoid getting attached to temporary loopers, I have to think it's the latter.

(These are also great questions to ask about Sudomir, another person it's hard to imagine Zach trusting enough to show them the gate.)
