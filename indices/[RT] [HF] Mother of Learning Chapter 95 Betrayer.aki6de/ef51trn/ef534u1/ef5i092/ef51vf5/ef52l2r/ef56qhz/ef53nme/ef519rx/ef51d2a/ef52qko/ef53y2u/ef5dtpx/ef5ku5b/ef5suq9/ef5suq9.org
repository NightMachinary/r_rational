Theory A has interesting implications. We know in Zorian's case, the foreign soul matter would be assimilated over time. Not be kept separate. If the duo found a way for Zach soul to momentarily lost identity to avoid angels detection, and keep it separate from the host until it spliced again into new body, that would be swell. I wonder if anyone would teach them that, if the spell's viable at all.

Postulate B is not really attractive. Zach has this paranoia against mind-magic after chapter 26. And he's constantly in the vicinity of Zorian, the master among human.
