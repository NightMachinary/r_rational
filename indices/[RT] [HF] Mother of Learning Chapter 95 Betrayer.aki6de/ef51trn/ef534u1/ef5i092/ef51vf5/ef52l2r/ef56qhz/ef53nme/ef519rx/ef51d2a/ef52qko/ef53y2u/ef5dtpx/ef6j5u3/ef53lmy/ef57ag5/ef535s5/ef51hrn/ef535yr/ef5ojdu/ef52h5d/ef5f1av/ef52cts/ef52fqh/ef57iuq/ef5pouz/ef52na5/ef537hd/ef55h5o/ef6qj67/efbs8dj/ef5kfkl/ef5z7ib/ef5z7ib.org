It was a bit underwhelming for me, I guess here are my highlights of the chapter:

Pan did make a custom body for Silverlake. It is still remains to be seen how special it is.

The angels are ... Well, after this chapter I'd say that they remind me of a incompetent people in power (bureaucracy) misinterpreting the orders or trying to follow something to the letter.

Gods, before leaving, casually told the lackeys they left:Try to make sure that no one is using SG when we are absent. If you have to use it, make sure the knowledge is not spread about it. It would be good if none of the primordials would escape their cages. And try to make sure the locals don't blow the planet up or at least try to prevent some wars/mindless slaughter.

So the idiots in charge had a large part in:

Cataclysm (tried to meddle in something and things went beyond bad).

Weeping (the splinter states were fighting for a long time for supremacy with a lot of bloodshed. Mages were usually heading those attacks/generals/whatever. So Angels decided to cut this ruling layer down a bit. Unsurprisingly the situation went from bad to worse and they especially hurt their own followers (church/priests tried to cure the sickness and were nearly wiped out).

They learned of the conspiracy to release Pan and the action they come up with is promising power/anything for a capable recruit (the time to hone his skills is long) with a minor deadly geas as collateral.

I guess the sentiment about capable people in government (especially in Easternish Europe) may have reflected inadvertently from author.

Zach had some suicidal tendencies for a long while and Red Robe is a friend?

Zach spent a lot of time in loop and learned and matured a lot. After he learned a lot he had seen the preventing primordial release would keep the status quo which causes a lot of regular folk suffering. And he met his RR and his passionate plan to make the world a better place. Zachs plan before encountering Zorian was die inside the loop (he asked his friend RR to remove some memories about loop so he could die in ignorance. And by dying he causes least amount of damage). Some sort of euthanasia. Then Zorian appearing in his life and it his life plan was derailed.
