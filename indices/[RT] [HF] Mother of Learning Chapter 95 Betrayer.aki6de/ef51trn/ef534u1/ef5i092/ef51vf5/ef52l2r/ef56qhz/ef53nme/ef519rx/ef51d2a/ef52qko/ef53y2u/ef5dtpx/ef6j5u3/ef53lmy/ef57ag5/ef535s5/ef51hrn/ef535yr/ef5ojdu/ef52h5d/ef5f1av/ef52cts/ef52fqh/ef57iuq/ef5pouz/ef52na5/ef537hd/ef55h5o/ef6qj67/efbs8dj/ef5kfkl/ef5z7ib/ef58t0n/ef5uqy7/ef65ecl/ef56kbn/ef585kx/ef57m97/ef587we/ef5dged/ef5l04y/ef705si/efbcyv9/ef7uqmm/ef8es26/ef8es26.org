  why did RR!Zorian go get Veyers as soon as he escaped the loop?
#+end_quote

Clearly, getting to Veyers before Z&Z could ensured that he could use him to figure out who the other looper was.

I like the idea that RR!Zorian thinks he can get Our Zorian to cooperate after he's already killed a bunch of people and cooperated with Silverlake. But honestly, I think it's a trap. RR being secretly good would be kind of disappointing at this stage, and I think it makes for a better story if the two Zorians came out of the loop wildly different.

(Also, I had my own giant Zorian-Is-RR post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/aazrb6/a_final_rr_theory_spoilers_through_93/][here]] if you want to compare notes/walls of text)
