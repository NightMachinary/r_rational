Actually. Hmm. I was trying to think of any connection between Veyers and Alanic that would explain why Red Robe would remove Veyers from the loop and later snatch him up outside the loop. And then I remembered that Alanic has a high proficiency in fire magic, /including an item that selectively protects people from his fire magic/.

...what if Alanic is an exiled / disgraced member of the Veyers noble family? He could end up being very sympathetic to Veyers, as someone who has also been mistreated by the Veyers family. Hell, the artifact could be something that he stole away from the family and would have been incredibly useful to Veyers.
