I guess I like to come up with those thin and far fetched theories just to amuse and pass time. It has to contain enough grains of truth though.

We know very little about angels. They are some alien species and they might not know a lot about lower species. All we know is some hate words from QI and that Sulrothum high priests communicates with them.

They are left in charge and some of the powerful tools are left for them to keep/maintain order.

Powerful alien race making some short sighted decisions about things/creatures they do not understand/really care? It is more than plausible. Especially left with some very powerful tools in their disposition.
