Excellent chapter and the perfect way to "up the stakes" for the end of the story!

Will Zach be able to get out of the death pact?

Surely there is no way he would kill Zorian and anyone else that knows about the time loop. Or perhaps there will be an "out" for him in some way. So exciting! I can't wait to see what happens next!
