But I think Zach's first words to Zorian after Zorian enters the loop are about being a looper. Yeah, in chapter 7 after Zach recovers from the soul meld and firsts interacts with awakened Zorian: "The whole world resets itself on the night of the summer festival and I am the only one that remembers what happened." " I've lived through this month.. God... 200 times now" "I don't remember how I started this time loop"

Etc. There were other instances where he told people too so clearly his instincts did not really make him feel like he couldn't tell people about the time loop which in this chapter was apparently one of the things that he wasn't supposed to talk about. If he believed that those restrictions by the angels were stopping him from telling people about the invasion, why did he not feel they stopped him from talking about the loop?
