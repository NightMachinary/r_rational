I agree with your Zorian-Is-RR theory although I don't think Red Robe is really evil. I think he just started to see Zach as an enemy after he learned about the angel-pact and acted accordingly.

  Unless RR!Zorian is actually an insane gambit where he's really good, and this is just a super complicated way of getting around Zach's death pact. But that's starting to get crazy.

Yeah, that's roughly my theory at this point. See my post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aki6de/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_95_betrayer/ef7uqmm/?context=3][here]].
