I have to wonder though, assuming this theory is true, how did he arrange to have himself killed in the loop, when he can't influence any loops past leaving short of using the knife? Or would he have originally just been targeted by the cultists normally, and co-opted them somehow?

Also, how would he have become friends with Zach when Zach was hyper focused on the invasion?

Finally, i can't help but think that Alanic being red robe would feel a little bit weak without the loop!Alanic we've come to know being there for context and confrontation.
