I would need to re-read all the relevant bits, but isn't the relevant trait a direct line to the Ikosian Emperor who we know used the gate last? That was always what I assumed; Zach got picked because he was basically the heir to the gate from the perspective of the angels, esp. given that his family owned it until his guardian sold it back to the current royals.

Of course, if that's not the reason why, I find it hard to believe it's something so coincidental and trivial. If Zach wasn't just the default gate user by dint of being the sole survivor of House Noveda, why would an unremarkable boy get picked to be the savior of the universe? We still can't conclude they're not sneaky machiavellian puppet masters until we actually know what's up with that, because it might be possible that Zach was designed to fetch Zorian or some other convoluted nonsense that led to the present circumstances.
