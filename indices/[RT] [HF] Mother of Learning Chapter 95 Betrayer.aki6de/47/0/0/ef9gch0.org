Misdirection against Zorian/the believed time traveling group. If Red Robe is in fact on Zachs side and was helping the invasion to simply gain training from the lich then I think it makes sense to appear opposed to Zach and to force him into hiding early on. Zorian potentially appearing meant they needed to see how Zorian would interact with Zach and that they needed to make the attempt appear genuine. To determine whether or not Zorian/the group was hostile to Zach and so that they don't have to worry about Zach being held hostage against them.

I don't think Red Robe is actually a pawn of the Primordial. My guess is that the rules the gods put in place insured that the first person to use the gate was able to leave as well as the person with the original marker. And that the primordial was bluffing when he said red robe was working with him.

Zorian didn't interact with Zach much during the loops Red Robe was there. I don't think it's a stretch to assume that a group of multiple time travelers isn't going to be willing to help Zach survive the month.

I think that the note in fact refers to Zach and that Veyers was originally removed from the loop for convenience, if Zach didn't intervene to protect the other students my guess is that people would have been injured and it'd have had butterfly effects on the campus.

Also Zach has to be kept in the dark due to the death pact and him actually having compulsions to kill people who tamper with his mind. Remember he'd have had no idea that Red Robe originally scrambled his mind without Zorian interfering. Red robe appearing hostile in fact makes it easier for Red robe to get Zorian to disable and mind alter Zach.

Honestly I don't have a strong conviction to this theory. I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case tho. I'm working backwards here. I started with "How can this story end in 5 chapters".
