Maybe we already have the solution to this. Remember Sudomir's wife? She died during the plague thing, and Sudomir kept her soul. Part of the deal he had with QI was a modified version of the ritual that turns people into a lich, made so that it works on a disembodied soul. If Zach dies, and his soul isn't immediately swept away to the afterlife through the death pact, Zorian could potentially deal with QI to get that spell and reincarnate Zach as a lich. A lot of people have speculated that Zorian would become a lich because of all the nefarious magics he learned in the loop, but this would be a really fitting way for him to use that knowledge.

To get QI's help, they could probably offer him the Orb or one of the other pieces of the Key. He's always portrayed as someone who honors his deals, so the idea isn't completely unworkable.
