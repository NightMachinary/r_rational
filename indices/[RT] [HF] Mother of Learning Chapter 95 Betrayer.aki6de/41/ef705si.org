So all they have to do at the end of the month is erase Zorians Memorys concerning the time loop and reinstate something that tells him not to go after those memories ( he can already do that himself)... he will have all his skills, shaping skills, pure technical knowledge etc... maybe he goes back to be an ass but then its Zach job to befriend him again, not that much of a problem. More of a problem is to kill Silverlake and Red Robe.
