i think you missed something.

The angels gave him the Increased mana & the death pact so it was probably a deal, they needed him to be powerful enough to stop all this hence the mana, they did not want the news of the gate to spread hence the death pact. he made a deal with the angels pure and simple.

Zach was always a good candidate, his status as last heir to the Noveda opens a lot of doors, he have more liquid assets then most. he is young and healthy with lots of stamina, so basically he got almost everything going for him to stop this. (now RR is a problem but that was caused inside the loop so it was a problem the angels could not have forseen, without RR Zach could probably have stopped everything himself)
