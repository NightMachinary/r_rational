I wonder if the story is going to end with Zorian taking a hacksaw to his own brain.

Last chapter, last scene, just wipe away all memories of the time loop so that both Zorian and Zach can live.

Not sure where that'd leave Zorian (probably not all the way back to pre-loop self, maybe something like false memories of how he got his powers) if he does try it, but it'd be a nice dramatic end for the story.
