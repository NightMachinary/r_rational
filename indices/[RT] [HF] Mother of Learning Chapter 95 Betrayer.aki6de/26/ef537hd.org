I get the feeling there will be no weaseling their way out of this one, either Zach will snuff it or Zorian will be completely mind-wiped when it's all said and done. There's a more narrative appeal to Zorian either biting the dust or getting wiped at the end in my opinion, going back to the cyclical nature the plot is based on and building on how much Zorian has matured as a person over the course of the story. Zach doing a heroic sacrifice feels like it doesn't tie in as well with zorian's arc and wouldn't be as satisfying.
