I think it's just part of him being a crappy corrupt caretaker. From the sounds of it he's gotten pretty much everything he wanted out of the Noveda estate so he doesn't really care what happens to it outside of keeping up appearances. I'd be surprised if he was Red Robe, there's no way Zach wouldn't notice him acting different considering he probably thrashed him dozens of times in the loop. Also he'd never trust Tesen enough to tell him the things he told Red Robe.
