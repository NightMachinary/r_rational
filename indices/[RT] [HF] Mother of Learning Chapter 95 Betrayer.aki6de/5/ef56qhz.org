This explains a lot. Looks like the Veyers thing was part of Red Robe's plan, just not in the way we were thinking. He just wanted to get an idea what kind of people his opponent's are. Also as a lot of people guessed Silverlake is young again and the familiar destabilizing her magic nicely explains why she hasn't been around, pretty obvious in retrospect. The death pact Zach is under explains so much. It wasn't just a clever compulsion from Red Robe that pushed him to act so strangely, it was also the pact in his soul he no longer understood all the details of. Maybe he met with Red Robe to specifically figure out a way around the geas then got screwed over, assuming Red Robe isn't actually Veyers.
