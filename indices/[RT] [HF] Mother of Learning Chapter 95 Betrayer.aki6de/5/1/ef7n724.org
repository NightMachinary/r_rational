Yeah, I think people often forget how early Red Robe left the loop. He didn't experience all the adventures that Zorian and Zach went on, likely didn't even know who Zorian was. Zorian is coming into this with all these experiences of what Red Robe did in the time loop and years of thinking about it, but Red Robe likely left shortly after learning that other loopers (outside of Zach) existed, and didn't even know who they were.
