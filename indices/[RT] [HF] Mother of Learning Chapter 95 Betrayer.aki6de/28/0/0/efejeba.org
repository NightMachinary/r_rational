It is interesting that RR was able to use mind magic on Zach, but Zorian cannot (unless he uses his secret weapon).

I guess the explanation is that RR used mind magic on Zach in one of the first few iterations, when Zach was much weaker (I'm assuming Zach was always under the compulsion to kill anyone who tries to use mind magic on him). But that means that RR was much better at magic than Zach in one of the earliest iterations. That does not sound like Veyers. Although I guess it could have been Veyers colluding with QI. Which could also explain how Veyers became a looper -- QI helped him. But that raises the question about why QI did not make himself a looper.
