  "The primordial cannot directly discuss this," Silverlake said. "He hinted at it, and Red Robe explained the details of it to me later. I don't know how he knows so much about it, but presumably *Zach told him that personally while he still remembered.*"

The above is inconsistent with the below.

  "I didn't know the details," Zach said defensively. "I didn't know I'd made a deal with angels, or even that it /was/ a deal. All I knew was that I have these... instincts... that tell me things. I can't really talk about them..."

  "Can't or won't?" Zorian asked.

  "Can't," Zach said. "I get tongue-tied whenever I try."

So, Zach couldn't tell, and RR still knows. Are we adding that to the pile of mysteries?

Was it something RR found out by mind-reading, then mind-wiping Zach to prevent Zach from having to kill him? I could even speculate that RR and Zach were allies up to this point, with Zach willingly allowing access to his mind somehow.

I'm quite happy that this finally gives a compelling reason why Zach vehemently opposed having his mind read, despite the evidence of his mind being tampered with. He either was compelled to do so by his 'instincts', or simply didn't want to take the risk of being forced to kill Zorian.
