At the very least, right before Zach dies open a dimensional portal to the mansion. His soul gets sucked in, Zorian can go learn some more soul magic then pluck his soul out and attach it to a golem or something. This is kind of satisfying because it uses several plot elements + Zorian skills we know about - the Sudomir subplot, Zorian's spell formula experience, etc.
