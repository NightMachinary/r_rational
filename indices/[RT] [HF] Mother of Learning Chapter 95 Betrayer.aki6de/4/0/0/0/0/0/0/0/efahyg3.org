You're right, I don't get your banter. Are you saying that RR, Silverlake, Zorian, and Zach are all going to team up? And they'll be on the other side of this from QI? Who is presumably allied with RR, or is at least receiving aid from him?

My point is that at this point in the story, QI has a role to play. He's the bad guy that the good guys have only ever driven back; even Z&Z at their peak aren't enough to take him on their own, they need a whole crew of top-tier archmages and a teleporting hydra. By this logic, QI will get murdered to demonstrate another antagonist's power, he will be defeated in some climactic conflict with Zach or Zorian, /or/ he will turn good and it'll be a “if you can't beat ‘em, join ‘em” kind of moment.

This is just based on the logic of stories generally. QI has been too important to the story for him to just show up with his troops, discover that things are completely off the rails, and then fuck back off to Sudomir's manor. He either has to be dealt with decisively or he has to become someone we don't mind seeing as one of the good guys.

That's all I'm trying to say anyway; I get the impression we're talking past each other, so maybe I'm just ranting to myself more than anything. Sorry about that.
