I would imagine Quatach Ichl will noped out of Cyoria once he realized what at stake. Why risked himself when the angels and primordial already planned to make a ruckus? He would be on standby, of course, in case angel team won without much fanfare. But he would be staying at Iasku Mansion when the event unfold. Not in the middle of it.
