  I don't think Red Robe is really evil

He's already responsible for the real, permanent deaths of thousands of people in order to create wraith bombs. Hard to come back from that, I imagine.

But yeah, broadly, I agree; I don't think Zorian had to start evil to grow up to be RR. Zach's death pact is just another little complication that makes it easier for someone to decide to join Team Panaxeth.
