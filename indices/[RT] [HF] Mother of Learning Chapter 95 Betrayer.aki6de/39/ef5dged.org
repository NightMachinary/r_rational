Very interesting chapter. Silverlake is being as crafty as ever, and I honestly didn't see the divine death pact coming, though it's another great escalation.

But as far as my Zorian-Is-RR theory goes, a mixed bag, like the rest of the chapter. On the one hand, another Zorian gives Zach an interesting route to defeat the death pact---maybe the angels' pact will be satisfied somehow by just killing one of the Zorians, or maybe Zorian can figure out some complicated way to take his soul and stuff it into RR!Zorian's corpse after the month is over.

But on the other hand, this theoretical RR!Zorian doesn't seem like the type to do the whole “thank you for showing mercy” thing. Unless RR!Zorian is actually an insane gambit where he's really good, and this is just a super complicated way of getting around Zach's death pact. But that's starting to get crazy.

Either way, it's interesting that Zorian starts the chapter thinking about how /obviously/ RR got his start as a temporary looper. Given what we later learn about Zach's pact with the angels, it makes it far less likely that he would've gotten involved with an effort to bring someone out of the loop with him.

But if it isn't Zorian (still my leading candidate, though it feels shakier after that chapter), we now have some extra info about who it is. Somebody who could either convince Zach to change his mind, or get into a position where they could talk to Panaxeth. And whoever it is, presumably they knew about Zach's angelic death pact, or Panaxeth told them; that might help convince lots of people to think helping a primordial was a good idea.

Lots to digest in this chapter. Maybe I'll have a better idea of what's up after I sleep on it.

edit: Maybe the whole “showing mercy” bit is just RR pretending to be Veyers a little longer? But why? And is it significant that the bad guys are continuing to try and tempt Zorian?
