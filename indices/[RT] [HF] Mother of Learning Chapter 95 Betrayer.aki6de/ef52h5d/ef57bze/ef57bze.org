Well, that doesn't make much sense. He seemed awfully willing to share the fact that he was a looper with just about anyone in the loop. He talked about trying to convince Zorian himself multiple times but he just wouldn't believe it until he became a looper too. Or am I misunderstanding you?

I assumed he wanted to beat the invasion alone because he knew once he was outside the loop he wouldn't be able to rely on anyone else, or tell them about his foreknowledge. So he wanted to practice with the same conditions that he would have once he exited the loop.
