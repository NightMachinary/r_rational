What I am saying is that if he believed he would have to kill anyone he told about the loop, why did he tell so many people? What would his strength have to do with it? Also, in my memory he was still telling some people even after he had gained significant power... Or at the very least not trying to hide it (like when Zorian first started looping) I will have to look back.
