I guess we know why Zach spent so much time studying the divine energies on his soul, even after giving up on modifying the temporary markers. He was looking for the death pact mechanism, so he could circumvent it.

  His fellow time traveler was sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes closed, trying to sense the divine energies of his divine blessing and Controller marker. Zorian wasn't sure why he was doing that, to be honest. Both he and Zach had already succeeded at percieving those divine energies, and it was unlikely he would develop the skill much in what time they had before the end of the restart. On top of that, they had basically given up on trying to modify the temporary markers. There was little point to that now.
