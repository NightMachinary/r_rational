Oooh, I get why he was trying to beat the invasion alone. His memories of the mechanics of the time loop were erased by RR. That means he had no idea he was actually living in a "simulated" world. He "knew" that anyone he told, he would be forced to kill at the end of the month, or die himself, because he never knew that he wasn't living in the real world. And the first time Z&Z actually had the ability to coordinate, Zorian had figured out that they were living in a simulation of the real world instead of the real thing, and that in said simulated world there is nothing past the end of the month.
