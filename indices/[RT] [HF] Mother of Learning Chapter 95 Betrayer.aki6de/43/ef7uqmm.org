As I expect the true identity of Red Robe to be revealed within the next couple of chapters, I'd like to go on record with my Red Robe theory. I don't love it. I'm clearly making most of it up as I go, but it's the best I've got.

Zorian is Red Robe. Or, well, a copy of Zorian is Red Robe.

Some time before Zach got mind-wiped of Veyers, he placed a temporary marker on Zorian. Before the end of this temporary marker, Zorian is approached by Panaxeth and offered a deal. In exchange for doing his best to make the invasion a success and helping Panaxeth to be released, Zorian will be made a permanent looper and allowed to leave the loop whenever he wants. Zorian initially refuses, hoping he can find another way to escape the time loop or become a more longterm looper, but then he learns that Zach has a pact with the angels and is soul-bound to kill him if Zorian ever makes it out.

So Zorian changes his mind. But instead of merely becoming a permanent looper with a get-out-of-the-time-loop-free-card, Zorian also asks Panaxeth for an extra, unmarked copy of his soul (and body for that matter) to live the life he would have lived in the loop if he didn't make this deal with Panaxeth. Why? Because he is also planning on wiping Zach's memory of himself and when he starts helping the invasion in the loop, Zach would be able to figure out that the mysterious Red Robe must be Zorian if Zorian was totally absent. (We know that this is within Panaxeth's power to do, for the record, even if he never explicitly offered this deal to anyone. The whole time loop functions by leveraging Panaxeth's power to copy the souls of everyone in the world. What's one more soul?)

Panaxeth agrees to the deal, this Zorian becomes Red Robe and wipes Zach's memory of these events. But what about Veyers? Why did he wipe Veyers from Zach's mind? Because they had "soul-killed" Veyers together at some point on their adventures together. In order to wipe Zach's memory of himself, he had to wipe Zach's memory of them soul-killing Veyers, and if Zach doesn't remember soul-killing Veyers, he'll be confused when Veyer's doesn't show up to school like he usually does. Easiest to just wipe Zach's memory of Veyers entirely so as not to arouse suspicion.

Why did they soul-kill Veyers in the first place? Probably because he always got in a fight with a drake near the beginning of the loop and the flames tended to kill an innocent bystander (which may well have happened in the most recent chapter if Zorian and Zach hadn't been there to tend to the flames). Or because Veyers was just annoying them or they were just testing out the power and Veyers just happened to get hit. Whatever it was, wiping Zach's memory of Veyers wasn't for Veyer's sake. It was so that Zach wouldn't be able to figure out that he'd been mind-wiped.

One last question - why did RR!Zorian go get Veyers as soon as he escaped the loop? Likely because Silverlake had talked to him and, as such, he knew that Veyers was Zach and protagonist!Zorian's lead suspect and he wanted them to persist in that false belief. After observing Zach and Zorian's post-loop behavior for a while (and maybe by talking to Silverlake some more), he determined that they might not really be enemies after all. He decided to release Veyers to see what they'd do to him. They showed mercy, so now he wants to see if they can work together to get him out of his deal with Panaxeth. End theory.
