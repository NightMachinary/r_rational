OK, now's a good time. *RedRobe is Veyers Boranova.* I won't explain how, because I don't know. But here's the deduction.

1. RedRobe cares about Jornak Dokochin the lawyer. When interrogated, Jornak was not that fond for Veyers. Him saving the kid would be unthinkable. The counter argument: He could grew attached to the kid, like Zorian grew attached to Taiven despite their fairly distanced relationship at the beginning. It's a sound argument, but I wouldn't want to put much weight on that. I grew fond of Occam Razor.
2. The memory that's erased from Zach is on Veyers. RedRobe, because he presumably understood he would be killed if Zach knew about him, went on to erase the memory of himself. The counter argument: Veyers being erased could be a tactic employed by RedRobe for the sake of completion, as in, why just erase myself, why not everyone that could be connected to me; just like Aranea. It's also a sound argument and I'd put more weight to it that the Taiven-Zorian analogy, but I would like to think RedRobe was not as paranoid when he did memory erasure.
3. RedRobe left Veyers to his own device after some measure of security because he's fond his naive cringey old self. Unlike Zorian who got no option but to kill his old self, RedRobe could see him from afar. Beside, killing him or bound him in some kind of dungeon will be detriment to his plan. So, why not just spare him? The counter argument: Sending Veyers to his own device will provoke Zach and Zorian into hostile action, which ultimately will be a detriment to their plan. I won't put much stock on this counter-argument, because RedRobe was cautious; he won't underestimate the skill level of Zach and other ex-looper to get rid of Veyers without anyone noticing. Instead of thrown wrench, Veyers just became a momentary distraction if he follow this logic.

I think I have some other rationale behind these three, but I can't remember at the moment. So there you have it.
