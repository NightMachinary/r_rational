Why not just rewrite his own memory to remove the time loop but create plausible alternative stories for how he got his knowledge/powers? Maybe even use a permanent aging potion to make himself look older. It seems like the angels don't care about new archmage-level humans coming out of the time loop, they just don't want anyone to know about the existence of the Sovereign Gate + loop.
