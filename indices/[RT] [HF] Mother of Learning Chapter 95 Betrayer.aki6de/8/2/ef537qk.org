I wonder if redacting the knowledge that a loop exists is enough, magically keeping the skills, and regaining the memories after the "loop" ends.

Probably playing with fire, doing it like that, though. Best way would be to dissolve the pact, though. There must be a way to deal with divine magic, though. Just steal magic from the angels just like they did with everyone else.

Imagine doing blood magic on an angel to gain the ability to manipulate divine energies.
