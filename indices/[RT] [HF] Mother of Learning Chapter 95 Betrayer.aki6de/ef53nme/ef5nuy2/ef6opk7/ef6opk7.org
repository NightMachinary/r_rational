You know, I hadn't considered that before now, and while I think it's unlikely, it does make one piece of the puzzle fit: We've established that Alanic and Silverlake already know each other and don't trust each other. And we know that Silverlake and Red Robe aren't working together too well. Silverlake stated this chapter that she's withheld info from Red Robe, and it was implied this was for purely selfish reasons.

If Red Robe /is/ Alanic, this makes a lot more sense, because Red Robe is going to be immediately distrustful of Silverlake from the moment she shows up, even if they're 'supposed' to be on the same side. And Silverlake might assume he's going to backstab her the first chance he gets, so she's keeping him at arms length just as much as the she is the protagonists.
