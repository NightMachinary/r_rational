QI is heading the invasion. Zach might need to bring in some big guns to deal with him. Sudomir also keeps a pretty solid front as the mayor of Kynazov Dveri. He could plausibly brought in via the Veyers Cult connection.

I'll admit that Zach's modus operandi is as a solo actor, which makes the Sudomir connection tenuous. But we got to imagine that since the crown starts in QI possession, Zach will need to bring in some backup for a lich that up to this point in the story, he has been unable to solo. Zach could have possibly sought out QI countermeasures and ran into Sudomir in the process. He could have even been mind persuaded into stopping pursuing certain training directions with a lighter touch than the Ignore Veyers angle. Have some cudgel mind techniques in place to disguise more precise techniques.
