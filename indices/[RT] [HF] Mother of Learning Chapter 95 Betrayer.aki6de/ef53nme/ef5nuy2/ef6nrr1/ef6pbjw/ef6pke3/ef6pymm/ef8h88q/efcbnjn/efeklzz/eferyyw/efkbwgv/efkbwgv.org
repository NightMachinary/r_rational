Operative word there is "can," burnerpower. And it's funny, he /didn't/ directly attack RR's mind. He was playing defense:

  "Oh fine, have it your way," Red Robe said with a dramatic sigh. "I guess I'll just have to rip it out of your mind like I did with Zach. Regardless of what those arrogant bugs told you, the aranea aren't the only ones capable of mind magic."

  Zorian felt the other mage trying to connect with his mind, but he immediately realized the attempt was incredibly crude and simplistic. Zorian was better and he knew it. Not willing to let this mistake on the part of his opponent go to waste, he promptly clamped down on the connection and blew Red Robe's telepathic attack to bits before counter-invading his mind. Knowing he had no experience with subtle attacks, he simply proceeded to blast the Red Robe's mind with an undirected telepathic scream. Red Robe flinched back and tried to terminate the connection. When that failed, he reached for his spell rod, but Zorian caused his hand to spasm and it promptly slipped between his fingers and clattered to the floor of the cave.

  After several seconds Zorian realized that, while the other mage was no match for him when it came to telepathic combat, he wasn't defenseless either. He couldn't overpower Red Robe mentally, and the moment his concentration dropped the other mage was going to sever the connection and beat him to a pulp in the physical world. He tried to commandeer the Red Robe's limb to release its grip on him so he could flee but the hand remained resolutely wrapped around his neck.

Notice how he disdains the aranea; after he reads Zach's mind earlier in chapter 26, he calls them "thrice-damned bugs." But why wouldn't RR!Zorian have a different opinion? He would've entered the loop fully aware of what he had to do---free Panaxeth---and that goal wouldn't have taken him through the Dungeons of Cyoria, and it certainly wouldn't have endeared him to any passing aranea who happened to read his mind one loop. Our Zorian, who needed all the help he could get, had to rely on powerful allies like the aranea, but got /much/ more powerful as a result. And was still weaker than RR!

As for Veyers, perhaps Zorian and Zach soulkilled him together because Veyers was so dangerous at the beginning of every loop. Maybe Zach did it because Zorian got fried every time---you know how much he likes to sit next to the fire drake every day for the first class. Or perhaps Zorian decided to do it because it was a great false trail, soulkilling Veyers and erasing him from Zach's mind to mislead anybody who got wise to Zach's memory manipulation. Or maybe RR is doing a test, where he made Veyers aware of the loop, but erased the fact that Zach knew that Veyers knew from Zach's mind, and it's a very complicated way to see if the death pact gets triggered.

And if Panaxeth can make bodies outside the loop, why shouldn't he be able to make them inside the loop? Given Silverlake's hot new look, I think the theory still looks like a slam dunk to me.
