Sure, but that doesn't mean the narrative doesn't play a role. A rational story it may be, but it's still a story, and Red Robe being Sudomir would simply be unsatisfying.

Even Alanic is suboptimal due to how relatively late in the story he was mentioned, but it'd be surprising enough in other ways that it makes up for it. And every choice mentioned sufficiently early is ruled out by logic.
