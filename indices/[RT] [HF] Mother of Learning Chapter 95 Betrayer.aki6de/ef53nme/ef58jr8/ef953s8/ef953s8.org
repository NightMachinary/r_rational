No way. The letter must came from RedRobe about Veyers. Because, what's the point of sending letter if Silverlake herself would spare time to have face-to-face. And if you mean RedRobe thanking the duo about sparing original Silverlake, well, that sounds fantastical to me. RedRobe should not know Silverlake, because even the looper witch wouldn't say a thing about the original. She does not even care about her.
