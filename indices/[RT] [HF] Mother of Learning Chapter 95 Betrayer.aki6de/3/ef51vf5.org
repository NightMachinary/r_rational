A temporary memory packet might work as a loophole. The terms of the contract are specific about nobody knowing /at the end of the month/, and memory erasure is specifically called out as an alternative to murder.

If Zorian forgets everything and picks it up back after, it might work. Nothing to lose by trying it, at least.
