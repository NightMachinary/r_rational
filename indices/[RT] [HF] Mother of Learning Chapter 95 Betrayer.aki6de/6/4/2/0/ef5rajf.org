It just seems in-character for Alanic. And aside from not having been mentioned early enough, he's the most dramatic pick that still makes logical sense. He knows soul magic, he didn't speak to Zorian during the time Red Robe was operating in the loop, and him being Red Robe would be surprising given his religiosity. He's honestly my bet currently.
