We can't focus on narrative ALONE though, logic also needs to play a part. Fortov was far too predictable in the first resets for it to be him, PLUS, there were no signs that Red Robe personally knew Zorian.

Alanic is both narratively satisfying (despite having the fact that he wasn't mentioned in the first loops stacked against him) and logical.
