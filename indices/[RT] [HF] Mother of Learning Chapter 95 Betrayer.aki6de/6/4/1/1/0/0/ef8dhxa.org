All of that seems like incredibly subtle work for a guy who turns into an insane monster every time he's stressed out because he thought the best way to Ultimate Shapeshifting Power was to just mix all the best creatures together and chug the potion.

It's also worth noting that Panaxeth doesn't even give a shit if Zorian helps him after leaving the loop if he's willing to prevent Zach from leaving with mind magic; Sudomir, a capable soul mage, could probably do that kind of damage to Zach pretty easily. Why would RR!Sudomir be forced to work so hard for an invasion he already knows goes more or less flawlessly for his purposes?

If RR was Sudomir, why are none of his attacks remotely necromantic? Why do we not see more experimentation with souls and wraiths in the first arc, when RR!Sudomir would've had the perfect opportunity to really hone his necromancy skills?

I'm just not seeing it. It's theoretically possible, sure, but it seems pretty unlikely.
