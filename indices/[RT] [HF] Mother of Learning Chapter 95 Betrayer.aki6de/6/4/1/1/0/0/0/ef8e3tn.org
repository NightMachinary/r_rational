You can't hurt Zach's soul significantly without triggering a restart.

Alanic says at some point that necromancers make shitty snap casters. Most of their stuff is long duration rituals. Even during Sudomir's fight you primarily see constructs rather than traditional attacks. Loop is a great opportunity to shore weaknesses, fix the monsterification (which would be a badass final fight with a perfected ultra badass).

Perfected invasion is important cause Sudomir vaguely dislikes Eldemar and more souls mean more bombs and more power.

We don't know what happened early loops because Zach was likely mindwiped.

I'll admit I have no clue how anyone gets their hands on the royal vault dagger without making a huge ruckus though. Even with QI helping the burglary, that stuff was hard. Maybe RR has a finesse option for dagger rather than bashing heads.
