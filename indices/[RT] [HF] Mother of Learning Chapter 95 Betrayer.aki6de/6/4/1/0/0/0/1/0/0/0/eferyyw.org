Chapter 24: "I can sense all minds around me, empath or otherwise," Zorian said. "I also get some basic information about each mind -- how complex their thoughts are, their species, their gender, stuff like that. Empaths light up like little suns on my mind sense, so... sorry, Kiri."

He could definitely tell very early into his training who is and isn't psychic. I think all he meant about Daimien is that before he had improved he had a hard time tracking everyone around him at once which by the chapter he met Daimien he could do instantly and effortlessly. Seeing as he directly attacked Red Robe's mind there is no chance he wouldn't have noticed that RR was a psychic. Besides RR was worse at mental combat than Zorian and Zorian only had a few months training at it. A Zorian with decades more experience would certainly have been able to fend off such a novice assault. This also doesn't even start to consider that if RR was Zorian he has no reason to care about Veyers and no body to inhabit in the loop seeing as our Zorian is using it. I can kind of see the narrative irony of it but there is such a mountain of evidence against the idea there is no way it can be true.
