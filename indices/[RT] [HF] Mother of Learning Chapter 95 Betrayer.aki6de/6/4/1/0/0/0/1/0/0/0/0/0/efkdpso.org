Zorian literally invaded RR's mind to puppet his limbs and you think he somehow missed the fact that RR was psychic after previously describing psychics being like sun's to his mind sense. Sounds kind of hard to miss. Honestly I'm not sure how your quoted passage helps you, that looks like more evidence against your theory than anything. Also none of your theroies theories can explain why Red Robe cares about Veyers. Zorian strongly disliked the dude but RR clearly cares about his well being at least a little bit. To your final point, that's complete speculation. If Panaxeth had the ability to make alterations to the time loop template he would have already won. By just editing it so the loop begins with Zach breathing poison gas after RR left the loop, his greatest enemy respawns and immediately dies. If he can do something as complicated as edit the loop to spawn a whole new body, something like that would be trivial and our protagonists would have already lost. Forgive me but calling such a speculative theory a "slam dunk" strikes me as faintly ridiculous with all the evidence considered.
