I haven't been getting as much sleep as I supposed to, so I set up the productivity app on my computer to lock me out at night. I forgot that this means that I can't post the link a few minutes after midnight like I normally do, and classes have been busy enough today that it totally slipped my mind until just now. Sorry about that.
