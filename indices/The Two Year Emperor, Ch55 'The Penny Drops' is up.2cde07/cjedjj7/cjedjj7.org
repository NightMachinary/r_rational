Well, that explains why no one was resurrected. I'd been wondering.

We haven't really gotten any new information from Loki's answer, since the black flames were near certainly significant, but it still feels like an Oh shit moment. I would have guessed something along the lines of an alternate ritual, but Loki said that can't happen. Could the evil gods be interfering? I really want to read an expositiony answer about the gods.

Also, why didn't Jake add caveats to his question like "the answer must be in an easily readable format"?
