Rereading the last few chapters, I've found a few relevant seeming quotes

#+begin_quote
  she's the friggin' Goddess of Secrets and Knowledge. She's always been one of the primary allies that any god needs---or needs to neutralize---when things get serious.

  Once she's reified, she'll be inherently grateful to her creators, and highly motivated to help her worshippers."

  "Well, simply put, no. Starting a ritual like this requires abilities that undead simply don't have. So, no, he can't do his own copy of this ritual on his own ground and resurrect her before you finish yours, which is what I figure you really wanted to know.

There is a motive for Afi and the death gods to get Herrun on their side, because she's insanely useful. Or to neutralise her. They clearly think they'll benefit from her being resurrected or they would have intervened. She's inherently grateful to her creators, and is implied to have her personality shaped by them. This may also extend to alignment. So, Afi seems to be probably sacrificing secrets to her from his army of undead, to shape her to be evil. Black seems a likely color for evil, so that part makes sense.

Either Afi has his own ritual or is using their's. Loki says no undead could start the ritual or on undead land, but Afi must have some living minions, so it's still possible that he started another elsewhere. But that would imply some strange connection between their flame colors, so it's admittedly less likely. So, that leaves him using their ritual. Could the dragua run though their camp freely? They're not exactly friendly. And no one has mentioned hearing invisible dragua say prayers or the flames growing higher, again counting against it.

And there's the ash mystery, which I have literally no idea about.

Jake really needs to take care of his PTSD. It's getting a bit repetitive. This seems like it might be foreshadowing of it making a real difference later, or just an adherence to realism. I am unsure
