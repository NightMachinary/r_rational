I'm looking forward to the next chapter, though this one was a bit less fun. It was certainly well written and excellently, done, but most of it was centred on them not being able to do resurrections and the obvious truth that Afi had done something bad, not much new or actiony and it didn't contain much new information. On the challenge, reading the book...

Although there's no psionics... The skill autohypnosis (from psionics stuff) would be very useful. You can memorize 800/6 non magical words per second, no limit on font size. You could use it to find useful info.

I suppose he'll probably use polymorph any object to duplicate it, though I'd argue that true creation would better since the only stated limit is crafting skill, max 20.

It might be possible to bypass the antimagic. "Immunity to Magic (Ex)

A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. " Scholar's touch doesn't allow spell resistance. Depends on what magical immunity he granted them.

If you can remove the book from the library or block the antimagic emanation with a copper sheet (check exactly where it comes from) or use invoke magic you can then use scholar's touch.
