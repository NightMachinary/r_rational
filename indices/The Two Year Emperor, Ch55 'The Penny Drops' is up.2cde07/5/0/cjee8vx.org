Taking those in reverse order:

- The merchants actually couldn't buy them because 'howizter' doesn't appear on any of the equipment lists, so it doesn't have a price.
- There's no way I could write Sir Poley or EY believably, and I'm not going to try. Out of universe: bringing in more and better strategists, Munchkins, etc would make the story boring and confusing.
- Out of universe, see previous point. In universe, the ritual is extremely difficult and can only be executed when the stars are correct, or something. Yeah, let's go with that.
