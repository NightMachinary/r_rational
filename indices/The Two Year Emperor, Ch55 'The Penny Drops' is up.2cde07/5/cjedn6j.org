Okay, this has been bugging me for a while now:

Why hasn't Jake had his wizards summon other Smart People and D&D munchkins from his native plane?

It seems like having Sir Poley and EY as advisors (not to mention some /actual/ military strategists) would come in very handy.

Hell, he could summon engineers to manufacture modern weaponry, sell them to merchants (who then have an infinite supply) and buy back enough to equip everyone in Flobovia.
