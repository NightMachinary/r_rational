Can I get clarification on the mind blank thing at the early part of this chapter? I don't think I fully understand.

Afi did mind blank and invisibility on himself and cast an ice assassin targeted.. at himself? Then he walked into Gr fhamr and his Ice Assassin followed him? I think I need a step-by-step playthrough of that, because I'm trying to read through it and my eyes just gloss right over that section.
