Sure, no problem.

- Invisibility means no one can see you...
- Unless they have True Seeing, which can see through Invisibility...
- Unless you have Mind Blank which, in a world that works by revoltingly strict RAW, prevents True Seeing from seeing through your Invisibility.

The relevant text from [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/mindBlank.htm][Mind Blank]] is:

"This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. "

This is intended to cover things like Scrying and Detect Evil, but that's not what it says. What it says is 'divination spells'. True Seeing is in the Divination school, so Mind Blank prevents it from working on you.

As to the Ice Assassin: Afi cast IA on himself at some point -- could have been centuries ago, doesn't matter. That gave him a duplicate of himself (well, himself as he was at the time he cast it). The duplicate must obey his every command, so today he ordered it to put Invisibility and Mind Blank on itself and then go into GrÇ«fhamr and try to talk to Jake and the others.

Does that make sense?
