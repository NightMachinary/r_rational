I think that raises the question of what it means to know it.

To sacrifice the secret of a buried treasure's location, how precisely does one have to know it? Can you just name a town, or a landmark, a distance in feet, or does it have to be coordinates, and if so to how many decimal places?

Likewise for a book - does just knowing that a book, or a certain chapter of it, contains secrets count? Or do you have to have read the book? Or do you have to have understood the book well enough to be tested on it, and if so, what's the required passing grade?

....

Outside of that question, it does not appear that secrets require active knowledge. Herr√∫n's temple was destroyed, and the damage to her was not solely because of the knowledge of the people there, but also the records---many of which were presumably unread, at least not by anyone living. She also mentions pregnancies not yet known to anyone as a kind of secret.

....

Even outside of /that/ question...

  It has to be something that is actually a secret, and that benefits the person, either by staying a secret or by being revealed. [...] The person making the sacrifice will no longer remember it

Just /a/ secret, not /your/ secret. So theoretically I could sacrifice someone else's secret that would benefit me by being revealed (say, a wax-sealed paper from HJPEV containing the secret of Patronus 2.0 [[https://pay.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2cg3qa/on_the_disposition_of_a_characters_effects/][^{WHERE IS THIS LETTER NOW, BY THE WAY}]].)
