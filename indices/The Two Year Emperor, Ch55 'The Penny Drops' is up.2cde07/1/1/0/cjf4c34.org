  The bunker would be useful, but the information probably won't.
#+end_quote

Given the question as phrased, I expected the information to be absolutely useless.

He asked:

#+begin_quote
  "What is the set of words in a language that everyone at this table understands that contains all the truths that we most need to know and that you will award us for the cost of only a single question, sorted by importance from most important to least important?"
#+end_quote

I imagined receiving a result like "the, be, to, of, and..." (or a similar list, depending on how one is calculating importance). He asks for the set of /words/, not sentences or paragraphs or whatever, which is bad enough, and then he asks it to be /sorted/.

He asks the /words/ to be in a language understood, but not the /truths/. ("I decided to use this set of common English words as a cipher for [[http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Tamarian_language][Tamarian]].")

He asks for his result to contain all the truths, but not /only/ the truths, (though including untruths as well as truths would probably fall afoul of a 'not deceptive' answer).

Given Thor's tendency to go literal-genie when he doesn't like the question, Jake was /incredibly lucky/ to get something back that "contains the opening paragraph of the discussion about the nature of the gods".
