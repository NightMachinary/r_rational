Re Tamarian: Yeah, it's infeasible for the entirety of the language, but the trouble with the plot was that it /wasn't/ the entirety of the language - drop the names and you can still say "___ when the walls fell", "the river ____ in winter".

Saying that it was /necessary/ to speak the language, as I believe the plot of the episode did, was demanding too much... though I wouldn't put it past a culture to /customarily/ speak in references like "eaglejarl, his eggs bland" and consider more direct speech either rude or childish.
