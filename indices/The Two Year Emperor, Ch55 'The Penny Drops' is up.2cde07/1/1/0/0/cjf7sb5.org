Interesting point. You're right, Loki could have done that. Maybe he didn't think of it...?

EDIT: I always had a problem with Tamarian. Leaving aside the fact that any culture needs a way to say "pass the salt", there is the question of base truth. In order for the language to be comprehensible by a Tamarian, they need to know the underlying references. How do you convey the underlying references in a language that consists entirely of references to those references?

And yes, I saw how Darmok taught Picard. I'm dubious about being feasible for everything in the language.
