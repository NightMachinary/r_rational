Well, sure, I agree that the magical nukes made the consequences much more reasonable then "radiation did it" in base Fallout, but FO:E follows the exact same plot as Fallout 3 with only slight variations and flashbacks, and a different ending. It still takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to be fine with the absurd ratio of insane bandits to people they could actually be banditting, 200 years after the megaspells/bombs dropped, not to mention how pockets of <=50 people could survive in vaults for centuries with not even cultural drift.
