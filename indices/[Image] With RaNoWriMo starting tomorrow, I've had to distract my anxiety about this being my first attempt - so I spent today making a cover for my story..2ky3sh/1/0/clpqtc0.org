The best way to describe it is probably as a "parallel universe" to the original FO:E. Some settings, characters, an overall world-building will look similar, but nothing is going to be exactly the same - the story will be mostly original in plot and character.

For example, I plan on keeping Tenpony Tower, but DJ-Pon3 may or may not stay (and will be a very different character even if she does).
