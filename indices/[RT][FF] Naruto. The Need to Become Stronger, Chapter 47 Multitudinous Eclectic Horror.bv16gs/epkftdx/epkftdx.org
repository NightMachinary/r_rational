Ok, things are starting to come together now. First off, what does "Rin" mean when she says that shes everywhere? Clone technique obviously but there is no way that with a normal clone technique someone could hide from all of Konoha, especially with the Hyuga around. If only there was some foreshadowed way to use genjutstu on someone without having a physically present body. Kotoamatsukami? Maybe, or...\\
"Dan was known as the Ghost of Konoha because of his spirit transformation technique, which allowed him to project his spirit and even possess the bodies of his enemies. Orochimaru wanted that technique" -Tsunade CHP 39 This seems like a good fit for what we're seeing, with key figures everywhere being possesed by the spirit tranformation technique (re-read last chapter and you'll see that possession and genjutsu are basically the same thing). The members of the Yamanaka clan, to have the spirit cast a tiny chakra interference field around their head, while manipulating them subtly to ensure they can never get around the field. Hiashi Hyuga, to ensure that the Hyuga don't fill the gap the Yamanaka are leaving. Chiyo and Kakashi, to let Orochimaru get a hold of Kakashi's sharingan. The biggest problem is the question of how this technique is being applied, if we assume that the same rules for all of genjutsu apply for this technique then it seems like the defense is to simply flare your chakra, which is going to happen in the middle of a fight anyway, the fact that the spirit transformation technique could allow you to posses people even if your body/clone body is far away helps with this somewhat, but there are too many sharingan/byakugan users out there for you to reliably hide with this technique. That problem seems to favor the kotoamatsukami answer somewhat, if you assume that the kotoamatsukami cannot be dispelled, but that is quite the assumption to make. Of course if I was using this technique I would try and put a seal on my targets body or clothes and use that to possess them repeatedly, but who knows if that's even possible (though if it is possible it suddenly becomes A LOT more suspicious that missing-nin slash out their headbands). The other problem is that this theory suggests that "Rin" really is everywhere, which makes genjutsu pretty crazy strong, with her possessing numerous clan heads, and incredibly powerful ninja. This has become a lot less improbable to me recently, but this is still a knock against the theory.

On the subject of the power of genjutsu in this world, I'd like to note that this world finally makes sense to me, I was so confused for a while, I just didn't understand how this world could work with no clear defense against the OP OP genjutsu. How was the world not dominated by mind readers, how were the yamanaka clan the only mind readers to have prominence, it didn't make sense, even if you restrict genjutsu to mind reading and line of sight, things which it's been shown in the story to be able to do explicitly, it's still crazy powerful. Silly me, the author literally told us the only true defense. "The most important skill for any ninja to possess is the ability to remain hidden: Your foes cannot fight you if they do not know you exist, nor uncover your secrets if they are not aware of them" If you're unable to do that, well... "Poor Kakashi. You've been used and controlled by so many people, who can blame you for being unable to remember?" It makes me wonder about whether the hokage has some defense, since there was an assassination attempt against him not too long ago, I think the solution might be limited shadow clones, e.g. create a shadow clone that only has a certain portion of your knowledge, and only returns a small amount of knowledge/chakra, to prevent infection by proxy.

The next question is, what does "Rin" want with Naruto? There are two very good reasons to believe that someone has been setting Naruto up on at least 2 occasions, first is this line from "Rin" "I'm in the hospital too, just as I'm in the HyÅ«ga compound and the Uchiha district" The hospital is obvious, the Hyuga compound I've covered, but what are they doing in the Uchiha district, who is even there other than the sand siblings, Naruto, and Lee? (is sasuke nearby?) Which brings us to the next point, how the hell did Temari and Kankuro even find Naruto? It wasn't like they just stumbled onto them, they were clearly ready for a fight, what with their human puppets in tow. Thats occasion 1, occasion 2 is from a while ago. "He had his own team now, no matter how strange that thought seemed to him, and he knew that he had to protect them even if it killed him." lulwut Kakashi? do you seriously not remember leaving them to die against a stronger opponent back in the land of waves? Obvious point is that he left them to die in the land of waves to due the influence of genjutsu, but why? If "Rin" or anyone else powerful enough to put a genjutsu on Kakashi wanted Kakashi's team dead there are much better ways of doing it (even while staying incognito) then letting Haku handle it. Thinking it through, I've got two hypothesis as to why "Rin", wants to mess with Naruto: option 1 is that "Rin" wants to groom Naruto, by providing him a stream of opponents at the correct battle level, letting him become stronger for some purpose. Option 2 is that "Rin" wants to force Naruto to the brink, getting him to release the nine-tails like he almost did after his fight with Haku. Pit him against too strong of an opponent and he'll die too quickly, but against someone of the proper battle level he could have enough room to release the nine-tails without dying, which might be necessary to "Rin"'s plan for some reason.

If you couldn't tell from my way too big comment, I freaking loved this chapter. Absolutely amazing job. The battles continue to reach an absolutely absurdly high bar of quality, Kakashi's section was brilliantly creepy. If all this story was was an incredible Rational Mystery story it would be good, but somehow Sophronius keeps raising the bar on themself with great writing in nearly every category.
