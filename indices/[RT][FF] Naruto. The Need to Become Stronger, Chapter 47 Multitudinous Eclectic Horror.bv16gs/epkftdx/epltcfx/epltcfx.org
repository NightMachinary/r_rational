Nice catch re: the spirit transformation technique! I didn't notice this at all but it seems like the sort of hint Sophronius would drop.

Except, does that mean Oro gave it to Pain when he joined Akatsuki or that he's still working with them in this fic? Rin and Pain were a couple or something in canon and there's this line which seems pretty suggestive:

  “I'm in the hospital too, just as I'm in the Hyūga compound and the Uchiha district. Wherever pain and misery exist, there you'll find me waiting.”

Regarding Kakashi, I wasn't thinking of him as leaving Team 7 to die in the waves arc, but trusting them to survive. After all, he at least tried to trade the sharingan for their safety. Was your reading different?
