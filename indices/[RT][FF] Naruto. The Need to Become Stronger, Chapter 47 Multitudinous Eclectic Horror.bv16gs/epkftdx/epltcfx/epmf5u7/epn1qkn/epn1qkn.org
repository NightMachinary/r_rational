I doubt it, considering the line about how she's also in the hospital, Hyuga compound, and the Uchiha district, both places we see in this chapter. My list of suspects includes Orochimaru, a minion of Orochimaru, or Pein. Potentially it could also be anyone with a Sharingan like Sasuke or Itachi or Danzo- it sure seems like the apparition is reading his mind.
