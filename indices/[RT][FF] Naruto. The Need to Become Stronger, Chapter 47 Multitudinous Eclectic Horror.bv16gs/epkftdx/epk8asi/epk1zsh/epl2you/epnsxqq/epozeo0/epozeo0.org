Give it a few more chapters- the first few put me off as well, but I think it's well worth it. It has my favorite characterization of Kakashi in any fic by far, and I love what the author's done with Naruto, though it took me a while to appreciate his character. The important thing to realize is that Naruto really is quite smart and usually correct... but he's bad at getting people to *think* he's smart, and so they don't listen to him. That realization helped me a lot.
