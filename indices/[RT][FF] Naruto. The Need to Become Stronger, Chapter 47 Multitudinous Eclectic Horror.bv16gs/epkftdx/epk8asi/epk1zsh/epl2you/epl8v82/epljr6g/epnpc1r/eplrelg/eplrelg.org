  So on the whole of it, in this chapter one character died but several dead characters turn out to be alive, which is a net improvement on what we had before.

So is this confirmation that [character] dies at the end? (I can't remember whether there was some other death in the chapter. If so I'll be pretty embarrassed.) (Also: funny to see the author chime in that the chapter titled "Multitudinous Eclectic Horror" actually shows that things weren't as bad as they looked! ;) ) (Also also, people definitely just think things are too dark because of the update speed: you just need to release chapters faster and everything will be fine!)

I think I remember you saying a while back that the story was 2/3 complete, and your mention of The Empire Strikes Back seems to suggests the same. On the other hand, Oro taking Sakura seems like it'll require a longer runtime or a timeskip for it to really pay off.

Since it looks like you're in a mood to give out meta information, can you say anything about how much longer you expect the story to be? Or whether you're planning a shippuden-style timeskip?

I'm expecting the story to wrap up all of the important canon threads, and everything set up by so far, so I'm not worried about that. I just don't want this to end since I'm enjoying it so much.

You wrote in the last thread that you like setting it up such that "the fate of characters ultimately depends on whether they are able to overcome their primary flaw". If [character] did die, it's really depressing that their final test was failed in such a cursory manner.

  He found himself cursing the reputation that he had cultivated: Could they not see that he needed their help? But then, he had never accepted help, even when there were no ghosts and poisons to mess with his mind...
