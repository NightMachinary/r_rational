So, the major reason for feeling apathy for the story from my anecdotal perspective are the following reasons -

1. The fact that Tsunade got captured despite being an expert on poisons and being a top level ninja is a bit... jarring. How can a ninja of her level not recognize when a poison enters her body? It's not death that audiences off, it's the loss of agency (unless of course, Orochimaru is a final boss level villain and this is the penultimate arc, which you seem to have confirmed). Similarly, not having any POV chapters from the powerful people's side. A Sarutobi, or Danzo or Ibiki POV chapter interspersed between these chapters would've kept some hope alive in the audience.

2. Lack of real "victories" for the heroes' side. Gaara getting defeated was the only time I had a "FUCK YEAH HOLY SHIT GOOD JOB" moment. And even that was undercut by Naruto's realization of what he did, which again, shifts the tone to be depressing...

3. The lack of any sort of hope. In stories like these, you always have a sliver of hope that keeps the readers reading the story.

As in your example of Empire strikes back, it's Luke that keeps you watching the movie even after everyone is captured. You have that hope, that even if he is not ready, he can at least save his friends. This hope is dimmed throughout the last part, but never completely extinguished, and the last scene embodies this. They have lost Han, but they escaped to live another day. All is not lost.

Yet another series that does a similar thing is Game of Thrones. Ned Stark dies, but his children and bannermen are all alive, and they are pissed. The red wedding happens, which pushes the level of hope super low, but because Arya, Sansa, Jon Snow, Daenerys, Tyrion and several other interesting and intriguing characters are alive, and importantly, they are all POV characters. Their stories are still ongoing, the hope is never completely lost.

Here though? Konoha is said to be the strongest village, and every other village either seems to be their enemies or neutral to them. But the majority of the strong characters have been taken out, have no agency, or haven't shown up.

Every single POV character goes through absolute shit, so all hope seems completely lost (even though offscreen, it might not be) and that takes the audience out of the story.

This isn't the first time it happened, and the series has a tendency towards killing off major characters from canon, so eventually the audience reaction becomes "Oh, he/she dies? Huh, ok". Instead of shock, or awe, or sadness, there is just apathy. There has to be a balance. There has to be hope. Something to strive towards. Some sort of foreshadowing for cavalry arriving to save the day. Without any hope, audience investment is lost.

My two cent solution would be to see a POV on one of these "cavalry" members. Whoever is trying to patch up Konoha's defense. Seeing them go through tribulations as well, but not end the chapter on hopelessness. Seeing the defense finally come together, so that the audience has some hope of getting through the event.
