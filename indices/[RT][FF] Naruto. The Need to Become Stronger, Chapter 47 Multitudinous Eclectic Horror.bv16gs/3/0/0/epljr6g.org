I get what you mean. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][Darkness induced audience apathy]] is very much a thing, and it's bad. Things are not actually as dark as it looks though. Previously, four of Naruto's friends were believed to be dead. In this chapter, three of them turn out to be alive, and two of them are freed thanks to the heroic efforts of Naruto. That's certainly not a fate worse than death! And Tsunade is being operated on by Kabuto which yes, looks bad, but you also have to ask yourself why he would operate on a corpse (unless he's doing an autopsy). So on the whole of it, in this chapter one character died but several dead characters turn out to be alive, which is a net improvement on what we had before.

Also, yes it's true that Naruto's naivety made things worse, but he's also the one saving everyone through his efforts. Yes, he (maybe) gave Temari the idea to use poison gas, but he also warned Lee about it and saved his life twice this chapter. It's the same as last chapter, where Naruto's ideas saved Sakura's life several times over. For some reason Naruto only ever gets blamed for his mistakes, but never gets any credit for what he does right, both in the story and IRL :p

Anyway, I hope this doesn't turn anyone off from reading. If it helps, this arc will only last a few more chapters, and then it's the end of the "villain's win" part of the story. Think of this as the ending of "the empire strikes back", if that helps. A part of me also wonders if it feels darker because there's a week's delay between each chapter, since with a regular book you'd just read a few dark chapters and then you'd be on to the next part, but now you end up feeling bad for more than a month.
