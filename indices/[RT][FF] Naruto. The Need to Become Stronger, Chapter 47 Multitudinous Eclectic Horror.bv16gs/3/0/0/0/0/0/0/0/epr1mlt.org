  it's nice that Joffrey dies, but then Tyrion gets blamed for it and the story only gets darker as a result - just like in NTBS!
#+end_quote

I'll use this scene as a small comparison -

- Joffrey dying is such a great moment for the audience, because he was such a hated presence both in the story and out of it, and it came after he was being an absolute asshole at his own wedding. Tyrion getting blamed for it immediately afterwards, at the time, felt like a misguided rage from the part of Cersei, and we never really see if the Kingsguard actually did arrest Tyrion until a couple of chapters later. Because this chapter was about the high point of watching Joffrey die, so even Cersei's rage filled screams simply add to the schadenfreude of the scene instead of undercutting it, and the audience gets to bask in the glory of that good thing happening, just for that one moment.

Compare to NTBS, you have Sakura, Shikamaru, Kakashi and Naruto all losing consciousness at the end of their chapters, at the mercy of their enemy. In my audience perspective, I feel like there wasn't any need to linger in their POV until they completely lost consciousness (which makes them completely at the mercy of the enemy with zero chance of escape, and thoroughly and completely crushes the hopes of the audience).

- For e.g. if you ended Sakura's chapter with her simply sensing Orochimaru and feeling that fear, and perhaps ending the chapter at the "kukuku" laugh (thus still retaining the audience hope, at least for a little while). It certainly was a powerful moment, but because it happened just after a much needed win for the good guys, that entire badass FUCK YEAH previous scene gets undercut. Sakura did indeed learn from Naruto, and survived, but she still ends up at the mercy of the enemy.
- Same with Kakashi, we could've simply cut away from the scene just after Kabuto's final dialogue "leave it to the pros", which would leave some hope for the audience ("oh shit, what's going to happen?!"). The last line of the chapter simply confirms that Kakashi has indeed been defeated, crushing the hopes of the audience completely and leaving them with an absolutely depressing result, instead of curiosity about what happens next or a faint bit of hope.

Cliffhangers are cliche, but they are used super often because they still leave the audience with the hope that the hero can climb from the cliff next chapter.

  Shikamaru fails because he didn't prepare for the coming conflict despite Naruto's warnings.
#+end_quote

Not really what is conveyed in that chapter IMO -

- Sensible, logical patterns of attack. All of them would fail.
- Kankuro and Temari had watched them fight during the exams.
- What was worse, Naruto had gotten them to share some of their techniques.
- They would have counters ready for every one of them.

What the audience sees as the cause for the defeat of Shikamaru and his team are two things -

- The kids being super enthusiastic about showing off their techniques in the exams.
- Naruto's naivety (or was it Sasuke's manipulation?), trusting in the Sand village kids with their techniques even after /murdering their brother/.

Even when Shikamaru made all the right calls, he still failed [1]. Shino escapes thanks to the thing he got from Naruto (point made) but Tenten hadn't gotten hers yet, so she ended up failing.

  Sakura survives because she did
#+end_quote

Not sure if this feeling is properly conveyed to the audience IMO. She kicked Kabuto's ass and perhaps that is why Orochimaru took an interest in her, but at the end of her POV she ends up completely at the mercy of her enemy. So the audience feeling is that she made all the right calls, and still failed [2], because Orochimaru was always watching and so she was never going to win.

#+begin_quote
  Kakashi fails because he refused to accept help.
#+end_quote

Which is, again IMO, not properly conveyed to the audience. We had a whole chapter of Kakashi fighting a fight way above his pay grade, and trying his hardest to win. He didn't accept help here because he knew that regular Chuunin and Jounin would be no match for Chiyo and would just end up dead. It ends in [uncertainty], because we don't know if the technique worked or not. Next chapter, the start of his POV is awesome, as we can see that he has survived and Chiyo is contained for now, a Victory! Kakashi knows that he can't remove this poison, and neither can Chuunin gatekeepers or random doctors in the hospital, and says as much -

#+begin_quote
  "He found himself moving towards Tsunade's wing of the hospital. She had always been the only person who could cure Lady Chiyo's poisons"
#+end_quote

So what the audience sees is a veteran ninja surviving a really rough battle by the skin of his teeth, BUT... but.. he made a logical/rational choice and went to the only person that could help him. He made all the right calls. And still failed [3].

When you take all the right steps and still end up in failure, that is when you have no agency.

With that, hopefully you can see how the audience would see this triple whammy.

  Anyway, next chapter will feature several of the characters you mention, so hopefully you'll consider that a plus. But uh, fair warning, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll like what they do :P

Very much looking forward to it! :D as for liking it, well, let's see what happens!
