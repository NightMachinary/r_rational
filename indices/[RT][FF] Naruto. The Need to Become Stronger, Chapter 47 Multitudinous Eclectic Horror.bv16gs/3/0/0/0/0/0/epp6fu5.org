  Or it could be more because the bad things happen right at the end of each chapter, which causes it to end on a depressing note each time.

^ yeah I think you hit the nail on the head for this arc. When the chapter ends on a depressing note, any victories from before lack any real weight.

  GOT or Worm never really had unambiguously good moments either
#+end_quote

There were plenty from both series.

GoT -

1. Tyrion's defense of King's Landing.
2. John Snow cutting peoples' heads off.
3. Joffrey's wedding.
4. Tyrion's trial and the privy aftermath.
5. Daenerys vs slavers.
6. Pretty much any dragon vs shitty people scene.
7. Culmination of Arya's training and some of her murders.

Even some of the "bad guy wins" scenes in GoT are compelling because of the shock value you get from that chapter, as these events are usually confined to one chapter after which we move on to a different POV and a different tone. Red wedding, Kingsmoot, Jon "Caesar" Snow etc. are all compelling chapters, but they don't extend beyond that one.

  Arya remains alive as you say, but was she ever hopeful again?
#+end_quote

She did become badass after that. She has a list of people she wants to kill. She has objectives. Things to look forward to, even if they are rage induced. Which balances things. Agency is what matters. And Arya has plenty of agency right now.

As for Worm, it was a little different. Things went to absolute shit and continued to go further and further down, and I'm 100% sure this affected the ability to care for any audience that were reading those as they came out.

But characters always retained their agency. They were always thinking of what to do in the upcoming shit situation, so even if the situation kept getting worse, you kept reading because they characters could still "do stuff". Agency.

Also, it had an immensely satisfying payoff with Khepri. The ending was what it had been building up towards. And for me at least, it delivered. Hopefully you have some satisfying chapters coming up as well :D

  Tsunade didn't get poisoned, she literally just drunk herself unconscious because she's Tsunade and there's a reason Shizune wouldn't let her near alcohol.
#+end_quote

Ah, alright, that did come to mind as a possiblity. Maybe it's because I still have the canon character's image in my head, it becomes difficult to detach from that version.

  In other words, you can have impossible odds as long as the main character somehow always manages to come out intact regardless.

Agency man, agency is always what keeps stories from becoming too depressing.

1. Naruto was winning but then his chapter ended with a suicide attack cliffhanger so there was no "FUCK YEAH" moment.
2. Kakashi lost all agency at the end of his chapter (after a potential "FUCK YEAH" moment).
3. So did Sakura (Another potential "FUCK YEAH" moment undercut. This chapter in particular was 100% guilty of apathy inducement because we were hoping for that ONE victory after a series of things going to absolute shit. Doubly so because it was actually a tough fight and Sakura was pushed to the edge and clawed out her victory... only to be suddenly undercut).
4. So did Shikamaru.
5. So did Tsunade (even though she wasn't POV).
6. And one remaining character whose POV was shown was preparing to lock themselves in (removing them from the board, and limiting their agency).

There was no such series of chapters in either worm nor GoT, where chapters continuously showed POV characters losing agency at the end of their POV.

I'm assuming the characters with agency are all "behind the scenes" types so you're reluctant to show their POV (Sasuke, Danzo, Ibiki and Sarutobi come to mind), so hopefully we will have future chapters where they finally decide to get involved. I just hope the upcoming awesome moments are awesome enough to balance the scale of sheer depression we are left in after this series of chapters :)
