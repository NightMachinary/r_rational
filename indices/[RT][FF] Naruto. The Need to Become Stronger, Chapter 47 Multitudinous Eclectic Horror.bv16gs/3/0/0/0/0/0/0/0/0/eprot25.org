  Compare to NTBS, you have Sakura, Shikamaru, Kakashi and Naruto all losing consciousness at the end of their chapters, at the mercy of their enemy. In my audience perspective, I feel like there wasn't any need to linger in their POV until they completely lost consciousness (which makes them completely at the mercy of the enemy with zero chance of escape, and thoroughly and completely crushes the hopes of the audience).

Hmmm. The problem with cutting the Oro scene short is that I would end up giving up on one awesome moment just to make another a bit better. I dunno. On the other hand, I could have easily made the Kakashi fight end on a high note. In the first draft, there was another scene right after from Chiyo's point of view where you see the effects of Kamui, but I ended up cutting it because it was unnecessary. But maybe if I had left it in the readers would have felt more satisfied, and more willing to accept that Sakura's victory was stolen from her in the next chapter.

  What the audience sees as the cause for the defeat of Shikamaru and his team are two things -

  The kids being super enthusiastic about showing off their techniques in the exams. Naruto's naivety (or was it Sasuke's manipulation?), trusting in the Sand village kids with their techniques even after murdering their brother.

Shikamaru sees is that way, sure, but if you read between the lines... he spent the entire fight arguing with and trying to correct his own team. He fails to convince Kiba because he never bothered to establish a relation with him, he has to correct Tenten's moves because he never showed up for the team training before, and in the end he never attacks Temari and Kankuro even once.
