Thanks for the feedback. I think you hit the nail on the head when it comes to the lack of "fuck yeah!" moments. I already knew people liked the Naruto vs Gaara chapter best (it has the highest number of upvotes by far), but I always assumed it was just because they really liked the fight scene. Now it makes a lot more sense.

I think the mistake I made is that I looked at the story from a too 'logical' perspective, ironically enough. There were good things happening as well as bad things throughout this arc, I thought, so what's the problem? But when you put it like that... I think the problem is that there are events which are 100% bad, and there are events which are a lot better than you'd expect, but there are almost no moments that are 100% positive. A story needs highs and lows to be effective, and the highs are just not as high as the lows are low, in other words. Sakura kicking Kabuto's ass is awesome, but then Oro shows up right after. Kakashi is awesome, but then he basically draws vs Chiyo, Naruto saving Kiba and Choji is awesome but then Kakashi's downfall happens right after. Or it could be more because the bad things happen right at the end of each chapter, which causes it to end on a depressing note each time.

It's strange though, because GOT or Worm never really had unambiguously good moments either. Arya remains alive as you say, but was she ever hopeful again? No, she just goes darker and darker as the story goes on, and the same is true for most of the others. On the other hand, I kinda stopped liking Tyrion by the end of book five because he became too hateful, and I kind of stopped liking Arya too for the same reason, so... maybe the right conclusion is simply that GRR Martin made the same mistake I did???

Maybe Worm is a better example? Worm was an unending darkness fest of darkwangst, and yet, I enjoyed it immensely. Perhaps the difference is that the MC was just so much of a badass, and frankly just more of a wish-fulfilment character, that it made enough of a difference. In other words, you can have impossible odds as long as the main character somehow always manages to come out intact regardless, but impossible odds + realism simply don't mix as well.

Btw, regarding your first point: Tsunade didn't get poisoned, she literally just drunk herself unconscious because she's Tsunade and there's a reason Shizune wouldn't let her near alcohol. Girl's got issues. :p

Sarutobi did get poisoned (reportedly), but there's precedent for that in canon as well: Jiraiya, who is is easily as strong, got poisoned by Tsunade and was useless for most of his fight against Orochimaru. So it's simply not the case that powerful characters in Naruto are never caught off guard. Think about the way Orochimaru was originally beaten by Sasuke. That could have been a scene in NTBS, and I wouldn't even have to change much to make it fit.
