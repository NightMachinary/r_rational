I confirm nothing! I also said that Naruto's friends were dead last chapter but are alive in this one, so you might be taking things too literally. Things sure don't look too good for Kakashi though.

There won't be any timeskip: I just don't think it makes sense to have all the major players do nothing of consequence for any serious length of time. Instead I prefer to suggest the passage of time between each chapter, so the characters feel like they're aging rapidly without skipping anything.

If you don't want it to end... good news! It turns out I'm terrible at brevity so the story will probably last quite a bit longer. Hard to be sure though, because we're really going off the canon rails from now on.

Regarding the final test: a big theme of Ntbs is that battles are decided by the time swords are drawn. So in this case, Kakashi fails his test not just because he doesn't ask for help in this one chapter, but because he ignored Naruto and couldn't change his worst instincts even when they were explicitly pointed out to him:

  Naruto glowered at him, not seeming to appreciate the humour of his last comment. “You know,” he said, “I think I've finally figured out why you're always late to our team meetings, sensei.”

  Kakashi raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”

  “Yeah. At first I thought you were just being lazy, but no jōnin would ever survive as long as you have by being lazy. So then I figured you must be trying to teach us a lesson somehow, and I thought I'd look at the expected result and assume that was your intended goal. I concluded that you were trying to teach us not to blindly trust authority, and to take responsibility for our own development.”

  Kakashi took care not to smile. “You may very well think that, but-”

  “But then I remembered to look underneath the underneath, and I thought to myself: What if all of that is just my attempt to guess what you want to hear, when you yourself might not really know why you do the things you do? So instead I asked myself which state of mind would make your actions the most likely outcome, and focussed only on what I already know.” He looked at Kakashi with uncharacteristic coldness. “So I'm gonna stick my neck out and guess that it's not just us but that you're late to all kinds of meetings, and that you had difficulty connecting with people long before you even had a team. And whatever bogus rationalization you came up with afterwards, whatever answer you claim to be the correct one, it's really just an excuse to avoid having to get close to the people you care about.”

And more recently, in the last few chapters: He rejected Naruto's offer of Shadow clone support. Choza was right there and he sent him away. And right at the end, when he finally considered calling for help, he allowed Rin to convince him not to.

So yeah, call it instance #341 of Naruto being entirely correct when it comes to identifying crucial problems, yet entirely failing to convince anyone because he's too much of a brat about it :P
