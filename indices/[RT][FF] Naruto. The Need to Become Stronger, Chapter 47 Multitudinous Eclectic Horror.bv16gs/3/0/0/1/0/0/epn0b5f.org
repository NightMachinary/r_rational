Pretty sure Shino 'ported away with the ghetto flying thunder god scroll, and Shika effectively killed himself by overusing his clan's jutsu to let himself think faster. That chapter mentions brains turning to mush from overuse. Ironic that if he'd just given up and not overused the jutsu he might have survived.

Or maybe he did survive, but his other ninja skills are weak enough from his overreliance on his clan's jutsu that Kankuro didn't bother using him.
