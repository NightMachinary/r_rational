For sure, in a literal sense they're better off than they were, I meant "fate worse than death" in a tropey sense that they were forced to fight their own friends while a prisoner of their body.

As for Tsunade... I kind of just assumed she was either dead, about to die, or otherwise be puppetted? Like, just this last chapter has shown that any ninja specializing even in a medical-adjacent field (poisons) can reeeeeally mess with you if they have time to do so after defeating you. I figured the first thing Kabuto did was turn Tsunade into a quadraplegic and isolate her chakra network, haha. IMO there's no real reason for Tsunade to end up anything other than dead or 100% compromised, same with Kakashi.

I admit I was being uncharitable to Naruto's actions in general, the justu-sharing idea he had to begin with was relatively sound. But it's because he had the temerity to try to make bonds outside of the village/ingroup (as naruto's character core dictates) that he ends up screwing his friends over more than they would otherwise, which feels bad, man.

Don't worry about losing me as a reader, at least. I powered through Worm and Pact no problemo. But in terms of general darkness... wow chakra string puppetry is freaky as hell? It's kind of ridiculous you can even affect a person's speech through /strings/ but hey that's chakra for ya.
