You might be using a different definition of "unambiguously good" than I had in mind. :p

Yes, watching bad guys get what they deserve is satisfying, but I meant that good very rarely triumphs in an optimistic way in GOT. For example, it's nice that Joffrey dies, but then Tyrion gets blamed for it and the story only gets darker as a result - just like in NTBS!

I get what you mean with the lack of "fuck yeah!" moments though - I think I just need to write more scenes that are satisfying from the perspective of the POV, even if the POV is not really a hero, because the reader's experience depends on what the POV character feels rather than what is seen as good or bad from an outsider's perspective.

> Agency man, agency is always what keeps stories from becoming too depressing.

I'm not sure 'agency' is the right word. Sure, the good guys are on the back foot right now, so they're much more reactive than usual, but they still live or die as the result of their own choices and actions. Shikamaru fails because he didn't prepare for the coming conflict despite Naruto's warnings, Sakura survives because she did, and Kakashi fails because he refused to accept help.

But yeah, it's true that their efforts are undermined somewhat because the enemy is actively working to prevent their actions from making a difference in the grand scheme of things.

  I'm assuming the characters with agency are all "behind the scenes" types so you're reluctant to show their POV (Sasuke, Danzo, Ibiki and Sarutobi come to mind), so hopefully we will have future chapters where they finally decide to get involved.

This is very true. I am very careful not to show certain characters too much because, well, then there wouldn't be any mystery left to resolve. The story needs to have multiple suspects for the mystery aspect to work, and it just feels cheesy to show too much from their perspective without revealing what they really think and plot and do...

(I insist that Naruto at the very least does have agency though, since quite a few events of the plot are happening strictly because of him. They're just not all what he intended.)

Anyway, next chapter will feature several of the characters you mention, so hopefully you'll consider that a plus. But uh, fair warning, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll like what they do :P
