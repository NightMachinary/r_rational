Right? This is really well-written and interesting, but this practically feels like schadenfreude-porn with how horribly everything is going for our protagonists. I thought it was bad enough when half of naruto's friends and mentor had merely died, but instead they have the Fate Worse than Death ending going for them. And a not insignificant portion of the blame (when it comes to the named characters' suffering, anyway) lies on Naruto for daring to try to cooperate with outsiders.
