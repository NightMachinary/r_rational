I think I mentioned before that I use music to get in the right mood when writing a chapter. Sometimes, the process of finding the right music can take hours, and if I don't find anything I just can't seem to get anything done. When I do find something that fits, I can listen to it for hours until it keeps playing in my head long after I stop writing. I don't usually remember what I wrote each chapter to originally, but in this case, I edited the second scene to the incredibly addictive [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIU5e7lSH1g][can you dig it]] soundtrack from Iron Man 3. By contrast, the ending scene was written to much of the Planescape Torment soundtrack, especially [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6oLK4m6iKs][Deionarra's]] eerily haunting [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUt84LyH2JI][theme]]. You really have to give that game credit for providing so much inspiration.

If you want me to make it more of a habit to describe my writing process, let me know in the comments! And of course, as always, thanks for reading. :)
