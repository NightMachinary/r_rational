From the way Finch "fished" a confirmation of gold magery with just a coin, I'm thinking that the call of the gold uses multiversal exploration (or some heuristic approximation, more likely) to identify when and what to do in order to stay on the possible path of maximum gold acquisition at any given time.

It would be interesting to see if this confirms and if so, whether Mary can figure out a way to exploit this mechanic.
