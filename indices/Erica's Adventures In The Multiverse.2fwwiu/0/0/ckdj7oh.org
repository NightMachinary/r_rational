I read it, but to be honest I did a lot of skimming in the early pages, I feel like you need more dialogue, something actually happening, closer to the beginning. Once the side-seeing started to get explained I was interested. Then at that point I felt there could have been a little bit /more/ explanation of why she has this power she has never used, not even once. To make it a little more believable she'd never experiment, to make it more believable why this time she would.

But I did get interested, I'd have kept reading but I caught up to the in progress part!
