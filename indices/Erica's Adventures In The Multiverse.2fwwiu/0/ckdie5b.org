Thank you very much for posting this! I am the author. After reading Harry Potter and parts of HPMOR to my young daughter, I had a wish for more YA science fiction with female protagonists. Fortunately, I had already concocted the beginnings of a plot, as part of a "fulfillment game" I had constructed to help Heather learn the Methods of Rationality. EAITM is that game translated into novel form. The most consistent piece of feedback I've received so far is, "I'm hooked and I desperately want to know what happens next!" I hope you enjoy it.

Every day since Erica Anders Singleton moved with her family from Manhattan to Quibbletown, New Jersey, has been wrong. In her earlier life she was a gifted student in a school for gifted students; now she's a weirdo in a school full of "normal" kids, where the worst thing you can be is Different. To make things worse, Erica has a secret: the power to see into the multiverse and change the future. And now that the school has been taken over by the strange, dead-eyed teacher, Mr. White, she just may need to break the world, in order to save it...
