Thank you! I'm very interested in your comment: "The guess about the simulation is sort of preventing a lot of criticism of the setting and realism of certain characters' actions etc. I can't really say "this portrayal is obviously silly/unrealistic/etc" when the setting is supposed to be unreal in very obvious ways."

Not spoiling whether anything's a simulation or not: If it seems "obvious it's a simulation" because certain settings or actions seem silly, that's probably a writing fail!!

If you feel like giving me more detailed criticism of places where the setting and action strikes you as unrealistic (aside from the name "Quibbletown", which is more or less a [[http://www.njplaygrounds.com/6842/quibbletown-park-piscataway/][real place]]), I would welcome it!
