You are the leader (president/governer/dictator/whatever) of (insert generic 21st century first world society). Superpowers have begun to manifest in, lets say 25% of the population all over the world. Superpowers come in all shapes and sizes, it could be anything you could imagine, god like power, or something insignificant. Regardless it is sure to cause some distruption to your society. Come up with a plan (new legislation, come up with new taxes, adjust budget spending, new ministries) to maximise the benefit your society gains from its new superpowered population.
