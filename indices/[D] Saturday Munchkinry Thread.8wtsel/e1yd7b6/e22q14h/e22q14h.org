As others said, Alice and Bob don't need no modern asymmetric crypto. They already have exchanged key material.

If they had access to calculator, they could now go on using e.g. AES-GCM. The problem is: They don't have this.

[[http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/smallprng.html][Small PRNG]] was a good naive suggestion for a RNG that can be abused as a cipher (you XOR the output-stream with the cleartext). Authentication needs a hash function, not just a simple checksum; something like Murmurhash could work. (you don't want to be susceptible to bitflip attacks)

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_(cipher%29][Bruce Schneier does not need a computer]] to do his crypto. Extra relevant because the cipher was designed as a prop of the Cryptonomicon. More modern, one could look at [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/339.pdf][LC4]], which is also authenticated and looks significantly faster to me; I really recommend at least skimming that paper and looking at the pictures at the end. Also, it is funny:

  I made a simple appliance to help a human perform the LC4 encryption and decryption algorithms by hand. The appliance consists of 36 wooden tiles plus a small plastic game marker, which I carry around in a bag (Figure 2). Each tile is marked at the top with one of the characters of the alphabet; at the right, the value (c mod 6); and at the bottom, the value (c / 6), where c is the character's integer value. The bag also is used to generate a random key: put all the tiles in the bag, shake it well, and draw tiles one by one

Apart from this, I would think hard about other assets and priority: Is it really the case that both directions are completely insecure? And I would put more emphasis on authentication / MAC than on confidentiality, at least in Joon's situation, whatever it is. My take on it was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8vkomq/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_108109_dreamveil/e1pp3gn/?context=3][here]].

edit: Because that stuff is fascinating, apparently even almost trivial ciphers like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC_cipher][VIC]] survived shockingly long, due to good OPSEC. But all this does not really matter, because Joon failed to properly prepare, as far as I can tell.
