I'm going to assume you and the friend both have copies to the same book printed in the same edition. It doesn't matter what book it is.

In your shared history, have already explained to your friend how a one time cipher works. And a pre arranged signal such as "this conversation is being monitored, bible 225."

Then you can encode any message you want to send as the first letter of each word in a sentence. Always end a communication session with a new book or number (encoded). If you or they ever end a message you can't decode, send a new cipher book/page in the last good cipher.

Unless your captor is a genius, they won't know what a phrase like that one single one out of the ordinary means. Any manipulation of your messages will reduce them to jibberish, but your protocol will always make you revert back to the last good cipher if one fails. And you only have to communicate your cipher page in advance once.
