Anarchy: a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority. Unfortunately, "nonrecognition of authority" is fundamental to not only the superhero archetype but also how individuals granted overwhelming power actually play out. Furthermore, regression to the mean doesn't play out in humanities favor, as the "mean" is whatever food we can scavenge out of the ground until the ripe old age of died in childbirth.

"Disruption" is sort of good, but cancer is a type of disruption, war is a type of disruption, etc.
