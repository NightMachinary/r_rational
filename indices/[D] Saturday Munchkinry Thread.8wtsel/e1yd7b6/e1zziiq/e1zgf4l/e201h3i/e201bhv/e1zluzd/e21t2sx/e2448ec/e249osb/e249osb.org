  Anarchy: a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority
#+end_quote

Anarchy's not disorder. Whoever offered this definition clearly did not do their research. This subject has been rather well studied academically, by the likes of [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3146284][Robert Ellickson]], [[https://books.google.ie/books?id=7FhzAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&dq=anarchy+pirates+caribbean&source=bl&ots=1iSjIIegz_&sig=dUva-tZUpIRlebWPfxbC-8qR87c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji4-yLnpTcAhUPrRQKHb5qBVI4ChDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&q=anarchy%20pirates%20caribbean&f=false][Peter Leeson]], Hernando de Soto (on the emergence of property rights without authority), [[https://archive.org/details/ClastresSocietyAgainstTheStateEssaysInPoliticalAnthropology][Pierre Clastres]], etc.

But yeah my point is that it is not necessarily a bad thing, which does not automatically make it a good thing either. It's just that historically, trying to force-stall disruption with state power does not tend to end well.
