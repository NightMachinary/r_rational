If it's "anything you can imagine" as the limits... you're basically guaranteeing anarchy. Sure, people are going to be chill at first, because they think the old rules still apply, but gradually people will be forced to use their powers to force what they want to happen. Whether that's assassinating world leaders, making a mess, or destabilizing economies, people aren't going to react well to being handed pocket nukes.

The only way to prevent this is an /aggressive/ propaganda campaign emphasizing normalcy, as well as enlisting as many supers as you can into the ranks of law enforcement. I really hope that you had a high approval rating before this happened, because otherwise that's going to increase the assassination attempts 100x.

Of course, third world countries are going to descend into chaos, so you're going to have to figure out how to prevent the economic, refugee, cultural, and superpowered problems from spilling into your country (hello south america, africa, eastern europe, middle east, southeast asia...), which assumes that your country is nice and uniformly gentrified like iceland or the nordic countries. If you're someplace like america, flyover states, inner cities, and dying towns will be hotbeds of superpowered crime.

That all assumes most superpowers lean towards the popular depictions of powers, where the majority are either useless or good for fighting and causing property damage. If your powers skew towards healing, empathy, building, tinkering, etc. the news looks a lot better.
