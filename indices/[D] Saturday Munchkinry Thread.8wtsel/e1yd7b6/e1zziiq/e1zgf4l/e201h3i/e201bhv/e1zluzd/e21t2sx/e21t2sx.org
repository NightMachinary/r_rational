  If it's "anything you can imagine" as the limits... you're basically guaranteeing anarchy.

That can prove a good thing. Instead of being at the mercy of nation-states, the world becomes gradually at the mercy of random individuals.

The end result will depend on whether the most hyper-powered individuals are willing to act well or not: instead of trying to maintain the statu quo by emphasizing loyalty, patriotism and fealty to the law in a clumsy attempt to have hyper-individuals continue delegating the important decisions to their ruler(s), the better (and probably only) option is to focus everyone's interest on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature][the four "inner angels"]]: empathy, self-control, ethics and rationality. That also means people currently in power will have to choose between several different ways out:

- they cede power away more-or-less graciously

- they become glaring targets for anyone with a decisive superpower to take down

- they themselves become better examples of the behaviour they are trying to elicit in super-powered individuals

To put it another way: what is guaranteed by the setting here, is not war but disruption. It's no different in nature from very high-tech disruption, really.
