Propaganda time. Emphasise safety, patriotism. Depict the discovery of new powers as something to be celebrated - and /registered/, so the government knows what's going on.

Hire suitable Supers where possible, especially in law enforcement. Bear in mind that most people don't want to destabilise society, and try to sort out the ones who do. Sharply discourage vigilanteism, but encourage flashy, visible power use amongst registered law enforcement individuals.
