On #4 the wait and see approach will juts get people killed as the evidence that it's needed will be super-powered people starting fights to try and take over. Best case scenario we get an 9/11 like attack and then take action, worst case scenario "The United States of Dr. Murder-o the merciless; petty and, bad at grammar" is even worse a place to live than it sounds and it's no longer practical to try and institute a pressure valve system.

Besides the president will need a Secretary of Super-Powers, and really an extra veto power floating around isn't THAT big a deal it's just another check and balance in a system designed around the idea of checks and balances.

For similar reasons open admission is there because turning away somone who wants to enter runs too high a risk of them turning up anyway and not obeying the "no killing otehr entrants or the audience" rule for no real gain (well, except the probable ratings spike it'd cause).
