Premis: I am somehow able to make arbitrary changes to the U.S. legal code withut all that inconvenient mucking about in Congress or worrying about re-election (possibly this is my super power).

1. Classify super powers as "deadly weapons". (this makes super powered violence count as worse for legal purposes, and as a bonus prohibits Congress from illegalising powers thanks to the 2nd amendment)
2. Declare people with powers a protected class for the purposes of anti-discrimination law, and violence against people with powers as a "hate crime". (scores easy points with the powered as the ones at risk would be the ones week enough the'd deserve to be protected by existing assault and harassment law anyway, so it doesn very little but looks like doign a lot)
3. People with registered super powers are tax exempt. Registration is voluntary, but you do have to be able to prove your claims in a double blind study for anything subtle enough to not be trivially demonstrated. (encourages people with less flashy powers to disclose them to the government and also gives an incentive for foreign supers to immigrate which is going to be a major strategic advantage in dealing with foreign powers as the dust settles)
4. Create a new executive position with the title of "Emperor" the authority to veto any bill passed by Congress and signed by the President, and nominal authority comparable to a cabinet member over matters pertaining to super powers. This position is held by the winner of a grand tournament held every year using Dragon Ball Z World Martial Arts tournament rules. The tournament will be televised and the federal government holds the merchandising rites. (gives a pressure valve of sorts to the might makes right crowd simultaneously given them a way otehr than declaring war to get a ton of power if they want it and are strong enough, while also limiting the destruction they cause, AND calling attention to whoever is the current biggest fish to deter any middling talent from thinking that being able to blow up tanks means being able to defeat the U.S. Government. Also, new revenue source from merch).
5. Create a grant system similar to the McAurthur "genius grant" that pays people with super-science powers a stipend to do whatever they hell they want. (makes them less likely to turn their super science against the society that's giving them so much support.)
6. Create a new agency or a branch within an existing agency who's job it is to find any viable ways to give non-powered people powers, or to remove powers from the powered and make both readily available to whatever extent the methods found allow as practical.
