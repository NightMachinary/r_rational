I've followed this series since near its inception, and in my opinion the writing quality has been decreasing for at least the past 5 chapters.

Characters are increasingly cavalier (to an irrational degree, especially those newer to the 'dungeon') and are constantly making witty banter out of character. Emotional and physical trauma are glossed over without lasting consequences, and story/character threads are consistently dropped in favor or new ones.

Sadly the most interesting aspects, the 'magical' tools, previously discovered remain unused or forgotten after acquisition. What's the point of discovering the use of a blue tool if you then never use it or mention it again? Why even mention it then, unless it's just for flavor?

I wish I could have faith that the author is planning to wrap up all the loose ends and make the characters act rationally, but that light grows dimmer as dimmer as time passes.
