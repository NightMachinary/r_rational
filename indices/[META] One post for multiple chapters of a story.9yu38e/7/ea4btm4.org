I wouldn't say that it should be a /general/ norm in the sense that we should frown on it if the author opts for multi chapter posts. The release timings and posting style are the author's choice (or the poster, if the author is not posting for themselves). But if someone wants to discuss something without being fully caught up i certainly don't see the harm in whoever wants to have the discussion just posting that chapter and discussing it. Or if a specific person or an author wishes to use the one at a time format that should be fine.
