I spoiled myself this way once with WtC, and was frustrated, but it was really just my own fault.

At most it takes 15-20 extra minutes to read the other chapters, and all separating chapters out would do is make everyone discuss things in the latest released chapter thread, and clutter up the subreddit.

Maybe there would be a couple people posting in earlier chapters about what they think will happen in the next ones, but I don't feel like it would be a meaningful discussion.

If it /did/ manage to get people to discuss things in multiple threads, then what it would really do is fragment the discussion, and likely reduced the overall quality. People would have to read through 5 or so different threads, and a lot of it would be the same content.

More time would be lost dealing with a thread for each chapter than you'd save by being able to comment after each one. And if you don't have time to finish reading all the chapters, do you really have time to discuss them?
