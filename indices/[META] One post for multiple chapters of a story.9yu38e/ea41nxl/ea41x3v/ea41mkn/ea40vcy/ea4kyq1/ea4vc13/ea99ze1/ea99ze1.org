Personally I think that we already have too many posts about some of the more fast-updating stories. Right now there are four threads about A Practical Guide to Evil on the front page, which are 8, 6, 3 and 1 days old. It's a good story, and I love reading it, but having four threads about it at once feels cluttered and a bit redundant.

I do accept that I am rather alone in this opinion, which is fine. But I would like to express my opposition to any proposal that further aggravates this situation.
