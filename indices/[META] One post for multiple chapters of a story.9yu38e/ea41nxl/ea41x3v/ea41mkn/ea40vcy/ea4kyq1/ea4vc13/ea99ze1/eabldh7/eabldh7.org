I definitely agree with that, and I think that it's one of the benefits of doing batch releases of chapters (in addition to the fact that more material means that more substantial conversation can take place, and it's easier to fit a full arc or half-arc into a batch).

I don't think there's much to be done about it, not from a mod standpoint anyway. /Ideally/ conversation would move to [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/]], where dedicated discussion makes sense (similar to how many people here read Wildbow's works, but discussion is almost entirely on [[/r/parahumans]]), but that's a somewhat tall ask, especially since sister communities are not the same as this one, value different things, etc.
