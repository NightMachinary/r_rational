So what you're saying is that people should be reporting apgte for breaking rule 3? I think he gets around it by having a reader post it rather than posting his own story.

The rule is there because the chapters bury the discussion otherwise and bad (etc) daily stories bury good (etc) monthly stories just by posting over and over.
