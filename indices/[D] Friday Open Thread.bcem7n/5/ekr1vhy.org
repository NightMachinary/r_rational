Random request.

I'm a little too impatient to wait until Monday to ask about this, but does anyone know of any books that involves eldritch romance? Or where one of the partners in a romantic relationship is a Lovecraftian monster in some way.

I just read [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan?from=LightNovel.NyarkoSan][Haiyore! Nyarko-san]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElderSisterLikeOne?from=Manga.AneNaruMono][The Elder Sister-Like One]] and was craving more stories like them. However, they both had the Cthulhu-like entity act too human-like and with a lot of fan service (more than I felt was necessary) and I was hoping for a slightly more realistic version to read.
