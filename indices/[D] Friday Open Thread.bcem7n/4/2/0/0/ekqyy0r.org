The original post seems to be talking about how people gain weight, and I agree that CICO doesn't give much information on that. It's true that if you want to lose weight, spending more calories than you eat necessarily means you lose weight, but the reverse isn't necessarily true. Eating more calories than you spend could result in no change in weight, weight gain, or even lost weight depending on how your body absorbs it. Saying that carbs can cause you to accumulate fat is helpful knowledge, because at some point you are going to have to eat more calories than you spend, and most people want to keep the weight off that they just spent so much time losing.
