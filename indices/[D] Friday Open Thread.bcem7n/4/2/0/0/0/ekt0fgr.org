CICO is the best predictor of weight gain we have, there's only one edge case I know of: zero fat diets. The human body basically cannot create fat molecules (de novo lipogenisis), so if your body doesn't have fat to store while intaking excess calories you essentially can't put on fat but you also won't be burning it. This isn't common knowledge, or very useful, since any healthy diet consumes some amount of fat. If you consume excess calories with fat your body tends towards burning the carbohydrates you have and storing fat until it balances out.

Practically speaking though telling people carbs make them fat isn't productive, we don't have an obesity problem from eating too many fruits or vegetables for example. The only blanket statement I'd support is that refined sugar makes it easier to put on weight in a negative way.
