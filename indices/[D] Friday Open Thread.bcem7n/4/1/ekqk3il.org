First thing to be aware of is that diets are like religions. Here is a list of diets: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diets]]

The book is pretty old already, so it doesn't take into account the gut microbiome. Up-to-date diets need to take the gut microbiome into account ;).

As a data point, btw. the most efficient way for me to gain weight is to eat lots of nuts (peanuts because they are cheap).

A non-carbohydrate diet is kind of a luxury, as well. Not many on humans on this planet can afford this diet. This is also why historically, most people would eat potatoes, grain, rice or corn if they would get anything to eat at all. 15-45 million people died in a famine in China in 1959--1961.
