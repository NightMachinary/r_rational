I went to Harvard's admitted students weekend this weekend. I know the entire point of the programming is to sell the school to attendees but goddamn they did a good job.

I walked out feeling like I was now a member of their "club" and now that I'm in, I can basically never be kicked out. I've struggled most of my life to make my own path and be noticed on the strength of my own accomplishments. It always felt like no one noticed except for my spouse. But now I have been noticed and accepted, and instead of blazing my own trail I can stop trying so fucking hard and follow an easy, well-worn path to greatness. It's a fucking relief. And vindicating.

I also loved that every person I met this weekend was /smart/. I didn't click with everyone, but without exception I got the sense that everyone was talented and had hidden depths. I'm not sure how much of that was confirmation bias, but it ... it felt really nice.

Junior high fucking sucked. High school sucked. College sucked even more. Then I spent years and years working /alone/. But now it finally feels like I've finally found a group where I can fit in and be comfortable.

...I'll be sure to make a post after finals roll around and my rose-tinted glasses have shattered.
