Gumballs and Dungeons.

It's not really like any other game I've played or seen. The best way to describe it is...... not a gacha game? It somehow achieves all of the things gacha games are trying to evoke via collecting characters and powering them up and stuff, without adopting most of their crappy mechanics:

1. There is genuine gameplay, you run through dungeons in a sort of roguelite dungeon crawling clicky thing, as opposed to sitting there watching your characters fight for you. Your strategy and tactics matter, and there is a lot of complexity in the type of builds you can do, even if you end up clicking through it without thinking much on the easier levels.

2. (most) Characters are acquired in specific ways, not via random lottery. If you want a specific character, this is a specific method you can do on purpose to get that character, guaranteed.

3. Characters can be upgraded by acquiring more of their fragments (generally by doing the original task to unlock them repeatedly), not by absorbing other characters

4. Characters are unique, you don't dozens of duplicates of a character and have to do this stupid inventory management to get rid of them

5. Each character provides a small global buff, either strengthening your party or your resource rate or something just for owning them, so even characters you never use in your main party are still valuable to collect (and most of these buffs are unique so you have an incentive to seek out specific characters with buffs you want).

6. The game is relatively generous with giving out premium currency. You get some for daily logins, achievements, and can even grind it in certain dungeons if you want. More importantly, the quantity it gives versus the quantity required to progress in the game is well-balanced (and most characters are unlocked via gameplay, not premium currency) so you can easily play the game free-to-play without suffering.

I highly recommend at least checking it out, it's unlike any game I've ever played and is a lot of fun.
