I have played a lot of games, but I couldn't bring myself to uninstall a few. Monument Valley I, II and Alto's Adventure and Odyssey. They're so beautifully designed and it's just plain relaxing to play them. Gorgeous elucidation geometry ftw! (Monument Valley) Or just sliding down the mountain on your snowboard trying catch your runaway llamas, watching the scenery shift with time of the day or weather.. (Alto)

Limbo, if you want an atmospheric challenging plaformer. It's out on mobile now too. So many deaths.. and I love it.

Boson X - where you play as a professor running through a Hadron Collider ever accelerating. Running and jumping from platform to platform, with the slightest misstep resulting in annhilation. Pretty much like Super hexagon in a way, minimalistic. I loved how they made the movement rotational.

Gathering Sky - a short one. You play as a flock of birds, transversing a handpainted land below..

Smash Hit. There's something utterly serene about being able to toss balls shattering glass walls.

Like you have guessed I mostly stick to the indie games. The list could go on and on.. I was thinking of finishing Samoroast 3 and Old man's journey. As for Rpgs.. I have a Nitendo DS emulator and Roms. Need I say more? ^_^
