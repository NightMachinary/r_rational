Strategy wise I've enjoyed hexonia, and polytopia.

For RPGs there's bard's tale, eternium, MH Stories (not sure if worth Â£20 though, but you can try the free version for the first part of the story) and dungeon quest.

There's also emulation which will give you access to all the strategy and RPG games from GBA, PSP, DS, PS1, N64 and depending on your phone's specs GameCube & Wii.
