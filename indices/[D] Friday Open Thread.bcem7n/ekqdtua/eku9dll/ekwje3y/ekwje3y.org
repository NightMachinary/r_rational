First off, congratulations! That's an awesome achievement and you should be proud.

Second, [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/more-than-half-of-harvards-most-recent-graduates-had-an-a-gpa-or-better-2015-5][the average grade at Harvard is an A-]]. It's hard to be in the Ivy League club because there's a very high barrier for entry, not because they expect a lot from their members. Enjoy the rose glasses, you might get to wear them for a while ;)

(I suspect that's less true of graduate programs, and I know there's tons of great research coming out of Harvard, but it's still a pretty shocking figure.)
