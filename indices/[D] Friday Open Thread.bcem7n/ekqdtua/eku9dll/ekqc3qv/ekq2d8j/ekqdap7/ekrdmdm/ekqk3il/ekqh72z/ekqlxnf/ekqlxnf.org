I see this with some frequency, and think that it's objecting to the wrong view, and one not expressed in that excerpt.

  These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary.

Carbs /drive you to accumulate fat/, /make you hungrier/, and /make you sedentary/. This isn't saying anything at all about the fundamentals of thermodynamics, it's saying something about the fundamentals about how humans interact with food. If the premise is true, then someone attempting to lose/manage weight who doesn't cut out carbs is going to be fighting an uphill battle, because they won't want to work out or exercise, and they'll constantly be hungry even when they've met their caloric needs.

A large part of what makes diet and exercise work for people is minimizing the amount of willpower and action needed to maintain that diet and exercise. CICO is a real and important aspect of dieting, but if you attempt to meet some restrictive caloric intake while still taking in a lot of carbs, you're very likely to fail your diet fairly quickly. It drives me nuts that people will fundamentally misunderstand that aspect of dieting and criticize anything that takes it into account as thermodynamic denialism. It goes hand-in-hand with CICO.

(Now, if you wanted to criticize the science of carbohydrates in relation to insulin or something, that might be a different story.)
