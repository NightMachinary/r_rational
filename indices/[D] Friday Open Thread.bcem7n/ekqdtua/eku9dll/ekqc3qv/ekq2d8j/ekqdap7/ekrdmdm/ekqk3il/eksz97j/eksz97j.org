The gut microbiome is overblown by popular science, it's a minor factor for most people. If it was so practically important we would just be giving everyone fecal transplants but aside from C. diff and a very recent autism study we don't see it as very useful. Unless you have major digestive problems you don't need to focus on it since a healthy well balanced diet, which should be your goal for weight loss, is beneficial for your gut anyway. If you want to go out of your way to help it just eat yogurt daily.

Weirdly enough all the correlation studies I've seen associate nuts with lower bodyweight and waist size. Dieticians I've listened to talking about it are confused too since they are so calorie dense but our best guesses are: those people eat salty nuts instead of other less filling salty snacks like chips, and that it could be correlated with higher income or healthier cultures.
