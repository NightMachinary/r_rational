I remember searching for a reference and found [[https://osf.io/ezcuj/][Reproducibility Project: Psychology]].

I wasn't aware of this empathy study. But it only questions a "quick read" of literary fiction. It reminds me of the "[[http://socialpsychonline.com/2015/12/being-a-good-samaritan-psychology-of-helping/][Good Samaritan study]]" ([[http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/darley_samarit.html][paper]]). Reading the Bible passage on The Good Samaritan didn't make people more likely to help a stranger.

Maybe there are effects on empathy after "slow reading" over a long period of time :)

I like this Paul Graham quote [[http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html][on reading]]:

#+begin_quote
  "Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of. It works, but you don't know why."

EDIT: Share your inventory when you've finished it :) I'm not a fan of the above osf.io UI ;)
