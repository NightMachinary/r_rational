  You pass with anything over a 65%, I think.

Wow, I think 65% was my /average/ for my engineering degree! (I'm doing a nutrition degree part time at the moment and taking it Seriously and getting a ~81% average)

  Just in case I get hired as one of the dozen software engineers working on particle accelerators or something.

Yeah, it's weird they make you do physics and stuff. I think it's because a lot of the time you end up diversifying like crazy in engineering. Like, I did a civil engineering degree, and I'm a traffic engineer now but virtually nothing I did in my degree relates to my job, and yet I can see the skills I learned in unrelated parts of the degree are really super transferable (interpreting at the Australian Standards for steel construction --> interpreting Austroads Standards for road safety). So although the physics itself may not be a useful skill, PROBABLY the ability to learn equations, understand how they work, implement them, etc are what this subject /actually/ means in your real life.

That said, all the multivariable calculus I learned has been thoroughly useless. Me and a very senior engineer managed to thoroughly confuse each other over /basic algebra/ (as in, 3.7x = 87, solve for x level algebra).
