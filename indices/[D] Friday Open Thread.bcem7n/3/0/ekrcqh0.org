:(. There's always next time?

That said, it's really baffling to me how different countries have different "standards" for marks. Like, in Australia, a passing mark is 51% and an 80% is a high distinction. So my instinct upon hearing someone say "at best I got 80%, hooray" sarcastically is me going "wow someone has excessive self expectations" rather than the more appropriate to circumstance "this poor person is going to be lucky to get a (B?? what's 80% in your neck of the woods?)"

But then again I guess there's no reason why 80% or 50% or 20% should be a "good" or "bad" mark, it's all arbitrary and depends on the difficulty of the test.
