I have been reading up on weight management and obesity lately.. An excerpt from the beginning of Gary Taubes's Why We Get Fat:

  "When insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat---not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells. “Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat,” is how George Cahill, a former professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, recently described this to me."

  "In other words, the science itself makes clear that hormones, enzymes, and growth factors regulate our fat tissue, just as they do everything else in the human body, and that we do not get fat because we overeat; we get fat because the carbohydrates in our diet make us fat. The science tells us that obesity is ultimately the result of a hormonal imbalance, not a caloric one---specifically, the stimulation of insulin secretion caused by eating easily digestible, carbohydrate-rich foods: refined carbohydrates, including flour and cereal grains, starchy vegetables such as potatoes, and sugars, like sucrose (table sugar) and high-fructose corn syrup. These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary."

  "This is the fundamental reality of why we fatten, and if we're to get lean and stay lean we'll have to understand and accept it, and, perhaps more important, our doctors are going to have to understand and acknowledge it, too.

  If your goal in reading this book is simply to be told the answer to the question “What do I do to remain lean or lose the excess fat I have?” then this is it: stay away from carbohydrate-rich foods, and the sweeter the food or the easier it is to consume and digest---liquid carbohydrates like beer, fruit juices, and sodas are probably the worst---the more likely it is to make you fat and the more you should avoid it.

  This is certainly not a new message. Until the 1960s, as I'll discuss later, it was the conventional wisdom. Carbohydrate-rich foods---bread, pasta, potatoes, sweets, beer---were seen to be uniquely fattening, and if you wanted to avoid being fat, you didn't eat them."

Insulin is the key player in weight gain it would seem. I did end up confused by his views on legumes, vegetables and the meat exclusiveness though. The advice on carbs and glycemic index was sound. Also, anyone here has any experience with intermittent fasting? How do you go about it?
