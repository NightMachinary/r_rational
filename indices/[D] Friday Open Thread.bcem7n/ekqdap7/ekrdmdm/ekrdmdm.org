I'm skeptical of any and all diet advice. If there were any sort of easy trick to it, obesity would have been solved long ago. Instead there is constant conflicting advice from experts.

I think the safest general guidelines are to eat a sizable amount of vegetables, excersise, sleep, and you can't go too wrong. Not easy, but as reliable as you can get.
