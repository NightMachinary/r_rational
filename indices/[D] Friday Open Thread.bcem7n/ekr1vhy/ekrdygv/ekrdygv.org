The Shoggoth on The Roof is probably in the realm of what you're interested in, it's a comedy parody of Fiddler on the Roof about eldrotch horrors. Not a lot of romance though.

Welcome to Nightvale is a podcast that's presented as a small town radio station, but there are eldritch horrors and aliens and such all around town treated normally. Some romance in it.
