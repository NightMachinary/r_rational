In America the convention is 80-90 is the "B" range, where you know about 80% of the material. You pass with anything over a 65%, I think. But as a software engineer, I need at least a C, because it is /very/ important that software engineers know their velocity selectors. Just in case I get hired as one of the dozen software engineers working on particle accelerators or something. Or maybe CRTs make a comeback.
