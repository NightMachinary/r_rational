hmm i am not looking for upside down, but if you agree that not much would change with just these 2 steps, does that mean you believe you would go down the same path as Fuminori had you been in his shoes?

Because personally i think there are many points where he could have acted much more rationally,

For example when he first saw something which looked and tasted good to him he immediately should have asked himself if that thing is fit for human consumption, i mean sure his perception changed, but it was never suggested that anything else in his physiology changed. so anything which looked and tasted good to him was very possibly deadly.

When Saya offered him to fix his brain why didn't he suggest that she would change along with him? if she could change biology that well surely she could have changed her own look, or at least she could posses some meat puppet to look human.

Just a few disconnected examples, But i am sure there are more, possibly some which could somehow be stringed..
