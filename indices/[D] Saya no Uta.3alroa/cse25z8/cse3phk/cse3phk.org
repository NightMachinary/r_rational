  Step 1 would be not lying to your doctors about it.

I don't see how anything would have been different if Fuminori had told the truth to Dr Tanbo..

In the beginning they probably would have let him go seeing as it was obvious he was capable of supporting himself, and at the point where "truth" would have mattered in any way it wasn't related to his medical condition so no real reason to assume we should have told his doctor about it..

  Step 2, when meeting someone who seem completely exempt from your otherwise universal perception problem, is to ask why the hell that's the case.

How would realizing that Saya looks horrible in reality would have changed anything?
