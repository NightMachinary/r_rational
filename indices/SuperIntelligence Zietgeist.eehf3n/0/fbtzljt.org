I'm not a mod, but it sounds like something that would get positive votes in the wednesday worldbuilding thread if you are just talking about a setting you want to write. If you have a story I'd just say post a link and a brief description. If you are looking to extrapolate what a SIAI might deduce I'd say be very very careful and look up the advice, I think it's from Iceman the original author of Friendship is Optimal, on writing CelestAI for the greater Optimalverse setting.
