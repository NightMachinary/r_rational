I'm really interested by the fact that our last Tobias chapter was Chapter 47 (Chapter 35) and now we're at Chapter 70 (right after Chapter 46). We've gone a /long/ time seeing Tobias only in interludes, we've barely even gotten to meet Manihino! I'm really excited for the next Tobias chapter and I'm suspicious we're gonna get some sort of plot twist when we can see his thoughts again.
