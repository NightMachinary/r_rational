  The best way to think about Leeran hypersight is "imagine full psychic access for the duration of the exposure, plus a complete inability to track linear time, so that you experience all of the exposure jumbled up at once."

  (Note that this is indistinguishable, on the inside, from "I processed everything in the last two seconds and it felt like it was all happening in such a way that I could see past and future simultaneously.")

I can imagine what it's like to remember this after it's ended, but what is/was the Leeran homeworld like? Was the population dense enough that overlapping hypersight fields covered the whole planet? Did isolated groups of Leerans form megaminds that thought of all the individuals in third person? How is the experience of being a Leeran different from that of being a Howler?
