Ooh! A clue!

I always assumed that was because the Leerans are frozen, because V3 doesn't need their minds for anything.

It seems pretty impossible to actually do anything while you're brain is encased in Leeranium. If they brought enough Howlers into hypersight range, would the altered state propagate through the whole species as other Howlers randomly tune in?
