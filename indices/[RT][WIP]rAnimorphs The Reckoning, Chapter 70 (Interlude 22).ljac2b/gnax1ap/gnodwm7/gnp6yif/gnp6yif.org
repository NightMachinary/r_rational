Correct. The best way to think about Leeran hypersight is "imagine full psychic access for the duration of the exposure, plus a complete inability to track linear time, so that you experience all of the exposure jumbled up at once."

(Note that this is indistinguishable, on the inside, from "I processed everything in the last two seconds and it /felt/ like it was all happening in such a way that I could see past and future simultaneously.")

It's not magic with respect to time and possibility; it's /only/ magic with respect to extrospective access.
