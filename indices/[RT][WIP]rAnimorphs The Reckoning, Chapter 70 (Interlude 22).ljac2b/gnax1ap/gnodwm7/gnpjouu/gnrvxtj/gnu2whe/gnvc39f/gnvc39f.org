I think so, at least.

Edit: Now when I think about it, I should write it differently - in a real CEV, the approval is done by a version of you that's much smarter, thought about it much longer and had much more information, but in your scenario, it's current!Tobias who approves, if I understand you correctly. So I think there's the difference.
