Yes, my thinking is that it would trigger a series of self replicating improvements, ie:

Tobias/honestly wishes to be changed in some way/

Ship/sees Tobias wishing that change and plans to make that modification/

Tobias/sees that ship plans a modification, factors that into his desires, and honestly desires a second improvement/

Ship/sees desire for second improvement, commits to modifying/

Until boom, Tobias singularity?
