Oh I love the way that good ship is written! The inability to value chemically altered happiness less than happiness from goal completion. Both of the ship interludes have struck me with how close Tobias comes to having a complete personality rewrite, and I'm not sure he's even aware of the proximity of the danger?

This also is a good clue as to why the chee really shouldn't be allowed to self modify or modify others.

Final thought: if the ship has thoughts, then good ship +leeran will allow tobias to self modify until he's reached his coherent extrapolated volition. It might even be that good ship's brain and the leeren's ability for perfect communication will cause a friendly AI singularity

Oh maybe that's the players endgame? Make the pemalite ship meet a Leeren and some person to cause a singularity based around that persons values. Thus the winner of the game of the ones whose values the AI is aligned with?
