Question for the author:

How is Amaryllis pronounced? I'd been saying "Ah-mah-rill-iss", but then it got shortened to "Mary" which made me think "Ah-mary-liss" (or maybe "Ay-mary-liss"?) and now every time her name is mentioned my brain trips over itself trying to read it.

Loving the story BTW, and really appreciating how fast you're cranking these out.
