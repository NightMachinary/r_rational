Something I'm wondering is about the possible kiss at the end of the next quest. I'm totally expecting Amaryllis to kiss Juniper, and then he's going to have to explain to her that the quest log predicted she'd do that and about the effect her beauty has on him and why it scares him. Honestly it might have been a good idea to explain that to her already in addition to his earlier speculation about the other girls he chose not to rescue during the tutorial because it's probably a big hint to what the heck is really going on in this world.

Also I'm calling it now, Juniper isnt the original juniper, he's a high fidelity extremely accurate copy of Juniper reconstructed from the original juniper's memories, and this whole world actually is a simulation being run by AI. Well either that or he was uploaded by nanobots during his 5th period class, somehow.

Not quite sure why the AI would do that though. Maybe it's to give him the chance to play hero for a whole world just like he said he had wanted to before he came to Aerb, and the AI is just granting his wish in a way he did not want or expect?
