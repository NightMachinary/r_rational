Wise-assery aside, if we're talking about improving on Orson Scott Card, there's a golden opportunity: the Gate trilogy. It's not super well-known as his works go, but the basic conceit is that there are these hidden communities of sorcerers descended from ancient "gods" hiding out around the world because their powers have degraded over many generations. Until one of them is born with the long-lost power to make teleportation gates.

The first book is actually pretty good. It's got some OSC weirdness, but mostly tolerable, and he does some fun things with the characters' powers. At the end of the first book, it seems like he's setting things up for something EPIC ... and then you get the second book, where he gets sidetracked by a sex-gives-you-the-devil plot (sadly, not kidding) that doesn't go anywhere very interesting. There's also a fair dose of creepy misogyny in there. It's readable, but barely. In the third book he basically ignores everything he set up before for some weird alien cosmology which I'm guessing comes from the Book of Mormon. It ends with the epic stuff shoved in a corner, the hero so OP he's literally impossible to kill, and so much misogyny it makes the second book look almost feminist.

The shame is that it started out pretty fun IMO. If you picked up the thread at the end of book one and took it somewhere fun, you could improve on OSC's work a great deal.
