I love the idea of this. I do worry that any good Ender fic would have to be absolutely devastating: it seems like conflict between Ender and the government would have to be direct, meaning that they would either have to be malicious or bureaucratically nightmarish. I can't see a “satisfying” ending that isn't still tragic, and moreso than the original.

And I'd still probably read it 50 times.
