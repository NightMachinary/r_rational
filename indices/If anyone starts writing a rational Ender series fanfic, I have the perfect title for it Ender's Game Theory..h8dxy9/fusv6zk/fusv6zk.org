I liked the title enough to give it some thought, but then I realized the reason no one has wanted to play in that universe is that it's pretty boring.

The only conceit really is that everyone is sooOOoO smart. There's no worldbuilding or exploitable mechanics really that make it an interesting place to be, and you'd basically be left either making the characters actually sooOOoO much smarter and rational just to make a point that the originals weren't, or inventing a whole new cosmology, in which case just make an OC universe.
