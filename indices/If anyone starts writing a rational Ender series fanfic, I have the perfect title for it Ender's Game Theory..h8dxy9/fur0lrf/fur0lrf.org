  Why haven't humans/Formics tried communicating with each other through sign language.
#+end_quote

1) Initially, the Formics thought that any sapient would be capable of philotic communication (and tbh, I can see why they thought that and can't especially blame them for it).

2) The Formics probably never conceived of sign language, because they're all telepaths. Lots of other forms of communication which humans have historically used (e.g. semaphore flags) are likewise pointless for formics.

Also, tagging [[/u/tk17studios]], who no doubt will have a lot to say on the topic.
