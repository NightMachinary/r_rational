Yeah, the timeline is:

- 2010: Pathfinder published
- January 1, 2011: Card suffered a stroke
- 2011: The Lost Gate (Mithermages) published
- 2012: Ruins (Pathfinder) published
- 2013: The Gate Thief (Mithermages) published
- 2014: Visitors (Pathfinder) published
- 2015: Gatefather (Mithermages) published

Given the amount of time between completion of drafts and publication dates, I think that post-stroke work likely gets seen somewhere in the middle of Ruins and The Gate Thief (which may have already had pre-stroke drafts?) I don't really remember exactly, but at the time I remember at least feeling like there was a noticeable delay and subsequent drop in quality, which was really saddening. Could speculate more by looking at his bibliography, but I'm starting to feel a little morbid. Here's hoping that he has made a full recovery.
