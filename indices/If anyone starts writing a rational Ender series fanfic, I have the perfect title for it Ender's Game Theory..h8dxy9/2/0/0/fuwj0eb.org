"(relativistic) rocks fall, everybody dies" is a pretty boring story.

You could maybe stretch it out over 18 hours or so if they all have to come from the same direction and the formics want to preserve a biosphere (albeit without large-scale human industry)... each chapter a new group dealing with the shockwaves/emp/etc. of the previous impacts and coming to terms with the inevitable end. Can you get to a safe zone away from cities/water/infrastructure/faultlines? With enough supplies to survive the end of the world?

And, OK, there's an obvious sequel hook when the victorious Formics realise that individual humans are sentient /and it goes better than canon/.

Hmm. Alright, I guess there is a story there!
