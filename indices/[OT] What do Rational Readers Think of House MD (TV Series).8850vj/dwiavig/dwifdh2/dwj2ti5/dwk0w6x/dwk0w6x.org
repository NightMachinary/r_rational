ugh, my partner says it's because everyone else is "dumb" because House is awesome. And of course I, being less the prototypical rationalist than he is but definitely part of the community/movement/whatever, am just weird enough to love him, but just normal enough to have arguments with him where he insists that "you taking my tone of voice in that way is your problem, because i didn't mean it like that" / "it doesn't matter how you meant it, it matters how i felt". I fucking give up sometimes. Ugh. [/way too much personal stuff probably]
