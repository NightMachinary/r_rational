It's lupus.

No, but seriously. I used to watch it years ago. It was fun, in a "hey, hearing people throwing around very witty banter and solving mysteries is fun" way, but thinking back to it, I don't think it was /very/ realistic. And while House was right about how it's better to have an asshole that cures you than a very friendly idiot, that still doesn't mean a doctor should act like he did. Heck, he outright ordered his junior doctor to /break into a patient's house/ with staggering regularity.

Also, I am a bit inclined to bouts of health-related anxiety, so not going to touch it with a ten foot pole any more. Can do without giving my brain new ideas for how spectacularly my body could fail leading to an untimely and painful death.
