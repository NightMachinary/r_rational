Has anyone ever noticed that the character of House and Wilson is meant to be based on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson? They are very similar in terms of character archetypes and also their names.

Holmes -> Home -> House

Watson -> Wilson

EDIT: There's an entire [[http://house.wikia.com/wiki/Gregory_House_and_Sherlock_Holmes_connections][article]] on the connections between the two.
