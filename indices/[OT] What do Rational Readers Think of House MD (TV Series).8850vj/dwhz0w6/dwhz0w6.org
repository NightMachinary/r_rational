I generally enjoyed House but I never really examined it in terms of rationality. I think of it more like Sherlock Holmes, where his power of deduction is more or less just a super power that the audience has to accept for the basic premise of the story to work, more than a guide that you can follow and get similar results.

As such, it's just a good character drama. I like how it explores the theme of someone always needing to be right, even at the expense of social relationships. House as a character is often needlessly a jerk. And in real life, sure there are times where you need to go outside social norms to get results, but more often than not treating people with respect is going to be more beneficial in the long run than constantly stepping on people's toes just because you're smarter than them and can probably get away with it.

And the good thing about the series is that it does at times show that House is getting in his own way with his attitude. And being the smartest man in the room at all costs very rarely makes him the happiest. Which is not to say intelligence makes you miserable, but rather that intelligence alone is not going to make your life better if you only apply it to a very narrow field and ignore the consequences of your actions outside of that narrow field.

I don't know how to end my long rambling comment... so yeah, I like it. Also I don't know of any fanfiction that's good (though I do know fanfiction of it exists).
