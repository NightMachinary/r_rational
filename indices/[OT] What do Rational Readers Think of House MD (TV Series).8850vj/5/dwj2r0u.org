I rather enjoyed it; as others have mentioned, his deductive skill was definitely on par with super powers; half the time, someone would say something or he would say something completely innocuous but it would link things together in House's mind to save the day.

That being said, patients still died under him, which reflects how things actually work in the real world, so I was a lot more easily able to let his super power slide, so to speak.

In addition, the side plots and conversations were really fascinating a lot of the time; the talks on religion, morality, etc. were very interesting. I found myself agreeing with House's views on certain things a lot, though of course he had his own massive problems that he was aware and unaware of. And the other characters in the show were very well developed; even some of the shorter lived interns from that season where he had like 20 new fellows were well developed characters. No one was even close to perfect, everyone had their own flaws, and it made the show all the more compelling.

Overall, I don't think I would call House MD a rational show per se but I would call House himself a rather rational character and the show a smart show overall.
