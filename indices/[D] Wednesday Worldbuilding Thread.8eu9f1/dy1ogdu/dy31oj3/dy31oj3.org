Does the "soul" have any capabilities for perception? If not, there might be pressure to provide more information for the soul to process. Something like "better eyesight" might have diminishing returns, but the ability to take in more types of information could be more attractive. If the organism starts as a blank slate, with minimal instinctive knowledge, I could maybe see their young developing in transparent eggs to allow them to gather information as their bodies develop.
