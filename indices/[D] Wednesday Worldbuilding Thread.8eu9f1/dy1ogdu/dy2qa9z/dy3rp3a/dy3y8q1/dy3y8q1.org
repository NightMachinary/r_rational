I assumed if humans get today a true body-mind dualism, they would still not behave differently than humans like us. So that they mirror a brain from infant to adult, maybe even copy Alzheimer (If OP didn't hand wave brain damages.)

If I knew how our brains worked together with the body in detail, I would give options how the mechanics of the soul-body interaction could work. Since I don't know shit about that, I assume it works like brains, except no energy needed.

btw heads could be smaller since there would be no need for big brains (except if they are needed for the connection). And many other little things, that will produce more changes.
