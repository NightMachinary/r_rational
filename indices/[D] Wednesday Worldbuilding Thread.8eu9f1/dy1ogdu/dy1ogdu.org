I hope it's okay to post here even though it's not Wednesday anymore.

How would an intelligent species develop differently under true mind-body dualism? Say that instead of being controlled by a brain, the organism is animated by a complex matrix of magical energies that we'll call the "soul" for sake of discussion. During reproduction, a new soul is created based on the attributes of the soul(s) of the parent(s). Since souls are usually considered eternal, assume that they need no input of energy to keep going.

It might be more appropriate to describe such a creature as two organisms in a symbiotic relationship, with the magic half using the meat half for locomotion and reproduction, and the meat half using the magic half for information processing. I can think of a few consequences of this arrangement off the top of my head.

- The species would be liberated from the huge energy drain that a brain represents, and therefore would have more energy to devote to other things.

** This would make increased intelligence a much more attractive adaptation, since it removes the main drawback.

- There's really no reason for the gradual increase in capability that we see in biological organisms, except maybe learning by experience; such an organism could be fully conscious from budding/fertilization/parthenogenesis.

** Some of this "learning by experience" might even be skipped by souls coming "preloaded" with useful information, though that seems statistically less likely to evolve.

- The creatures would likely be less malleable than humans, not having to worry about brain damage or degenerative neurological diseases but also incapable of making use of mind-altering chemicals (be they psychotropics or antipsychotics).
