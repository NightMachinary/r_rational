So I initially planned to post this to [[/r/MakeYourChoice]], but they don't allow WIP text posts so I'm posting it here.

I've decided to make a CYOA. The general premise is pretty simple, and even kind of derivative: a ROB is going to transform you into something different (in this case, a magical creature), and you have a point-buy system to determine what changes get made.

The twist I'm putting on this is that there's no explicit upper limit to how many points you can spend (although there's the implicit one of there being a limited number of options.) There is, however, a lower limit. This is because points aren't an abstraction of "power used", they're an abstraction of how far from human you've diverged. Meeting the absolute bare minimum point limit means you're basically still human, except with a few quirks of varying in/convenience. Going nuts with points means you've lost much of your humanity, and are subject to penalties inspired by traditional supernatural creatures (i.e., cannot cross running water while conscious.) There's a bit more too it, but I don't want to spoil my own work.

Anyways, is anyone experienced with CYOAs (filling them out or creating them) willing to betaread/test it for me? I'm about halfway done with the specifications document at 2,000 words. My remaining steps are:

1. Finish the last three sections -- I'll need mostly betareading feedback here, plus brainstorming help
2. Balance pass -- betatesting feedback will be necessary here
3. Make the actual visual CYOA image. -- this will mostly just be on me
4. Typesetting pass (reducing sentence wordiness so everything is readable.) -- more betareading.
