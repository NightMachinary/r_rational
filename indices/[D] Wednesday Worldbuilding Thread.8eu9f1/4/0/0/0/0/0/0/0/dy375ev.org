  Sure and you might remember that animals didn't exist back then. It seems to be really vital to have access to oxygen if you're going to be doing anything energy intensive.

Yeah, that's why electric motors need oxygen to be doing anything energy intensive. It's true that oxygen really helps since it is a greedy electron acceptor. Still, there are other elements that would work better, if they were around us.

  Sure but the power didn't just say it provided unlimited chemical energy period, it seemed to be talking about the sort of chemical energy that you get from food. So it would seem to only provide half of the above mentioned mechanisms function.

What energy do you get from food? Nothing without oxygen. It is the same mechanism. I would say OP doesn't know enough biochemistry to say what he/she means exactly. And yeah, the more you know about body functions, the more you understand, why superpowers couldn't work in our world -.-

Still if we say demonic biological energy is the energy needed to make the right enzymes deform in the right way, we wouldn't need food or oxygen. If we say it is only for those enzymes that need food (fat, sugar, protein) we would have a problem, because there are enzymes that need the degrading(?) products. If those enzymes are also powered by the demonic energy, than we don't have that problem. (But the pH will not be good.)

And that was all not the point of my complaint. I complaint about

  Sure oxygen's used for energy but it's a totally different mechanism from the chemical energy in food,

  This sort of brings up a separate issue that the body doesn't run on some "pure" form of energy like electricity, so getting it to work without food and/or oxygen is going to require you create physical matter ex-nihilo to act as fuel for the bodies chemistry. Which would of course mean that since it's already creating matter, eating demons should be plenty capable of giving you the matter needed to grow.

Did you meant to say, that we would need atoms to grow in mass? If not why discuss this?

But if you want to bring up a separate issue, make it specific, tell me an example of the bodies chemistry that would need more than pure energy? And why the hell bring it up, where I talked about creating matter? I totally miss the context. If the demon just create food in your stomache and oxygen in your lungs, we wouldn't talk about anything.
