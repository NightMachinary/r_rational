  No, just no... There was a time, this planet had life, but no oxygen.

Sure and you might remember that animals didn't exist back then. It seems to be really vital to have access to oxygen if you're going to be /doing/ anything energy intensive.

  Actual if you talk about animals, we use Sugar, Fat and Proteins as electron donors and oxygen as acceptor. Without donors OR acceptors we can't get energy. (We use the energy from the electrons that want to travel. Just think the electron flow as water flow and our electron transport chain as water mill. The electron donor would be like the higher ground like a mountain where the water comes from and the acceptor would be the lower ground like the ocean where everything flows from.)

Sure but the power didn't just say it provided unlimited chemical energy period, it seemed to be talking about the sort of chemical energy that you get from food. So it would seem to only provide half of the above mentioned mechanisms function.

  If you meant to say, that we would need atoms to grow in mass, that is something different. Cause in a magical DnD world we could create matter, so we would need to ask OP.

This sort of brings up a separate issue that the body doesn't run on some "pure" form of energy like electricity, so getting it to work without food and/or oxygen is going to require you create physical matter ex-nihilo to act as fuel for the bodies chemistry. Which would of course mean that since it's already creating matter, eating demons should be plenty capable of giving you the matter needed to grow.
