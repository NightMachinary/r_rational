Yeah, many things would change. The circulatory system could still be needed if there is only one organ that converts the demonic energy.

Since I assume OP wanted a possible evolution path for dragons from lizards, I tend to answer most question that come up in a way that would make dragons more likely.

As long as the dirt has carbon atoms and the lizard can digest them, that should be fine. The lizards probably will not be eating trees, since the cellulose will not be able to be broken down. (And since dragons don't eat trees, they will likely not evolve that, unless OP changes that. The same for dirt.)

Well, we assume it gets unlimited demonic energy. It will probably move faster, but there could be limits how much demonic energy gets transferred. Since dragons are normally killing sheep and cows, I would say they should still need external sources of energy (besides demonic energy). Maybe they evolve slowly to have better summoning circles to get more energy.

I still see not a clear way to make the lizards fly unless we start with a small gliding lizard. And the demonic energy is causing more mutations. And the selection is more based on being able to run away for a million years.

Breathing fire could be just throwing up demonic energy. Or an unwanted product that burns with oxygen contact. And after some generation evolves into fire-breathing.
