Based upon that, I'd predict that the lizard evolves to be a lot smaller: higher energy dissipation per mass, and faster reproduction when mass is the only limiting factor. Further, I'd expect it to paradoxically grow very slowly and take its time reproducing. Without the necessity of eating for food energy, the lizard expands into areas like deserts, where encountering something edible is rare. It can afford to wait a long, long time between meals.

Its ideal environment might be deep in the ocean, actually. It could swim around vigorously to look for things to eat despite food being otherwise quite uncommon.

On the other hand, it doesn't /have/ to wait a long time between meals. It might drive all other life extinct by eating everything in the oceans, and everything else for that matter.
