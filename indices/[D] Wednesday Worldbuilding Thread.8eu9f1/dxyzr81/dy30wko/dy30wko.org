Argh, its complicated, because we/lizards use the Electron transport chain. Basically, we use food (sugar) as electron donor and oxygen as electron as acceptor. And the flow between them powers our system. The chain is basically a number of enzymes that use one reaction (sugar breaking down) to power another one (NAD^{+} to NADH and AdP to ATP) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme#Induced_fit_model][mostly by the enzyme binding with one of the substances and because of that deforming and that presses molecules together]]. I think some hydrogen atoms go from the sugar into other molecules (like NAD^{+} ). But from there they go sometime later to the oxygen. There are also some enzymes that need O2 react to H2O, so it can pump H^{+} ions around.

1. If the demonic energy acts as electron donor (and the chemistry still functions), it wouldn't need to eat. The lizard would still need oxygen (or something else) as electron acceptor. But we would have a problem since we would need the hydrogen atoms for producing water and our cell would get a higher pH (because OH^{-} gets produced) which messes with reactions. (The body can buffer that, but not forever.)

2. If it acts as acceptor (and the chemistry still functions...) Long story short we should end up with too many H^{+} ions. which messes again with the pH of the body. The lizard would still need food for energy and water. But doesn't need to breath.

3. If the demonic energy acts as the reaction powering the enzyms. There shouldn't be any molecules be overproduced. It could still happen, that some functions are limited (for the first 100k generations), because some reaction need temporary atoms from the food (sugar, protein, fat) or it needs the oxygen for some enzymes that aren't powered by the demonic energy. But evolution would produce fast (I would guess in 10-100 generations) lizards that have a big reservoir of the chemicals needed.

So I think case 3 has the best potential to produce a lizard that doesn't breath without messing other stuff up. By the way we regulate the pH of our body mainly by breathing. (H2CO3 goes to CO2 and water and H2CO3 acts as pH buffer) But in all cases it should be possible. Even in case one, something else could act as electron acceptor. And since demonic energy could be a stronger electron donor than sugar or fat. That would mean more stuff would be forced to accept electrons. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity][Look up electron negativity and redox reactions]]

There are still bodily functions that use up specific molecules. I think the brain needs some amino acids (protein). That would be still needed to be eaten.

Some other cool stuff that could happen:

- The lizard could evolve to produce sugar and fat from the CO2 from the air and water from drinking. Like plants. It wouldn't really need new biological processes, since each biological reaction is reversible (but we/they evolved to minimize the reverse reaction). They would just need a high concentration of the products (which is normally kept low) and a low concentration of the starting chemicals. Proteins are more complicated. They need Nitrogen and not many things can use N2. (With the right materials, they could still build all aminoacids and then protein the normal way.) But they would still need to breath and have an atmosphere around.

- They evolve so they only need food for growth. (For eating they would probably still need to breath oxygen.) They would evolve to have a closed system that they feed demonic biological energy into and get mechanical work (muscle movement) back. They could live in space or an 'closed' system. (not really closed, since they would get demonic energy.)

I hope I could explain it to you, why it doesn't have an easy answer. Just for the end: We only need to breathe, because we can't store enough oxygen. If we used a solid/liquid electron acceptor we could walk around without breathing. Just keep in mind we would need to store it too, like electron donors (fat).

Now what would mean free energy for the lizard?

- It could waste energy for defense (like fire breath) and running away (flight)

- nearly everything that it eats will be used for growth, making it big, and it wouldn't care, cause it can't starve, only stagnate and being big means, nothing will eat it. (except other lizards)

- it couldn't be fat, since energy reserves are not needed and also no insolation. (except the demons cut it off) (maybe it has other reserves for molecules it needs.)

- If it has to live in hot environments, it could use energy, so it can cool itself like a freezer. (Have a closed air bag organ/lung. Compress it with muscles -> compressed air gets hot. (lets say 90°C) -> cool the bag with outside air to outside tempreature 40°C -> stop compressing air in lung -> air in lung cools down (lets say to 10°C) and let body cool down from the cool air in the closed bag organ. And restart) Okay, that will never evolve, forget it. And who knows how effective this could be...

- I don't get why it would hunt at all, it could just wait until something comes along and eat it.

oh man, that does sound like a dragon would evolve out of a lizard with free energy device.
