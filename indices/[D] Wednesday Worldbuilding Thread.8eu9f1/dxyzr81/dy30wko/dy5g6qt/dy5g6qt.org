  It could just wait until something comes along and eat it.

  oh man, that does sound like a dragon would evolve out of a lizard with free energy device.

Ancient lizards instinctively horde seeds because it attracts delicious mice.

Modern dragons instinctively horde gold because it attracts delicious murderhobos.

Hah. I like that idea. And I guess I did somewhat have dragons in the back of my mind when writing the original comment. But the main thing was that I read about simulated creatures evolving the ability to exploit floating-point rounding errors as a source of free energy. Magic is a huge source of energy, but the only story I've seen where it significantly shaped the ecology of the world is The Stormlight Archives.

If I ever use this idea in a tabletop game, I might add a stipulation that the summoning-organ requires animal souls as a micronutrient. (But then why don't the demonovores just eat their own babies? Unless the demonovores just don't have souls.) That should plausibly encourage predatory behavior, limit their population growth, and prevent outbreaks of Vakusdrakian Von Neumann Moles.
