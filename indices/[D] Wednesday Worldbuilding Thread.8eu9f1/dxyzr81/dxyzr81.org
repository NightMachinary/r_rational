How might an animal lineage evolve if the animal magically doesn't need to eat for energy?

Say that by chance, some lizard is born with a pattern of scales which happens to form a simple summoning circle. It can eat demons, except the demons provide usable biological energy instead of infernal wishes or something.

The lizard and its descendants still have to worry about injury, disease, and eating for non-metabolic reasons. (To grow larger or produce a baby requires matter. Sweating requires water.) But a limitless freely acessible food source is a huge advantage. What kind of selective pressures might that cause?

Some ideas:

Is breathing still important?

Adaptations like large size and high intelligence become more advantageous without an energy tradeoff.

The demoneater lizards would probably be good at endurance hunting.

Arctic environments are less dangerous with the ability to infinitely shiver, but scorching deserts still pose a threat.
