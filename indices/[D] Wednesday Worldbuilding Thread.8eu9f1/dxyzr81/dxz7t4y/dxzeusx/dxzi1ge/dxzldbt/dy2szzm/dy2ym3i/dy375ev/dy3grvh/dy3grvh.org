  What energy do you get from food? Nothing without oxygen. It is the same mechanism. I would say OP doesn't know enough biochemistry to say what he/she means exactly. And yeah, the more you know about body functions, the more you understand, why superpowers couldn't work in our world -.-

Yeah this is probably the fundamental problem, that it's super unclear what exactly the demon based energy /does/. If it is supposed to take the place of food then it would serve as a magical nutrient IV which would not negate the need for air but would also negate the need to ever consume extra mass.

On the other hand having the power just "make the right enzymes deform in the right way" instead of inputting any matter (which seems to be your interpretation) seems vaguely plausible but would likely have more wide ranging effects than negating the need for oxygen or food.\\
For instance a normal circulatory system would be unnecessary and if you're just telekinesis'ing chemistry into doing what you want then it's easy to imagine that there would be little need for many organs. So it's increasingly easy to imagine that the creature would probably evolve to be a herbivore (since energy density of food is irrelevant) or even just evolve to eat dirt. Similarly since energy isn't a constraint it seem rather inevitable that it will evolve to be extremely fast moving and likely evolve to fly as well (unless it evolved other defensives first). Then if its offspring only need relative safety and some dirt to grow then it would be incentivized to go for an extreme R-type reproductive strategy..

So it seems like freed from needing external sources of energy the lizards would evolve into (potentially flying) swarms that would pretty much overturn the whole ecosystem by consuming all the topsoil (or just causing sinkholes due to constantly tunneling through the ground laying eggs and eating dirt) and over long enough timescales could threaten basically all other life on earth.
