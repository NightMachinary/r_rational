  Sure oxygen's used for energy but it's a totally different mechanism from the chemical energy in food, so getting the equivalent of a constant magical nutrient IV wouldn't eliminate the need for oxygen even a little.

No, just no... There was a time, this planet had life, but no oxygen.

Actual if you talk about animals, we use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain][Sugar, Fat and Proteins as electron donors and oxygen as acceptor]]. Without donors OR acceptors we can't get energy. (We use the energy from the electrons that want to travel. Just think the electron flow as water flow and our electron transport chain as water mill. The electron donor would be like the higher ground like a mountain where the water comes from and the acceptor would be the lower ground like the ocean where everything flows from.)

Just think wood has the energy, but without oxygen (or another electron acceptor), it wouldn't let the energy free (=burn)

If you meant to say, that we would need atoms to grow in mass, that is something different. Cause in a magical DnD world we could create matter, so we would need to ask OP.

I'm not an expert in that, so if I'm wrong you could tell me how the mechanism for food looks like and for oxygen. I'm totally okay with Wikipedia sources.
