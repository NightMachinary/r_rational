Usable biological energy means the demons are sources of all the macro- and micro- nutrients the lizards need? As a nutrition student I'm a bit skeptical of that as there's no such thing as "the perfect food" (then again, if the lizard is an obligate carnivore, then maybe: but even then I am sure there are trace minerals it will have to get some other way, just spitballing here, cats like to chew on grass and nobody knows why, maybe there's a trace mineral there?)
