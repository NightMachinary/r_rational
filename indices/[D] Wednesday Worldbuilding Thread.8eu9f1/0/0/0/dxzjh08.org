  I would note though, that the 'spending more points incurs drawbacks' and the 'pick drawbacks to get more points' models may not feel as different as you're hoping.

I'm designing play across what I see as the three main play types. The first two types of player shouldn't see /too/ much of a difference with my system, but the third kind (hopefully) will.

- "Risk Adverse" players will minimize their drawbacks, both by picking as few points as possible and by not picking options that have inherent drawbacks. These are going to be the players that want to be a bit more special than in real life, but not so much more special that it's inconvenient.
- "Goal Oriented" players will have a specific task or tasks they want their choices to accomplish, and optimize accordingly. They'll take drawbacks necessary to reach their goal, but seek to minimize how many they take.
- "MOAR POWER" players take as many drawbacks as necessary to pick every option they want. However, CYOAs typically run into a balancing problem where either drawbacks are cheap, so "MOAR POWER" players are perfectly OK taking a whole bunch of options, or drawbacks are too expensive, which makes "MOAR POWER" players not have as much fun because it's agonizing to fit all the stuff they want in their point budget. I'm hoping my system changes that up a bit by not having players worry about a point budget if they're already planning to take a whole bunch of options, but "punishing" them by making them fit in worse with society.

By the way, I've PM'd you a link to the google drive file with the CYOA. I'm mostly looking for brainstorming help and error-fixing during this phase.
