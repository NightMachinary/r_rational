/Out of the Violent Planet/ is a really obscure RPG supplement for the game REIGN, [[http://www.gregstolze.com/downloads.html][available for free here]], about modern-day humanity making first contact and discovering that we are the only species in the galaxy where innate psychic powers aren't commonplace. Aliens don't even have a spoken language.

The ideas are really interesting, but I personally found what I read to be bit shallow in terms of worldbuilding and plot hooks. Aliens have no concept of using tools to kill things because they can just rewrite less powerful minds /however they'd like/ when they're in range, which virtually all humans are immune to. One in a million humans are psychic enough to talk to the aliens, but not immune to mind control.

Psychic power is conferred by a genetic lottery that varies between species, so half the galaxy is ruled by the species that's best at mind control while the other half is ruled by the species most resistant to mind control. Neither have FTL travel or communication technology because some telepaths have interstellar range (more common in the former faction) and others can create wormholes (more common in the latter faction).

Warfare and social organization are described as being based around controlling information and positioning psychics based on their individual power. No one fields armies because that would risk putting more people in range of a stronger psychic, and aliens don't need to group up into large communities when they have dedicated teleporters and transceivers.

That is all the information I found, the book has some more details I considered superfluous, which is insufficient for me to create an interesting story or a fascinating fantastical society on my own. I don't have any plans to do something with this, it's just an oddball high concept I thought some of you would be interested in.
