I've wanted to do something with /Out of the Violent Planet/ for a while, and I realized that, I think in order to draw the setting out for a broader story rather than just the personal tales of some human schmucks, you need to shake it up.

The two things I've considered focusing on are:

- The proliferation of human technology (and human fighters) in the galaxy at large, and how this challenges the political and socioeconomic status quo. In particular, how the fact that not all species are equally poised to benefit from humans or human technology.
- The way that a human perspective on science and engineering leads to developments in fields of various psychic abilities. Rigorously analyzing what aspects of a species' physiology gives them stronger or weaker talent in a given field, developing cybernetic and organic technologies to simulate or enhance psychic powers, etc.
