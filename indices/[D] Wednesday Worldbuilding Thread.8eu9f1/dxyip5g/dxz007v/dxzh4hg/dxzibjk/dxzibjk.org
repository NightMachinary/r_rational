That's fair. The interactions are kind of the point of taking it in that direction. The game goes over the broad strokes of what aliens in general are like, but IIRC it takes quite a shallow take on exploring the particulars of any one species, since for the ordinary game, they aren't supposed to be the main characters.

And, that's true, but. I don't know how to phrase it precisely. The aliens know how psychic powers work, but they don't know /why/ I guess. They can't have applied the same mindset that prompts humans to deconstruct reality and understand not just how it works, but how anything /might/ work. Maybe I am misremembering, but if I'm not, the aliens are characterized as broadly lacking technology beyond the intuitive in general, not just a lack of weapons. It seems like a waste to say that isn't a space, in intersection with psychic powers, isn't something even humans are allowed to explore.
