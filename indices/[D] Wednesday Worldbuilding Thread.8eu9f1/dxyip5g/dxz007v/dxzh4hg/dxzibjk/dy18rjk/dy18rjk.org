The hard part for me is understanding how aliens think when their entire civilization is based around innate mind control powers. It's just a fact of life that a person more psychic than you will rewrite your mind into whoever they want you to be.

How do they live like that? How do they talk to each other? What do they call their political philosophy? What do they say to the one species they can't reprogram to do whatever they want?
