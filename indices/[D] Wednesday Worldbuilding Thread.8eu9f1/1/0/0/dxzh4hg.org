The former is something the game suggested for a plot, there are even references to aliens trying to get human soldiers since we can get close to enemy psychics without getting detected or attacked by usual methods. However, I'm unsure how interactions with these alien mindsets work.

Aside from a suggested plot twist of the aliens developing a gene therapy that can make more humans psychic, the latter is something that the designers seemed to actively avoid. Aliens already know how psychic powers work and developed biotechnology to enhance it.
