Ok, there is a technical definition [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation]]].

I see that you are not talking about this one, but rather mean a computer that is either (a) really powerful or (b) more powerful than can be efficiently simulated by physics, and not (c) fundamentally beyond simulation-by-physics?

(a) might be a lump of alien computronium, (b) might be a quantum computer in a classical universe (since we don't live in a classical universe, a quantum computer doesn't count), (c) might be a true random number generator (useless), the Necronomicon (useless), or a halting-problem-oracle (extremely useful if fast).

Regardless which one you have, I'd guess you should spend some time pondering the metaphysical implications of the thing existing before you try to take over the world:

(a) not angering the aliens is important, (b) or (c) are strong hints that either physics is really fucking weird, or that there is some god (e.g. a simulator) and not pissing off an actually existing god should be high on your priority list.
