  (2) the word "hypercomputer" is taken, and it does not mean what you appear to think it does
#+end_quote

Given /infinite/ processing power it would seems like most /any/ computer would become a hypercomputer in that it could solve at least some Turing uncomputable problems. For instance it could instantly solve all version of the halting problem for itself.

  1) you probably need to put a little more thought into fleshing out the details of your scenario
#+end_quote

Presuming you want to use the computer to instantiate a FAI into the world as quickly as possible, how much do the details (beyond what's obviously the case based on my initial descriptions) really matter? If you're already talking about a infinitely powerful classical/quantum computer does adding any other types of computing power actually speed up your goal of creating FAI here?

  Which capabilities do you add? "All of them" is contradictory: No hypercomputer of capability C will be capable of predicting whether a program written for a C-hypercomputer terminates. Therefore, you need to specify.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure "all of them" is so contradictory if you relax you definition of what counts as a single computer and count a whole system rather than one processor. For instance I would say that the hypercomputer interface can be called a single computer but actually connects to an infinitely powerful version of every mathematically possible computer. So thus by definition the system as a whole can do anything any logically coherent computer can do because it includes them all.
