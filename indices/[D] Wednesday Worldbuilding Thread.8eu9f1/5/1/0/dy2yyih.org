  What kind of magical computer do you have, precisely?
#+end_quote

I'm assuming the sort of hypercomputer that has literally infinite computing power and memory, also as a side effect it can output as much electricity as desired (though that's not terribly useful pre singularity while you're trying not to let people know you have a hypercomputer).

So yes there's a lot of mathematical problems it could basically solve instantly, but that's no really remotely important compared to using it to kick off a singularity.
