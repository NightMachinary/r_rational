Encode computer programs as integers, e.g. just interpret their bit-sequence as an integer.

Now, some of these programs terminate, while others run forever; only the Old Ones, from outside reality itself, know which ones will terminate. The mad Arab Al'Hazred received this list in a fevered vision, and wrote down, in ascending order, all the terminating programs that run longer than all previous programs in this list. Because Al Hazred was totally nuts he just had to write the book on human skin and call it the "Necronomicon", the book-that-names-the-dead (programs) [*].

This book, if you can acquire a copy, plus a steady supply of assistants for looking up pages, is a hypercomputer. For an alternative explanation, see [[[https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3531]]].

[*] Back in the day, the book was also known to the god who rules over the Platonic Realm of ideas, as taught by the high priest Hilbert. Alas, the heretics Goedel and Turing climbed Mount Olymp, violated the sancticity of the Platonic Realm and set fire to the divine library. Today, only the old ones remember; and some fragmentary copies of Al'Hazred's Necronomicon are said to remain in possession of various cultists.
