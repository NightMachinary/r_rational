I mean I'm imagining that I would be starting out with social animals and the idea is to select for prosocial behavior through similar kinds of mechanisms to what made humans like we are. Plus I will be running many parallel experiments; so if some of the species that pass my coordination and intelligence tests (which will include being taught english either typed/read or spoken) are just to damn creepy it's no loss. Then the remaining who passed will get exposed to human culture and I can view many iterations of this and pick the groups that end up with values I agree with.

Basically since I'm not dealing with a superintelligence I expect that evolved biological beings aren't going to pull off a multigenerational ploy over millenia to hide their species true nature, so I can trust their behavior to be somewhat determined by their goals.\\
Plus I expect there to be some convergence in mind-design among social alien species.

More abstractly though I sort of figured the evolutionary approach is the only one that lets me create biological intelligences through a process that requires no active oversight by me (thus allowing me to speed it up such that it instantly skips to the next time my automated system alerts me of something).
