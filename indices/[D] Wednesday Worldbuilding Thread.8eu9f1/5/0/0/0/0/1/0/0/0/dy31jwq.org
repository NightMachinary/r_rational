See I don't really buy that once you get to the stage where I'm seeing how they react to exposure to human culture that I could miss any highly relevant difference between their values and my own. Like realistically can you actually come up with any highly relevant psychological traits which wouldn't be made obvious by which human culture they end up adopting and how they react to it generally?\\
Another point would be that I don't need them to be perfectly human psychologically I just need them to share the same values or at least to have enough reverence for authority/god to follow my commandments about how to create the FAI in the later stages of my plan.\\
Or rather I need them to be human enough to indoctrinate into my own values even if it doesn't perfectly align with their innate moral instincts.

More generally though I'm rather dubious of your value alignment points because human moral intuitions aren't /random/, so you should be able to replicate them by recreating the same conditions that led to them arising in the first place. And I don't think there's reason to think you need to be perfectly exact either given the range in values humans display (meaning I can likely find /some/ group that ends up with my values) and the significant evolutionary convergence in the behavior of highly socially intelligent animals.
