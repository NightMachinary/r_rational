  A major difficulty of the alignment problem is that very small differences can end up being amplified. Even if your simulated beings aren't carrying out some huge ploy to mislead you, you're not a superintelligence, and there's always the chance that you'll just miss something.

Hmm yeah a major issue is that it's hard to predict exactly how much convergence in goal structures you should see among social creatures. I mean I would predict quite a lot of convergence based on the similarities between the independently evolved social behavior in birds and mammals with complex social dynamics.\\
Still do you have any ideas for how to more closely select for human-like minds? (though I have flirted with the idea that selecting for fanatical theocrats who will faithfully work as hard as possible to figure out my values and copy them into the FAI might be better..) Or alternatively do you have any other strategies one might try that don't take decades?

  And the aforementioned amplification effect means that you really need "identical", not "close enough, as far as I can tell."

I'm not really sure this seems likely though, I don't think aliens with minds that barely resemble humans would be able to "pass" as human-like minds particularly since they won't necessarily know what a human is. It doesn't seem likely that extremely inhuman aliens would happen to end up with extremely human like behavior purely by chance, the behavior should reflect on the underlying psychology.\\
Plus the next test, how they react to human culture seems likely to rule out any aliens who only have a passing behavioral resemblance to humans.

  There's also the ethical issue of subjecting quadrillions of simulated beings to the inevitable simulated Unfriendly nightmares implied by such a process.

My setup seems well designed to minimize that, they have basically no sources of suffering other than aging, unlimited resources and subjectively it would seem like the moment they died they were transported to a paradise (since they're slowed down enough that the singularity seems to instantly happen for them).
