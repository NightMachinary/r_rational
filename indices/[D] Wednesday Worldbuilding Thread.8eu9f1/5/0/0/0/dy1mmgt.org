I'm not sure an evolutionary approach is the best idea. After all, evolution was selecting for reproductive fitness, but produced organisms that use birth control and get off to porn. You're very likely to end up with something that matches your values in the training environment but diverges in actual application. And even that is assuming that you can specify your values well enough to implement this selection.
