Yeah that's why I figured you might not be able to do better than simulating evolution to get intelligent life and making it do your AI work for you at accelerated speed.

Still do you have any ideas how you might improve upon the selection method I described? (or come up with a better way of utilizing the hypercompomputer)

Given your absurd processing power it does seem a /bit/ silly; as though you were using godlike power to create a whole universe, just so that you can evolve life which you then force to do your taxes for you. Still I can't really think of anything better
