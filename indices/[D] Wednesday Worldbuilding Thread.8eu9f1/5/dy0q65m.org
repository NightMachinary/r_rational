Here's a question: You magically end up with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation][/Hypercomputer/]] and you want to use it to create simulated civilizations so you can use them to work on AGI/AI safety at arbitrarily accelerated speed:

- *Firstly* is there a faster way you can use infinite computing to get FAI (assuming you don't want to risk UFAI because you aren't sure how the computer works well enough to be sure it couldn't take control of your hypercomputer once created)?

- *Secondly* do you think you can improve upon the plan outlines below (assuming you aren't willing to increase the amount of egregious mindcrime)?

The best plan I can come up with so far is to use brute force methods to figure out the laws of physics. Then once I can make simulation of universes like our own I'd create many artificial virtual chambers with different biochemical conditions until I got abiogenesis to work. Once I'd done that I'd create some large environments to let life develop then run that at insane speed and have it slow things down and alert me once some animals managed to pass the entire breadth of tests I put into the world to test intelligence and tool use (which also dispensed food).

Once I'd created a suitable target for uplifting I would take precautions to make sure I'm not causing them unbelievable suffering in the process of getting human level intelligences. I would remove all diseases and parasites from them and put them in a new environment which was designed to artificially select them for intelligence and prosociality. This would work by controlling their fertility artificially so they were forcefully committed to a K-type monogamous strategy (since selecting for them to be similar to humans seems probably useful) and also having their fertility only be able to be turned on by competing procedurally generated cognitive tests. Similarly I would have other procedural tests which controlled fertility that were group based team exercises potentially against other isolated groups of the species which would select for prosocial behavior. In addition I would automatically have the computer detect creatures with physiological signs of dying and have them taken to a virtual environment where they're ran at such incredibly slow speed that they won't die before I get FAI and can have it fix their ailments.\\
Still while I have protections from death the creatures would have plentiful resources, no sources of danger and all the selection effects would be from their artificially controlled fertility.

Then once the creatures can consistently score at human levels on the cognitive tests I'd give them access to human culture (but still no way of creating tech) and look for the ones who ended up with the values closest to my goals. Those one's would be copied into a new simulation (the old run no longer being run at accelerated speeds) where they would be given more cognitive tests controlling fertility (in order to get them up to consistently genius human levels) however I'd also keep copying the ones with my intended values into new sims and leaving the old one's running to slow to matter.\\
The idea would be once I had my population with genius level intellect and roughly my values I'd give them access to human tech and get them to work on FAI at accelerated speed. However I would need to interfere a fair amount of tampering in this stage in order to make sure all such research was being done with my knowledge by a single coordinated group who was being as slow and careful as possible with their research.
