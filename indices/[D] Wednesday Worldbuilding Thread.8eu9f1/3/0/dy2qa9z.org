so the soul is the brain. And doesn't need calories. But the soul is still subject of evolution. (honestly, that's not how soul's are supposed to work in mythology, but I can play with that.)

I assume you mean with intelligent species human. Cause elephant bodies or bat bodies would change many things. (Mainly elephants would benefit less, and bats probably more.)

I guess attributes of the soul are something like how nice, how smart someone is and what character they have.

I don't think we would get infinite/super intelligence. Since the species/individuum wouldn't get more information and at some point a higher IQ will not give a better result. Just think you could program a phone to be as good in tic-tac-toe as a super computer. So selection would not prefer higher IQ, but would sort out lower IQ.

The species could be more malleable than humans. If the body/soul connection is easily attacked. Maybe heart massage can't work. Maybe a huge shock (like a dragon looking at me) would mean the soul leaves the body forever. Maybe being depressed is a death sentence.

The only thing that changed, is that the species can outsource the energy cost of information processing. So over a long time it is more likely to have bodily functions reduced and replaced with brain functions, that would normally have higher energy cost. And that only to a finite limit. If hearing isn't selected for, their ears and sound processing will degenerate, since an individuum with bad hearing will be as likely as one with to get children. Maybe no ears is better, since it saves energy. If hearing over 100m distance isn't selected for, they will not hear better than needed.

Like weaker eyes, but better image processing software. Or no eyes instead echolocation (if that is now efficienter).

Let's say they would get the same energy with brain or with soul. They would either store more energy (fat), have a higher population or grow bigger. The last one could increase the avaible calories. (Could get fruits higher up. Kill bigger animals...)

  Some of this "learning by experience" might even be skipped by souls coming "preloaded" with useful information, though that seems statistically less likely to evolve.

That is called instinct. Toddlers fear snakes, spiders and dark alleys. But not guns. I don't see a reason why that shouldn't evolve similar for them.

So what would change:

They would evolve to have less costs for body functions and instead increase the processing.

They would either increase the population (likely) or get bigger bodies with the avaible energy. If it is the second one, the body change will be exaggerated, since with a changed body they will get more energy than before.
