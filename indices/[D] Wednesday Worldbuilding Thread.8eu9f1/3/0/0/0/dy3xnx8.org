I assumed that you were asking what would happen if a human/ape would get access to a soul for mind stuff.

So instinctively knowing learned stuff would only be likely, if [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism][Lamarckism]] is true for souls. (btw we know instinctively math, like where will the ball land and how to place our feets, so we can walk and jump and stand.)
