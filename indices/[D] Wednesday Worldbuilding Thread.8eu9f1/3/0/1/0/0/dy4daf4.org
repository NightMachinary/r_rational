Yeah, I don't really know the details of how this would work; I was just going off of [[/u/SevenTrillionNipples]]'s comment about possibly being fully conscious from conception.

A humanoid species with smaller heads would probably have a gestation period of longer than nine months, since fitting the baby's head through the mother's pelvis is the main reason we're born so underdeveloped.
