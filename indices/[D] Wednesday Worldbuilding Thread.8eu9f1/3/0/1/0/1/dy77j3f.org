The soul doesn't mirror the function and development of a brain exactly. After creation, the underlying architecture acts as a gestalt entity instead of a sophisticated mechanism. So while humans have a period at the beginning of life where this infrastructure is developing and sometimes one at the end where it's breaking down, this species would just always have it, like a computer with variable software but fixed hardware and firmware.
