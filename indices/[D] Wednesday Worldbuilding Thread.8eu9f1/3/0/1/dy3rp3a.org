  The only thing that changed, is that the species can outsource the energy cost of information processing.

Wouldn't the childhood development stage change too? Or would the gathering information and forming conclusions ultimately end up mirroring a human infant's brain development? It seems like there'd be at least some difference between an infant with a brain that's still developing and lacks even basic self-awareness and an infant who's fully conscious but just very na√Øve and uneducated.

That's probably a difference that'd manifest more in culture, though, and I'm not sure whether [[/u/SevenTrillionNipples]] meant to include cultural development, or just biological differences. If things like empathy and impulse-control are innate in the soul, children might be held more accountable for their actions. Then there's the fact that just porting in a standard human mind would probably result in everyone being born insane from nine months in a sensory deprivation chamber, though that's just speculation.
