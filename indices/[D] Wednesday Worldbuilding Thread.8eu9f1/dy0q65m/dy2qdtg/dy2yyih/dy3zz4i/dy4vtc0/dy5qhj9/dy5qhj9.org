But the point is, there is no "universal hypercomputer": Goedel and Turing purged it from the Platonic realm of ideas (or, less poetically, proved that its existence is contradictory).

You can add extra capabilities to an ordinary computer. This makes it, per definitionem, a hypercomputer.

Which capabilities do you add? "All of them" is contradictory: No hypercomputer of capability C will be capable of predicting whether a program written for a C-hypercomputer terminates. Therefore, you need to specify.

I understand where you are aiming with your question: You want to ask: "well, suppose computational power was no constraint". I'm just saying that (1) you probably need to put a little more thought into fleshing out the details of your scenario, (2) the word "hypercomputer" is taken, and it does not mean what you appear to think it does (call it e.g. "friggin OP computer", which is a much more precise formulation of your question).
