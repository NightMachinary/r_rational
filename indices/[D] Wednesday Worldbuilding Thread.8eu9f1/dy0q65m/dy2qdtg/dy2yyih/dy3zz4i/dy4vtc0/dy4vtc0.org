I mean that it's a hypercomputer in that it can do everything a hypercomputer can do, but it's /also/ capable of anything any other computer can do including for instance things like say simulating an infinite quantum multiverse or well /anything/. The constraint here is just that you actually have to figure out how to get it to do what you want. In addition you can't go too overboard with brute force solutions because you don't want to risk creating any UFAI by accident.

As should be rather obvious from the blatantly physically impossible qualities this computer has I'm assuming this computer is just magic and was created ex-nihilo. As for how it was created lets disregard that since it's not really what I'm asking about here. Though it could plausibly have been created through something akin to the bootstrap paradox given the sorts of weird shit you can do with infinite computing.
