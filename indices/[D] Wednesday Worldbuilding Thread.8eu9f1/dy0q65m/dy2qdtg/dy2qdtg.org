What kind of magical computer do you have, precisely?

"Hypercomputer" is just a catch-all phrase for everything that exceeds Turing machines.

For example: A "magical box (TM)", of weight N log(N) gram. You feed it with a number k < N, wait log(k) seconds and, tada, it outputs the longest-running terminating Turing machine, with number < k (when interpreting the description of the machine as an integer).

Awesome, you can now compute the uncomputable and know the unknowable! Also, useless. Also, the magical box of size "N" is a book with N log(N) pages (but in our universe, this book can only be written on human skin by mad Arabs). As Eliezer joked, he would understand a mathematician saying that a single page out of this book was worth more than the entire universe, but he'd still rather take the universe than a page.
