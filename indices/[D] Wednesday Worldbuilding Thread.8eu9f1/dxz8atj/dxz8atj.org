You're in charge of all firefighters for a city which is primarily built of wood on top of wood pilings in a shallow lake. (Laketown if you know LOTR.)

One day, an allied military command arrives at your town and informs you that your town may soon be the location of a large battle, possibly involving flaming arrows and crude gunpowder weapons.

The ally simultaneously implies that your town will be attacked by a firebreathing dragon in an unrelated incident at an unrelated time, either before or after the large battle.

What are the differences between your dragon-response and battle-response plans? When you receive orders from your local civilian command to not let on that there's a dragon about, how do you disguise preparations for the dragon as battle prep, if that is necessary? And seriously, whatthefuckadragon?
