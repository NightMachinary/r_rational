well, I must say buckykat has the right idea, if battle and dragon means many deaths. I wouldn't leave if it is more likely to survive in the town.

So that said. I would try to make the town safer. Should have done that earlier.

- enforce a minimum distance between buildings if possible, for battle make a ring of houses around the rest, as walls.

- put on every house a big barrel to catch rainwater. To be used for washing and putting out fires. If already there tell everyone to not waste it.

- if possible, use fire-resistant paint, or put mud on roofs or put wet clothes on roofs.

- force everyone to make flightpaths clear, remove textils

- try to make it less likely for dragon/army to attack. Like lights out. Putting candles in buckets and put them in remote but visible area. Send out diplomatic group to find out what we could do, to make peace.
