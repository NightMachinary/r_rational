I'd start by making sure it was possible to create fire breaks.

On a lake, that means I'd want an ability to pull out a building's pilings and drop it into a canal, if necessary.

To make sure that's possible, I'd have building owners wrap some heavy rope around the top of their pilings and use the rope to anchor some standardized iron rings (/rope loops if iron is unavailable)

Then, issue all of my fire response teams a winch and a 20' hooked pole. If a fire can't be put put, use the pole to hook your winch onto the relevant pilings and bring the building down.

That should keep fire from spreading via contact with adjacent buildings.

The other concern is that fires can spread when burning stuff (/arrows/dragon fire) lands on someone's roof.

To address this, I'd have building owners get a bunch of rolled up reed mats. We'd keep these in contact with the water, just under the sides of the canals

When the fire bell goes off, civilians should get their mats and unroll the damp reeds into their roofs.
