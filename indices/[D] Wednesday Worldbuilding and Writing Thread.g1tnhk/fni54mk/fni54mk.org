I've worked out (most of) an interesting-seeming magic system. Assuming that the magic system is just another part of how the world works, rather than anything remarkable, how should I go about figuring out what sort of impact it has on culture and the development of civilization? What sorts of questions should I be asking myself?

Relatedly: Are there good resources for something like an overview of the development of human civilization? Useful keywords I should be inserting into search engines?
