You don't have to zero in on any of those, and your magic system won't necessarily interface with them, but that's what I try to get a feel for when I'm thinking about a magic system. The biggest aspects /for magic in particular/ tend to be:

- What are the costs (time, ingredients or reagents, effort, renewable resources, non-renewable resources, initial investment)?
- Who can learn it (hereditary, ritual initiation, access to materials)?
- How much learning does it take to get which rewards?
- What are the biggest /non-replaceable/ impacts of the magic system, i.e. what does it do that either cannot be done by other means at all (ex. mind-reading, weather control) or what can it do so efficiently that nothing else can really compete (ex. teleportation, food production)?
