When you say "descending into anarchy" do you mean the population starting to en masse follow some anarchist philosophy like your top replier seems to understand? Or do you mean more like the Somalia style government isn't strong enough to project power almost anywhere, might makes right warband leaders roam the lands but even they can't be everywhere and small communities self-organize however they can?
