Thanks for the information! I guess to expand on it, I've been reading some very good fantasy web serials recently like the Wandering Inn, the Iron Teeth, Into the Mire, etc. and got inspired to write up some outlines of my own. The story itself is a horror story that follows 4 characters from a kingdom that are all from different walks of life.

The King and the eldest prince have recently been killed in battle after invading a neighboring kingdom that broke a peace treaty. This is leading to major power struggles and a civil war between the King's remaining sons is on the horizon. Peasants are struggling from high taxes to pay for the war and a major famine is becoming increasingly likely thanks to a severe drought. While outside the Kingdoms, vengeful elves have started to spread disease and are waiting to take advantage of the kingdom's weakness.

Suddenly and without warning, all of humanity falls asleep at the same time and they all have the same terrible nightmare that involves vivid depictions of being devoured alive by some kind of alien presence. They awaken to find their bodies changed and filled with the instinctive knowledge of a type of magic. The slow breakdown of society, copious amounts of body horror, monstrous insects showing up, and war ensue as the four characters change along with humanity into something new.

The main reason anarchy ensues is that no one trusts the nobles/government to protect them and this magic means that governments no longer have a monopoly of force. A peasant using this magic can potentially become powerful enough that they can take on a small army and EVERY human being now knows this magic instinctively.

This magic has nasty side effects and huge risks but peasants all over the kingdom were forced to use this magic to fight off elven raids, avoid starvation, and cure a nasty plague spread by the elves. Then the kingdom goes into civil war between the princes and armies try to "forage" near villages only to be beaten back. A peasant revolt ensues that wins but no one really trusts anyone else, there is a lot of conflicting information and rumors, the local church just declared it the end of the world, there are giant insects appearing thanks to the magic everyone is using, and it becomes village against village for a while until the main characters stabilize things by organizing people and getting rid of some of the human monsters who turn into actual monsters using this magic as time goes on.
