I'd definitely advise hanging around wallstreetbets, because they speak almost /entirely/ in jargon, though it's pretty hard to buy shares of something for too low of a price on an open market situation. I'd imagine this would come out of an insider trading situation or private investment situation, where a company authorized the sale of more shares, either through dilution or expanding shareholder stake in the company. That would only reasonably be explained by board member collusion or previously unknown information that the buyer had access to (Perhaps they found damaging information, and promised not to release it for a stake in the company?)
