If you're doing an actual medieval setting, definitely make sure you don't neglect the religious side of things. Religious thought was an utterly massive part of the medieval worldview, and an event like what you're talking about would have been a huge theological crisis as much as anything.

If you're talking about a descent into chaos, the most realistic in my mind would be to have a massive upswell in popular religious movements, with leaders or holy figures promoting new practices that break from existing church doctrine and heirarchy.
