This depends on which type(s) of anarchy you're talking about. For example, with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism][anarcho-syndicalism]], it would be characterized by the commoners starting to organize and forming democratically-run guilds, unions, or syndicates, depending on what you want to call them. The unions would help to ensure the rights of their members, and help to arrange for societal needs in their local community. Furthermore, these unions start building a superorganization, a federation of unions that span the entire kingdom, and possibly beyond, something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo][CNT]]. This organization would begin addressing societal concerns on an even larger scale, effectively supplanting any need for a national government. When it becomes powerful enough, it would start progressively pushing the government to cede power, and the landlords to cede property, aiming to ultimately eliminate the state and capitalism, leaving only a democratic worker's collective. If its demands aren't met, it would declare a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike][general strike]]. Rents and taxes would no longer be paid, workers would stop working for their bosses (though they might still take over workspaces and use them for free), deeds and titles might be seized and burned, etc. The entire country would be reorganized, much like what happened during the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936][Spanish Revolution]]. An uprising of this sort naturally created immense concern among the ruling elites in several European powers, and they ended it with Italy and Germany supporting Spanish fascists to crush the rebellion while the Soviet Union did the same with the Spanish Republicans.

If you're talking about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism][Anarcho-communism]], then it would be similar to the above except with the creation of peasant communes instead of unions. As before, it would be a series of local democratic organizations that join in a federation to supplant any need for a state. Multitudes of such communes would work with each other to gradually encompass the entire working force of the region, much like what happened with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovia][Makhnovia]]. This ended as you might expect, with the government seeing this as a threat and using the army to eliminate it.

If you're talking about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrectionary_anarchism][insurrectionary anarchism]], then the aim would be more like a constant attack on the institutions that the ruling class uses to maintain power. Insurrectionary anarchists aren't necessarily trying to build any formal societal organizations to replace what they're destroying, but rather trying to create informal and ad hoc organizations through a leaderless resistance which essentially turns regions into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone][temporary autonomous zones]]. This could mutate into something more formal if it weakens the ruling class enough, or it could dissolve if an army is brought in, only to return immediately afterwards, creating endless pockets of resistance across the country.

If you're talking about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism][anarcho-primitivism]], it would be similar to insurrectionary anarchism, except that the commoners would be trying to destroy the infrastructure and economic developments which made the kingdom possible in the first place. They'd be demolishing bridges, sabotaging carts and wagons, collapsing mines, setting fires to farmland, ports and ships, pillaging warehouses, tearing down lighthouses, etc. Everything that once gave the kingdom the resources and power that it used to oppress the people would be destroyed with the aim of not just causing the kingdom to collapse, but to also prevent any future kingdom from ever rising from its ashes. They'd be intentionally returning their society to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with all the deaths that would naturally come with such inefficient food gathering techniques (so, obviously, this type of anarchism isn't likely unless conditions for the majority are absolutely horrifying).

So, to answer your question, it's going to depend on what the kingdom looks like. The fact that it's descending into anarchy is a clear indication that most of the population is /fucking done with/ the kingdom, but the exact type of anarchy and how quickly it collapses depends on what the kingdom has been doing to piss people off, and on how effectively it has been isolating the commoners from communicating with each other.
