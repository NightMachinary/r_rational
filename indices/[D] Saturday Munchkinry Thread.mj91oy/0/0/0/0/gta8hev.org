I think you want the travel void over travel water. Precise control over which Lagrange point you can exit might be more versatile than controlling what body of water you exit for interplanetary and interstellar travel because many planets of interest may not have enough water to use the water travel exit as opposed to exiting in orbit or in a Lagrange point. Other than that, great build!

Oh and I added a bit more to the travel description: The ability to enter a plane is free for any plane you are attuned to, but entry conditions are more flexible if you take the travel option. Exit can be done from any plane you in, but is very random and unpredictable for planes you aren't attuned to, semi-random for planes you are attuned to but haven't taken the travel option, and controllable if you do take the travel option) you have an intuition for where in the plane you need to travel to travel to get the exact exit you want.

Edit: and I forgot to say it, but the water creation under pressure exploit is brilliant.
