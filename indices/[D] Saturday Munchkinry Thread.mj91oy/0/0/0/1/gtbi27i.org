That /only/ opens portals in water, though. I mean, sure, it implies that any world you visit has at least a habitable /temperature/, but the downside is that you might need to get close before you even know whether or not there /are/ liquid-water planets in the target solar system.

And water is one of the easiest things for your colony to get hold of if it's not present (as long as your colony has enough Water channellers); so not having it won't break a colony (assuming that everything else it needs is there).
