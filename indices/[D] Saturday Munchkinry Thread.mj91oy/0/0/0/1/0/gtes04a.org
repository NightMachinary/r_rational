  And water is one of the easiest things for your colony to get hold of if it's not present (as long as your colony has enough Water channellers); so not having it won't break a colony (assuming that everything else it needs is there).

Water in the volume that modern agricultural/industrial societies require would not exactly be easy to acquire. Remember that huge amounts of water are used in agriculture, as well as for power plants, and for the chemical and extraction industries; water simply used for cooking, cleaning, drinking, and washing is just a drop in the bucket, relatively speaking.

In 2015, the US used an estimated 322 billion gallons of water /per day/ [[[https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/total-water-use-united-states][Ref]]]. At that time, the US had a population of 320 million, so it worked out to about 1,000 gallons of water per person per day. That might not seem so bad at first glance, but let's do the math.

One water-attuned person making water in 8-hour shifts each day (with up to 60 minutes for lunch/bathroom breaks per shift), working 5 days per week, with 15 sick/holiday/vacation days per year would, over the year, produce an average of 2,873 gal. per day (assuming each hand can produce 315 mL/s). So, yes, water-attuned people could theoretically meet water requirements for the US, but it wouldn't really be practical, as we'll see below.

If water-attuned people were the sole source of water, then 35% of the total US population in 2015 would have needed to be full-time water producers, or 112 million people. This is insane, because in 2015 the US only had 121 million full-time workers [[[https://www.statista.com/statistics/192356/number-of-full-time-employees-in-the-usa-since-1990/][Ref]]], since many people are students, retired, stay-at-home parents, infants/toddlers, disabled, imprisoned, etc. Needing to produce all water to be used would obviously be an enormous hindrance, and it's easy to see how that would quickly cut into the ability to make significant economic progress.
