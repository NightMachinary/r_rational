Hmmmm. Consider that the water used in agriculture doesn't just /vanish/ - there's run-off from fields and so on, much of the water gets trapped in the plants from which it can then be extracted, etc. And with very careful use of the water (I'm thinking almost completely enclosed greenhouses, where water doesn't /leave/ the greenhouse without the head gardener knowing /exactly/ why) you should be able to get by with much lower water usage - at least at first.

Then all the water channelers need to generate is enough to offset whatever is lost to the environment and cannot be recycled.

Let's say that extreme water-scarce agriculture etc. uses 70% of the water that the US uses (I have no idea what the right figure is, but cutting 30% of water use due to extreme scarcity feels possible to me). And let's say that intense recycling efforts mean that only 5% of that water is lost to the environment in the process. (I'm sure it's possible to do better than 5%; my intuition is suggesting that it might be possible to bring it down to 2%, but let's use the more pessimistic figure). This brings you down from 35% of the population needing to be water channelers, to 1.225% of the population (or 3.92 million people out of 320 million). It puts a significant dent in the workforce, yes, but we're no longer looking at 'impossible to found a colony' levels.
