  For reference, solar escape velocity from the surface of the sun is 617.5 km/s, in other words, 2% of the speed of light.

This immediately struck me as implausible, so I did a quick calculation, and 617 of 299,792 km is equivalent to *0.2%* of lightspeed, still significant, but an order of magnitude lower.
