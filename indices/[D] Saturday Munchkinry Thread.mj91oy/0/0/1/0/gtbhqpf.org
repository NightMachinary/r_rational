Hmmm - I /could/ swap out my Air plane's "lungs always full of air" in favour of Void's 'pressure immunities'. Food/water will be a problem indeed...

But let's see how long it would take. Without the speed boost from 'air', it would take a few tens of minutes to travel a few miles - let's say twenty minutes for two miles - and a few hours to travel hundreds of miles - let's say two hours for two hundred miles. So, six times longer spent travelling multiplies the real-world distance by 100.

Proxima Centauri, the closest star, is about 2.5*10^{13} miles away. Given exponential travel times, with twenty minutes covering two miles, I get that travelling to Proxima Centauri will take... uh... around four point seven years.

Huh. Food and water /will/ be needed for a trip of that length.

Speed of sound in air is about six times terminal velocity. So that brings us down to about nine and a half months. Will still need food and water.

Hmmm... if I have a friend with attunement to fire (for heat immunity) and ice (to be able to keep a large ice block frozen even in the Plane of Fire) then we can store our food and water supplies inside the ice block... maybe a team is needed, so that there's always someone awake to hold the block cold (and someone else awake to steer and pull us towards the target - we're all connected with fireproof chains, of course...)
