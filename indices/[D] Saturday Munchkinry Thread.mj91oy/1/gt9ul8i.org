You suddenly and mysteriously gain the ability to convince anyone that sees you that you are the devil.

The ability is active for 666 seconds at a time and has a cooldown of 666 minutes (~11 hours). While active anyone that sees you in person will be instantly convinced that you are the devil, although they can be convinced they were wrong afterwards if you are sufficiently persuasive.

Every 666 hours (~1 month) N new people (where N is the number of 666 hour periods that you have had the ability) must see you in your "devil form" or the ability is turned on permanently until you reach the required amount of people. Note that rollovers from previous "months" count, so 3 people on the first day would last you ~2 months. In addition, each living unique person that sees you increases the duration of your ability by 1 second and reduces the cooldown by 1 minute.

How do you use this ability to maximize profit and minimize the chance that you get murdered by people worried that you are literally the devil?
