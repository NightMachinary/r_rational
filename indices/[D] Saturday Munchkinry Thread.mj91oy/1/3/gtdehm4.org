In what exact sense of "you" do they think "you" are the devil? It seems like an easy way to get sympathy would be to pretend you were being /involuntarily possessed/ by the devil for 666 seconds, but that doesn't reflect badly on you the rest of the time. It might even make people hesitate to kill the devil since by doing so they'd also take the life of the innocent being possessed.
