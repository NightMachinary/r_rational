I can go into acting. Once a day, for eleven minutes at a time, I can play the role (on stage or - preferably - on television) of the devil.

It's a /super/ convincing performance; but since I am clearly playing a role at the time, it's much easier to convince people that it /is/ merely a performance (I can blame it on 'body language'). Being seen playing this role in a /Faust/-like film counts as being seen by people - a /lot/ of people - and drawing in an actor's salary for an /amazingly/ convincing performance gives me plenty of profit.
