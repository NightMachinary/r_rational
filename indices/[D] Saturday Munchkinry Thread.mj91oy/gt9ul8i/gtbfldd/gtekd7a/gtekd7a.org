Only the stage would work; the ability doesn't work via picture or recording. For normal people it only works for sight, although it works via sound for the blind, and those that are both blind+deaf can directly sense the presence of the devil.

I'm also sceptical of the safeness of this. Even assuming that 99% of people change their mind at the end after your ability deactivates and ignore the fact that they are 100% convinced you are the devil the entire time they see you that would still leave multiple people per play that are very very concerned about you being the literal devil, some of whom would probably be willing to do something about it.
