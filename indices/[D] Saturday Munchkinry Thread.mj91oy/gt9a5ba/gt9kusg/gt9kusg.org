Travel through other planes magnifies the /distance/ travelled through the material plane. Not the time. The distance.

Hmmm. So if I have a way to move faster, then I can cover greater distances...

Right. Let's see.

- Attune to Fire: Free

- Boon: Immune to heat (necessary; also free)

- Boon: Heat means I don't need air (1 pt.)

- Boon: Travelling to locations of extreme heat (1 pt.)

- Attune to air (1 pt.)

- Boon: Change air resistance (can fall at the speed of sound, and steer my direction - free. This should speed up my travel through the Plane of Fire no end)

- Channelling: Lungs always full of air (1 pt.) - might be useful

- Attune to Void (2pts.)

- Boon: Kick off invisible walls to change direction (just to help me steer) - free

Total: 6pts.

Now. I can open portals anywhere where there is sufficient heat, and I can get there very fast - and the distance seems to increase exponentially with in-plane distance travelled.

Suns are pretty hot places... so that means I've unlocked a form of interstellar warp drive, right? If someone can supply robotic probes that can survive (and launch themselves) from near the surface of a sun, we could investigate nearby solar systems...
