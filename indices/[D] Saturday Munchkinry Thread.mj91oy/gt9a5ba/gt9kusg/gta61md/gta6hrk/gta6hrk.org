You didn't manage to squeeze any pressure immunities into your list, so you need to carefully target whatever layer of the sun (or other star) has Earth-atmosphere like pressure but other than that, it should work okay. You will need a heat-resistant probe to take with you. Oh and I thought of another problem with longer periods of travel... any food/water you have can't survive the trip intact. Maybe you could keep some pressurized (to prevent boiling) water inside your probe, but it seems like preserving food against extreme heat is another challenge entirely...,

Still good build. How much more could you improve it with 12 points instead of 6?

Edit oh wait, as the other poster described, your probe will get stuck in the star. So good for probing stars, not so good for interstellar travel.
