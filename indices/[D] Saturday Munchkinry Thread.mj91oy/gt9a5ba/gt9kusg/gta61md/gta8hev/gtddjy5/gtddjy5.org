This is true if you have a specific destination in mind scouted in advance with telescopes, and the tech and infrastructure to land and take of... But if things are slightly more primitive and your goal is a colony, the inability to enter without liquid water might be a feature, not a bug. Especially if liquid water is rare. If you travel far enough that the uncertainty of exit covers multiple solar systems, it can act as an automatic search that takes you immediately to a planet in the goldilocks zone, with at least a significantly higher than average chance of having a passable atmosphere. Even better if you can select specifically a salty sea, which more or less requires an atmosphere and water cycle. And if those conditions are rare, that actually makes it easier to make sure you exit in the same place every time having only that option, instead of hundreds of lagrange points and orbits around bodies that cant support a colony distracting you. And you save a lot of mass on only having to go out of and into the sea, which you can do using some ropes, rocks, and cork, instead of having to be able to launch things or survive reentry every time.

Once you have more infrastructure, and other people with specialized builds (specifically water+fire), you should be able to skip all the extra travel steps and travel the entire way between the colonies in the plane of water alone, by frictionlessly shooting a submarine through a tunnel of superheated steam.
