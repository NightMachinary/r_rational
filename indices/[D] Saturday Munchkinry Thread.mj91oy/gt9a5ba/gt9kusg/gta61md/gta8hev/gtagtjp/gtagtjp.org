That works up until you want to go to the surface of the planet with an atmosphere, where you'll quickly find that the fins point you forward even though you'd really prefer to reverse thrust. You crash land, surviving the impact pressure, but you'd be stuck unless/until you can figure out how to repair the rocket without any tools or infrastructure to do so.

In version 2, you could design some mechanism to rotate the body of the rocket relative to the fins, or add a front rocket nozzle with valves for front and back nozzles. This would make it so that the engine points opposite of the fins (towards the ground while landing), and then you'd have to make sure you have a couple of windows to the sides of each rocket nozzle so you can see the ground on approach. That would work right up until you visit a planet with upwards of 1.5 g's of surface gravity. Eventually, while approaching it to land, gravity would exceed your thrust and you'd accelerate uncontrollably towards the surface, ending up similar to the previous situation.

In version 3, you could add a gravitometer and a radar range-finder to estimate surface gravity before making a landing attempt. This version would finally work, as long the instruments are accurate, though all of the added equipment will make the rocket heavier and you'd need a modern level of technology to build it.

I kind of prefer the approach of automatically discovering fairly habitable worlds, and being just about 100% certain of being able to leave at any time.
