That's going to leave you horrendously deep in a solar gravity well, so you'd need a ridiculous amount of âˆ†v to get out. For reference, solar escape velocity from the surface of the sun is 617.5 km/s, in other words, 2% of the speed of light. Merely building a rocket which could do that would be impressive, fitting it through your portal would be even more impressive, but then heat-shielding it enough to survive being launched out of a star's corona would be mind-boggling.

A better approach might be to attune to water first (free), then get the water traveling boon (free), the immunity to crushing pressures and cold (1 pt.), the boon to avoid needing to breathe (1 pt.), and the channeling ability to produce streams of water (1 pt.). Then attune to void (1 pt.) and get the immunity to negative/low pressure (free), and finally attune to fire (2 pt.) to get the immunity to damage to heat (free).

Note that the water channeling ability may be underrated. Presumably, it produces a constant volume of water per second, regardless of surrounding conditions like temperature or pressure (so being deep underwater doesn't reduce your ability to produce water). This means it can potentially be quite energetic. If you build a cast iron pressure vessel large enough to get inside of, you could potentially generate a surprising amount of thrust.

For example, suppose each stream normally produces 5 gallons per minute (315 mL/s - moderate to strong flow from a garden hose) initially moving in a cylinder of 3 cm in diameter at about 44 m/s (98 mph, not fast enough for power washing). Now suppose both streams have to pass through a nozzle at the back which is only 0.25 cm in diameter. At this point, you'd have 630 mL/s blasting out the back at 12,834 m/s. The mass flow rate remains the same, but increased pressure increases the velocity of the water by nearly 300x. This would generate a thrust of 8,085 N, enough to lift about 1,800 lb. against the force of gravity. Outfit the pressure vessel with a pressure-rated hatch at the top for an entrance/exit, a very thick glass porthole at the front, a pilot's seat, a few side nozzles and control levers for the pilot to manage steering, some fins at the back to improve atmospheric stability, and you now have a tiny one-man water rocket with infinite fuel.

With the boons I listed, the pilot could open a portals in water. They could then survive navigating from the plane of water, through the plane of fire, through the plane of air, through the plane of void, and then build up impressive speeds in the frictionless void environment to potentially allow for even intergalactic travel in reasonable time frames thanks to the exponential distance benefits of planar travel. When ready to return to the material plane, the pilot can just open the exit hatch, point his hands at each other, and start creating a small glob of water which would encompass the vehicle, then make the entry portal, pass through it, and end up at some distant planet or moon with large bodies of liquid water.

Two-seater rockets of this sort could be used to transport people to such planets and moons to form permanent colonies. Passengers would need to be attuned to water so that breathing and pressure aren't problems, but they'd still have four points they could spend on other things that might be useful for the development of the colony.
