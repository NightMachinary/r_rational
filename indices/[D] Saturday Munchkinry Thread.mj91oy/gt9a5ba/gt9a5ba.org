Extraplanar powers. There are planes tied to various physical substances and esoteric concepts. You can "attune" to these planes enabling you to to channel material/concepts from these planes, gain various boons from them, gain extrasensory perceptions, and open portals to use them for rapid world exploration (you can physically enter them and then exit at point physically connected to the real world and associated with the plane's concept/material, although you may need boons to survive hostile planes):

First plane you attune to is free. Each additional attunement cost one more point than the last one (so 1 point for your 2nd plane, 2 points for your 3rd plane, 3 points for you 4th, etc.). The first option you pick from each plane you are attuned to is free, but each additional option you pick costs one point. You have... let's say 6 points to work with, although I wouldn't mind seeing builds done with 3, 9, and 12 points also.

Traveling: Planes connect to each other according to esoteric rules that don't quite correspond to movement in 3 dimensions. Time traveled in the plane very loosely corresponds to distance in the real world: A few tens of minutes traveled will tend to result in exits within a few miles and/or that fit the exit definition very well, a few hours traveled results in exits within hundreds of miles and exits that only loosely fit the exit requirements (or tens of miles with exits that vaguely fit the exit requirements), a day traveled can cause you to exit anywhere in the world in very specific locations that only vaguely fit the exit requirements. If you haven't traveled far enough to have a good exit condition location (for instance you entered through the plane of water in the middle of the desert), you either exit exactly where you entered or in a completely random location randomized within 500 miles. It takes a few hours of travel through a plane to each an "adjacent" plane ("adjacency" rules described below for each plane).

The ability to enter a plane is free for any plane you are attuned to, but entry conditions are more flexible if you take the “travel” option. Exit can be done from any plane you are in, but is very random and unpredictable for planes you aren't attuned to, semi-random for planes you are attuned to but haven't taken the travel option, and controllable if you do take the travel option) you have an intuition for where in the plane you need to travel to travel to get the exact exit you want. Travel between adjacent planes is easiest if you are attuned to both of them, doable if you are attuned to at least one of them, and very hard/unreliable if you are attuned to neither of them.

Some of the major material planes:

Fire: An endless realm of flame. Traveling "upwards" eventually takes you to the plane of air. Traveling downwards takes you to the plane of magma. There is gravity and no solid support, but the updraft from the flame can take you upwards unless you minimize your drag in which case you fall downwards. Traveling towards boiling steam eventually takes you to the plane of water (this method is tricky and unreliable). Traveling towards less active fire eventually takes you to a living plane (flesh/blood/wood), but this method is tricky and unreliable.

- Boon: you are immune to damage from heat
- Boon: Exposure to heat reduces your need to breathe, a small fire against your skin is just barely noticeable in the increased anaerobic exercise stamina, being completely engulfed in flame means you don't have to breath at all.
- Traveling: you can open entry portal to this plane wherever you have access to a large fire and can exit to points in the world where there is extreme heat: volcanoes, forest fires, smelters, etc.
- Channeling: you can generate small flames from your hands or mouth. They don't initially need fuel or oxygen but once leaving contact with you they do.
- Channeling: You can heat yourself at will, enough to stay alive and comfortable surrounded by freezing water.
- Sense: you can see infrared, you have a vague sense of distant (10-100 miles) large sources of extreme heat (smelters, forest fires, volcanoes)

Water: An endless and cold ocean. Faintly lit. Traveling in the direction that feels "coldest" will take you to the plane of ice. Travel in the direction that feels hottest will eventually take you to the plane of Fire. Traveling down through the thickest silt eventually takes you to the solid earthy bottom and the plane of Earth.

- Boon: You are immune to crushing pressures and cold (but not freezing) temperatures.
- Boon: You have no drowning reflex, you don't have to breathe when your lungs are filled with water.
- Traveling: You can open portals in water. You can open exit portals to deep locations, at least 200 ft. deep.
- Channeling: you can generate small streams of salt or fresh water from your mouth/hands.
- Sense: You can feel the water in pipes, plants, and living tissues when close. You can sense bodies of water from a distance.

Air: an endless volume of air with faint traces of clouds. Brightly lit from below. You continuously fall in this plane. Directing your fall to the thickest clouds takes you to the plane of water. Directing your fall to the hottest updrafts takes you to the plane of fire. Traveling towards lower pressure take you to the Plane of Vacuum/Void.

- Boon: you can change your air resistance at will, allowing you to control your tumble/movement when in free fall, and change your terminal velocity anywhere from 12 mph to the speed of sound.
- Boon: You are immune to low pressures and wind chill (but not cold in general).
- Traveling: You can open entry portals when wind speeds reach at least 30 mph. You can also open entry portals while falling at your current terminal velocity. You can open exit portals to locations in the upper atmosphere, or closer locations
- Channeling: You can generate a continuous supply of air inside your lungs. Enough to keep you breathing and have a bit to spare.
- Sense:

Earth: Endless caves and crevices occasionally sand, clay, or soil. Unlit. Traveling through the most submerged sections eventually takes you to the plane of water. Traveling to the coldest sections takes you to the plane of Ice.

- Boon: You can mold "earth" ranging from solid rock to loose sand as if they were wet clay, moving them and then sticking them into place in the new shape.
- Boon: You can squeeze through any crevice large enough to fit your head into.
- Travel: you can enter this plane from any underground location. You can exit to deep caves and/or place deep underground.
- Channeling: You can generate various types of common "earth" (sands, clays, soils, and rocks) in your hands at an average rate of a gram a second, in quantities as small as single grains at a time or as large as fist-sized rocks. You can switch types of earth every
- Sense: You have an innate sense of direction and location in caves, able to mentally sense and map them around you for several miles and sense key features such as toxic air, water, and exits to the surface

Ice: Endless crevices and glaciers. Faintly lit

- Boon: you are immune to the cold, even below freezing temperatures
- Boon: you can change the state of water with a touch in large quantities at once (enough to make a person size passage through the ice at walking speed)
- Travel you can enter this plane with a localized drop in temperature: for example an ice old bath. You can exit to place of extreme cold or localized cold: Cold mountaintops, industrial walk-in freezers, etc.
- Channeling: You can cool yourself at will, down to just above freezing. You can cool yourself rapidly enough and precisely enough to be immune to extreme heat.
- Senses: You can sense area of coldness.

Magma: Endless shifting lava flows. Traveling towards updrafts of flame takes you to the plane of fire. Traveling towards where the magma cools takes you to the plane of Earth

- Boons (same boons as Earth or Fire)
- Travel: You can enter through molten metal or Earth. You can exit in any location with molten material (smelters and volcanoes)
- Channeling: You can heat yourself at will. Enough to survive
- Channeling: You can generate molten rock at will, around a gram a second
- Senses: Same as earth

Void/Vacuum: An endless empty expanse with no gravity, no air, and faint light. Traveling towards faint traces of air will take you to the plane of air.

- Boons: you can break conservation of momentum and equal and opposite forces and apply force by pushing/kicking as if there was an invisible solid floor/wall. You can do this once every 10 seconds.
- Boons: you are immune to negative/low pressure.
- Travel: You can enter this plane when the pressure is extremely low (basically vacuum, although a perfect vacuum isn't required). You can exit this plane in low earth orbit, Geo-synchronous orbit, or at a Lagrange point.near earth.
- Channeling: you can create a sphere of vacuum near your hands that sucks away all air.
- Senses: you can sense vacuum. When surrounded by vacuum, you can sense even faint non-vacuum like air.
