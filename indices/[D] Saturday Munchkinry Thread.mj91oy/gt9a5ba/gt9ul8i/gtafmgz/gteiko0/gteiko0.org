While it is likely true that there /are/ some people (based just on the law of large numbers) that really do worship Satan finding them would be very difficult as the vast majority of self described Satanists don't really believe in or worship Satan. If you go around to all of them and turn your ability on you might find some, but it might also get you mudered by scared people afterwards.

They don't have to see your face, all that is required is seeing you as a distinct individual (eg. if you were laying down under blankets they wouldn't know, but if you just had a sheet over you like a ghost while standing up they would know).
