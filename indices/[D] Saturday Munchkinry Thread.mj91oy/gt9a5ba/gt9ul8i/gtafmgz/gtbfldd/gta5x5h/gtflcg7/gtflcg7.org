For the average person the only information they gain when they see you would be "That dude over there is totally the literal devil/Lucifer Morningstar/Satan" for as long as they see you.

However, if they lack the foundation to understand that means (eg. they know nothing or almost nothing about Christianity) then they will instinctively know you are the devil and everything the devil represents based on the collective knowledge of Satan of every living human on the planet.

Thus its practically impossible to game or manipulate the information your power gives them without significantly changing the entire religious structure of humanity.

The cult leader idea is good though, and although chancy would have a real chance of playing out.
