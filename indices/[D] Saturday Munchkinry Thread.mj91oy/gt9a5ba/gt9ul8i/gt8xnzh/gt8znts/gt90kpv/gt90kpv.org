Have not, I'll check those out! Uh, I don't really have rec's. It was /kind/ of tongue in cheek, because most of these threads are posed questions/scenarios that the subsequent comments try to solve/answer.

Those are still fun because 100% of the time the shit I come up with is peanuts compared to what some of the comments do haha. But it's still fun to lurk this thread every week!

Edit: premise on those two look really interesting! Thanks for those rec's ü§ùü§ù
