It's something that I'll probably work on in edits. Part of the problem is that characterization needs to develop through dialog and actions, and there's not currently that much room given that Henry has his fathers (who taught him everything he knows) or people who he's hiding things from, which makes the needle a little more difficult to thread - and I think that there's already too many chapters prior to Henry and Sofia meeting, so don't particularly want to beef up those sections. I'll think on it.
