It wasn't quite immersion breaking for me, but I agree that [[/u/alexanderwales]] should show some more hints of later-story Henry in early-story Henry when he starts working on edits. Part of it is that we have very few opportunities to see Henry interact with others his age until Sofia and him meet up, so that part of his character may not have even developed until he reached that part of the story and felt the dynamics between the two solidify.

I'd say some of that playful arrogance should probably come out through his interactions with Nathan or his fathers so that it's not quite as sudden a shift from his earlier quiet and reserved demeanor.
