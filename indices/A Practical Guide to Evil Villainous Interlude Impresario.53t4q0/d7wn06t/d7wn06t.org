I tried starting this a while ago but the prose and the huge run-on paragraphs put me off. Just in the first chapter the author used "grunted" instead of "said" /four freaking times/, and it doesn't stop there. I hate it when the prose keeps breaking your immersion. The author should really read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/4n5rhl/grammar_in_speech_in_speech/][this guide to grammar in speech]] that was linked here awhile ago.

Does it get better? Should I give it another try?
