First, mentioning Newton is a bit of strawman argument, he lived well before Darwin and he didn't any evidence to look at.

Second, for a scientist to believe in creationism means wilfully ignoring evidence that conflict with their faith. That's not following the scientific method and a scientist who disregard any evidence that do not support their conclusion is not a real scientist.

In the case of Michael Carroll, he doesn't even have a defence of saying that it's not his field. He wrote a book about creationism so that means that he had to research it, had to be confronted with the evidence against creationism and discarded it. There's no way this can be called science. And he is either not a real scientist or he doesn't believe in creationism and lack integrity.

Now note, that I did not mention religion. There can be scientist who are religious in that there's no evidence that there isn't a godlike entity. So a scientist who is Christian or Jewish or any other religion but doesn't believe things that are disproved by evidence can be a real scientist.
