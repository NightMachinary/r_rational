Does Newton qualify as a "REAL scientist"? Because, you know, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Isaac_Newton][he believed in Creationism.]]

I'm tempted to utter phrases ending in "no true Scottsman," since maybe your own narrow jargon will cut through better than honest conversation. But lets opt for the latter anyway.

According to Pew, [[http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/][just over half of scientists believe in a "higher power" and about a third say they believe in "God."]] I guess Pew forgot to check with you to see whether this disqualifies those surveyed from being scientists.

One can do the work of a scientist while failing to be a "Rationalist." Nearly every scientist in existence has, though I'll grant you MIRI and friends have absorbed a few people with actual training in recent years. One can be a scientist, perhaps even the greatest scientist of all time, without sharing the same dogma as Richard Feynman, Eliezer Yudkowsky, or you. One can even be a scientist without possessing only purely rational beliefs.

Few humans are entirely rational. Few humans are likely even mostly rational. Most of the scientists we know of are human. Does one's status of a scientist really come down to an ideological purity test where some beliefs get the okay from this community and others don't, based largely on ... what exactly? How offensive you find the beliefs? How well you can rationalize that these beliefs are inferior to the ones commonly held in the present day? Maybe you give Newton a pass for his era but this Carroll person doesn't get one because he has committed a sin against current dogma?

We all hold beliefs which are complete shit and wouldn't stand up to the least scrutiny, if only we even knew to apply scrutiny to them and possessed the honesty to do so. A willingness (though not perhaps a propensity) to hold beliefs which are contrary to those of the seething masses would, if anything, make me respect an individual more, not less. As a scientist and as a human.

Edit: Some phrases which, by analogy, you might have sympathy for.

- "He's not a scientist, he's a communist!"

- "He's not a scientist, he's a Jew!"

Actually, even the Nazi's didn't quite (maybe?) go this far. They bemoaned Einstein's [[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/books/review/einsteins-jewish-science-by-steven-gimbel.html?_r=0][jewish physics]], but at least they still called it physics.

Part of the scientific ethos is the solidarity of transnational, trans-ideological unity in the pursuit of truth which doesn't know such arbitrary borders. Many less Rational individuals than yourself have seen, appreciated, and abided by this ethos. If Rationalists can't, then it is they who will find it difficult to do the work of science.
