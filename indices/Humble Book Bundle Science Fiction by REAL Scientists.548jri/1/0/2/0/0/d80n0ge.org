  I'm sorry, did I say somewhere that a scientist must devote all of his actions to the pursuit of truth? If so you're right to rebut me and I apologize.

I very much doubt that the author presents the books in a way that doesn't imply that he's engaging in a "pursuit of truth". Discussions of the origins of the universe tend to have that context. Can you really blame me for holding him to a decent standard in this case?

  Oh okay. So you admit that you do not know anything about this man's work. He could be a leader of his field and you would not know it, and would still slander him for his (completely unrelated) beliefs.

He would still be deserving of ridicule for believing in silly things. In fact, if he was a leader of his field, that would be all the more reason to mock him, since then he wouldn't even have an excuse of not being among the smartest people on the planet. I'd still acknowledge him as a scientist, of course. But I would be mildly surprised that he was a leader in his field, as opposed to some non-creationist person.

  It's quite a leap from "This guy believes something which I think is stupid! Maybe he is stupid!! My confidence has not been inspired by this fact!" to
#+end_quote

Evidence is evidence. If you restrict the definition of "real scientist" to people who actually make breakthroughs and significantly advance the fields, then it's not that unreasonable to say that being a creationist is decently strong evidence for not being a "real scientist".

  Pretending even that what you're doing isn't some tribal status dance, who the exactly are you and why do you compelled to '[decide] if they're worthy of the title "scientist" '?
#+end_quote

Surely I'm entitled to constructing the reference class "scientist" inside my own head in a way that I feel will be most informative and useful for me? Including the sort of person who writes books arguing for creationism (if that's all I know about them) doesn't seem like something that will serve to make the class more useful to me, so I don't. If you're going to be using coarse labels and stereotyping people (which is inevitable with a human brain), then you might as well try to make labels as informative as possible.
