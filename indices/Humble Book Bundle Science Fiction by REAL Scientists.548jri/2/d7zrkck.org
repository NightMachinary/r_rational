I can't guarantee that the books are rational, but since you guys often enjoy hard science fiction I thought you all would appreciate the chance at these books. It's a bundle pack of science fiction books written by scientists where readers are certain to learn some scientific facts disguised as an entertaining story. The books even include fairly lengthy appendixes which explicitly explain the scientific concepts used in the books.

For the people who has never heard of the Humble Bundle before, it's an organization which sells games and books with a portions of all sales going to charity. Every two weeks or so, they come out with a Book Bundle where you can buy some or all of the books at certain prices.

Better hurry, today on September 23rd, there's only 4 days left for this bundle!
