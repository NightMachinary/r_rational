I would really take any scientific explanation I read from a guy who believes in creationism with a grain of salt.

That said, I've looked at the other authors and the rest seems legit (or at least do not have explicit red flags like that). It's just that I'm very surprised that a publisher who decides to start a series of books written by real scientist would publish that Creationist guy as part of that series.
