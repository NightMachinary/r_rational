Now /that/ is a much better reason to take issue with this author being pushed as a "real scientist."

It's also rather disappointing, especially when there are so many top of the line scifi writers who DO have training in technical science disciplines.

In no particular order and allowing both computer programmer and mathematician to count as "scientist", off the top of my head there's:

- Mark Lawrence

- Peter Watts

- Vernor Vinge

- Greg Egan

- Ken Liu (maybe? Wikipedia says he worked in "technology")

- Ted Chiang (maybe? Has a degree in computer science and does technical writing)

And I would highly recommend the work of all of the above. It'd be nice to have a broader list of such authors. Anyone have any suggestions?
