  Actually, even the Nazi's didn't quite (maybe?) go this far. They bemoaned Einstein's jewish physics, but at least they still called it physics.

  Part of the scientific ethos is the solidarity of transnational, trans-ideological unity in the pursuit of truth which doesn't know such arbitrary borders. Many less Rational individuals than yourself have seen, appreciated, and abided by this ethos. If Rationalists can't, then it is they who will find it difficult to do the work of science.

Writing a book series on creationism for children doesn't exactly qualify as a "pursuit of truth" by my standards. I mean, I would certainly judge the person by his actual professional scientific achievements as far as deciding if they're worthy of the title "scientist", if I knew of any. But, in the absence of actual scientific results to be used for that purpose, him writing books on creationism certainly doesn't inspire confidence.
