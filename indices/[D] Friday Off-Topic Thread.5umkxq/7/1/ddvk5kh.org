How small is your flat and how high is your tolerance for mess? I think it's easy to underestimate how much impact cats actually have on a space, especially if you have to have a litter box for them. (Dogs too I imagine, but I'm more of a cat person and have never owned a dog).

Also if you do get a pet, consider getting an adult pet from a shelter. Kittens and puppies are adorable, but they're also less predictable in how they grow up than a pet that's already grown and you might e.g. find out that this adorable little kitten you've got grows up to be an adorable big cat with a bladder problem who likes peeing everywhere (source: That wasn't much fun)
