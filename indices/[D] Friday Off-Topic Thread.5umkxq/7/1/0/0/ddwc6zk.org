Things cats I have lived with have done, in no particular order:

- Decided that my sweaters would make a great nest and dragged them all off under a bed
- Decided that my sweaters were delish and chewd great big holes in them
- Pissed over all the furniture
- Pissed on me
- Vomited all over the carpet
- Spread their cat litter everywhere
- Spread their food everywhere
- Completely destroyed door frames because they make a great scratching post
- Completely destroyed sofas because they make a great scratching post
- Knocked over water glasses all over the room (resulting in both water and broken glass) because the foolish human whose glass it was was looking the other way
- Probably many other things I'm temporarily forgetting

Cats are low mess if you have a lot of space and they are indoor/outdoor cats (though some of the above comes from indoor/outdoor cats I've lived with too). When you're cooped up in a small flat with a cat that can't get out, they're really not /that/ low impact.

ETA: Just discovered that our cats (who are indoor/outdoor) have vomited all over the dining room table. Thanks cats.
