Just moved into a new apartment with my friend, and we want to get either a cat or a small dog, but we have to pick which one and agree on it. I've never owned a pet before, he has.

There's a dog park right across from our apartment, and I would assume that dogs are much more loving/fun/active, plus a dog would be a great reason to go on walks since I don't get a great amount of exercise. I'd worry about the dog barking, as the walls are pretty thin.

An indoor cat seems like it would be a better fit for our small apartment, and I expect they're less work, but every cat I've interacted with seems like a little furry alien with impossible to understand motives.

We're leaning towards getting a cat once we're all settled in. Anyone have an opinion, or have advice to offer to a first-time pet owner? I've done very little research into what pet ownership involves.
