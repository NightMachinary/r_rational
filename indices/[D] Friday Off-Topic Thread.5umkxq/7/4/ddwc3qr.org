We've had a greyhound for about a year now. They're very good dogs for apartments - don't need much exercise, sleep about as long as cats do. So you're not stuck getting a small dog, any non-active breed is good.

Only had cats before that. Not sure which I like better, owning the two pets is a very different experience. The dog takes more work of course, she needs a 20 minute walk every day (play POGO/Ingress and that makes it fun), but you really should be exercising so it might be good incentive (not fair on the dog if you don't commit). Give her a bath every three months or so (when we notice she's stinky) at a self-serve dogwash or just outside with the hose. Feeding takes the same amount of time. If you've got an indoor cat, the litter box is a pain to scoop. Dog can be trained to go outside and I've made a habit of scooping the poop when I go through the back yard every morning with my bike on the way to work. If your cat goes outdoors it will poop outside and bury it so that's the absolute easiest from a poop point of view.

Dogs are much more biddable, can do tricks and stuff. The best thing about the dog is that she is /SO HAPPY TO SEE US/. You know that old joke, "what's the difference between a new dog and a new husband? after a year, the dog's still excited to see you"? This dog is so extremely happy to see us, goes crazy when it's time for walkies (you'd think we didn't walk her every day the way she goes on!), and just seems more intelligent - not because it is a more intelligent animal (probably) but because this animal has been selected for generations to really like people.

Dogs can be more destructive though, and especially if you get a rescue dog you can't be sure of its past, triggers, the exact breeds that go into it, etc. I don't know if I'd get a non-greyhound dog because greyhounds are the venn diagram of "purebred, low effort dogs that basically come off an assembly line" and "desperately need homes". (Oh, and greyhounds don't really bark! Ours has barked on maybe 12 occasions total since we've had her, and that's 2-3 barks, only for attention, never because she's spotted something...)

Hope that's helpful!
