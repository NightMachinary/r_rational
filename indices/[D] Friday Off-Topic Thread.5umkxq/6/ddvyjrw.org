/Very/ irksomely, the motherboard of my new computer (the only one I've built so far) has died. See [[https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128651][all these one-star reviews]]?

In addition to ordering a new (non-Gigabyte) motherboard, I also bought copies of the two books that I attempted to discuss [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ki3ey][here]]. I'll make a detailed post about them after they arrive and I get a chance to re-read them for the first time in /several/ years.
