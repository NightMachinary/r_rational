  There seems to be a common feature in certain kinds of psychological models where the latter "stages" are often highly questionable and more reflections of the authors own opinions on the matter than fundamental facts about the human mind.

Oh yeah, I definitely noticed that. There are a few places in the article where the author goes "And this type of thinking is a way people consistently disagree with me and are wrong".

  I think you shouldn't buy to much into the idea that this sort of model will grant you any sort of massive insight

Aw man.

Seriously though, it does feel like a model to explore. There are a lot of ideas (n+1 being mistaken for n-1, the monism-dualism dichotomy) there that resonate with me as patterns I've observed before without putting a name on them, in way Maslow's hierarchy never did (although I guess observing Maslow's hierarchy "in action" is harder than observing patterns in everyday relationships), and I do feel I could make predictions because these patterns are pretty consistent.

But yeah, stage 5 seems mostly defined as "like 4, except better and without those pesky postmodernist ideas" in the article, and the whole thing seems ironically inflexible, "this is the way things are"; if I'm using the article's language, it's systematic and not fluid, even though the contents of the article explain fluidity is the best thing ever.

I dunno. Maybe I could find someone who has already refined these ideas, or just take them with a grain of salt ("Trying Too Hard to Fit the Data Into my Model" is a thing).
