So I've been thinking a lot about self-awareness and ideas and epistemology and stuff, and through a SSC post I stumbled upon that article: [[https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/]]

This feels like a big piece of the puzzle. Like, I already knew/suspected/felt some of it, but I've never thought about it as a coherent theory before. And it's like... I feel that if I understood these concepts, it would probably increase my understanding of social situations, philosophy and myself by several orders of magnitude. Anyone here has ever had that impression?

Also, what do you think of the article itself? Some parts of it sound pretty shaky, but again, I don't remotely understand this enough to tell. It seems to assume, for instance, that people consistently go through each phase one by one, and that a variety of psychological traits (self awareness, relationships, work ethics) can be strongly predicted by what phase they're at.
