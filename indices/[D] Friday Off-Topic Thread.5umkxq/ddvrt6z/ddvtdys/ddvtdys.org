  It's also interesting to see sureness in votes. Of course, your typical Le Pen voter would never consider changing his mind based on new evidence, or he wouldn't be voting Le Pen in the first place.

That's pretty uncharitable. Another viewpoint would be that some voters are pretty sure they won't meet new compelling evidence at all, and that all candidates will mostly stay the same and keep the same positions, stupid debates about colonialism aside.
