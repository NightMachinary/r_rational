I know some people here read Quests (either on SV, SB or some other place), so I thought I should point you all to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/][A Destiny of Strife]]. It's a Quest where you play as a Hollow from Bleach, starting off as a basic one in the city and evolving from there. At the moment, the players have finally hit Adjuchas and are gathering an army to conquer the entirety of Hueco Mundo.

I really like the quest because Hollows are, for lack of a better term, soul-eating demons. Yet somehow, the GM for the quest was able to straddle the line between edgy grimderp and dumb whiteknighting, writing a compelling and sympathetic group of sociopathic mass murders. Seriously, it's great. Check it out.

Anyway, the reason I'm saying this is that one of the players' goals is to create a functioning Hollow Society, akin to Soul Society for those who read bleach. We finally hit the point where we can start designing such a society and started a google doc for it (which I won't link due to brigading reasons; you can find it fairly easily by reading through the story).

If anyone is interested in reading about or helping to create a society for soul-eating demons, there's always room.
