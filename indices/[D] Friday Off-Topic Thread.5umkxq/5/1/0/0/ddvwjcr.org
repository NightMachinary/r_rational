Not the Left: Macron. He said [[http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2017/article/2017/02/15/macron-qualifie-la-colonisation-de-crime-contre-l-humanite-tolle-a-droite-et-au-front-national_5080331_4854003.html][(link)]] that the French colonization of Algeria was a "crime against humanity" and that it was "barbaric" in an interview. He went on: "colonization is part of French history. It's a part of the past that we must not shirk away from. We must confront this by apologizing for it to those to whom we did it." roughly translated.

The UMP/LR Candidate, Fillon, responded by saying such was "unworthy of a candidate for President of the Republic" and "Not long ago, Mr. Macron found colonization had positive aspects. These statements show us that Emmanuel Macron doesn't have any spine. He simply says that which his listeners want to hear"
