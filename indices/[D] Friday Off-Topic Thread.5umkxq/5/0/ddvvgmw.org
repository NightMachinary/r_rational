  I'm astonished that a quarter of PS voters would stay home rather than help Macron win over Le Pen.

Call it the Clinton Inevitability Effect: when your second-choice is viewed as the inevitable winner, you feel more comfortable making a Moral Gesture by not actually helping them get that victory, to Send the Message about how they're disappointing their ideological flank.

  Melenchon's guys, though, I get it: Macron is in the pocket of the banks, and this really turns people off.

Well, there's also the fact that most of the Western world has had a /decade/ now of bank-dominated austerity politics. While I personally am a radical socialist, I think that Europe made a /godawful/ move by not allowing for any degree of Keynesianism or deficit social democracy within its mainstream this past decade. And by "godawful", I mean it's empowering the far-right and the Putin pawns.

You can't hold people down in this kind of social crisis forever and expect that they won't rebel. You have to give them a rational, mainstream way back towards a decent life.
