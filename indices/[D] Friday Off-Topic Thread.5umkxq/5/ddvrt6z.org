Exciting news everyone, about the French election. New polls are in, and with them, new terror and horror about Le Pen's chances for victory. Also included are some more detailed things about the second round:

From [[http://cdn1-new-parismatch.ladmedia.fr/var/ifop/16-02-2017.pdf]] here are some important charts:

So, some sad news: Macron has bled off some votes. Just one week ago it was Le Pen at 26%, Macron at 21%, and Fillon at 17.5%. Now we see Fillon rallying and bringing back some people who liked Macron, as well as as some (but not all) of voters who left him for Bayrou. Hamon and Melenchon are still too low to have a real shot at the run-off.

It's also interesting to see sureness in votes. Of course, your typical Le Pen voter would never consider changing his mind based on new evidence, or he wouldn't be voting Le Pen in the first place. A majority (~60%) of Fillon and Melenchon voters are the same way, which makes sense given their radical positions. Hamon's voters are still somewhat on the fence, with half of them saying they may still change their minds, and Macron's voters remain uncertain, perhaps because many of them are UMP defectors, perhaps because Macron is already getting ready to service the banks and people are worried about that.

Looking at the runoff, you see basically that Macron is unattractive to the far left and right. Half of Melenchon voters would abstain in a Macron-Le Pen runoff. 9% (!!!) would vote for /Le Pen!?/ Wow, fuckin populists am I right. Hamon's voters would mostly get in line, with 70% voting for Macron and 6% for Le Pen in a runoff. Macron would supposedly lose 4% of his own voters in a runoff, which is probably the margin of error for this poll. Bayrou's voters would mostly get behind Macron, and Fillon's voters, those that remain at least, would vote 45% for Macron, 26% for Le Pen, and 29% stay home.

I'm astonished that a quarter of PS voters would stay home rather than help Macron win over Le Pen. Melenchon's guys, though, I get it: Macron is in the pocket of the banks, and this really turns people off. It's interesting to see Bayrou's voters included in this poll. I guess nowadays he has enough of them that you see it happening, but I know little about the guy. Also, I'm surprised that The Greens still haven't put their support behind Hamon, who is pretty good on these things. Usually there's some sort of horse-trading and things are worked out.
