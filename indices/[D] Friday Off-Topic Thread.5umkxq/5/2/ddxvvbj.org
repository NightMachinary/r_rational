The French election is a rather depressing topic for me right now. I really hope that Lepen doesn't get elected but I'm worried that she will. I like Hamon but of course thanks to Hollande's stellar performance he has no chance.

Since I live abroad, I have to travel 4 hours each way to go to my consulate to vote, so I'm unlikely to vote during the first round but I will definitely go there in the second round to vote against Lepen....
