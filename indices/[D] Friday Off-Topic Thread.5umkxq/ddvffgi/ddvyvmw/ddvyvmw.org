That's pretty awesome. I keep thinking there should be an organized effort to make low cost laboratories (and/or factories), following a bootstrap sequence from an inexpensive starting point.

One rather crazy thing I found is that it is apparently possible to make a [[https://dberard.com/home-built-stm/][scanning-tunneling microscope]] using an 80-cent piezoelectric speaker disc and a broken piece of tungsten. There are some additional parts involved (damping out vibrations, moving the needle up to the surface, electronics to move it around and sense the voltage changes), but they were able to get it to resolve individual atoms of HOPG.

If someone were to combine this with a similarly low cost approach to ultrahigh vacuum, it might be possible to have low cost electron beam lithography, and maybe [[http://www.zyvex.com/nano/][Zyvex]] style nanotech experimentation.
