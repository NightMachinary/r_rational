Get a cat, but make sure it has a good personality. I grew up with a furry alien cat who didn't let people touch her except in certain circumstances (usually when she wanted food) She was kind of fun to play with and would attack peoples' feet when they weren't expecting it, but I would have liked to have a cat that I could pet without having to be vigilant so I could dodge when she decided she'd had enough and it was biting time.

There was a stray cat that sometimes came to our yard who loved being petted. She was the fluffiest nicest cat around and was so into pets that if you were standing she would get up onto her hind legs in order to rub her head against your hand. She was also content to just sit in your lap and purr for however long you were willing to sit for.

For the most part, cats will let you go about doing your own thing and they go about doing their thing. I would estimate that having a cat is like 30% as much work as having a dog, and 60% as rewarding in what you get out of it in terms of playing together and enjoying its existence. So definitely the more optimal choice in terms of efficiency, but that's mostly my opinion and not any actual rigorous study.
