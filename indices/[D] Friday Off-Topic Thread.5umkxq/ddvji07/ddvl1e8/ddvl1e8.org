I appointed myself team leader for a semester-long group project last fall, and it went amazingly well. I think a big part of it was that I got above-average group members and the prof was good at stricturing the class is a way that facilitated teamwork.

I limited myself to calling meetings (and laying out what should be done beforehand) taking notes during the meetings, and then distributing the notes after the fact. It worked well, but wouldn't have helped with a lazy group.
