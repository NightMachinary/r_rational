[epistemic status: mostly cynical ranting, though I don't believe any of this is factually incorrect. Just not the full story :P]

Actually the biggest thing you should learn from it is importance of incentives. The behaviour you describe does not go away after high school, and in any situation where incentives are misaligned you'll find such degenerate teams.

Your options are to go into management (i.e. do more of what you're doing right now, trying to get people to do work despite bad incentives from up high), or work at small (<50 people) companies where it's easier to align everyone towards a single goal.

Or be rich.
