Yeah, we're in a different setting. The school I'm in encourages a very individualistic "do everything yourself at your own pace" mentality, which is pretty good and attractive for aimless students who come from "Sit down all day and note what the teacher says" environments.

On the other hand, when you start working as a team, this mentality becomes an obstacle, and you basically have to learn professionalism from the ground up (show up to reunions, communicate about what you're doing, etc). I also think that the school's "You do whatever you want, but we're going to examine your results and not your efforts" policy also encourages students to [A] do everything in last-moment rushes (which is kinda terrible for a long term project with many important-but-abstract first steps) and [B] associate authority and responsibility with strict enforcement, which means that your team's productivity will often be proportional to the team leader's willingness to police everyone.

It's something I'm thinking about /a lot/ lately, especially since I re-read "What Developmental Milestones are you missing" and the associated post about stages of psychological development.

I'd be interested in [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]]' opinion on the subject, btw, since you did a series on similar themes (responsibility-building) a while ago.
