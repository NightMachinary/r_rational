If it makes you feel any better: the main reason why my life sucks right now is directly analogous to your venting above, except that I include a few more capital letters and quite a few more swears and also more punctuation marks. I very much Feel Ya, and it sucks, and there are ways it can be made a /little/ better, but mostly humans haven't figured out how to implement even the known, partial solutions to this problem.

Perhaps when we're both a little less burned-out over it, we can put our heads together. I'm encouraged by the fact that you're doing some theorizing and model-building around it.
