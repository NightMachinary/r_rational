Hey everyone, so a little while back I started [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55o2ah/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d8cethq/][designing an AGI development board game]] and documenting my progress in these weekly posts. I've stopped posting because I've mostly stopped developing, and I've mostly stopped developing for one simple reason: I don't know enough about the field to do the work justice.

Mechanically, I can figure things out to make what I think is an engaging game. I still occasionally design new cards and aspects of the game. But when I say I don't know enough, I mean I literally don't know what to call those cards and aspects.

Just as an example, I've got a list of cards that can be developed for your AI that fall under "User Modeling." They are, in order, Modeling Dangers, Modeling Beliefs, Modeling Preferences, Modeling Enhanced Knowledge, and Coherent Extrapolated Volition. Each card that you research and develop gives you more bonuses and lowers the risk of your AI ending the world. Coming up with the costs, the extra effects, things like that, I can do. But to get those names and understand those concepts, I had to research. And that goes for every aspect of the game beyond the basics.

It's research I don't mind doing, and found educational, but it's also research that took a lot of time that was taking away from my other projects, like Pokemon and Rationally Writing. So I shelved the game for a bit and tried asking around to see if anyone with that knowledge already, and an interest in board games, is willing to basically look over what I'm doing and answer questions to make sure I'm actually basing my game's design and flavor on real concepts, which is sort of important to me.

So here I am asking here: if anyone has the extensive knowledge of the AGI field and current research going on in it, and is also interested in spending a few minutes every so often answering emails or chat questions about it, let me know, and maybe I can get this project rolling again!
