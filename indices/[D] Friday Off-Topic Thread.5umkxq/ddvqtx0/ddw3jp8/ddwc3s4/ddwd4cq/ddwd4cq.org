Yeah i'm always quite nervous about models that don't make predictions and merely interpret existing data, but then go on to try to give the impression that they are imparting information.\\
Especially when the model then feels justified drawing extra territory onto the map because what's already there seems to kind of fit (at least in part by because it's so vague that it would be hard not to).\\
When those sort of models are especially broad reaching then even more red flags go up, because generally 99.99...% of ideas that try to explain everything about human experience (or even worse /everything period/), are fatally flawed or so vague as to not even be capable of a truth value.
