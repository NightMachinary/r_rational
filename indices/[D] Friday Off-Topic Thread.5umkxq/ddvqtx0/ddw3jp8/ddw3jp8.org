Yeah a lot of parts seem pretty questionable. There seems to be a common feature in certain kinds of psychological models where the latter "stages" are often highly questionable and more reflections of the authors own opinions on the matter than fundamental facts about the human mind.\\
I'm also not sure that stage 3 necessarily has to come between stage 2 and 4. It really doesn't seem like that sort of social groupthink has to come between selfish shortsightedness and systematic thinking.

I think you shouldn't buy to much into the idea that this sort of model will grant you any sort of massive insight. It's just a psychological model and it's the sort that kind of fits the data not the sort that makes testable predictions. Stage 5 is also somewhat vaguely defined and doesn't seem like you could reliably determine someone in that stage with a test.

Even more established models like Maslow's hierarchy of needs mostly just fit the data and frequently fail to apply to real life (for instance people will often neglect lower levels in pursuit of high level needs).
