I think "model building" misrepresents what I'm doing, the same way "making a study of the existing" misrepresents what my group is doing right now, which is also the same way "I'm building a giant house of cards" misrepresents someone who is struggling to make two cards hold against each other.

But yeah, I'm better at this than I was last year, I'll probably be better at it next year. Model building sounds nice, I've been thinking about looking up formal approaches to sociology or psychology.
