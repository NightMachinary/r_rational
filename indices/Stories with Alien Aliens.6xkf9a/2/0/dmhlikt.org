/Speaker for the Dead/ is definitely one of my go-to "alien aliens" books. I actually read them out of order when I was a kid and read that one first. While I think /Ender's Game/ is a better book in terms of pacing and broad appeal, /Speaker/ will always be my favorite. The aliens were just so compelling.
