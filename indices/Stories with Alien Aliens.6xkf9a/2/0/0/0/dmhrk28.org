Thanks! I definitely will. I am definitely into that.

In another comment I mentioned /The Mote in God's Eye/ and /Ringworld,/ both by Larry Niven. Big fan of both of those.

/Mote/ is an excellent first contact book, and Ringworld is a classic in general. I find the Puppeteers to be a really interesting alien race.
