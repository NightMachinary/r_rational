  If the ocean can understand them well enough to bring up repressed memories it can surely understand well enough to communicate, at least a bit. Or does it make more sense in the book than in the reviews?

This is discussed a little bit in the book.

Solaris is a one-of-a-kind entity. It has not had to evolve the buttload of communication protocols we have as a social species living on a planet full of animals. Its only known interaction with the outside world (before the event of the book) is tidal manipulations to stabilize its orbit. Forget communication barriers, it's not clear it would understand /communication itself/ with an external entity as a concept.

Complex "geological" constructs regularly emerge from the ocean, stick around for some time, then disperse. The scientific community's best guess is that this is how Solaris's thoughts are produced and/or stored. But they have no idea, really.

One character compares the things that Solaris is doing to, what if we scanned one of those structures, built an exact replica, and dumped it in a random spot in the ocean? Just because we could do it, doesn't mean we have any fucking clue how that would feel from the inside (or if that's even a sensible question; Solaris may not even be sentient).
