Hmm, well I'll check out Hamilton, then. From the description I was a bit worried it was very Star Trek-y, which is not really my cup of tea.

The whole sentient ocean generating hallucinations thing on /Solaris/ seems a bit implausible, though. If the ocean can understand them well enough to bring up repressed memories it can surely understand well enough to communicate, at least a bit. Or does it make more sense in the book than in the reviews?
