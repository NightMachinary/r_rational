The travel itself plays absolutely no role in /Solaris/ as the entire plot takes place on one planet that is far off from Earth. So if you want you can pretend it's without FTL and just a close neighboring star, IIRC it's never mentioned how long it took them to get there.

You're missing out on Hamilton though. While there is a super conventient FTL method at the very central of the setting he goes out of his way to stay away from usual Space Opera tropes.
