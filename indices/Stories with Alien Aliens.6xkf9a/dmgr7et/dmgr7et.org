Karl Schroeder has a number of stories with truly alien aliens.

Ventus - a human-created artificial ecology that has assumed its own goals and rationality, in which humans are now merely one more species to be managed.

Permanence and short stories like Solitaire - consciousness is simply a stage an intelligent species goes through. Humans come late to a galaxy that's had generations of interstellar ecosystems layered upon each other.

The Virga series - Artificial Nature is not conscious in any real sense, but its method of simulating reality to plan for its goals works at least as well.
