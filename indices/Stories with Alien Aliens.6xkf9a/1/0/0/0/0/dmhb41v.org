There only really two humans as we know them in the story, the two watchers/observers, one on the ship and planet. The rest of human civilization is pretty different, what with compulsory racial/gene blending done a few ..centuries ago?, legalized rape, and whatever the electronic web-democracy-stock market thing was. The culture humans had then is practically it's own alien culture, just as repugnant to us as the other two are...because it's Three worlds colliding, observed by an immortal with no investment in any of them.
