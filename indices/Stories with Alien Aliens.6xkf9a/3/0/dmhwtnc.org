1) It's really, really good. Stick with it! It's got both the best AI and the best aliens I've ever seen in fiction.

2) It diverges from the Inside Out model in a bit... (Really mostly in the second book, though)

3) ^

4) The first book is about 0.4 HPMoRs, the second is about 0.3. Only the first is free; the second is available on [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01N7TK5EF/ref=series_dp_aw_ca_2][Amazon]].
