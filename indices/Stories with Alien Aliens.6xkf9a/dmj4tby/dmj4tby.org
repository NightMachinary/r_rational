Love the Crystal Triology, I'm thinking of re-reading it. Can't wait for the third book!

Just realised that nobody has recommended Dragon's Egg yet, and given my flair, I should probably do it.

Now, I'm not going to lie - the aliens in Dragon's Egg aren't as alien as many of the others shown. They have a society broadly similar to ours with some notable exceptions (no pair bonding, different method of raising children, no taboo about cannibalism), but those are exceptions that I wouldn't be surprised to read were commonplace in an Amazonian tribe.

The really amazing thing about Dragon's Egg is that the life forms exist on a neutron star and use neutron physics. The novel was written by a neutron star physicist so it contains a LOT of detailed things about the magnetic field and how the aliens interact with that.

And even more amazing is that the aliens make First Contact with humanity, but they live 1,000 times faster than we do: so a Cheela lives and dies in 15 minutes. This means that the humans who are on a space ship orbiting the neutron star get to watch the society literally go from hunter-gatherer to spaceflight within the space of 12 hours. It's really, really cool.

Again, the Cheela are not altogether that alien, but I think they're still very alien because the physics they operate under is so very different to our own. I believe it's available for Kindle though I might recommend the paperback if you can get ahold of it because there's an appendix in the back that is very helpful when you read it (so you can flip across to see how much 30 seconds means to a Cheela).
