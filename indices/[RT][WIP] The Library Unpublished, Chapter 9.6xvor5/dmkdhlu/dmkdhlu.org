I reached ending 71) first. I just tried to do what I would have done to find =_sein_= and get out of the library. Unfortunately I failed :(

Then I read the all the other endings, retracing to the most recent fork and taking the one that I would have taken first.

If the OP had not warned me about "Read the chapter before reading the rest of this post!", then I would have taken care to note down or remember my thoughts while reading. As it is, I don't remember if there were "any options you wanted to choose that I did not offer you". I believe the OP contains no spoilers.

Finally, I think my favourite ending is 96). I don't want =m1k= to end badly, including 30), and the other non-bad ending 72) isn't really an ending, and it seems to be hinted that =_sein_= will turn traitor.

I nearly always get bad endings when choosing my own adventure...
