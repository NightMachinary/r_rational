My first reaction to the CYOA was something along the lines of "oh shit I'm going to lose my place". I ended up opening a Notepad file and going through all the paths via a method that basically boiled down to the equivalent of always turning right in a maze. At some point I started labeling the various endings as I got to them; I'll post them here when I get the chance if you're interested.
