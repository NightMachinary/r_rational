  No room for mind-control; yes room for definitions-hacking. Can you define "past" and "you" and "acceptable" and "consider" in such a way that a superintelligent being won't be able to find a loophole that would allow it to screw you over anyway? Say, "past you" --- did you mean your brain, or your body? Maybe your hand? It's a part of you. Or your sense of hunger? It's a part of your mind. Or, say, the you of N years ago, when you were in a really bad mood and unconsciously wanted the world to be destroyed? Those are the ideas a near-baseline human came up with after a few minutes of thinking.

I think you're really overstating the problems here because the level of specificity you'd need to deal with asshole genies or AI alignment is far greater than what you can get away with by literary standards. Simply say that the book's outcomes are such that 5 minutes before writing it into existence, you would have considered the outcome acceptable. So any outcome you don't consider acceptable just can't be caused simply because of how you specify things, "you" being vague isn't much of an issue here because it's understood what it is you mean by that implicitly, otherwise no book you could write that wasn't a total mathematical description of a world state from first principles wouldn't work anyway.\\
Sure you could come up with ways you could get screwed over if the book was somehow actively malevolent in how it interpreted things, but based on everything in the story it seems to interpret things as any sensible reader would, so it's not going to use a frame of reference wherein 5 minutes is long enough that you would still have been an infant despite that being a technically "valid" interpretation.\\
The reason this sort of exploit works is because the description you are giving /is/ actually staggeringly complicated. However nearly all of the complexity is hidden as part of the expected knowledge and mind structure of the reader at least in the parts of the library we see.

Similarly you could make things work by coming up with a fictional backstory for your books that involves them being created by certain benevolent agents. Then you can reasonably be assured things will work by simply stating those agents are inerrant and describing them enough to be sure of their trustworthiness and having them start out as human at some point in their fictional past and having them interact with humans for more sureness of friendliness.\\
Sure if the interpretation of the text could be actively malevolent and convoluted, those agents might be evil and all the thoughts described in the text could be purely coincidental and unrelated to their actual personality. However it's reasonable to expect that not to be the case since every canonical example seems to function under the standard of how any reasonable human like mind would interpret the text.
