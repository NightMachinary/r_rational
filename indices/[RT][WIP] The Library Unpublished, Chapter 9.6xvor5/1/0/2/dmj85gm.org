  I don't think the library as defined in path 57 would allow that. In any case, self-replicating nanobots are absurdly dangerous, and unless you're extremely sure that you have everything under complete control, only to be used as the very last resort. No one wants Grey Goo. Considering that m1k knows almost nothing about the way the Library works, I don't think he should risk that.

I don't actually think things are anywhere as risky here as you think, the nanobots are preloaded with FAI so they aren't going to do anything I would consider unacceptable.

  And that's extremely dangerous. If you're instating mental changes with the intent to cause a butterfly effect, you're walking a thin line because the very nature of the butterfly effect is that it is unpredictable and chaotic. Some side effect of those propagating changes might erase your identity (and thereby your utility function, similar to what happens to m1k in 57). That's some high-risk munchkinning, though far safer than the nanobots.

See again it's just a matter of the fact that you can explicitly define how it is that the book actually works (within the specified limits) that eliminates any potential issues. So since the book can have knowledge of basically everything, you can just define it such that it uses what little tangible influence it can directly via you reading it to lead to whatever is desired.\\
Just say that it's effects on your mind aren't something "past you" would consider noticeable and simply say that they effects caused on the outside world are of the sort that "past you" wanted. Then just let it steer you into the unlikely path wherein due to random chance some proteins in your body randomly assemble into the previously mentioned nanobots carrying a friendly GAI within the next few seconds, after all it has a non-zero probability.

To rephrase things, this basically gives you a probability pump of unlimited power. Whose instructions only have to be as specific as the descriptions in a story.\\
As for precognition being supernatural it's no more supernatural than the ability to grant knowledge of the present events without having to directly causally interact with them in order to get that info. Plus after all there's always relativistic reference frames wherein anything that happens in your future has already happened anyway, so you would need to dispute relativity in order for the present to hold that sort of special status.
