Aww, you know me too well. And it's true: the text supports both your interpretation and mine. The fact that he decided to abandon the outside world completely was something I do not consider to be part of his previous character; while m1k has few friends, he is loyal to them, and disappearing without leaving a message for Cio seems out of character, especially since he could have instructed _sein_ to convey that message at almost no cost to himself. He almost forgot to rescue _sein_, even!

Of course, if you interpret him as a paranoid shut-in, his decision to abandon those who care about him might seem more reasonable :)
