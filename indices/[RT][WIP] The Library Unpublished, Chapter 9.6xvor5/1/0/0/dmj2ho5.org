  Indeed. I re-read 57 and wonder where I created the impression that smuggling information out of the library wasn't possible. If you could point me to whatever made you think that, I'd be interested. It's very likely that I've just forgotten the relevant section, but it might be that I wrote something that was easily misinterpreted.

It doesn't imply any information, just the more improbably self-modification. The exact quote:

  It seemed most likely that for whatever reason, people lost whatever they gained inside the library as they left it

Of course, given how far gone m1k is at this point, it might just be them rationalizing in order to go deeper into the library.
