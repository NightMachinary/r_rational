Don't remember which path I followed first though I can say with unlimited choices I would most certainly go down a route sort of like 57 the moment I got into the library, in fact I was thinking of that much earlier in the story. Of course as scruiser pointed out 57 is actually if anything a suboptimal munchkin because we know information can be brought out of the library.\\
So my plan would conjuring a book explaining exactly the limits of the library, but either way I imagine things would probably go basically the same way either way. The books can conjure electronic bits to some degree as was used to make seins flashing book so I might just create a book with some self replicating nanobots preloaded with a friendly GAI that activated once I'd defined it into existence. Or alternatively I might define into existence a book which altered my thinking in some miniscule way that would rapidly lead through the butterfly effect to those previous nanobots being assembled in my body.\\
Or in the worst case scenario I would define a book which would give me PtV towards achieving my goals. Which I would then use to come up with the best conceivable book to bring out of the library in order to direct myself if the PtV wore off outside. Though likely there would be little to do except keep myself safe as the seed GAI I'd put on my phone escaped once I left the library.
