I ended up in 30) and enjoyed it quite a lot. I'm still going through the other endings. It would be fairly simple to add <a href="#option_30">30) (click me!)</a> on the link and id="option_30" in the h6 in the story heading.

Edit: Actually that was a lot easier than I thought since you had everything be consistent with -> #) and <h6>#)</h6> so a simple regex replace worked perfectly. I have an HTML file with the chapter that has clickable links that seem to work and should be allowed by AO3, can I send that over to you?

Edit2: My second readthrough left me on 57) which was very satisfying :) Nothing quite like Meta-Munchkining as an ending!
