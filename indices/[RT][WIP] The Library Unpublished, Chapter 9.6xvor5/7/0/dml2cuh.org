Thank you for your kind words!

I sent you a personal message already, but I'll try to rephrase the most important points here for other people who stumble on this comment. The reason I didn't use links in the html wasn't because I didn't know how to do it (at least not primarily) but because Cio didn't. Therefore, to implement links, I have to consider the impact on the story. I may still do it, but I'll take a few hours to think about it.
