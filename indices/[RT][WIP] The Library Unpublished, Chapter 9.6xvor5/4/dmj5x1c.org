I ended at 57 first. I chose by the old stand-by CYOA method that has always failed me eventually in every CYOA - namely, always choose the highest number choice first, knowing that it doesn't really matter because I will be going back and exploring all other branches. And then reading through linearly to look for ectopic sections.

I liked many of the endings, but 57 stood out as honestly one of them more interesting as well, so I am not sad I got it first.

I really like the CYOA format here.

The various choices read a lot like [[http://antichamber.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Signs][Antichamber's various signs]] in terms of 'vague life suggestion with immediate applicability which sounds super deep on casual inspection because of phrasing'. I like the aesthetic.
