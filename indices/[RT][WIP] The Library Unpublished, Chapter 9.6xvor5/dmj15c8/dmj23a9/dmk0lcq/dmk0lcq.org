Wait, it happened? I read it as Mike making a weighted choice aided by his newfound nearly-perfect rationality, fully aware of everything he is doing every step of the way. He wasn't exactly a social butterfly beforehand, and given an unlimited source of tailor-made books that also granted him ever-increasing power... I considered it in-character enough for him to decide to abandon outside world in favour of exploring the library. Was there actual manipulations going on?
