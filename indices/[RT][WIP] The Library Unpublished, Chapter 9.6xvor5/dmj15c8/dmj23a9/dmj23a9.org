#+begin_quote
  we know information can be brought out of the library
#+end_quote

Indeed. I re-read 57 and wonder where I created the impression that smuggling information out of the library wasn't possible. If you could point me to whatever made you think that, I'd be interested. It's very likely that I've just forgotten the relevant section, but it might be that I wrote something that was easily misinterpreted.

Let me offer my two cents on your munchkinning ideas. Keep in mind that I'm just the author, as well as rather fallible, and while Word of God is a thing, I can be reasoned with :)

#+begin_quote
  self-replicating nanobots
#+end_quote

I don't think the library as defined in path 57 would allow that. In any case, self-replicating nanobots are absurdly dangerous, and unless you're extremely sure that you have everything under complete control, only to be used as the very last resort. No one wants Grey Goo. Considering that m1k knows almost nothing about the way the Library works, I don't think he should risk that.

#+begin_quote
  a book which altered my thinking in some miniscule way that would rapidly lead through the butterfly effect
#+end_quote

And that's extremely dangerous. If you're instating mental changes with the intent to cause a butterfly effect, you're walking a thin line because the very nature of the butterfly effect is that it is unpredictable and chaotic. Some side effect of those propagating changes might erase your identity (and thereby your utility function, similar to what happens to m1k in 57). That's some high-risk munchkinning, though far safer than the nanobots.

#+begin_quote
  I would define a book which would give me PtV
#+end_quote

In 57, m1k only modified himself in ways that gave him realistic mental abilities, like speed reading or rationality. PtV (which is a Worm reference, for those few of you who don't know what we are talking about) requires precognition, which seems a bit too supernatural. m1k theorises that more supernatural phenomena might be available deeper inside the Library, but this is not actually confirmed in the text.

In any case, thank you for munchkinning! Check out [[/u/scruiser][u/scruiser]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6xmi5q/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dmiwwxv/?context=3][comment]] in the Saturday Munchkinning Thread; maybe someone will post more ideas there.
