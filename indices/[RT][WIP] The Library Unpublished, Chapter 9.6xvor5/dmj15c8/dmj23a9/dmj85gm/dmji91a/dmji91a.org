Of course, your ability to define a book precisely allows you to circumvent some of the immediate risk, /if you assume/ that the precise definition is followed exactly. I don't think m1k has enough confidence into that, at this point, to risk a Grey Goo scenario.

Also, any definition of a book is somewhat imprecise. You cannot cover all corner cases in a finite text, which opens the possibility of the library going full "asshole Genie" on you, twisting your words into something that might be technically true, but still not what you had actually wanted. (This possibility will be stated more explicitly in Chapter 10.)

And as for precognition, I'm not an expert on relativity, but I was of the opinion that information is generally held not to be transmittable from the future, as a law of physics. Doesn't that mean that getting that information from those reference frames to ours would have to be a bit of a problem, and we haven't seen the Library break an actual law of physics yet, have we? Its improbable amount of information about the present is explainable in a number of less physics-breaking ways^{1,} at least in the non-magic endings.
