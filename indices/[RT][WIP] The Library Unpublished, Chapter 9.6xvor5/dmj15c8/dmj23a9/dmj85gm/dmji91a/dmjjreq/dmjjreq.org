Ok when it comes to issues of specificity as was my point before the nature of how you describe things really circumvents that if you can phrase things half competently. As I said before you can basically rely on specifying that the outcome fits the criterion past you (so no room for mind control) has for what counts as a desirable outcome. There's no real worry about edge cases here because either an outcome is something you would have considered acceptable or it isn't.\\
Also on an unrelated note when dealing with asshole genies it's a good idea to use a somewhat similar plan for specifying your wishes.

  And as for precognition, I'm not an expert on relativity, but I was of the opinion that information is generally held not to be transmittable from the future, as a law of physics. Doesn't that mean that getting that information from those reference frames to ours would have to be a bit of a problem, and we haven't seen the Library break an actual law of physics yet, have we? Its improbable amount of information about the present is explainable in a number of less physics-breaking ways1, at least in the non-magic endings.

The issue here is I don't think you get that the books must fundamentally violate physics there's just no getting around that. As maxwell's demon illustrates (well actually there is formal information theory but most people will only /maybe/ know about maxwell's demon) information and energy are interchangeable and connected. So getting information or doing computation without interfering with the relevant system and expending thermodynamic work is, well a violation of thermodynamics that could be used to get free energy with the right setup.

So once you accept the fact that the books fundamentally don't get information through the proper channels anyway there's no reason to privilege the present over the future given that: One there's nothing different about the past and future except in relative terms, and two that by picking the right "present" to get information about you could arrange things to see into the future given FTL information transfer.\\
Plus given how present events determine future one's you don't even really need future events to get things to work anyway. The only hitch in exploiting the butterfly effect might be truly random events which are only issues in the copenhagen interpretation. Even then you can use statistical effects and slightly more time to make up for things just like people do when dealing with actual real life chaos theory.
