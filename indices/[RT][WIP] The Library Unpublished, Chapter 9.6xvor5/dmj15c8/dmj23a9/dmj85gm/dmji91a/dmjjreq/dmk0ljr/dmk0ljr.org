  As I said before you can basically rely on specifying that the outcome fits the criterion past you (so no room for mind control) has for what counts as a desirable outcome

No room for mind-control; yes room for definitions-hacking. Can you define "past" and "you" and "acceptable" and "consider" in such a way that a superintelligent being won't be able to find a loophole that would allow it to screw you over anyway? Say, "past you" --- did you mean your /brain/, or your body? Maybe your hand? It's a part of you. Or your sense of hunger? It's a part of your mind. Or, say, the you of N years ago, when you were in a really bad mood and unconsciously wanted the world to be destroyed? Those are the ideas a near-baseline human came up with after a few minutes of thinking.

Frankly, the only way to control malevolent superintelligent wish-granting beings is to mathematically bind them. Any open-ended wish, any self-referential complex cleverness is by its nature exploitable, and your opponent could exploit it better than you.
