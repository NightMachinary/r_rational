Yes, House of Leaves should be read in a physical version. This book has tons of little quirks which just don't translate to an ebook. For example, the cover is too small, which means that the book is bigger on the inside!

I've got a solution for your problem. Make an account on amazon.de and use this [[https://www.amazon.de/House-Leaves-Remastered-Mark-Danielewski/dp/0375703764/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504557225&sr=8-1&keywords=house+of+leaves][link]] to buy the book. Shipping from Germany to Poland should be far quicker than overseas.

By now, I've got accounts on amazon.com, amazon.de and amazon.co.uk, because sometimes the prices on another site are cheaper even when postage is taken into account.

If that doesn't work for whatever reason, send me a private message here on reddit, and we'll find some kind of solution. If necessary, I'll buy the book and ship it to you personally :)
