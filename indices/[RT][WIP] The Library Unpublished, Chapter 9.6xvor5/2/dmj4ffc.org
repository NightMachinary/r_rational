Thorough this adventure I started with actions I would take, cautiously and curiously approaching the ending 30).

After reaching my first ending I decided to map out this... cocoon, as computer!Librarian at 39) would refer to it. From what I've seen there were only 3 paths you could reach through more than one road (20),39)80)). There were also 3 general outcomes- die, join the Library, or join _ sein _.

As far favorites go I'll take the full on godly descent of 57) and frankly silly bromance of 96).

54) is completely disconnected from any other. That and the missing 36) would suggest this is an incomplete index.

So basically, /assuming/ that the choices we can make in those snippets are not dependent on... snippets available in this chapter, it would mean that there are other paths Mike could have taken before chapter 9. Those paths could perhaps lead to the missing pieces, as well as roads leading to the ending 54).

Honestly, if anything, I would like to see more of the disconnected, nonsensical paths that go from nowhere to nowhere, to truly drive point of "this is meta-fuckery of the highest order".

  As the shadows danced around the bookshelf, painting red leather black and casting embossed gold letters in sharp relief, I realized, for the first time, what the library lacked. Some quality I lacked the words for, a metaphysical spine, was missing, and as a result, the library suddenly felt flat and lifeless.

I have to say- this was quite absorbing and interesting adventure. I can't wait to see how will chapter 10 resolve this convoluted story.
