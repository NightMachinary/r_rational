Thank you for reading! The "bromance", as you call it, was meant as a nod to The Northern Caves. While I didn't want it to be as explicit, I knew I wanted to get a similar ending in there.

Also, "godly descent" is a nice way to put it. Is it merely a descent into the Library or a descent into madness? Is m1k diminished by his ascension? Questions that will remain unanswered, but your term evokes them in a nice way :)

Have you read House of Leaves? That book does something similar. It contains a chapter about labyrinths which is in itself a labyrinth; footnotes lead you through the pages in all directions. Some footnotes cannot be reached by reading normally, and some footnote marks are actually dead ends, because the footnotes don't exist.

House of Leaves was a big inspiration for The Library Unpublished, as you might have noticed :)
