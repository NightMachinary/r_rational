If I may ask: what's the deal with 54)? No other segment connects to it, which indicates that either (a) the author made a clerical error, (b) we're meant to infer the existence of additional segments that exist "out there in the universe" but (for whatever reason) weren't included, or (c) segment 54) is actually /not a part of the same story as the rest of the segments/, and exists on a different level of (meta)reality entirely.
