Good question! In this case, I didn't make a clerical error. I'm not /entirely/ sure what the canonical interpretation of 54) is, but b) has some merit. After all, the choices shown here cannot possibly cover the full spectrum of real choices a person could have in that situation.

That's one interpretation. c) is also an option. Consider what m1k does here; he burns books. If he is the author, not the narrator, placing this segment in there, but making it unreachable, could be his way of making a statement, namely, that burning books is something he cannot conceive of ever doing.

There are multiple options here, and given that The Library Unpublished is a book within a book itself, a tale that Cio posted on a fictional ao3, I'd like to refrain from calling one of those interpretations canonical.
