Reached ending 30) first... Looped back to an early point because that ending was far to tantalizing. Has the narration character been brainwashed by a super intelligent AI or perhaps convinced their reality is fictional? I'll edit this post with the next ending I reach...

Edit... and ending 49 next. Ouch.

Edit... and 99) so its not an AI? Or it is an AI, but is claiming the library is supernatural as a lie to cover itself up? Still not too helpful. Funny that Mike realizes he might get brainwashed...

72) So Sein has broken partially out of his brainwashing, but not enough to leave the library, and he tricked Mike into reading the brainwashing book the library unpublished.

Well, I guess I'll avoid talking to the terminal at all then.

Partway through 20), its funny, I'm glad to hear that Sein is dead since that means I'll avoid ending 72).

And ending 82)... I'm going to start fresh now. At this point I've broken with trying to keep Mike in character and instead I'm trying to weedle out as much information as possible, even if Mike dies or gets brainwashed a few dozen more times.

71) So it is magic. Nice to have the confirmed, although apparently its the lethal uncontrollable Lovecraft or older darker fairytale magic that can't be safely munchkined.

Tried to take 36) just to see if I could squeeze out another hint, but I realized 36 doesn't even exist. Guess it is a true dead end of dead ends.

I jumped randomly till I found a narrative I hadn't read before, then traced it back up to 97).

At 18), if there was an option to kill or silence Sein I would take it... I imagine if I knew enough about each of these philosophers I could pick an option to silence him, but instead I'll try both.

And it seems interacting with Sein is a death trap either way. Welp, time to grasp absolute power.

In the middle of 57) And this just got meta... Mike already tried this once, but... with a guide to help him maybe it will actually work this time.

And, well, at least I know why the other endings ended as they did, with exploring the library indefinitely or joining the cultists.

And time to read linearly to catch any snippets I missed.

Final edit... don't think I missed anything. There is still the question of who the author (in-story is) and how the narrator (Mike) got his account to them. And the fact that I want more endings still...

Well... there is one weak spot in the narrative to attack at:

  36) I woke up hungover and disoriented. It was raining outside. I wondered what... oh shoot, Sein was in the library and I needed to... I had already been to the library? My memory was a disoriented mess of fragments and I seemed to recall dying multiple times, being brainwashed by a cult, and obtaining near omnipotence at the expense of losing my ability/interest to return to ordinary reality. The most recent memory was accepting my own death in an attempt to avoid suffering. Worse yet, my thoughts felt off, as though they were being generated by a different source than usual. I checked the time and the date... had I not even left to rescue Sein yet? Well, assuming I wasn't insane, I think I knew the "winning" strategy, save for the fact that the chance of self-modifying would become addictive. The "winning" ending also seemed to have made a logical error... Sein had somehow been able to get text out the library so it wasn't true that I couldn't take anything out. I just needed to restrict what I wanted to take out to a single book bags worth. It would also help to write into existence a useful book to use ahead of time. I had just the idea... I could make a reddit post and get munchkining ideas for the best books to take out. The post's responses itself would be sufficient to write books into existence.
