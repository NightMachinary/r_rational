Wow, you put quite a lot of effort into this. Awesome!

I'm sorry to say that the omission of 36) was a simple mistake on my part. I was under some time pressure while posting and messed that section up during editing. I'm sorry to say that your version of 36) is now officially non-canon :/

Let me say a few words about some of your more interesting conclusions.

  So it is magic.

If you're trying to explain everything with one narrative, that explanation will necessarily have to be extremely powerful. Magic is the most powerful explanation presented here.

At the same time, can you be sure that explaining everything with one narrative is the correct approach? Consider 53) and 96). The only difference in m1k's actions is that in one of those, he doubts /sein/'s intentions, while in the other, he doesn't, and that somehow immediately results in his capture in one ending, but not in the other. There seem to be more differences between the endings than could be explained by m1k's choices. /sein/'s audio log was self-contradictory as well, and maybe the way the plot in Chapter 9 is fractured at the decision points allows for entirely different worldbuilding.

  if I knew enough about each of these philosophers
#+end_quote

Another editing hiccup, thank you for spotting it. Replaced their names with more informative statements in the style of the other branches, as was originally intended.

#+begin_quote
  it seems interacting with Sein is a death trap
#+end_quote

Almost everything is. In fact, the only "happy" endings in Chapter 9 are those in which I decided to stop writing at a high point instead of drawing everything to its (inevitably terrible) conclusion. Well, that part isn't actually written down in Chapter 9, so you're still free to believe that /sein/ and m1k actually win the Library's internal war after 72).

#+begin_quote
  the fact that I want more endings still...
#+end_quote

I don't disagree. A more labyrinthine Chapter 9 would have been great, but at some point, I had reached my limits and further writing just wasn't possible.

Thank you for reading.
