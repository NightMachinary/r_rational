You can isometrically scale your body up or down /once/, after which it is set permanently, beyond standard aging and growth. All functional relationships are preserved with the appropriate, ineffable required secondary superpowers (in the ‘intuitive' manner, e.g. relative to your change in mass when it comes to lifting things via stronger muscles and bones (so if you can bench 2x your bodyweight now you'd be able to bench 2x bw post-transformation), or your metabolic requirements; though some things remain ‘functionally' constant, e.g. you generate and radiate heat in a manner such that you'd be as susceptible to overheating or getting chilly at the same temperatures and exertions as you would be now).

There are no limits to this transformation, so you can become as large as mountains or galaxies or as small as an ant or an atom, though you'd still be unable to breathe in space (though your corpse wouldn't collapse into a black hole, since your body's structural integrity will have scaled too).

To what size do you change, if any?
