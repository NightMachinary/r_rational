I'm very interested in the secondary superpowers.

Consider your blood circulation. If your body size increases, and the secondary superpowers work in the 'intuitive' manner, does the amount of time it takes for blood to go from the heart to any other organ stay the same as before? But that would imply that if you grow as large as a galaxy, your blood would be moving way way faster than light. Your body would be one giant mass of backwards time travel.
