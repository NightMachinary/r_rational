You have a magical charisma that makes most people (>80%) agree with your opinions (the rest are genetically resistant to your magic, but could still be convinced non-magically to agree). However, your power comes under the following restrictions:

- You must never attempt to communicate with anyone in any method other than pointing your thumb up or down at something. Any other attempt at communication will cause your magic to fail and turn you back into a normal human.
- Every action you take without the intent for communication will not communicate anything to any observer. For example, if you walk to a restaurant, that does not make observers that think the restaurant is good. (Though doing a thumb up at the restaurant would.) If you write a note without any intention of sharing it, people who somehow see the note will just think of it as a cryptic memo you wrote for yourself, whose meanings are indecipherable to anyone else.
- Your magical charisma only affects observers that see you thumb up or thumb down in person. Any kind of second-hand information, such as from cameras or word of mouth, is not affected by your magical charisma in any way.
- Your magical charisma only makes an instantaneous change to an observer's opinion. This new opinion can still be changed later, exactly like any non-magical opinion would be changeable. That said, there is nothing to stop you from thumbing up or down the same item again to once more change the opinion.

What do you do with this power?
