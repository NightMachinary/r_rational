This is part 5 of the mini battle royale quest I've been running. It's somewhat low effort, there's no voting, and it's intended to be simple fun.

--------------

The instant her wish fell into place, space and time and weight stopped in place, Felicity moving in a near-timeless passage, even her own heartbeat slowed beyond recognition, dust particles suspended in the air, her clothes dragging behind her, blind to gravity as if painting an afterimage. She had roughly twenty minutes left on the clock before the next round, and not one second seemed to have passed, so if nothing else, she thought, she had time.

Arlene was ready long before the she entered the arena. Again, she sat on top her defensive dome inside her trapped fortress, but where the camera feed used snap instantly to the new scene, she saw the new view blend into the old, top to bottom, at first cut in half, all artefacts visible only in the world she now inhabited.

What else was new was her ability to pour over individual frames of the image, seeing each moment as the ground raised steel walls as if a flipbook, each page slowly turned.

Her opponent was missing.

At least she had time and shelter to figure this out. She had a lot of defensive options, including running. Her offensive capabilities were strange and unphysical, but effective and varied.

Her opponent could have entered the arena somewhere else. If they had free choice, they would most likely have hidden themselves away for some indirect attack that took time to prepare, or have spawned as close as possible, aiming for a blitz. Only a fraction of a second had passed, so either was still a possibility, and Felicity immediately ran into the safest, most trapped area of the fortress she could find, neither too close to the centre nor too close to the outside. If her opponent was outside stalling for time, she needed to get going.

Her opponent could be invisible, or extremely skilled at hiding. Were this the case, leaving the fortress while not in constant motion would be suicide. They could have any kind of attack, and a single hit could come from anywhere, leaving her dead. If so, she needed to utilize her traps, or figure out how to circumvent this immunity.

Her opponent could have teleportation. This was potentially an even worse prospect, since it allowed both defense and offense. However, if they did not have enhanced reflexes or immediate use, it was not necessarily a bad matchup, and it would leave the opponent less likely to have some other, confounding trump card.

Other options that came to mind seemed less plausible. Perhaps her opponent was miniature, or underground, or so fast as to avoid the first frame of the camera. But they were still concerning; a miniature opponent would avoid most of her traps, as would a tunneling opponent, and if her opponent outsped her... well, hopefully the game was fairer than that.

Felicity ran to take a spear from a trap, less interested in the flamethrower now it spewed flames at such a glacial pace, but halfway through her acquisition sensed a loud buzzing sound and felt the room shake. In the molasses of time, sound was a strange thing, and rumbles were merely subtle linear motions, but somehow her wish translated them, and they were as natural and contentful as ever. She yanked the spear carelessly and rushed to find the source of the attack.

--------------

The wish Felicity went for is “I wish for /speed/”, or more particularly, “vastly enhanced speed and reflexes” from part 2, since reflexes seemed to her like they would pay off. She didn't summon kyubey because she thought wishing to create creatures that wanted to entrap prepubescent girls in soul-harvesting schemes seemed evil and creepy, and that part didn't seem to have anything to with her current circumstance, so she ended up distrusting the whole wish.

With aid of the camera system, Felicity has found major structural damage to the top parts of the fortress. The fortress is only one floor plus spacing, so she expects it won't hold after many repeated attacks, though it should take a fair few. The attacks seem to be some kind of laser beam, about a metre in diameter, with no visible travel time but some observable ‘warm-up‘ time (that is, it fades in, rather than acting as a projectile), though it isn't clear at what point it becomes lethal. The attacks seem to be coming from the air; Felicity thinks her opponent has flight.

Felicity has found that she, and things she is exerting force on, move as if affected by forces in subjective time. That is, Felicity feels standard gravity, and struggles to pick up heavy objects. If Felicity hits a wall, her hand ends up sore. However, once released, objects maintain momentum; if Felicity throws a rock, the rock's speed is maintained on release and will become a deadly projectile with a lot of inertia. This does not let her jump extra high, since gravity affects her in subjective time, but she isn't sure if there's a way around that restriction.

If Felicity had enhanced aim, she would venture outside and attack directly. However, her flying(?) opponent will prove hard to hit from afar, and though Felicity might be able to dodge the laser attacks, she isn't certain---after all, magic is in play.

What does she do?
