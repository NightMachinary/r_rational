The first wouldn't work because the pictures/videos of your thumb are second-hand information. And handing the pictures/videos to someone would be a form of communication no different from writing a message.

The second works somewhat. Any action you take without the intent of communicating will not be taken as any kind of communication. Your handler won't be able to tell whether you are hungry from your body language. On the other hand, your handler could simply guess that since it has been a long amount of time since your last meal, you now require another meal. Leaving money around the house may or may not work depending on the handler and how your agreement was set up. If you already had the handler before you got your magic and already arranged for the handler to just collect whatever money is laying around as payment, there's no problem. If the handler gets annoyed by the fact that you aren't paying him any money, and just decides to steal the money lying around the house as payment, there's no problem either. If the handler asks whether he can just take whatever money he finds in the house and you thumbs up, there's no problem either.

On the other hand, if you place money in front of him, or anywhere in the house with the intent of making him think you want to give it to him, that's a form of communication with intent to communicate and so you lose your magic.

I admit the limitations are somewhat hand-wavey. I wanted to see what could be done with a mind control that only works via thumbing up or down things, but realized it would be extremely overpowered if you could just say anything you want and then thumb up it to make people believe anything you say. Similarly, I didn't want you to be able to just prompt someone to bring up whatever issue you want to thumb up or down. So I wanted to only let you thumb up or down things brought up by other people without you causing them to.
