1 minute of time is plenty for gambling. For moderate sums of money, you can buy scratchcards every now and then, and if they don't win, rewind time to before you bought them. Larger sums of money are also possible, but tend to draw a lot more attention.

You can also use that 1 minute to learn things about people without them knowing you have learned these things. Like in this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY][video]]. Granted, you can only use it once every 5 minutes, but that only means it will take you longer to learn things.

This isn't exactly safe however. If you do something very offensive, the person could punch you in the head and daze you, making you forget to or become unable to rewind time.
