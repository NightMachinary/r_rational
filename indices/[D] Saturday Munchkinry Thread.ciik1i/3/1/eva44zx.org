Open up the roof of the hallucigenic gas room; let the gas drift upward in a great big cloud and completely disorientate her attacker.

Then find a trap that drops a large weighted net to hold down an invader, go out, and throw the net at the attacker; precise aim is less important when you're throwing a thing that spreads out in the air and covers a large area.
