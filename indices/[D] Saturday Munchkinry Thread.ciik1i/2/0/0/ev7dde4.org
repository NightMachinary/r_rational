  he first rule means you are now basically a mute, except worse, because mutes can still use texts, emails, notes, and sign language.

It's even worse than that. You're starving. You go to the store. You bring your purchases to the counter. The act of placing items on the counter is a body-language communication that says "I wish to purchase these goods." Boom, you lose your power.

Not everywhere will have self-checkout kiosks. Even then, what if the attendant tries to look in your bags? You just have to stand there, completely mute and staring straight ahead, since any body language at all is a form of communication.

The limitation is completely crippling and would be broken instantly.
