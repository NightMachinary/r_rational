  What do you do with this power?

Very little, if anything at all. The problem is that you are simply reduced to a like/dislike system. You could react with a thumb to something somebody else said, but that limits your ability to express concepts to simply the concepts that are given to you, like an even more restricted version of Newspeak. I would probably immediately give up the magical charisma, or if I saw some immediate use for it, I would make use of it for that purpose, and then give it up.
