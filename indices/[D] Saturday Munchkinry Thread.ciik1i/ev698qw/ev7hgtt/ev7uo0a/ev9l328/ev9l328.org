You are the OP so you gets to call the shots but I'll point out that there's nothing in the OP that says anything about firsthand and secondhand thumps up.

I am sort of interested in the secondary power of nulling body language reading. I am assuming that people can still see you but what do they see when they look at you? Constant serenity?
