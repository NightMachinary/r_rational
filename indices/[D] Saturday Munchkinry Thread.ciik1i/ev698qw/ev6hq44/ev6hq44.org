I don't see how anyone could ever have a normal life once they had this power and wanted to keep it. The first rule means you are now basically a mute, except worse, because mutes can still use texts, emails, notes, and sign language.

Yeah actually I think this is maybe useful for like a few days at most. Longer than that is unlikely to be practical, because family/friends would check up on you and probably not take thumbs up/down for answers as to why you're not speaking/texting/calling. People don't just suddenly go mute for no reason as an adult.

If you work, even that may not be possible because you usually have to tell your boss you need some vacation time.
