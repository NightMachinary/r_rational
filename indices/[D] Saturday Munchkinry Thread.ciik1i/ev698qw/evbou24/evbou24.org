The big thing would be getting an immune helper that knows (to a decent degree of accuracy) what I want and knows about my power to help me.

This could be done initially via thumbs upping at individual letters of a large picture of the alphabet, to show him I believe I have magic powers, after which I could just show him my thumbs up powers working on someone else in person to make him believe.

After he knows about my power and my disability (aka, not being able to communicate any other way) he could ask me questions (eg. do you want me to order food for tonight?, do you want to rob a bank today?) which I would then thumbs up or not respectively.

While I can't do anything other then thumbs up+down he can convey whatever information he wants (eg. you want to give me and my friend 10 million dollars), which I would then just thumbs up so that they agree. With the assistance of even a single person I could leverage this into getting pretty much whatever I want, from money to (global) political change.

I might end up ditching the power eventually after I have everything I want due to its huge costs, but I would use the hell out of it in the meantime.
