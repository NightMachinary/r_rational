  What else was new was her ability to pour over individual frames of the image, seeing each moment as the ground raised steel walls as if a flipbook, each page slowly turned.

After looking at the Slow Mo guys [[https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=319][video on TV's]] and doing a quirk calc it seams to pull this off she got at around a 160 times speed multiplier (The frame rate was 4000 to see the frames. They gave 25 as normal. 4000/25 = 160). To put that into perspective a baseball thrown by Felicity would travel at 4160m/s (mach 12) and have more kinetic energy behind it than some cars at highway speeds. There is no way they are hiting her without an aiming wish.

  This does not let her jump extra high, since gravity affects her in subjective time, but she isn't sure if there's a way around that restriction.

Throw a rock on a rope? You throw the rock, it gain a bunch of momentum, you then grab the rope and let it pull you along.

  What does she do?

Run out and throw stuff at them. We almost certainly have better reaction times then them so the fact they weren't there at the start means they must have spend a pasive wish that caused that. So 1 wish for invisibility/different starting location, 1 wish for flight/teleportation/portals and 1 wish for the beam. I am willing to bet they don't have good enough aim to hit Felicity while she is moving so finding and attacking them seams like the best move.
