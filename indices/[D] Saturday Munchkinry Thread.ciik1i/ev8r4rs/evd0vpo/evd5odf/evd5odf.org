  Throw a rock on a rope? You throw the rock, it gain a bunch of momentum, you then grab the rope and let it pull you along.

I'll answer things Felicity would have had opportunity to test, and this seems like one of them.

This doesn't work, the rock and rope all end up undergoing Weird Physics, and although the rock falls slowly, the rope tugs on it â€˜as normal' and arrests its momentum. If Felicity instead ties the rope to a solid object and lets go of the rock after throwing it, the rope breaks and the rock flies off into the distance.

(I'll confess it was a struggle to figure out how to grant a superspeed wish that actually looked and behaved something like superspeed, but I think this is a decent compromise.)
