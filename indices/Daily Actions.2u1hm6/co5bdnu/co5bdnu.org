Is it rational to follow patterns that you know will reduce the negative impacts of irrational behaviors that you can't make entirely go away?

For instance. I am mildly OCD and ADD. Over the decades, I have developed mental tricks and behaviors that I use to play these two tendencies against one another.

For instance. My keys, wallet, phone, and other absolutely critical bits and pieces of my life are absolutely always, every time put in the same place every day. I carry them in the same way on my body when I leave the house, and when I return to the house, they go in exactly the same place. No exceptions. My pens always run out of ink, I never lose them. I haven't locked my keys in my truck or lost my wallet in over twenty years. However, the rest of my physical possessions are far more fluid. Things that I do not need are allowed to enter rather chaotic states.

Ideally, there would be a happy medium between these two states, but I cannot manage that, so I've prioritized. For the critical things in life, I allow my OCD to have free reign. For the less critical things, I allow the ADD to have free reign.

These things have shifted over time. When I was young and working at disposajobs, getting to work on time was not really a priority. After I started doing professional work with benefits, I shifted that to an OCD category. I went from not caring about being on time to being 15 minutes early every day, and maintained that habit. Sick days and weather is the same. When I'm scheduled to be at work, I'll be there, unless my truck is flipped upside down in my driveway.

Basically, I pick and choose the bits and pieces of my life that I allow my irrationality to control.
