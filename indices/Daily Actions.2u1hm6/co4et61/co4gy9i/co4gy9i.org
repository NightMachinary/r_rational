That's a lesson I have yet to learn with my SO. I have extreme difficulty bordering on complete inability to concede when I don't feel I have done anything wrong. It's a miracle she hasn't broken up with me yet.

However, during the course of those arguments which never should have happened because I should have apologized at the beginning since there was no concievable gain to be had from having the argument, I make all kinds of rational arguments. So I've got that going for me, which is nice.
