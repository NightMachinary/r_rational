I also find that relationship arguments are never black and white, right and wrong, either. Even silly stuff like who took out the bins last.

The number of times I have been convinced I did it, and then realised I was wrong ... the arguments are always the sort of trivial shit that our minds love confabulating about to make us feel better about ourselves. I don't trust myself about that shit anymore.

Just another reason to drop the argument.
