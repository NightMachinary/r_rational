I use a more meta technique to increase the chance I actually use tricks of the form everyone is mentioning here. I explicitly name every trick something short and mentally 'call my attacks' anime style.

The combination of sheer cheesiness and mild awesomeness strongly reinforces the habit of using these techniques. It's a little like a mnemonic system -- the fundamental rule of every single one is to make weird and ridiculous associations. As a plus, it also spices up your inner dialogue when you think "Hang on, is doing this really any use to me presently? I invoke True Goal Focus! /(inner voice echoes awesomely, battle aura, war cries, etc.)/" You might laugh, but I've found myself operating way more sensibly since I've adopted this approach.

Meanwhile, simply /naming/ each trick confers numerous benefits -- they're more easily available, you quickly can run through a list of them, it's easier to reference them in journals for tracking purposes, and it opens your awareness to the possibility of building more advanced techniques by combining simpler ones. The heuristic /name and conquer/ is frequently used in mathematics, where the power of good notation for usefully applying reductionism has long been known. For an aspiring rationalist trying to train noticing, naming stuff is the equivalent of chunking. ("Bah, I really don't want to deal with the DMV today...wait, /Ugh Field/ detected! Counterattack: /One Small Step/...")

Quick regex search through my journal reveals several techniques mentioned in the last three weeks. Here are the two I've found most useful.

*One Small Step*: Apply reductionism to any complex task or problem, especially one that's generating an Ugh Field. Break it into small pieces and do just the first piece. If you can't muster up the motivation to do even that, you haven't decomposed it enough. You must be totally willing to kick common sense to the curb while doing this decomposition. Tasks are infinitely divisible as far as you're concerned.

As an example, I had to fill out some forms and mail a letter, and I was totally demotivated. So at one point, an item on my decomposition was 'look for stamps in desk drawer'. This literally takes all of 5 seconds. It was the only piece of the task I did that day. But I kept reapplying this to the task for days, and it was done in less than a week. Had I let myself procrastinate, nothing would have happened for a couple of months, and that slight niggling feeling of guilt would keep floating around in my head. This is the single most effective anti-procrastination technique I've found, because it requires basically zero willpower.

*Look One Step Ahead*: I think this is my #1 real life application of instrumental rationality. I try to look one step ahead as much as possible, in order to gain a more long-term perspective. I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks, and now I find myself looking /two/ steps ahead, because one step ahead has slowly turned into unconscious behavior. I figure this will extend to several more steps if I keep practicing.
