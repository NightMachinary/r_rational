Practice noticing. Relevant blog posts: [[http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2014/09/what-its-like-to-notice-things.html][1]] [[http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-to-train-noticing.html][2]], but also more broadly see the cognitive behavioral therapy literature on how noticing things is a key step in changing things.

For me, an excellent thing to practice noticing was when I open a browser tab as a method of procrastination. I kept a piece of paper and a pen next to me, and put a check mark every time I noticed that I'd ctrl+t'd out of habit. Other people have had great success with tracking calories as a method of noticing what they eat.

The idea is that once you notice something, you need to exert less effort to change it, because you actually know how the effort needs to be used.
