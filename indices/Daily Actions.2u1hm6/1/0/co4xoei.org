The calorie counting has definitely worked for me. I use an app that lets me enter what I eat and gives me a daily target for calories consumed. I'm pretty sure that the apps estimated calories are not that accurate usually, but the fact that I am noting it down and thinking about what I eat seems to be the more important thing. I have to decide "is that really worth the X number of calories I would get by consuming it? How much do I really want that"
