Tracking stuff is really useful. About a month ago I started carefully timing myself at work with Emacs org-mode timers and task tracking. I've managed to increase my productive time by about 20% since then.

Fair warning, if you do this you'll be left reeling in disbelief at how little real work you're doing. 50% efficiency should not be surprising at first.
