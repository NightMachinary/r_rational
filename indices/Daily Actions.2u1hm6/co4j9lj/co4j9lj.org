- A nice trick is thinking about "What would someone else do in my position?" This generally makes you think less biased about your situation and opens up new avenues of thought.
- Frequently think: "Does what I'm doing right now contribute to my larger goal(s)?" This is a general case of the advice given by [[/u/rumblestiltsken]]. Long arguments with people you care about doesn't contribute to the larger goal of making those people happy and like you.
- Another thing I use frequently is treating a single decision as if I was making that same decision for all similar things in the future. Example: My car was almost out of gas and I could either fill it at a station on my way or wait until it was completely out of gas (e.g. the light on your dashboard goes on). Clearly filling it up then was the better option, since I had time and occasion to do it, but my brain was coming up with complex reasons why I shouldn't do it right then. Then I acted as if the decision would be the same for all similar occasions and it'd became very clear how much time I'd waste in a lifetime of making that decision.
- Second-guess your own decisions and statements. (Unless your brain gets really panicky about that!)

I know I do more things, but I'm extremely tired and my brain is running at very low speed.
