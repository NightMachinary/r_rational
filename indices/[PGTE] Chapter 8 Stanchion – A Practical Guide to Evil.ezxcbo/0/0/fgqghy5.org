I think Hune was mostly just a general. She's intelligent, capable, and has roots with Cat going back to Legion training. She doesn't particularly like Cat and wasn't drawn into her band of followers, but she's a capable soldier and strategist. Pretty sure she's just doing her job regardless of who is in charge of the army.
