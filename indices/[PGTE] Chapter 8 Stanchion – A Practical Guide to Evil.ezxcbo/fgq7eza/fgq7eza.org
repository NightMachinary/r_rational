So I don't really know much about Hune, the only notable thing being that she's an ogre (don't know what ogres look like other than being large) and isn't part of Cat's inner circle (or what's left of it).

From what I do remember she wasn't too thrilled with dying for another woman's dream, and just wanted to finish her service in the imperial army and leave to do her own thing. This was back when cat was still with the empire, so I'm not what made her decide to continue following cat so loyally? Can anyone recap Hune's journey?
