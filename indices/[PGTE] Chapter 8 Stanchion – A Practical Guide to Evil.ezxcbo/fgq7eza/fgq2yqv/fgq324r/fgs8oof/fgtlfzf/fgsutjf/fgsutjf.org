I have to agree with this quite a bit.

I love Practical Guide, but this timeskip has been extreme. It was understandable when we skipped through bits like her being at Legion school to get to the important parts, but this entire war against the Dead King *is* the important part.

The story has mostly been continuous, going from major event to major event with plenty in between, up until the Empire Ever Dark, where we started having bigger skips. But it generally *showed* us major parts.

Now, it seems that many of the events we had been building up to in the previous book have just 'happened' and been glossed over and are back in the past now, along with a *lot* of interesting side treks and battles that we only find out after the fact.

Thanks for reminding me about the Bard. I hadn't even considered that. If there was no timeskip, it'd make sense as she is reeling from previous rejections and having to re-form her plans. But two *years* and nary a peep? Sure, she could be working behind the scenes, but Cat should at least have heard *rumors* and either made them a priority or at least be worried about them. Or, like you said, more direct contact with the Dread Empire of Praes or the Dead King using messengers and such to divide, taunt, or intimidate his enemies.

Honestly, it seems as if the author bit off more than he could chew. The series was supposed to end with the last Book, but it continued on and on. Now it seems he is determined to end it in this one, even if we have to leapfrog over things that the previous Book was building up to as being important events, but we still get things that are functional wastes of time (four chapters building up how important a new character is, only to kill him off and use him as a reason for Cat to be angry), important antagonists going completely ignored, and finding out that all that amazing work in the previous Book has only led to the "allied forces" achieving a stalemate.
