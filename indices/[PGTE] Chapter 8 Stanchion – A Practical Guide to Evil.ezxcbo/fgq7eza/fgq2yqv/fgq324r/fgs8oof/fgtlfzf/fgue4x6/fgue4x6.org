I still like the story, but this time skip is bizarre. This section reads more like a sequel to the story than a finale. And the story didn't actually get a finale. All the tension building up was the mark of an incredible storyteller. We got satisfying conclusion after conclusion, always with the next threat already established on the horizon.

The dead king was the next uber threat and the hammer wss ready to fall. But then he just stalls out for two years. Doesn't seem like that big of a threat anymore. I was expecting a desperate struggle for survival with heroes and villains snatching pyrrhic victories from the jaws of utter defeat. The drow and/or dwarves revealing themselves in a critical moment to shift the momentum. I was excited for Cat to finally get a name, and for Akua to finally get her punishment.

Instead, we skip two years. Nothing got resolved in two whole years. Really takes the wind out of the sails of the supposed Hidden Horror that he doesn't make real progress for two years
