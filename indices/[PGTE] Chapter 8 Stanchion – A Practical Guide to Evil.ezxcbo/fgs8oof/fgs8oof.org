All of the tension and life of this story had been drained out for me because of this two year time skip.

There were so many things set up to come to a head:

Heroes and villains finally getting started on working together. The grand alliance and dwarven and drow nations poised to strike at the dead king together. Malicia mind jacking the legions and setting a trap for black. Black heading to Praes as a claimant to the tower. The 3 month cease fire with the dead king coming to an end. Unstable politics in Procer, Callow, Praes, and the Free Cities. Twilight ways just got made and had yet to be used against the dead king in a major way. Cat is planning "something" for Akua.

CAT HAVING AN INCIPIENT NAME!!!

And so much more. But then we just skip... two... years? Two utterly unremarkable years of campaign against the dead king.

What happened to cat's Name? What did the drow and dwarves do for two whole years? Tombmaker promised to kick down Keters door by some deadline, and we're two years closer to that. Why hasn't Akua gotten her just deserts? Black went to Praes to do... politics?... for two years?

The dead king is supposed to be incredibly genre savvy. How is he bogged down in a two year stalemate as the only opponent of a grand alliance/crusade? Is malicia defeated so thoroughly that her only contribution is some barely mentioned lines about politics in the free cities?

And what about the Bard? Effectively gone from the story. She does absolutely nothing for two years, so she either works on a timescale that makes her no longer a relevant threat for the remainder of this story, or she's been doing background stuff this whole time and is going to Deus ex Machina her way cheaply back into the story.

Two entire years where it seems like none of the conflicts have progressed appreciably.
