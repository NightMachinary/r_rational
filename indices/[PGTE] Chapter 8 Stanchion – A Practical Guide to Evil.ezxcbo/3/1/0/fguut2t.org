Yeah this book feels like the start of a sequel more than the climax of the story we've followed this whole time.

And it's not like the climax happened and we missed it. It just utterly stalled for two entire years. That is an enormous amount of time to skip for the size of the threats they are up against. Really lowers the threat level of the dead king.
