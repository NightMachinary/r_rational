(You're welcome!)

Rather than the aliens, I was referring to the horses and mice and dogs and cats and the many other non-humans on planet Earth (other than fish and lower) which we can see undergoing REM sleep and pawing at the air as though chasing illusory rats and the like while they're asleep. That--the suggestion that humans are the only organisms on the planet that dream, despite our observations of non-human animals, especially domestic ones--was what I felt conflicted with suspension of disbelief.

Good fortune with your writing!
