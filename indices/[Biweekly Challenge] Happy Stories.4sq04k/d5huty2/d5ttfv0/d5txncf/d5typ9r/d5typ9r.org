  There's a brief paragraph explaining it; basically it's because the trauma inflicted on your brain when you experience negative emotions, such as fear, follow you into the dreamscape. It's the same mechanic that allows you to dream about regular things that make you happy.

Yes. I can see why the system as made could have that happen. But why would they allow it? Someone can spend a lifetime being tormented just because they watched a scary movie before they went to bed. Why aren't the protections against that?

  It's not so much that we have the ability to think thousands of times faster; it's that we have a largely unused portion of our brain that can be somewhat favorably married to the Simulation technology the narrator speaks about.
