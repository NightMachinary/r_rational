Oh, haha yeah. I can see that. I definitely know animals can dream, I just didn't really think about the implications in context. It'd be really easy for me to go back and fix that. Something along the line of the Alien making sweeping changes to the more complex animals to test the effect it would have (and then releasing them to see how well the technology would be transferred into subsequent generations)

So essentially he'd work his way up to working on humans. That's viable.
