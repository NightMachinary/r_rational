No; the implication is that dreaming isn't Dreaming. Yet. Dreaming is going to be the lifetime thing; the mental simulation in which we're as in control of it as we want to be. The narrator is still working on the technology. Nightmares are a current side effect but one he plans to resolve. He plans to take centuries, if not millennia, more to get to the Dreaming he mentions he wants for us in the end. We're still firmly in developer mode.

Uploading us...where? I'm confused. The technology itself is interfacing with our brain. The eventual goal is to allow you to, while asleep, utilize it to have your own simulated world to do with as you please. There's no actual mental transference going on; you are not being uploaded anywhere. If you like, you could almost think of it as a very specific, directed hallucination.
