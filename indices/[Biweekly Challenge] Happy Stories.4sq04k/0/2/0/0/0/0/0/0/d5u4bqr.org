  Have you never had a dream that seemed much longer than the time you spent asleep?

Yeah, but that's just because I suck at tracking time while I'm asleep. It's not the same as actually experiencing more time. It's the biological equivalent of changing the time on your computer.

Isn't that to be expected? You're not dreaming the whole time you're asleep.
