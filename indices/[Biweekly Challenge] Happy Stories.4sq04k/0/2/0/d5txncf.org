  Why are there nightmares?
#+end_quote

There's a brief paragraph explaining it; basically it's because the trauma inflicted on your brain when you experience negative emotions, such as fear, follow you into the dreamscape. It's the same mechanic that allows you to dream about regular things that make you happy.

It's not so much that we have the ability to think thousands of times faster; it's that we have a largely unused portion of our brain that can be somewhat favorably married to the Simulation technology the narrator speaks about. That part of the brain itself can't do much on its own; it's just a tool, a port if you will, that the narrator then plugs in his tech.
