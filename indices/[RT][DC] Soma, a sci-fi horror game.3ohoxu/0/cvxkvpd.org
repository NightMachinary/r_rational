Mhhhhhh I dunno how strongly the game addresses those things, honestly. Just about the only (rational-fic) thing I think it /really/ does well is an example of a /very/ alien Mind with good intentions, and how /incredibly badly/ that can end up going.

more to the point, almost none of the characters are what I'd call good rational characters. the only one who stands out is Catherine. Everyone else.... makes you lament human stupidity, most of the time.
