I guess I find it frustrating a sub focused on rationality can stay silent.

It is so easy and morally certain to issue a simple statement denouncing racism and state violence.

Surely a rational person can investigate why some people feel they need places away from messages about racial injustice.

Why should we be uncomfortable with discourse on the issue? What do we fear, unmasking those in our midst who hold antiquated, scientifically indefensible biases?

It is easy to halt dialog on an issue, when it doesn't affect you or your community.

"Stick to sports" indeed.

Edit: I suppose the mods didn't sign up to police speach in discussion threads. I just feel a little disappointed about one of my favorite communities.
