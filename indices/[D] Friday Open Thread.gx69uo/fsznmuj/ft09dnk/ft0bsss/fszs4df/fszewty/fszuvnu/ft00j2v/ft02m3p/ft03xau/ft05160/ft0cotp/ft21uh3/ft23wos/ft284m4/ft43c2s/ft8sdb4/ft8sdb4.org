Even in a place like this, the discussion is bound to get heated. To use your own words, it would turn this subreddit into a battleground, with ideological partisans entering on both sides and leaving the subreddit worse for the wear.

I can't imagine the moderators want to deal with that. I certainly wouldn't. And I doubt that they'd be willing to give you mod power, even if you were willing to volunteer (and you haven't) to do the vast amount of work to keep such a discussion civil.

And I don't blame them: even as someone who agrees with the point you're making, I wouldn't trust someone who starts the discussion by staking out an ideological position to moderate that same discussion fairly.

So, if there's no one who is both deemed suitable and willing to moderate such a discussion on this subreddit, the solution is to take the discussion elsewhere. Which you are free to do.
