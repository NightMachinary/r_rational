Except that this is the Friday open thread, which is explicitly not focused on a specific topic. The text in the original post mentions politics specifically, just not US politics.

My original statement was "I believe that black lives matter". Given that Germany has just signed anti-discrimination legislation, I'd say that the topic goed beyond US politics, though there is a US politics angle.
