You ever think that by banning political discussion here, the mods /keep/ this from being a place for the rationalists? I hear ScottAlexander et al have been coming down hard on the side of promoting Holocaust denialists lately - if the mods opened things up and banned the worst offenders, whose to say you wouldn't end up with a clear consensus that mirrored that of [[/r/TheMotte]] but just never went past allusion, just barely toeing whatever line was set while letting all of us know how pointless it was to assume the community endorses anything vaguely human?
