  I guess I find it frustrating a sub focused on rationality can stay silent.

Look at [[/r/themotte]] or [[/r/slatestarcodex]]. It is no given, at all, that the rationality-adjacent won't have atrocious politics [ I mean even you are a one of those dirty neolibs after all :) ] And at least my own experience has been that in subreddits with nearly a unified voice on the topic, you still get trolls and unwelcome, insane, brutality-apologist posters.

AlexanderWales has made it pretty clear above, I think, that he does not have the energy to deal with that, and I don't think he owes this community any responsibility to do so, even leaving aside that I'd defer to his wisdom on just how bad it might get if it were opened up.

I really get that you may want to engage in political discussion with people who share some of the rationality-adjacent background that's common around here - you might try out [[/r/leftrationalism]], which despite being a socialist sub, would probably make a better political fit than this place anyway.
