Well, I just typed up a point-by-point response to this post, and then deleted it before posting. Why? Because I realized that I was falling into the culture war trap. I don't want to do that. Please take the conversation to any of the hundreds of subs that allow it. I suggest, [[/r/TheMotte]], if you want to discuss it with rationalist-adjacent people.

No one is halting your dialog. This just isn't the place for politics.
