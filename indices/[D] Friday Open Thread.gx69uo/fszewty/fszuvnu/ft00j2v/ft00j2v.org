Understandable. I did not check the rules of this subreddit before I made my comment, just the text in the Friday Open Thread post.

I understand why there is a rule against US Politics in this thread. Other subreddits I frequent have become battlegrounds, with ideological partisans entering on both sides and leaving the subreddit worse for the wear.

With that said, I think that this subreddit should address what is going on outside the boarders of [[/r/Rational]], in a single stickied thread or a one-time post if an ongoing dialogue is not attractive.

Denounce Racism. Denounce Whataboutism in defense of Racism. I believe equality and equity to be the only rational stances on this matter.

I hope your friends and family are well. I hope you are well.
