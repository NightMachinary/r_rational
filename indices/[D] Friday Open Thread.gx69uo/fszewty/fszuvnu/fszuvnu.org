  I believe that Black Lives Matter
#+end_quote

This subreddit has a blanket ban on US politics. Read the rules before commenting.

To answer some obvious objections: yes, "black lives matter" is considered a political statement, in the same way that I would consider any slogan of a political movement to be itself political, even if the slogan itself is obvious or anodyne when considered by itself.

And yes, a blanket ban on politics favors the status quo, or if not the status quo, then whoever is winning a cultural, ideological, or political war. That said, the cost of allowing politics is that this subreddit becomes yet another battlefield, which it's been in the past. People need places to take care of themselves, escapes from the constant anxiety and tension of the real world, and a subreddit that's primarily for the discussion of fiction /should be/ one of those places.

Yes, this means that it's also a place for odious people to not get confronted about their odiousness, and no, I wouldn't want every place to adopt our policy. I'll also note that this subreddit has a lot of readers who aren't from America (though they might still be impacted by or care about American problems, or have their own similar problems).

On a personal note, I live in Minnesota and have been feeling stressed, anxious, angry, and helpless. I have friends and family living in the Twin Cities that are helping to organize and provide aid to those who need it, both with the protests and riots. This will probably be the last mod note that I write on the subject, and I'll let the other two mods handle reports for a bit, since this particular topic has been wearing pretty heavily on me, and I doubt my ability to remain objective and/or mentally healthy.
