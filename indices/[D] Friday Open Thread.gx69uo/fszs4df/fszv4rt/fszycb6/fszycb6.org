  The cost of allowing politics is that this subreddit becomes yet another battlefield, which it's been in the past.

Sure. Rules exist for the purpose of either actualizing a desired outcome or preventing the actualization of an undesired outcome. "No discussion of US politics" is intended to prevent threads in this subreddit from being derailed. That's an undesired outcome. It's understandable that you would want to prevent that.

But I feel like the reason the Friday thread exists in the first place is to give people a chance to go off the rails and discuss things that aren't appropriate in the rest of the subreddit. Obviously there are more appropriate places to discuss politics, but there are also more appropriate places to discuss different ways to plot meteorological data and the cost of living in Portugal. Sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here.
