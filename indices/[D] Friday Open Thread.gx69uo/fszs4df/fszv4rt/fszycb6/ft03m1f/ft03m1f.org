It wasn't just 'derailing'. It incited slapfights and brigading and all the other culture war mainstays. Frankly it was just more trouble than it's worth. It sucks that it means we don't discuss important and divisive current events here, but it also means we don't have to listen to Outgroup trying to peddle their wares and pick fights, either.
