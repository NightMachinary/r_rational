I have been on mandatory 50-hours-a-week overtime for about 3 months now (energy sector "essential" work). There have been times in the past when I exceeded this by a fair margin, but never mandatory and never for this long.

This combined with canceling my regular weekly sports because of COVID has had a very detrimental effect on my mood. My wife said "I miss my husband" last night, and I can't say that she's wrong. Even when I'm home I feel exhausted and moody.

And now the workload looks like it may be increasing, and they're wondering if they'll have to increase hours worked further. I'm thinking of bailing out, and I'm actually considering getting into programming/coding instead. I noticed that I love building excel worksheets to automate all the things I have to do regularly at work, and I figured that's pretty similar to coding.

With an eye toward employability, would you guys recommend taking a "Coding Bootcamp" class? Or is just knowing how enough? I finished all of the challenges at [[https://www.learnpython.org/]] a few years ago, but when tried to do The Python Challenge, I got stuck on the 3rd one because I couldn't figure out how to make Python interact with another program on my computer or the internet.

Anyway, just wanted to vent and say a month of "quarantine" sounds really nice about now.
