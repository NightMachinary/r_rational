Unless you're sitting on a huge nest egg or your wife can shoulder the family's expenses for the foreseeable future, giving up your job is a very risky gamble right now. Worrying about employment is way more stressful than any 50 hour week.

If you're thinking about a major career transition, it's safer to first give yourself time to sleep on it and set up foundations. Don't bail out on a "grass is greener" mentality.

In the meantime, look for ways to wind down after a long day/week. Maybe ask your wife for her input? It sounds like both of you are honest with your feelings and there's a lot of stress relieving activities that are made infinitely easier with a partner.
