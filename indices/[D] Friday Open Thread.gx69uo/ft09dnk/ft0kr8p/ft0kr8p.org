In my personal experience, Coding Bootcamps are a gamble, but also the fastest way to switch to a programming career.

The more you need out of a Coding Bootcamp, the harder you will have to work AND the less likely the gamble will pay off. If you just need work experience to put on your resume so companies don't skip you over, (Coding Bootcamps should have a big capstone project), it honestly isn't much of a gamble. You are trading in money for time.

If you need to learn actual coding/need help passing technical interviews/etc., then it depends on how badly you want to get out of your current position. It will require a lot of hard work and constant networking to make it pay off. I'm not sure if it's worth it in general, but it may be worth it for you.
