I feel like "she died of old age" is kind of stretching it. Like if you cast a spell on someone so time sped up and their heart gave out and then you shake your head sadly and say "His heart just ran out of beats" I mean yes it would literally be true it's also because you made them use up 200 million beats.

What I'm saying is if I was an genie forced to settle rules-lawyer disputes in this setting and someone said Saint can't be rezzed because she died of "natural causes" I think I might agree but I'd be making a really exasperated face.
