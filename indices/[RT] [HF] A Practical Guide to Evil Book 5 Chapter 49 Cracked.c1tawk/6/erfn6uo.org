Having seen Saint in her last stand i could believe that she was potentially a threat or at least the closest thing they had to threatening the Dead King. Also loved using time as a weapon with a cost even if she was still mortal eleven years was a price that Cat could pay much more easily than Pilgrim or Saint, and at the same time almost worthless against the Dead King or most of her other potential problems like White Knight.

But at the same time it's hard to say if that last time play was a realm thing or if everything got shifted forward the latter leaves kind of huge problems with Vivienne and Hakram in charge of Callow for probably too long, but even the former potentially has a lot of backlash it's uncertain that Pilgrim would be able to survive it. Also who the heck is going to wear the crown? My money is Pilgrim cause that's easily the way that screws over Cat the most.
