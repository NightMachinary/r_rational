Huh. So Cat aged them both by 11 years (12?), or aged everyone in "this broken realm?" Because that would probably come close to killing Pilgrim too, so I'm guessing it's just Saint, but then why would Cat be touched by it too? Maybe it's a required sacrifice for such a powerful prayer.

Still, very cool solution. Also interesting implications about what she is, now, if she's mortal but still somewhat resistant to aging.
