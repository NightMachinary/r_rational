Holy crap, I just remembered the perfect counterpoint. After the battle with the silver spears (or whatever the hell they were called, the hero who was shot in the face) they have a funeral and everyone goes up to offer a secret to the funeral pyre. They do this so the dead can bargain with the demons once they get to the hells.
