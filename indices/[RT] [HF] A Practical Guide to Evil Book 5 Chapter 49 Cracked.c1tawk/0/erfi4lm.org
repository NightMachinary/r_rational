Prediction: The Tyrant is going to put on the crown and sacrifice himself. Tyrant arranged all of this, with the Bard's help, to give himself a deathbed redemption arc. This was his plan all along: to do as much evil as possible, and then end it all with betraying Below by getting redeemed. After all, he was on borrowed time the whole way, and he gets to dodge being sent to one of the Hells.
