I'm not sure there's that much evidence to support her being somewhat resistant to aging. In the first chapter she's noted to be close to 16, i mean as close to any age as an infant put into an orphanage can be said to be with any certainty, and i don't think we get any explicit mentions of her birthday/s but time has passed. I'd say that the very least she's in her late teens and oldest is maybe mid twenties and from there another eleven years puts her in her thirties generously. And while her thirties isn't the most youthful she could be it's by no means completely out of the question for her to be well in fighting shape if nothing else.
