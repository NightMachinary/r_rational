Cat's protection against it is just rather different, whether she will naturally age at all while the high priestess of night is in doubt, but a miracle like this would likely hit a villain just as hard, though it might invoke a direct clash between the sisters and the GB so maybe not. Her aging here is likely more of a price than a sign of her actually aging naturally otherwise.
