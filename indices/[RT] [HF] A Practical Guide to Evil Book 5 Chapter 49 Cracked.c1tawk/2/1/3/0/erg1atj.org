Do we know if she was aging while she was the Squire? I can't recall offhand if we get anything more than the semi-frequent mentions of her being shorter and less impressive than people expect of her, I'm not sure how easily we can gauge her age in uhh not absolute terms but in physical aging if that's close enough to get my point across.
