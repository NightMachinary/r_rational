Isn't that basically what everyone with any power tries to do? Disliking someone because they try to use their power to make the world a better place by preventing the rise of a massive threat seems a bit silly. Why would it make sense for her to respect the "right" of villains to forge a terrible new threat that could end up causing harm on a massive scale.

This perspective seems particularly hypocritical given that Catherine has been trying to do the exact same thing on a vastly greater scale in her self-assigned role as Savior of Callow. What "right" does she have to commit horrific crimes in the pursuit of her vision for Callow?
