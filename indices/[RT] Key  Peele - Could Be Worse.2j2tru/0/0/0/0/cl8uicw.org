  Actually, it's pretty accurate. You control

  - your action, and

  - your reaction

  That's all there is to it. Do you, umm, do you disagree with that?
#+end_quote

I /would/ disagree with that, but there's a more important problem with your model.

You assume that everyone has complete and total control over their emotions. From that, you assume automatically that there is then a right way to act. That is a non sequitur.

If you have complete control over whether you're resentful or accepting, and then you chose to be resentful instead of accepting, you've failed, according to Stoicism. But why should it be that way?

The only reason why these things sound like the wrong thing is word choice. Obviously you wouldn't want to be resentful, and you'd want to be accepting. But you'd obviously also rather put deliberate emphasis on upholding high standards than fail to respond to substandard situations.

The issue with Stoicism (and its sibling philosophies) is that one particularly common set of word choices is arbitrarily selected to be the right ones. This choice *does not* follow from your starting assertions, nor from a pursuit of an ill-defined "greater-good".

  It's not self-delusion; it's the most radical form of self-acceptance.
#+end_quote

That doesn't mean anything. The topic has nothing to do with self-acceptance.
