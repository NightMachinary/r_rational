Here is my problem with Stoicism: it really, really pushes you into worshipping walls, and although in the ideal case, where everything is perfectly clearcut, it would be awesome; in the real world, though, bounded ego, bounded self-control, and (most importantly) the fact that a Stoic attitude is by its nature imperfect in judging what you can and can't control and thus will sometimes just plain fuck you over in a situation where, if you were feeling normal emotional suffering, might succeed in finding a way out of your condition - these conditions make the success of Stoicism doubtful. To advocate for the pursuit of joy through self-delusion and mutilation of your own world-map is at best wishful thinking and at worst a blatant attempt to get people to kill their sapience-ness. Also, CBT seems to me (as someone who has done it in the pursuit of solving mental health issues) a lot more like recalibration of a badly faulty emotional state and set of responses and strategies than deliberate forcing of all responses to be happiness.
