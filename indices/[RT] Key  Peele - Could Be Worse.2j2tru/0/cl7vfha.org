Let's see how this does here.

The two prisoners in this video aren't typical rationalists: they're in a situation that doesn't quite allow for the feel-good heaven-be-damned attitude that seems so prevalent in transhumanist literature. Instead, they're totally at another's mercy, and there is no way to escape or even fight back. So what do they do?

They take the advice of the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus, who says:

#+begin_quote
  *You exert no control over the territory*; everything you currently think you control in the territory can be taken away from you. The only thing that's truly in your control is your map - specifically, the models that predict your emotional reactions to things. Change how you perceive things, and you can change how you react to them; *and then, nothing can ever make you unhappy*. (Except for mental illness. Haha, just kidding; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy][/this can fix that, too./]])
#+end_quote

... Okay, maybe that's not a direct quote, but [[http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html][it's pretty damn close.]]

Well. That's my particular interpretation of rationality under total lack of control, at least. Does anyone else have a conflicting opinion? A different opinion of what would be rational to do in this situation?
