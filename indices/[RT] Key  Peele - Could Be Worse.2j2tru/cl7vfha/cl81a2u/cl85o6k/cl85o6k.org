  a Stoic attitude is by its nature imperfect in judging what you can and can't control
#+end_quote

Actually, it's pretty accurate. You control

- your action, and

- your reaction

That's all there is to it. Do you, umm, do you disagree with that?

I think you're taking it to literally ... or maybe not literally enough. Have you read the Enchiridion? It explains a lot of this.

  thus will sometimes just plain fuck you over in a situation where, if you were feeling normal emotional suffering, might succeed in finding a way out of your condition
#+end_quote

Interesting POV, though I'm not sure where you're getting this from. You're missing the point if you interpret Stoicism as missing out on opportunities because you think they're not in your control. Stoicism doesn't ask you to stop trying; any action is necessarily fine if it is virtuous (ie, not particularly opposing the greater-good). All it asks you to do is to accept failure when it happens. Negative visualization and the other Stoic techniques are all designed to help with this kind of acceptance: stop living in the past; accept it, move on, and learn from your mistakes.

  To advocate for the pursuit of joy through self-delusion and mutilation of your own world-map is at best wishful thinking and at worst a blatant attempt to get people to kill their sapience-ness.
#+end_quote

First off, the aim isn't joy. The aim is /tranquility/, which is the word the Stoics use for "not being disturbed by strong emotions". If you don't let things you cannot control unduly affect you, you'll be tranquil as a tangelo. It's not self-delusion; it's the most radical form of self-acceptance.
