Really? Huh; it worked fine for me in Chrome and Safari. What happens when you click the first link on [[https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#tbm=vid&q=key+and+peele+could+be+worse+site:vimeo.com][this page]]? If that doesn't work, maybe just try another browser. :/

Ninja ETA: It seems it won't play if you're running NoScript. If you temporarily allow Vimeo and VimeoCdn, the video should play fine. Just remember to revoke permissions at the end. (Credit to [[/u/MrAristo]] for figuring this out.)
