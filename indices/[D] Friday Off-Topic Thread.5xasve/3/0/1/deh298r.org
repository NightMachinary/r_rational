So, skimmed that thread, and: You're doing it wrong, because: In the same way they're confused that you don't enjoy [ACTIVITY], you're confused that they /do/ enjoy [ACTIVITY]. The "doing it wrong" comes from attacking them over it. Humaning protip: If you find yourself attacking someone, you're doing it wrong.

Better to go "nope, not interested, have fun." and leave it at that. If pressed, sure, explain why YOU don't like it... but don't explain it as if they shouldn't like it either... although on the gripping hand, that thing there one voice of dissent lets other dissent is probably a good thing.

In terms of JUST exploring what "normal" people do... Most of the time it's dull AF. But the act of going out for a drink isn't what makes it boring, it's what the people who're doing it end up talking about. I have had amazingly deep and meaningful conversations in all kinds of "normal" and "crazy" situations.

Which part of the world are you in? I may be able to point you at some people.

A somewhat harder but way more liberating thing to do is to just start doing the thing that interests you, and DGAF when people run away because they're not interested. Want to talk about rationality? Just start talking about it. Want to make something? Start making something.

Note: It's definitely harder to, say, pull out a laptop and start coding at most parties, but still doable, and you may find a kindred soul that way.
