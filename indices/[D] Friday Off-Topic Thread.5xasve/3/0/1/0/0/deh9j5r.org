I mean, sure - those are all good points! It's working for you. How would you tell if you're in a local maxima?

(My best bet would be job related - I've gotten 3 out of 4 of my jobs socially, and they've all been better than the one I got "normally".)

The point I'm trying to make is that like with everything, the people are more important than the activity - so to @Magodo, it sounds like you just need to go after different people, not different activities with the same people.
