Referring to [[https://i.imgur.com/XqSk7fP.png][this]] thread, I too have little to no social skills and I can count on one hand the number of close friends I have. Tbh I find your capacity to refuse a drink with friends pretty admirable.

I rarely refuse myself in the hope that I might finally find it fun or to explore what "normal" people do in their free time. And so far I always ended up really bored wishing I'd stayed back home. I sometimes feel like I should stop trying to change and just tell people to fuck off like you did. Telling people my opinion on why drinking and parties are stupid is also something I'd never do but would absolutely love to.
