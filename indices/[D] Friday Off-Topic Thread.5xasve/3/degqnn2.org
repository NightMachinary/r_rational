Theoretical question-asking...

An asker of questions always must consider the answers that he wants to glean in formulating his inquiries. For an example, let's take a simple question:

#+begin_quote
  What's your favorite color?
#+end_quote

This sentence offers up two very obvious ambiguities for our examination.

First, /what do I mean by =color=?/\\
- Is =white=, =black=, or =gray= an acceptable response, or must the answer have nonzero saturation?\\
- Speaking of saturation, in what format should the response be delivered--a simple word, an RGB value (decimal or hexadecimal?), a Pantone CMYK reference, or something else?\\
- Should the queried person respond with a /specific/ color, like =RGB 0 128 0=, or with a /range/ of color, like =green in general= or =bright, highly-saturated green=?

Second, /what do I mean by =favorite=?/\\
- Speaking of RGB vs. CMYK, /in what context/ is the queried person expected to be thinking of the color? Is this his favorite color in isolation on a computer screen, or on someone else's car that he sees on the road, or on his own car, or on his casual polo shirts?\\
- Must the receiver provide a /reason/ for his preference ("I like green because I like forests and tree frogs."), or can he merely say "I like green." and have done?

In this specific case, since all these clarifications change the meaning of the question only slightly, my opinion is that the most economical course of action is merely asking:

#+begin_quote
  What's your favorite color? Be detailed.
#+end_quote

However, not all questions can be wrapped up so nicely. I recently had the pleasure of [[http://np.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/5vpocy/neckbeard_doesnt_like_parties/de4f6np][receiving]] the /hilariously/-vague question:

#+begin_quote
  Who's your perfect girl?
#+end_quote

I chuckled when I saw it!\\
- Does =girl= mean =child= (offspring, or subject of babysitting?) or =romantic partner= (or is the asker implying with such a belittling word that the person would be my /vassal/ rather than my /ally/ in the relationship?)?\\
- By using =is= rather than =would be=, is the enquirer asking me to describe a current /real-life/ object of greed rather than a /hypothetical/ person?

In the past (IIRC), I've posed the inquiry "Describe your ideal long-term romantic partner.", which obviously is /far/ more specific.
