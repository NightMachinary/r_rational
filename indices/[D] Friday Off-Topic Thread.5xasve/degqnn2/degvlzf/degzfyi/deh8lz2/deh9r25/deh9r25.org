FYI: I notice a pretty huge different in experience between normal beers (budweiser, etc) and "fancy" beers (allagash, three philosophers...).

I generally find one fancy beer to be excellent for thinking, in basically the same way as it's a social lubricant - thoughts slide around real easily, and I don't censor my internal thinking as much / at all. Prior to discovering fancy beers, beer never resulted in a good thinking experience for me. YMMV.
