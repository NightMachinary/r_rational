I doubt that any alcohol-containing food would taste better than my favorite meal, General Tso's chicken.

I don't like the idea of making myself stupider on purpose, even if only temporarily.

I don't see the point of making myself more social only temporarily.

Liking the background of a beverage and liking the beverage itself are two separate items. I like General Tso's chicken, but I /definitely/ wouldn't care if someone came up to me and started rambling about the history of Chinese-USAian recipes.

(laughs) I've traveled to enough places to know that I don't enjoy traveling. Being vaguely interested in something that the place contains (and, again, being interested in a drink's background differs immensely from being interested in the drink itself) definitely isn't enough to entice me.

  I quite enjoyed parties where I could join a smaller group engaged in lengthy discussion

Finding and following an interesting thread on Reddit or the Paradox modding forums is /much/ easier than searching for an interesting conversation IRL.
