Fair enough! I'd initially written those points in response to someone asking why /anyone/ might want to consume alcohol, so they're certainly particular to my own motivations.

#+begin_quote
  I doubt that any alcohol-containing food would taste better than my favorite meal, General Tso's chicken.
#+end_quote

Eh. Foodspace (and drinkspace) is large. I did look it up, though, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Tso's_chicken#Recipes][wikipedia]] tells me that /traditional basic ingredients [for Tso's Chicken] include: sauce: soy sauce, rice wine, rice wine vinegar, red pepper flakes/... though all the alcohol might be boiled off by the end. Still, de gustibus non est disputandum and all.

#+begin_quote
  I don't like the idea of making myself stupider on purpose, even if only temporarily.
#+end_quote

That's typically incidental to the main effect, though, which to me is more sort of a warm, friendly inner glow which can complement similar feelings from other sources (e.g. after a long day of intense hiking/biking, cuddling up with my partner and dog on the couch watching a movie with a cold beer in hand... the slight buzz only serves to enhance the experience). And your cognitive abilities aren't /that/ impaired at that point (6-12 drinks in, sure, but after 1 you can still hold plenty sophisticated discourse)

#+begin_quote
  I don't see the point of making myself more social only temporarily.
#+end_quote

Is it because of the /social/ part or the /temporary/ part? Because of course most everything's temporary, in the end.

#+begin_quote
  Liking the background of a beverage and liking the beverage itself are two separate items. I like General Tso's chicken, but I definitely wouldn't care if someone came up to me and started rambling about the history of Chinese-USAian recipes.
#+end_quote

Ah, this'd be another one of the "subject to personal preference" bits. I love knowing the history of a place or a thing, it definitely stimulates my enjoyment of it -- to use a nerdier e.g., I might like a sword because it looks cool and is sharp or w/e, but if you tell me the story of how some poor blacksmith discovered a new forging technique that enabled that sharpness, which revolutionized armed combat because now the sword could puncture previously impenetrable armor, etc. I'd certainly appreciate the sharpness more.

#+begin_quote
  If I'm bored, I can think about programming or video games or Naruto fanfiction instead.
#+end_quote

Ah, but social obligation dictates that one has to stay for another two hours and it's too noisy to think about those things! Whatever will one do!

#+begin_quote
  The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about, 'ttebayo.
#+end_quote

To make an implication a bit more explicit -- being social serves plenty of instrumental goals too, e.g. in closing business deals over drinks, connecting with your coworkers and boss after work (thereby facilitating promotion/career advancement), networking with strangers to open up opportunities down the line, even interviewing for new positions (e.g. in my experience in academia it's common to take applicants out for dinner/drinks after they give their job talk). It doesn't have to just be for the pleasure of others' company and can be thought of as a skill as any other.

#+begin_quote
  I already make art through programming (and fanfiction?).
#+end_quote

Neat! I take it there's some algorithm that generated that expanding jaggy soap bubble picture?

As for the response in the email thread, I think it's subject to what sorts of gatherings you're attending.
