  Telling people my opinion on why drinking and parties are stupid is also something I'd never do but would absolutely love to.

I'll bite -- why do you think drinking and parties are stupid? I've encountered the "drinking is dumb" thing in this and adjacent communities a fair bit, but then in my day-to-day life it seems drinking is popular all through the upper reaches of accomplishment/intelligence/scientific aptitude/etc. (maybe not independently of wealth, though -- usually those people are into the expensive craft beer scene, or own a vineyard, or fancy sipping their many-decades-aged scotch in the evenings, or w/e). A love of social events/dinner parties goes pretty hand-in-hand here, too (though with obvious sampling bias, of the sort where you ask "why are so many of my friends more popular than me?").

A short while back I came up with a quick list of reasons why I'll personally consume alcohol, in no particular order:

1.  It's found in a variety of tasty beverages (and occasionally foods, e.g. in sauces). In beverage form it can enhance the taste of certain foods
2.  In mild-moderate doses it has pleasing psychoactive qualities, i.e. a pleasant buzz
3.  It can serve as a social lubricant through direct modification of your attitude and personality
4.  It can serve as a social lubricant by giving you a common ground with which to connect with someone, owing to its immense popularity -- e.g. you can talk about the production or history of wine-making, or what flavors you like and dislike, etc.
5.  It's historically and culturally important in many places and you can get a deeper appreciation of a place by sampling its drinks (e.g. by going on a tasting tour and exploring the history of wine-making in France or beer in Belgium or something, never mind local scenes)
6.  Mild consumption might be good for you, or it's at least associated with decreased mortality (a classic "j-shaped curve" is borne out in a lot of studies; e.g. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17159008]]). Probably confounded, but there are plenty of plausible mechanisms
7.  It's something to do while bored which will make you less bored (e.g. at a noisy house party it lowers your threshold for entertainment -- flailing around on the dance floor is more fun while tipsy; related to the pleasing psychoactive qualities mentioned above)
8.  Its consumption is traditionally a symbolic/ritualistic behavior in a lot of circumstances (e.g. celebrations), and there are a lot of benefits to consistent tradition and ritual
9.  A lot of people like it, and to some you'll stand out -- not necessarily in a good way -- if you don't. There's a social stigma against not drinking, and failing to conform may rob you of some ability to resist social pressure elsewhere
10. Many activities and games become more challenging while under the influence, so it's a good way to handicap yourself if something's become too easy -- e.g. in drinking games
11. It can be fun to prepare alcoholic drinks and experiment with different combinations of flavors in the same way that it's fun to cook or draw or make anything else -- it can serve as an outlet for artistic expression
12. More an absence of a - than a +, but you can easily lessen the unpleasant effects of alcohol consumption (e.g. hangovers) by drinking in moderation, staying well hydrated, not drinking on an empty stomach, getting a full night's sleep, and maybe taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement

As for parties, I've found it /really/ depends on the sort of party you're going to. I attended dozens of house parties in undergrad and soon realized that the sorts of 50+ person parties where you stand around trying to talk over extremely loud music while nursing a beer were not for me, but that I quite enjoyed parties where I could join a smaller group engaged in lengthy discussion, with some quiet sounds serving as a background, with the occasional pre-planned activity (e.g. board games, video games, movies, dinner -- usually potluck style, and so on) to break up the evening.
