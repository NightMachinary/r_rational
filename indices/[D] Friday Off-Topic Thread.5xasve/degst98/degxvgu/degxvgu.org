I think the breeding ramifications are interesting here. It makes perfect sense for the defensive typing to sum to 1, since there's a corresponding physical effect. If a pokemon was 50% and 50% fire, it could be literally half fire and half ice.

It's the offensive typing where the problem comes in. If you breed a Charizard to have hotter fire, does it also fly worse?

If so, why? After all, if all mutations necessarily came with an equal reduction then organisms couldn't really evolve. There are obviously trade-offs in evolution, but it's not 1:1 and not always sacrificing like for like. Sometimes the downside is just increased energy costs for growing, using, and maintaining the feature.

To put it in reverse, if you surgically removed a Charizard's ability to produce flame, surely it wouldn't become a better dragon by magic.
