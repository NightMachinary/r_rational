This is actually a great point. Having the defenses capped and the offenses independent sounds much more reasonable than all or nothing.

Also, the concept you brought up of increased energy costs is intriguing to me (even if you didn't mean it as a mechanical proposal) ...something like, for every point in an offensive type past, say 30%, have a corresponding increase in endurance usage of moves of that type? There feels like there's /something/ there.

Thanks!
