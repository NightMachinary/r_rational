I supervise a delivery department, and the Google maps version of Earth is my go-to resource for giving directions. Seeing the area in 3D makes my descriptions of where to park the trucks and how to find paths to entryways make a lot more sense to my people when they can see them from the side rather than from above.

Certainly more sense than when they could only see streets and I had to draw any more detailed maps.

Surrogate spatial concepts!

That said, as Svalbard points out, I do live in a part of California that Google pays more attention to than, say, rural Wyoming.
