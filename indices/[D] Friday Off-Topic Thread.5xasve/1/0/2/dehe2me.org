I'm a traffic engineer and even having a photo every few months is great. You can see when things were put in, what an intersection looked like around the time of an accident, etc.

And taking measures is a godsend. Seeing sightlines. Without google earth and streetview I don't know /how/ we did this job without going on site visits constantly. I mean, we still go on site and that's still vital, but if we need to know the lane width real quick we can measure it from the desk.
