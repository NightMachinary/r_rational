Today, my father, who is a roofer (he builds roofs), asked me to install Google Earth on his computer, because his is being repaired. I asked him why he wanted Google Earth. He said it helped him check the advancement of his construction sites, take measures, see if the gutters had been placed, etc.

Holy shit, guys. We're in the future.

EDIT: Okay so I asked him to clarify, and he doesn't actually use it for his own projects? More to check the long term advancement and changes to existing buildings. Way less awesome.
