Denying free speech just says that you have no rational argument to debate them on.

You're allowed to disagree, or even to ignore or scorn people with differing opinions. But a democracy does not function when one group can mandate that another is not allowed to speak. Especially because that will imply that the silenced party has something so powerful to say that the majority party has no rational argument against it.
