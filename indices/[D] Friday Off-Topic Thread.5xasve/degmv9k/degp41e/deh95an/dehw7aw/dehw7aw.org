Is it? Imagine there was some harmful idea that was extremely persuasive because of quirks of human psychology, but not actually right. Teaching such an idea to vulnerable groups could lead to it being adopted despite the harm it causes.

Obviously if you train people to avoid those quirks, the problem is sufficiently reduced in magnitude that it may as well have disappeared. But the population we have isn't trained. They're eminently susceptible. Even rationalists are, though ideally we'd be able to notice and correct those negative beliefs in ourselves and others.

I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that there might be things which should not be given a platform. Unfortunately, I can think of no way to prevent the expression of such ideas without enabling the suppression of whatever ideas the government (or whichever group) doesn't like.

Essentially, my preferences would be (in order):

1. Eliminate the issues with human psychology that lead to people holding irrational beliefs.
2. Prevent the spread of irrational beliefs without affecting the spread of arational or rational beliefs.
3. Allow all beliefs to compete freely.

1 and 2 are both, as far as I can see, infeasible. 1 is a massive, multi-generational undertaking in the best case, and 2 might just be impossible. That leaves 3, and theoretically 1 & 3 implies 2 (since these harmful memes only spread because people aren't sufficiently rational).
