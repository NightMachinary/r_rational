You just seriously used the phrase

#+begin_quote
  I largely agree with it
#+end_quote

when referring to the concept of free speech. Stating that you have criteria that free speech must fit into for it to be allowed. Which by definition, makes it not free speech.

You can say that you want to supress other's point of view. But please don't try to call it free speech when you're explicitly using it to deny other's right to speak freely.

I am going to now disregard everything you have written, as your opening sentence proved that there is no value in continuing this discussion.
