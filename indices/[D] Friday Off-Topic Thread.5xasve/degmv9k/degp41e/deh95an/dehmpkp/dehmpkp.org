I hear what you're saying here, and I largely agree with it, I /want/ it to be true.

However, that being said, lets look at meme theory. There are clearly certain memes with negative social utility that are extremely good at self-replicating and propagating themselves in our culture. If these sorts of memes are allowed to take hold, then they act like a supervirus and spread rapidly through the population. Yes, this directly implies that the silenced party has something powerful to say, but that's the problem. We know from meme theory that power and ability to spread through a population are /orthogonal/ to the truth-value of a given meme. So you can have these incredibly infectious, powerful memes, that are societally-harmful but very difficult to eradicate, especially since many of these memes foster the creation of ingroups around themselves as defense mechanisms against competing ideas.

Now, trying to fix that quirk of human nature, on the whole, is a very difficult task, but given the existence of these memetic equivalents to biological warfare, maybe we should reconsider giving all memes an equally rich substrate to develop within.

The other problem I see with unrestricted free speech is this, quote is from Slatestarcodex, bolding mine:

  Liberalism is a new form of Hobbesian equilibrium where the government enforces not only a ban on killing and stealing from people you don't like, but also a ban on tyrannizing them out of existence. This is the famous “freedom of religion” and “freedom of speech” and so on, as well as the “freedom of what happens in the bedroom between consenting adults”. The Catholics don't try to ban Protestantism, the Protestants don't try to ban Catholicism, and everyone is happy. *Liberalism only works when it's clear to everyone on all sides that there's a certain neutral principle everyone has to stick to.* The neutral principle can't be the Bible, or Atlas Shrugged, or anything that makes it look like one philosophy is allowed to judge the others. Right now that principle is the Principle of Harm: you can do whatever you like unless it harms other people, in which case stop. We seem to have inelegantly tacked on an “also, we can collect taxes and use them for a social safety net and occasional attempts at social progress”, but it seems to be working pretty okay too.

My fear is that a group will claim to adhere to the neutral principle, take power, and then use that power to ban Catholicism anyway. [[https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5ntjh2/all_this_fake_news/dceozzo/][This post]] covers that playbook pretty well. If everyone involved isn't acting in good faith, it's easy to undermine the principles we hold dear. It's not particularly easy to identify when people aren't acting in good faith all the time, but if we don't make the attempt, then we leave the door open for people to use freedom of speech to destroy freedom of speech, who'll use democracy to destroy democracy, that's definitely a concern of mine.
