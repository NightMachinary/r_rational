As an Indian person, I have to say that there have been quite a few attacks on Indian people during Trump's campaign and afterward by people thinking we're Muslim. It's like the days after 9/11 all over again. Trump's rhetoric demonizing and excluding Muslim and Hispanic people and his legitimizing previously fringe far right people like Bannon has emboldened racists across the country. I know many other minorities I know don't feel as safe in America as we used to.
