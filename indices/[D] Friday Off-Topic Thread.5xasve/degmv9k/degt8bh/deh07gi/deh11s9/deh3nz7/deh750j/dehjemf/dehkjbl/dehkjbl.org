It must be nice to have the comfort of knowing you and your family aren't in danger whether you're right or not about Trump, but I don't have that luxury. I agree with Scott that it's very unlikely that Trump being elected is going to lead to any actual consequences to people I know, but even a 0.1% chance is worrisome and unprecedented from a U.S. politician. I understand that Trump is socially progressive in some ways such as in supporting LGBT rights and in not being racist towards black people. But conveniently it stops where it comes to anyone who could be considered a foreigner. Conveniently while Trump talks about being socially progressive he removes protections for transgender students because his flip flops on these issues means even his reassurances aren't reassuring. Any Asian person in this country has a right to feel afraid. People like you who will never have to worry about this don't get to invalidate these concerns. We live here in America at the mercy of white people, and it would only take a few major terrorist attacks or a war to get sent to concentration camps like the Japanese did during World War II. If you think I'm going to stop protesting just because some people who would never protect my rights in the first place think I'm crying wolf, think again. These moderates are the same as the ones who complained about black people calling for civil rights during the 60s saying things were already pretty equal and not so bad.
