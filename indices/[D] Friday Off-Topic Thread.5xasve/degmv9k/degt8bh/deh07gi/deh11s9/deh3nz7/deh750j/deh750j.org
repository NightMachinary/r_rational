Come on. Are you really only going to consider Trump a racist if he is explicitly so? Being explicitly racist would be political suicide, but banning travelers from Muslim countries while giving exceptions for Christians, decrying only Muslim terrorist attacks while ignoring recent hate crimes, making up fake terrorist attacks to attribute to Muslims, etc. all accomplish the same thing as explicitly as a politician can get away with. And the point about mistaking Indian people for Muslims is important because it's not really just about religion and ideology or terrorism, it's also about race. Anyway, I didn't say Trump himself is a white supremacist, but he's certainly currying their support and legitimizing their views. These people like Bannon target anyone they don't consider white, including Hispanic, black, and Jewish people. Maybe it's because I've spent time on 4chan and altright subs but the trend here is pretty obvious.
