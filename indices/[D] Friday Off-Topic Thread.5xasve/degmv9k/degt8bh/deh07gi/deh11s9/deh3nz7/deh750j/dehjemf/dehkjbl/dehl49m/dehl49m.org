A month or two ago, progressives were passing around a Hitler quote (yes, /that/ Hitler), along the lines of, "The only way to stop us was overwhelming violence, right at the beginning". The thing is, that's only half the quote. The other part was "or have done nothing". I don't know if there is a true consensus on who was responsible for the Reichstag Fire, but let's assume it was a pure false flag. That tactic worked because the communists already had a reputation from all the street fighting.

I'm not saying "don't protest" (though I'd suggest making sure the protests are productive; media coddling can only go so far). I'm saying "stop bending over backwards to interpret everything in the absolute worst Literally Hitler possible light, you sound like the guys who were ranting about Obama rounding up conservatives into FEMA camps back in 2009".

And for the record, I have Jewish and black family. I see no particular reason to be more worried about them than I was a year ago (aka: beyond the general baseline). If anything, I'm worried more about white megaprogressive cousins who might have an aneurysm from Trump Derangement Disorder before the next four years are up. One trendy bisexual cousin in particular seemed to think stormtroopers were going to kick in her door November 10th.
