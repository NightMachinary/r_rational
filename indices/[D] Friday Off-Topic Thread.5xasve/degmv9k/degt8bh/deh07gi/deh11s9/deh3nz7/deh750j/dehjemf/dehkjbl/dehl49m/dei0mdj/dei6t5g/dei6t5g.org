There's been an arrest made in at least some of the bomb threats. [[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-fbi-says-its-found-one-of-the-jcc-bomb-threat-culprits/518511/][The suspect]] is a former journalist who I think even you would consider a radical leftist.

The suspect for the arson was a black [[http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/22/506558131/parishioner-arrested-for-november-arson-of-black-church-in-mississippi][parishioner]].

The only mass shooting I'm aware of was Roof, who was a horrific, evil shit. But he seems to have been somewhat motivated by some belief that [[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/us/dylann-storm-roof-photos-website-charleston-church-shooting.html?_r=0][no one else]] was going to do it, and if there have been any copycat attacks, I haven't heard of them.

  And that the rates have been rising for the past couple of years or so?

2012 - [[https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2012/tables-and-data-declarations/1tabledatadecpdf/table_1_incidents_offenses_victims_and_known_offenders_by_bias_motivation_2012.xls][5796]]

2013 - [[https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2013/tables/1tabledatadecpdf/table_1_incidents_offenses_victims_and_known_offenders_by_bias_motivation_2013.xls][5928]]

2014 - [[https://ucr.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2014/tables/table-1][5479]]

2015 - [[https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/tables-and-data-declarations/1tabledatadecpdf][5850]]

It doesn't seem like we can take these numbers at face value, however, [[http://reason.com/blog/2016/11/15/facts-about-fbi-hate-crime-data-2015][cite]]

  The 2015 statistics include information from law-enforcement agencies representing some 283,884,034 people, or about 89 percent of the U.S. population. This is actually down from 2014 and 2013 (when 15,494 and 15,016 agencies participated, respectively), but up from 2012, when just 13,022 participated.*

And we don't seem to have solid data for 2016 yet.

Do you have a solid argument for why I /should/ be particularly concerned? One that takes the recent rate rise in /hoax/ hate crimes into account?
