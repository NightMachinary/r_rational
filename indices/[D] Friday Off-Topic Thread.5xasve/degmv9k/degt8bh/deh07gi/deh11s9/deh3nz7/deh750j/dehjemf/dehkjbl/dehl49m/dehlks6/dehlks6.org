I haven't seen much of that type of overreaction recently, just in the few days after the election. And frankly, it doesn't take much for Trump to come across in a bad light when the words that come straight out of his mouth are frightening enough and when the actions he takes, from appointing Bannon and Sessions to the recent executive order, don't paint a particularly welcoming view of America. That's the difference between him and Obama. I never had to worry about this under Bush, and I wasn't worried about the 2012 election either. So comparing me to the FEMA camp guys or your cousin is a little ridiculous, especially when Trump intentionally used divisive, inflammatory rhetoric throughout his campaign.
