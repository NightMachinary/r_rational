This appears to be true, and I can see your point, although I'm not certain that anti-Muslim and white supremacy are the same thing. White supremacists would be anti-Muslim, and anti-Indian, but they would also be anti-everyone-except-whites.

The statistics seem to show a recent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes, but not a significant increase in other hate crimes. They also show a significant increase in Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe recently, which could easily explain this trend as the cause of the emboldening.

Given that Trump's rhetoric is negative towards Muslims and Illegal immigrants from Mexico, but makes little to no mention of race except occasionally to promote equality rather than oppose it, it would be more accurate to describe it as anti-Islamic, which is a religious category, not a racial one.

The fact that Indians and other people of certain ethnicity are being targeted without their religion being known detracts from this argument, but last time I checked bigots weren't particularly intelligent and probably don't care about the difference.
