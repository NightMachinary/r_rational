Do you consider only Japan and South Korea to be "ethnostates"? Or is some degree of homogeneity less than 98% allowed to fall under the definition? What /is/ the definition?

Given my own nationality and my own experiences of unpleasant "cultural divergence" in my home country, you ought to be able to make /some/ kind of case to me, but you're coming off more as a utopian than anything else. "Surely, 98% homogeneity will unlock the keys to stability, harmony, prosperity, and happiness! Ethnically cleanse more people!"
