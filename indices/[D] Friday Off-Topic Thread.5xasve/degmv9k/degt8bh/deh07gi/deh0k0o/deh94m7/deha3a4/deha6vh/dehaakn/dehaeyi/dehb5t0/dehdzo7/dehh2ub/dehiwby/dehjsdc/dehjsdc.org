  Ethnostate isn't an official term, but I think it's the best description of what I mean, mono-racial, (mostly) mono-cultural nations. You could add something in there about the government existing primarily to benefit their people, since that doesn't happen like it should.

Further: if the government doesn't primarily benefit the people, /the theory is not working/. You've got your mono-racial, mono-ethnic, mono-cultural countries. Some of them work ok, some are kinda shitholes, none are great glorious world-scale powers.

Meanwhile, countries based on a common civic ideal are basically occupying all the top spots on human achievement, comfort, and happiness indexes.
