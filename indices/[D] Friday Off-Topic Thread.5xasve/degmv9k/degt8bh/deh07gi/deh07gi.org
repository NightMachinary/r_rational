Is there actually white supremacist stuff gaining traction? Because I have only heard accusations and condemnations of it, not anyone actually supporting it. Although perhaps since I've mostly been on Reddit I'm not in the best position to encounter it. And the accusations I have actually looked into, like the idea that Milo or Trump are themselves white supremacists, are so blatantly false that I hesitate to believe the other claims.
