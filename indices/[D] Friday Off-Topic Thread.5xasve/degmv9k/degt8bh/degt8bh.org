I'm still in favor of free speech. The real danger right now is people like Trump doing everything they can to suppress and discredit all opposing voices. I do think the education standards of this country needs to be raised so people don't buy into this white supremacist shit that's gaining traction recently. These people have always been there at the fringes of society, the problem is that the backlash to globalism is making them more popular.
