I think my internal debate ultimately comes down to whether a preemptive strike against evil is justified in this case. Are they deserving of coercion if they don't resort to coercion before we do or has the war of ideologies already begun and I'm just avoiding fighting it? All I know is that bad things are happening and the people causing them won't listen to me when I explain why they should stop.
