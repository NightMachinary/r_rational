  I have had to defend the authority of the courts to interpret the law, universities to educate, intellectuals to inform, and major news organizations to be trustworthy.

That's a very broad brush. What I mean is, you should point out (for example):\\
- Court decisions that are /very clearly/ based on common-sense interpretation of law and precedent rather than on a supposed judicial desire to accumulate authoritarian power and tear down the executive, legislative, and administrative powers beyond what the principle of checks and balances dictates (read the decisions yourself, then check analyses of them as well)\\
- Universities and news organizations that are /very clearly/ devoted to the acquisition and dissemination of true knowledge rather than to the masking of political opinions as truths and lies as facts (look up ethics scandals and incidents of agenda-pushing)\\
- (I can't think of anything to defend "the authority of 'intellectuals' to inform". Maybe try describing them as "knowledgeable people" or "dedicated analysts", and show that they've been correct in the past.)
