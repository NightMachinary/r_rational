My standpoint when dealing with leftists has always been "fuck your rights". In my opinion, abstract notions like rights and individual freedom are completely meaningless if we only get to exercise them in the leftist context of post-nationalism, post-race, post-gender, post-sanity society. That context must be denied completely. The western concept of individual rights must be put in the proper moral context of a homogeneous, high-trust, low time preference society. I see no reason why it would apply outside that. Indeed, it seems to me that leftists don't so much try to apply the right-wing idea of individual rights, as use it as a tool to beat people into submission - ie, you're pathological if you don't accept the people's individual rights to ignore national borders, to parade the rectal insertion of foreign objects, to have their mental delusions validated by the law, etc.

Also for your consideration: when your enemies are in power, you might want to hold off on agitating against freedom of speech - or they might just grant your request.
