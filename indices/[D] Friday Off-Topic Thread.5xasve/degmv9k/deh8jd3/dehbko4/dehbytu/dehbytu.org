  Of course, nobody thought you were in favor of personal freedoms, since you're arguing against them, but simply presuming everyone else is a "ban the buttsex" fascist deep down doesn't really help you here.

I'm presuming no such thing, I'm just pointing out how leftists pervert the meaning of "individual rights" through context substitution attacks. The reason I don't support individual rights is because in a leftist society, we don't have them anyway, the idea is only used as a bludgeon to suppress opposition to radical leftist ideas.

  You're not really getting us. We don't want to be "post-race" or "post-gender". We deny that those are causally meaningful variables in the first place.

The two are functionally equivalent though. By denying the meaningfulness of race and gender, you're also denying us their demonstrated discriminative power in improving society.
