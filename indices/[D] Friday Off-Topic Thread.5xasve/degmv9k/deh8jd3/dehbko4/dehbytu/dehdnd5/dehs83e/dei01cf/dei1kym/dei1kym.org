To the contrary, it seems obvious to me that a tremendous effort on the part of global semitism is required to maintain the present state of affairs, including indoctrination, manipulation, and active persecution of all counter-semitic narratives. Without semitism, the horrors of leftism would have been wiped out long ago.

I wish. While a communist and a pretty horrid one at that, Stalin at least had the foresight to kick semitism to the curb instead of courting it like modern leftists.
