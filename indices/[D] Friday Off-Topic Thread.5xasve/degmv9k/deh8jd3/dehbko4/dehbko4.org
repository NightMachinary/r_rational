  you're pathological if you don't accept the people's individual rights to ignore national borders, to parade the rectal insertion of foreign objects, to have their mental delusions validated by the law, etc.

Sooo... just saying... you've listed three things here. One is asking the state to avoid negative sanction against an action; the last is asking the state to give positive sanction to something. The second, however, has nothing to do with any preexisting role for the state: it's just listing some personal behavior you don't like, and which you presumably want banned.

Of course, nobody thought you were in favor of personal freedoms, since you're arguing against them, but simply presuming everyone else is a "ban the buttsex" fascist deep down doesn't really help you here.

  The western concept of individual rights must be put in the proper moral context of a homogeneous, high-trust, low time preference society.

You've given no reason we should actually prefer a homoegeneous society. Trust and long-term thinking are good, of course, but you've shown no causal connection between homogeneity and either of those two things. You're just counting on half the Slate Star Codex comments section to have done that work for you, when the real world doesn't really work out that way.

  the leftist context of post-nationalism, post-race, post-gender
#+end_quote

You're not really getting us. We don't want to be "post-race" or "post-gender". We deny that those are causally meaningful variables in the first place. It's like saying you want to be a "post-Magic the Gathering" society: sure, the words refer to /something/, but it's something irrelevant and made-up.
