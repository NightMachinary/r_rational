  Yup. You are a fascist.
#+end_quote

I support some policies advocated by Fascists, but Fascism overall is too modern for me, I'm more of a traditionalist, and the traditional political options in my country don't include fascism. I do think Fascism makes sense for traditionalists in e.g. Germany, Italy, Spain, etc, but I'm also strongly opposed to globalism or universalism of any kind, so I'm not going to generalize here.

  You just threatened everyone in the board with your last sentence.

The guy I was replying to did the same for me, I just returned the favor without feeling guilty. And, as stated above, my default stance against the far-left is "fuck your rights". You don't actually support individual rights except as a bludgeon to be wielded against everything normal, beautiful and productive.

  I consider you and your ilk to be existential risks to humanity. And hate is the only emotion it is appropriate to feel for such things.

The feeling is mutual.
