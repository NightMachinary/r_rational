Yup. You are a fascist.

I'm not...used to hate. I'm not good at it. It doesn't drive me, it only makes me feel like the world is less for it. It doesn't behoove the human condition.

But despite that, despite the fact that it feels like a betrayal of things I hold dear, I hate you. I. Hate. You. The world would be a better place if you and everyone who holds your opinions didn't exist. If you died tomorrow, I would not shed a single tear. Not that I will do anything to ensure that, you understand, as my hate does not drive me, but it is merely a fact that I recognize.

You just threatened everyone in the board with your last sentence. Openly and without irony, you threatened our rights. I consider you and your ilk to be existential risks to humanity. And hate is the only emotion it is appropriate to feel for such things.
