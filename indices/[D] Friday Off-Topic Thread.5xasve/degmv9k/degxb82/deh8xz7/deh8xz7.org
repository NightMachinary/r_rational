The fact that you want to do that to me makes me feel more justified in doing the same to you, but I'm not comfortable with being like you so I feel like I should be the better man and not do that to you. I remain at an impasse, though I am just as determined to fight the ideals you represent. For as long as I can, I will continue to hate you without becoming that which I hate. I can only hope I never have to.
