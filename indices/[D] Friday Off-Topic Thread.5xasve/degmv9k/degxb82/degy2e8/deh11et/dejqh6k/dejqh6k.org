I'm mostly left wing, but I have a strong dislike for many people who want roughly the same end result as I do. If you don't mind, could you elaborate on what you wish the world was like? It is part of my world view that people /generally/ have a better shot at happiness if they have a lot of freedom to pursue what they want in most dimensions of life. Big, complicated things like the rules of commerce, environmental policy etcetera do seem to require a government capable of developing and enforcing laws, but on mot issues I tend to default to personal freedom = good. What, if I may ask, do you see life being like in your preferred society?
