I think I understand what it must feel like, seeing good ideas fail to prevail and wondering if free speech actually does lead to the success of good ideas, but even if free speech has failure states like this, I'd argue that the alternative is still much worse.

Free speech or no free speech, the marketplace of ideas is symmetric. There's no Idea God to tell us which ideas are actually superior to others, and every proponent of an idea will assert that theirs is the only one that's true among competing ideas. Even when you /know/ your methodologies were superior and yours is the only honest conclusion with the data available, the situations are rarely so straightforward that people can be reliably convinced that their methodology was wrong, even when they're being open-minded. /They/ probably also know their methodologies are the most sound and that theirs is the only honest conclusion, too.

As such, there is no way for advocate for obviously wrong ideas to be suppressed while also being safe from suppression yourself. Even if free speech doesn't get the right ideas propagating, it /keeps the ideas propagating/, which is so incredibly important I can't begin to describe it.

The true failure state here is not that bad ideas gain popularity, even though that is a failure state. The true failure state is when ideas die because others disliked them, because without an Idea God there is no person, group, or ideology fit to dictate whether those ideas for certain deserved to die or not, because after all, they could be your ideas.

tl;dr free speech may not be perfect, but it keeps good ideas alive even if bad ideas never die either. Since we are only human, we have to accept that there's no way to forcibly cull the bad ideas and keep the good ones.
