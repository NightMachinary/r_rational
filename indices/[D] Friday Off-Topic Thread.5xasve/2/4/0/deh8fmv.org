The thing I'm worried about is that educating these people won't persuade them. Every Trump supporter I've spoken to has rejected all the evidence I present as biased against them or outright false without presenting any evidence of their own that I consider credible. They remain steadfastly committed to their current beliefs and seek out any rationalization they can despite being confronted by demands to think critically.
