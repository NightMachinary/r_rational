I disagree. "Militant identitarianism" is the idea of fighting for a country for your own people, whereas "X supremacy" implies, well, a belief in the supremacy of group X. One is an instrumental strategy, the other is an ontological belief. They categorically can not be synonymous, even if they happen to coincide.
