  Also, why would you want to move to an "ethnostate" that isn't made of your people?

Well you said that they're ideal places to live.

  If you look at the top-5 countries with the highest Human Development Indexes, they average around 80% native,

I'm looking at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index#2015_Human_Development_Report][the HDI]] right now. I'm not aware of Australia being an "ethnostate", and Switzerland, IIRC, has a high percentage of foreign-born residents. Going down further, the USA and Canada, your canonical examples of countries ruined by ethnic diversity, show up at places 8 and 9. South Korea is 17th, and Japan is 20th, despite their both being ethnically homogeneous. Between them, by the way, is Israel, which despite classing about 3/4 of its citizens as Jewish is nonetheless one of the most phenotypically and culturally diverse places on the planet (in terms of things like the number of mother-tongues in common usage, percentage of foreign-born residents or citizens, different skin pigmentations, etc).

Hungary, where a right-wing ethnonationalist "populist" government has been in power for a little while, is in 44th place. Poland, with a similar government more recently, has 36th place.

Care to explain this?
