Regarding Japan and Korea, they aren't the only ones out there - take Poland for instance. Ethnostate isn't an official term, but I think it's the best description of what I mean, mono-racial, (mostly) mono-cultural nations. You could add something in there about the government existing primarily to benefit their people, since that doesn't happen like it should.

Homogeneous countries may not be utopia, but they're certainly better than multicultural ones. Social trust (if you aren't familiar with the term, it can be generalized as "how much you like and believe in your neighbor") decreases significantly in ethnically diverse areas.

Wikipedia actually has a pretty decent article on this, but I'll link a couple papers for you: [[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122415577989]]
