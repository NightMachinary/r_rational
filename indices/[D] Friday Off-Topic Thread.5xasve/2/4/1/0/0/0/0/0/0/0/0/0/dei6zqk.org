  There's been an arrest made in at least some of the bomb threats. The suspect is a former journalist who I think even you would consider a radical leftist.

An arrest for four to eight of the bomb threats, out of about 190. And yes, I'd call this person a crazy left-wing extremist, to the point of being clearly under Russian ideological influence. Crazy isn't confined to one side of the spectrum.
