To give an example, dominant peoples stuck in heterogeneous societies misruled by leftists are said to be paying the "minority tax" - ie, a significant portion of their life's work is dedicated to maintaining the leftist delusions of toleration, heterogeneity, homonormativity, etc. Given the population trends, it's obvious that if leftism isn't kicked to the curb very soon, such a tax will soon dominate our expenditure and completely eclipse more meaningful pursuits. In other words, at some point we'll be faced with the choice between more rectal insertion of foreign objects and more meaningful technical and societal progress. I don't trust postmodern western leftists to make this choice, and I especially don't trust foreign peoples to make it for us.
