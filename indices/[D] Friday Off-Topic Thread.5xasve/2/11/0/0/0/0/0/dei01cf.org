  I'm going to concede that the US is slightly less leftist than the worst excesses of inhumanity in Europe, but the society itself is still being fisted by an iron fist of far-left ideals like heterogeneity, homonormativity, enforced equality and toleration.

Your language here is rubbish. You're treating the low-entropy/high-precision distribution of things you want as default, and then using "leftist" or "far-left" to refer to the high-entropy/low-precision distribution of /everything else/. You're basically just saying, "Everything I don't like is Stalinist".

Look, I know about the use of framing effects in propaganda too, but that's the issue: most people on this sub are going to recognize a framing effect /that obvious/. Maybe you /actually believe/ that whatever you espouse is the natural, passive state of the world before deliberate action fucks it all up, but you can't expect the rest of us to share that expectation.

It's just /polite/ to talk to other people as though we all share the expectation in common that, conditional on no particular action being taken, tomorrow will be roughly like today, and that continuation of the status quo requires no particular action.
