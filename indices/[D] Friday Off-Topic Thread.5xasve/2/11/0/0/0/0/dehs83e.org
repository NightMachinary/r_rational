  You're going to have to explain what you even mean by "leftist", since AFAICT we live under late-stage neoliberal capitalism with a proto-fascist government, none of which is "leftist" as I understand the term.

That's because we don't live in the same country. I'm going to concede that the US is slightly less leftist than the worst excesses of inhumanity in Europe, but the society itself is still being fisted by an iron fist of far-left ideals like heterogeneity, homonormativity, enforced equality and toleration.

  Demonstrated what now? Come on, what demonstration is this?
#+end_quote

The power of exclusion. The idea that we don't owe anyone inclusion in our institutions. When you deny a society the discriminative power of categories like race and gender, you're forcing it into including people in positions that society has previously never considered them to belong in. Even if you disagree about the long-term effects of such a change (and somehow believe it is beneficial on balance), it should still be resisted by the virtue of its forceful implementation alone. Leftism asserts itself against humane societies through the use of force, and I have no problem defending against it using the same.
