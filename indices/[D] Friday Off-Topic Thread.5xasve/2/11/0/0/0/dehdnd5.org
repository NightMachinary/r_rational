  I'm presuming no such thing, I'm just pointing out how leftists pervert the meaning of "individual rights" through context substitution attacks. The reason I don't support individual rights is because in a leftist society, we don't have them anyway, the idea is only used as a bludgeon to suppress opposition to radical leftist ideas.

You're going to have to explain what you even mean by "leftist", since AFAICT we live under late-stage neoliberal capitalism with a proto-fascist government, none of which is "leftist" as I understand the term.

  The two are functionally equivalent though. By denying the meaningfulness of race and gender, you're also denying us their demonstrated discriminative power in improving society.

Demonstrated what now? Come on, what demonstration is this?
