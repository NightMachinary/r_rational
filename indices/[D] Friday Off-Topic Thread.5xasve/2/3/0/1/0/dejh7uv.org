I...don't know that any more.

I used to think you were right, that rhetoric and honest debate were the surest ways of ensuring that the truth rose to the top. But...well...look at the world now. We have a man spouting obvious, easily checked lies in the White House, and a group of honest-to-goodness fascists behind him. Their followers ignore all attempts to engage them honestly, all attempts to try to show them evidence. They abjectly refuse to change their minds on any issue, even when you wave evidence in their faces that they are wrong. You can't embarrass them in a debate because their base knows, at the bottom of their souls, that their champions are correct by virtue of being their champions. You can't remove them from power through argument because the system as it stands has been totally corrupted, and there are enough of them in enough places that they can win elections without even having the majority of the country on their side.

This isn't about honesty, or rational thought, any more. This is about the integrity of the concept of truth itself, a concept which an entire political party and all of its champions have totally abandoned. These people are dangerous, existential threats to the capacity of this planet to support human life, due to their abject denial of climate change. Until they start actually slaughtering innocents, it's not possible to get much worse or more terrifying than that.

So yes, GRRM is right. I do absolutely fear what these people have to say. But I fear it because it is all, 100%, demonstrably, provably, wrong and dangerous, and because it risks my future and the future of every single goddamn human on the planet. Germany has learned this lesson. They learned that there is some rhetoric that cannot be allowed, some words that cannot be said, and some tongues that cannot remain in mouths. Being a nazi, or espousing things which the Nazis espoused, is totally illegal in Germany. The nationalist, blind waving of the flag as an ideal is socially frowned upon, because they know where that leads.

In order to win against these monsters, it is imperative to make them look ridiculous and dangerous on the biggest stage possible, and to make it personally dangerous to follow in their footsteps. In that way, you might be able to get these fools to slink back into the darkness and die before it is too late.
