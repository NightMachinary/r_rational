I don't think you really understand what "confirmation bias" is. If I (as a rational person trying to help you) think you're being biased and focusing too much on exciting negative things, then you telling me you're really really sure that you're right and citing a bunch of exciting negative things kind of demonstrates my point.

I'm not saying the awfulness doesn't exist, I'm saying STOP STARING AT THE AWFULNESS, and stop persuading yourself it's all there is.
