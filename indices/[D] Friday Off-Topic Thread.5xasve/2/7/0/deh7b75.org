It's not bias if the fear is rational. I am afraid of bigotry, authoritarianism, and anti-intellectualism. All of which have gained huge popularity over the past year or so and I see represented at [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters][r/AskTrumpSupporters]] from people who defend words and actions I consider indefensible. I won't pretend that things are okay when they are not and show no sign of getting better.

The question isn't whether I should be afraid that the owner of a white nationalist rag is my President's chief of staff, the only foreign leader the President hasn't criticized is the autocrat ruling Russia, or that millions of people believe a travel ban on Muslims isn't unconstitutional. The question is what do I do to stop things from getting worse?
