  You just seriously used the phrase I largely agree with it when referring to the concept of free speech. Stating that you have criteria that free speech must fit into for it to be allowed. Which by definition, makes it not free speech.

I think maybe you're misinterpreting me here, or intentionally interpreting it uncharitably. I hope it's the former. I mean that I largely agree that free speech is important and that restricting speech brings about all sorts of bad outcomes. I don't mean that free speech must have criteria to be allowed. I'm not sure where you read that into my post.

I'm just pointing out that free speech /also/ seems to produce some bad outcomes too, and that's worth /considering/ if nothing else. There's been a lot of things going on lately to make me question whether totally free speech is actually healthy for a society or if there's some speech (other then shouting fire in a crowded theater) that should potentially be banned for the memetic hazard they represent, but I'm not sure, I want to have a conversation about that sort of thing, so this sort of thing:

  I am going to now disregard everything you have written, as your opening sentence proved that there is no value in continuing this discussion.

Is really just kind of a shitty thing to say even if you disagree with me.
