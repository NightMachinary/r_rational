Re: Freedom of Speech, Yiannopoulos, and Maher. I haven't watch Bill Maher in a while, but there is a difference between liking freedom of speech and giving ridiculous ideas like fascism screen/mind time. I even think that arguing and debating over them may is some cases contribute to their normalization.

Re: Evil winning vs. good. Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I do still think that the world is generally getting better, and if anything we are just in a temporary downward spike. All this means is that we need to try harder using 'good' methods of optimizing the world.

That's all I have to say now (my first point was my main one), but I may have more later.
