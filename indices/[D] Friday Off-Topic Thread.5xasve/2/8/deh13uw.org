On Truth:

Hate speech, self-righteous falsehood, and proud ignorance are frustrating but- in my opinion -better to suffer them all than to throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater.

Truths can hurt, every bit as much as fantasies can, but they're true. They may be denied, they may be devalued, they may be undermined, but they can never be destroyed.

When necessary, it must be spoken no matter how much it hurts. That may feel like hate to the person who hears it, it may feel like falsehood, it may feel like ignorance and, indeed, /it may truly be any one of those or all three/. Who's to know? But if it remains unsaid, then the speaker's truth remains unknown... or the speaker's untruth remains uncorrected.

On Evil:

There is so much good in the world that seeing it is as blinding as the sun. Every minute of every day billions of people are gentle, kind, trusting, and giving. Their decisions trend towards health, community, and hope. Were that not true in aggregate, every minute of every day, anything resembling society would have failed before it began.

Evil is so rare that every insignificant bit of it stands out in stark, obvious contrast. When we're crowded together, or when the internet and the media bring us together, evil can grow common and we can feel apathetic. If that starts to hurt too much, shade your squinting eyes with your hand and notice some of the good. It's not easy, but it's worth a look.

To paraphrase a pair of detectives under the stars:

"How do those tiny lights stand up against all that darkness?"

"Used to be nothing but dark. Looks to me like the light is winning."
