I've always been a pragmatist on some controversies and an idealist on others, it's just that I've never considered taking away rights from people just because I think they don't deserve them. I actually oppose the idea of banning human drivers even though I know it would make the road safer because it feels like compelling someone to sacrifice control over themselves. However, right now, if I knew for sure that censoring hate speech would reduce the prevalence of bigotry then I would support it regardless of my own objections.
