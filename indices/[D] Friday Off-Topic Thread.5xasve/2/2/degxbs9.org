I think two things:

a) Genocide is not an opinion (this draws a nice, if typically fuzzy line, regarding free speech)

b) Any given system will have a faulting situation. Do not restrict yourself to one; life doesn't.

Let's dive into /b/ a little more: Utility monsters, Pascal's Wager - these are good examples of fault situations for value systems and methodologies. They are rescued by comparing their output to other value systems, including "gut" feeling. Look at Ethereum and the debate about forking it after the "theft".

Think about your own brain and existence: You have a logical system for thinking, and an emotional one. Some people experience existential systems. Your brain uses may different systems (electrical, hormonal) which in turn are not restricted to the brain (the gut has a substantial effect).

All in all - Don't feel conflicted that you have multiple active value systems. When your value systems disagree, that's a sign you should examine the situation in more detail. Maybe one system is in a fault situation, and you can't rely on it; maybe they're legit disagreeing and you need a larger principle to decide between systems (which itself is a system... yay fractals!)

Does that make any kind of sense?

(PS - My "larger principle" is: act to make there be more of what you want in the world.)
