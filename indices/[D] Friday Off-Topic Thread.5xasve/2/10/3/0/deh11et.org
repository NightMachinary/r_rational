I can't really give you an accurate idea of what my mindset would be under totally different circumstances.

  freedom of speech makes it easier to change your country for the 'better'.

True, but 'better' is subjective. I wouldn't want to live in your country, I'm confident you wouldn't like mine. I don't want ideas being spread if they are directly opposed to my agenda. You don't (?) want a platform for alt-right, fascist, or 'hateful' opinions, even if it is never explicitly forbidden, am I right?
