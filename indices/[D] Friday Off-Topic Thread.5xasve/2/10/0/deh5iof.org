Wow, this guy is a mod at [[/r/uncensorednews]], that explains a lot about that subreddit. Preserving the comment for posterity:

  I agree with you, coming from the opposite end of the spectrum. I'm an openly racist fascist, and in my ideal state there would be no room for anyone having an opinion that disagrees (or is fundamentally opposed) with the government.

  Just by existing, Communists try to tear down society and fill in the gap with theirs. I don't want memetic hazards like this to be protected by the government, that's essentially shooting yourself in the foot.
