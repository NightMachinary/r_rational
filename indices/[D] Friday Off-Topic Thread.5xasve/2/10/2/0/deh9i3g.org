I think it's reasonable to have a single exception to freedom of speech. Anyone who argues that there should be no freedom of speech should have their freedom of speech revoked so that they can lead by example. For some people, I think they would have to experience being arrested, fined and imprisoned just for saying something before they would truly understand why freedom of speech is important.
