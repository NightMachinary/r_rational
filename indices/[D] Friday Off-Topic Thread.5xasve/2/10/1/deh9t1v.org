A short note to everyone: this user remains on this subreddit -- /for now/. However, I'd certainly like anyone with an opinion to chime in on whether making fun of the Holocaust in a trollacter's username is "pleasant and on-topic". The default is not to ban, warn, or sanction just based on the comment here, but /daaang/ does this kind of Holocaust humor irk me.
