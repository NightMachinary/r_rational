Honestly, I think it means you and me too are confused about how things are working. Remember, there have been times Communists and fascists fought each-other in the streets, and the fascists won, and the Communists (and liberals, and moderates, etc.) got sent to concentration camps. There have also been times when neo-Nazis tried to march through a largely Jewish village, defended by the ACLU, and yet gained little to no power from it.

The real question is: what's the underlying causal factor that makes Card Carrying Evil win in some circumstances, but not others? Does that factor really match up to /our/ personal instinct, as aspiring fighters against Evil in general, to directly confront and fight people we believe are Evil?

If it does, then we should support tactics which Fight Evil. If the causal factor is something else, we need to work on that. If traditional Deontological Principles of Good are helpful to attaining Good and fighting Evil, we should keep them. If they're detrimental, we can change them: Chesterton's Fence is only helpful if it actually keeps foxes out of the damned henhouse.
