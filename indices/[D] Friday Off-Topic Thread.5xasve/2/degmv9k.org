Is anyone else questioning their belief in traditional democratic values like freedom of speech? I was always of the opinion that "sunlight is the best disinfectant" so that the surest way to stop bad ideas from spreading was for public discourse to prove them wrong. However, lately I have seen many ideas I consider evil gain massive support that rejects alternatives they're made aware of.

The result of this is when I see people critique Bill Maher for even allowing Yiannopoulos a platform to speak or Anti-Fascist groups that openly promote censorship of hate speech, I find I can't disagree with them the way I used to. I've seen hatred become normalized in spite, and sometimes because, of opposition to it so I worry allowing people to share these ideas at all will cause it to spread further no matter what.

At the same time, another part of me hates myself for being so utilitarian that I don't remain committed to the principles I've always held dear. I'm supposed to seek to optimize the values I cherish, not change those values in response to irrational opposition. I don't want to hate evil more than I love good, but the more I see evil win the less I care about being good.

It was so easy to have faith in goodness when I believed good was winning overall, but now that I feel like progress has been halted or reversed I'm considering means that I once considered evil in to reach an end that's even a little more good than today's world. What does that say about me? What does that say about the state of the world?
