  I was always of the opinion that "sunlight is the best disinfectant" so that the surest way to stop bad ideas from spreading was for public discourse to prove them wrong.

That doesn't work if the authorities in charge of "proving" things (whether [[https://www.google.com/search?q=replication+crisis][scientists]], [[http://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction][journalists]], or [[http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/320320-report-trump-administration-eyes-changes-to-trade-deficit][government recordkeepers]]) have thrown away their credibility--or if the item in question has such long-term effects than /any/ "proof" must be tenuous and disputable.
