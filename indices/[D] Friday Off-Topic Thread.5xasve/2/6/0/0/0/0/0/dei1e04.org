I have. They don't believe me. They're convinced that everyone they disagree with is lying to them. They don't have any evidence for this that I trust, but they consider it common sense based on the fact that these institutions disagree with them.

I have had to defend the authority of the courts to interpret the law, universities to educate, intellectuals to inform, and major news organizations to be trustworthy. None of my arguments have persuaded anyone because they reject reality as I understand it.

EDIT: I should've said scientists instead of intellectuals.
