The way I see it, there are two obvious approaches:

1. /The Merchant Princes/' Prime Earth is one where the Laundry (or a parallel version of it) is active. Following the events of the last /Merchant Princes/ book (or possibly contiguous with it) the Laundry (or since it's primarily in America, Black Chamber) makes contact with the world-walkers. Possible reasons include wanting to recruit someone with that ability, trying to prevent the massive deaths associated with [[#s][Merchant Princes spoiler]] and the resultant psychic bleedback, or trying to devise an exit strategy from Earth.

2. The world where the Laundry takes place is encountered by the world-walkers during their exploration. This leads to the sort of cock-up that one might expect.

Of course, you'd probably want to reskin the world-walkers as being related to something Cthuloid so there's less of a border between the continuities.
