You might be right that the frequency of the challenge sort of... cheapens it? Like, you always know there's going to be one next, so if you don't much feel the theme, you'll simply think "oh, I'll work on the next one" instead of thinking a bit harder about it. It's also possible that having more sophisticated prompts and themes, or optional elements to include in the story, could bolster creativity. Personally I actually find that I work better with constraints than I do without. Perhaps a reason why I enjoy writing fanfiction more than original works.

Another idea that comes to me from [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]: length. On that subreddit they give daily prompts for extremely short works (usually 100 to 500 words). It's easier to write on impulse something of that length than it is to plan and find time to write a longer work. Stories that short can also be directly copy-pasted, read and commented in here. I think it could be fun to occasionally have 'flash contests' of that sort, for rationalist drabbles or similar.
