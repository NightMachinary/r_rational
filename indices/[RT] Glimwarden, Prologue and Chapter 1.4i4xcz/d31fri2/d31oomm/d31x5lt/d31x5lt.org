Doesn't that mean that the creation of a second Lantern initially didn't increase the protected area at all until both Lanterns were once again stocked up to the pre-mitosis hava levels of the first Lantern?

Also, I assume that Lanterns can either only hold a max amount of hava or that there are considerable diminishing returns after a certain point? Because otherwise the smartest thing to do would be to just dump it all into one uber-lantern.
