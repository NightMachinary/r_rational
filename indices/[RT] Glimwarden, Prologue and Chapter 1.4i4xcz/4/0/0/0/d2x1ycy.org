I looked around for the paper, but all I know (from other sources) is that it was published in 1993, which is a problem since the FAO puts out about two hundred papers a year and I don't know the title (and their website only has the papers from 2007 forward as searchable).

However, [[http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/newsroom/docs/en-solaw-facts_1.pdf][this factsheet from the FAO]] [PDF] shows the following:

- Average number of hectares of cultivated area needed to feed one person in 1961: 0.45 ha

- Average number of hectares of cultivated area needed to feed one person in 2006: 0.22 ha

I'm taking a little bit of liberty in just thinking of those as "before the Green Revolution" and "after the Green Revolution".

Also, I'm pretty sure that +these numbers+ the first number takes into account food security and reasonable diversity, since you can get a lot lower if you go monoculture and assume an optimized farmer who never makes mistakes.
