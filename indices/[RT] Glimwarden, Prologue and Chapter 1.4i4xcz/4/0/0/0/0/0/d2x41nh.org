Well, if you assume that a person needs /more/ land than 0.5 hectares, then my point about not really needing tall buildings only gets stronger, doesn't it? If it's 1 hectare per person, then it's a 14:1 agriculture to living space ratio, which means only 7% of their land is used for living space.

(The tech level is a little screwy here though, in ways that will become clear later if they're not clear now.)
