/Glimwarden/ is about small town politics in a fantasy land where magical lanterns are the only thing stopping an incursion by vile creatures. The glimwardens are powerful magic users who have made a sacred covenant with the city of Light's Hollow and pledged themselves as protectors. The story follows three people -- two boys and a girl -- during the construction of the town's eighth lantern.

I should be posting chapters three times a month from here on out.
