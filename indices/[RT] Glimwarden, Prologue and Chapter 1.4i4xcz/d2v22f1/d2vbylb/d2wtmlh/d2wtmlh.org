The problem with RWBY is that we are continuously told that Grimm are a big threat, but we don't /see/ it on screen. If that was the case, cities would be actively defended. But Hunters aren't guardians - we don't see them defending borders. We see them /hunting/ - offensively, in small groups of people and far from civilization. Only exception was when Grimm invaded city because of human fault. And Ironwood said that only Atlas has any military besides Hunters... There obviously is a lot more going on behind the screen, but it really doesn't feel like the world is threatened by them.
