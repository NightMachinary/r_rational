Question regarding the prologue:

#+begin_quote
  Eventually a second lantern was constructed, doubling the available area and making the town more secure.
#+end_quote

If a Lantern's sphere of influence grows over time then how come the second Lantern immediately doubled the available area? Or is the growing hava thing only something that was true for the first Lantern? In which case it is still interesting that a new Lantern apparently is immediately of the same size, indicating that the original was somehow diminutive at first?

Care to shed some light?
