As Sander says in the first chapter, gliminance follows the inverse-cube law. Since surface area increases by the square and power needed increases by the cube, that means their relationship is given as power^{2/3} = area.

Or to put it another way:

| Power | Area | Radius |
|-------+------+--------|
| 100   | 21.5 | 2.6    |
| 200   | 34.2 | 3.2    |

... or for that same 200 you could instead have /two/ circles that give you 42.5 area. Except they're not actually circles, that's just useful for doing math. Instead, they're fields. So if your safe field strength cut-off is /x/, then making a second lantern of equal strength to the first doesn't just double your available area, because there are going to be places where both lanterns would individually be below /x/ but sum to above it.

I haven't actually done the math to see what the result is, but I think doubling is close enough, especially since every writerly bone in my body resists putting something like this in the prologue.

(There are other reasons not to build lanterns /smaller/ in order to get more coverage, namely the evaporative effect which dominates cost-benefit analysis at the low end.)

Hopefully I haven't screwed up the math anywhere here, if any of this makes it into the text itself I'll have to take some time to triple-check my numbers and actually do some field strength calculations.
