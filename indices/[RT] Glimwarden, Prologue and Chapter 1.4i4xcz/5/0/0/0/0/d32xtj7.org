I was wondering about that. The inverse cube law is a really weird choice for something that seems to work like EMR. You usually see an inverse square law because of 3D spatial symmetries. The only inverse cube laws that come to mind are from dipole moments.

Was that on purpose? Why that choice of falloff function?
