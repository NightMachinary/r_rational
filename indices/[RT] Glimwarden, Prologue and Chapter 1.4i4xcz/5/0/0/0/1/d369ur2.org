Say, could the town maximize their area of influence by making six lanterns in an overlapping circumference surrounding an empty area like a fence? I notice that the set up is similar to what I proposed, but with the seventh lantern in the middle which sounds like a waste of lanterns for more farmable land, unless they are very cautious of darklings breaking through any one lantern and devastating twice the area. Or do darklings just form out of thin air where there are no lanterns instead of sexually reproducing?
