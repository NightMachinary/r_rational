Lanterns have a permanent ball of hava sitting in the center of them that grows or shrinks in size as darkling hearts (which are really just balls of hava themselves) are added to it and shrinks in accordance to the burn rate and evaporation effect.

The process for building a second lantern usually involves something that looks a lot like mitosis; grow the ball of hava in the center of the first lantern, then when it's grown large enough, quickly split it in half and carry it over to where the second lantern has already been built and slot it into place. This obviously takes some engineering efforts in order to make sure that service isn't interrupted for long enough that the darklings attack.

In this case the original /was/ diminutive in size, since it was a travelling lantern only engineered to allow for a caravan to travel west relatively unmolested by the darklings. The first thing that the glimwardens and engineers did when they founded their town was to begin increasing the size of their lantern, which made it more efficient, which gave the glimwardens some breathing room because they didn't have to collect quite so many hearts to feed into it.

(There are other rules and engineering concerns involved, but some of that is to be revealed later and some of it is just worldbuilding wankery.)
