Fixed, thanks! I've been thinking about how to set up some kind of system for typos that works a little better than using comment threads. I don't (necessarily) want an e-mail alias like [[mailto:typos@alexanderwales.com][typos@alexanderwales.com]], since maybe that's an extra cost, but perhaps something like that.

Also, I was thinking of having some kind of bounty for typos, but don't really know what that would entail.

(That e-mail does work though, if anyone would like to use it.)

Edit: I'm now using Mistape, which is a Wordpress plugin. Highlight the offending text, hit Ctrl+Enter, and you can send an e-mail to the above address for processing. If you have ever placed a comment on my site, it will include your identity and I will give you credit on a future "People who helped me" page. I'm not a hundred percent on this solution, because there's no way for the user to include explanatory text, but I think it probably will help A) reduce the effort needed for people to report typos and B) help me with typo correction workflow.
