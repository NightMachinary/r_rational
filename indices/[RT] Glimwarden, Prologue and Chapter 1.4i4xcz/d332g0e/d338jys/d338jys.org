All that will come later on. I mean, don't hold your breath, because it's not going to become relevant for quite some time, but you might be able to draw your own conclusions before any of it becomes explicit. (I have a buffer of four chapters right now, and I think you could make a good stab at both of them by the end of chapter 5.)

I don't mind the questions at all, but will probably hold off on explaining anything that's going to have in-text exposition at some point, because I think that's the better way to learn it.
