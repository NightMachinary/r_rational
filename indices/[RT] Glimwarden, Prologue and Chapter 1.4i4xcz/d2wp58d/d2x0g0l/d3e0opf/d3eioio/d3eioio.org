Building downward works as well. The sphere of influence for the lanterns is large enough that you would run into some massive engineering problems before you reached a place where the lanterns' shine doesn't reach. But the economics for building down are roughly the same as for building up; even in the real world, whether it's better to build on a second floor or build in a basement is largely a matter of geography. People have basements, sure, but probably not second basement levels, especially if they're close to the water table.

The less land you use for housing (and other things) the more available for farming, but eventually you run out of arable land and using less space for housing doesn't actually get you much more farming. Even that's assuming that you're running up against your space limits /really/ hard, which probably doesn't happen if it's possible to expand your area with another lantern.
