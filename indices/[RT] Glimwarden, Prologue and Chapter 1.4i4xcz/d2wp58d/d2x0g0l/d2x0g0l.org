I don't think there's a strong incentive to build upward. Here's my reasoning as to why:

The UN FAO says 0.5 hectares per person. That means that if you want to feed all 11,000 people within Light's Hollow, you need [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=11,000+*+0.5+hectares][55 km^{2}]] of land. Average American household size is 2.5 people, average American [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home][single-family detatched]] lot size varies greatly, but Seattle DCI [[http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cs/groups/pan/@pan/documents/web_informational/dpds021570.pdf][has a great PDF]] that shows /their/ range, from 5,000 square feet to 9,600 square feet. If we're being pessimistic, that means [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(11,000+%2F+2.5)+*+9,600+square+feet][roughly 4km^{2}]] to house everyone. R/C/I ratios vary a lot, but let's say 2:1:1, which means a total of 8km^{2} in order for everyone to have space to live.

In other words, with a lot of unfavorable assumptions, we've got a 7:1 agriculture to living ratio.

If you perfectly selected a 63km^{2} plot of land, you might be able to get better than 87% arability, especially if you could convert non-arable land to arable land through chemistry or landscaping. But eventually you're going to reach a point where you run out of farmlands to feed the people, and I think in most cases you're going to hit that point far before space is so precious that you're pressured to build vertically. This does mean that proportionately more buildings would probably be on cliffs, hillsides, etc.
