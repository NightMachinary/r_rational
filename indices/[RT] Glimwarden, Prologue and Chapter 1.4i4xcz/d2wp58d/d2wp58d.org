I wonder if the forcefield means people build vertically more. I also wonder what the effect of a highly-concentrated field is - if two fields overlap, is the effective field strength at the point just the higher value, the additive value, or something else? If it's additive, then it might be more efficient to build in rings, so you get a good deal of area too far from any given lantern to be safe consecrated by the influence of overlapping fields. Especially if the lanterns are moveable.

The other thing I'm curious about - do smaller darklings spawn more or less easily than larger ones, or is it the same? If smaller ones spawn more easily, and a trained professional with tools can dispatch them fairly easily, then working on the peripheries of the field is probably pretty safe, so long as there are guards. You wouldn't want to sleep there, maybe, but arable land is arable land. Also, if you have a hill or mountain with inhabitable or arable slopes, putting the lantern inside it might consecrate more surface area than otherwise - just as a lantern tower in a valley would, come to think of it
