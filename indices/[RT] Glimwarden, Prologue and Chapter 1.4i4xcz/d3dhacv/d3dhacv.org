Quick note on the "handsome soul" part, I think I've better identified what I liked about it: it allows the imagination to fill in how his personality can make his features more compelling. Now that I've noted that though, the phrse itself "handsome soul" rubs me the wrong way. Maybe better worded as "lively soul?" "Kind soul?" "Bright soul?" Handsome just isn't a word that usually rolls well into a remark about someone's soul, but maybe that's just personal preference.
