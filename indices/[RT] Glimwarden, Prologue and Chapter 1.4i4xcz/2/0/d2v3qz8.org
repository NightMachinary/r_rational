I'm probably going to wait until either I'm rearing to go on the sequel series or putting /Shadows/ out as an e-book (which will probably wait until I've finished writing and editing some of the other stuff that's in the backlog). I mostly just got burnt out on the second appendix, because it's partly a survey of the history of illustrati and the history of the science of illustrati.

(I've lately been trying to get better at managing my writing efforts so that I'm producing things at a steady pace, and one of the ways I'm trying to do that is in recognizing where that effort will get the most returns. The second appendix is on hold until its effort/output ratio is better, which mostly depends on my enthusiasm.)
