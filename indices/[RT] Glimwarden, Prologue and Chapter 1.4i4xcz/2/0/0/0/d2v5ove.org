Oh, I'm a big fan of the Powder Mage series. I actually met [[/u/brianmcclellan]] at GenCon two or three years ago; he was on a few panels at a writer's symposium and had a lot of interesting stuff to say. There definitely isn't enough gunpowder in fantasy though, so I don't think I'll feel too bad about covering a little of the same ground.
