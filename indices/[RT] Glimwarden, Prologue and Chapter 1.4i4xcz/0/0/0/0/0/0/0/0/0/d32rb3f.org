Hmm - yeah, as much as I like the plots and worldbuilding and such, Sanderson just doesn't have Lynch's humour, Rothfuss's prose, or Mieville's way with style. It's great for thinking about, great for consuming, but it doesn't have many moments where you think "oh, that is just a lovely way to say that" - though there are some.
