That's something none of those series even hint at, which is a wasted opportunity to me. It'd be so easy to throw in the implication that the world wasn't always as brutal, that something changed in the past- which makes it a mystery story as well. If you've ever read The Games We Play, that's one of the main draws in my opinion, but even in canon it could fit well- the Grimm themselves don't seem like a natural phenomenon, and what happened to shatter the moon? Given the way the world works on myths, it seems like it's easy to theorize and fill in the gaps for yourself.

Attack On Titan has the same implications to me, it seems hinted that the Titans were created by humans and finding out what happened is more of an incentive than the action, imo.
