But is it a losing war? From what we've been shown so far, it seems that civilization is slowly /winning/ the war of attrition. Something along the lines of /Steerswoman/ meets /Dragonriders of Pern/ (with or without the Lost Technology angle). I suppose, glimlight-resistant darklings could show up just in time for the plot to mess things up :)
