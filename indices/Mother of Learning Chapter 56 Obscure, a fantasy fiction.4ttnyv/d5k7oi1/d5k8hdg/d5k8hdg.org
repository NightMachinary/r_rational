I disagree. They can check the status of the in-loop Veyers, which may give them clues about what he persuaded the Guardian to do to let him out. They can also go after him immediately when they return to the real world; we know Zach can take him in a one-on-one fight, and even Zorian should be able to trounce him unless he gets a Mind Blank up.

Identifying Red Robe was Zorian's priority #3 goal, listed in chapter 55. Priority #1 was determining how long they have left, which is done, leaving only #2: getting out.
