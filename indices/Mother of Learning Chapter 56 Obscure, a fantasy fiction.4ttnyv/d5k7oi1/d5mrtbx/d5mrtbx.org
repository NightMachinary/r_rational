I mean. Not really.

Remember, according to Ghost Snake, the Loop exits into the normal timeline basically 1 attosecond or similarly small timeframe after it begins. Even if Red Robe exited, he has literally 0 perceivable time to act before the loop ends for real and Zorian/Zach exit (assuming they find a way to do so).

They can exit at the same time, with a perfectly prepared plan of attack, which they have literal years to plan out contingencies for, and which Red Robe necessarily will be completely unprepared for, as he will assume that they ceased to exist.

At this point, Red Robe took the easy exit, but because that gambit didn't work, Zach/Zorian have a monumental advantage. The only winning move for Red Robe is if they fail to find the Key before the loop runs out of energy.
