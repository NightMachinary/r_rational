Every mentioned Noble House in this story has some secret trick or magical specialization. It would make sense that there is a House that specializes in soul magic. It's just Zach's luck that when he took the loop as an opportunity to befriend his worst enemy, the enemy happens to be a scion of a soul magic Noble House.
