The only reason I feel like he might be is because of the all the build-up for Damien. Boranova fits the bill right now, but it feels like Damien has a role to fill.

Then again, if Damien was revealed to be RR before this, we'd probably be arguing he was too obvious a choice and questioning why this Boranova guy had a single mention and then never came up again!
