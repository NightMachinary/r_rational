Way too much risk and uncertainty for too little gain. If they had the ability to reliably mark more Controllers (which I doubt they'll ever get, except by using the Key and thus forfeiting their own markers), then there are much better and safer recipients, and if they had a way to unbar the gate and switch a Controller soul with an original, they could just let themselves out and go beat up on RR in the real world.
