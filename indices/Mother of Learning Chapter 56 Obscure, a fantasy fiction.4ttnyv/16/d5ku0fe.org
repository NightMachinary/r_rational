Ahem. This chapter hinted at something far more interesting than Red Robe revelation, and apparently everyone missed that.

The running theory was that Red Robe mindwiped Zach about the specifics of the time loop (its purpose, who created it, why Zach was choosen, how to control it) after copying Zach's Marker onto himself. And yet...

Zach remembers running around in panic, trying to convince everyone he knows that he is stuck in a crazy time loop. Supposedly this is where Boranova got him.

Except why would Zach run around, if he knows what the loop is about? Either he originally had other reasons for approaching Veyers Boranova, independent of asking his help with the invasion, or Red Robe was not the first who scrambled Zach's memory originally. Or did Veyers mindwiped Zach so thoroughly he completely forgot about his first restarts, and repeated them, so that what Zach remembers is his /second/ round of first restarts, and the rest of his problems with memory were caused by Quatach-Ichl's spell alone?

Or was there even anything /to/ scramble? If not, what created the loop, and why?
