The problem with Damien is there is no real connection with Zach.

My main thought when we got to the chapter about the door was that Chekov's brother was written in so we'd have someone to talk to when we had to chase down the different parts of the key, after all that seems like a situation where it'd be handy to have magic Indiana Jones along.
