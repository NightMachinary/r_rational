I really wanna know about Zorians mysterious past where he knows how to picks locks and eventually makes a magic version of lock picking, not to mention he has no qualms about stealing from the "bad guys". I am for some reason under the impression that these previous time loop interesting bits somehow involved his grandmother and would love it if we met her at some point.
