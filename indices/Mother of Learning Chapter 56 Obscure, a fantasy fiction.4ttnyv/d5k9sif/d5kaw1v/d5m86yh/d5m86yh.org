My theory is this:

Veyers Boronova was kicked out before school started.

Zach starts the loop, everything is normal for a while.

Simulated VB notices Zach's impossibly increased skill somehow.

Simulated VB runs a soul ritual on Zach to bring actual VB's soul into the time loop. And scrambles Zach's memory at that point.

This is hilarious, because people always assumed the looper could do whatever inside the loop without consequence. But simulated soul mages inside the loop as still effective!
