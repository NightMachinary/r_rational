Not exactly, no, but Zorian learned about it from Benisek on day two of the loop. Even if we assume that the hearing was on day one (and how could Veyers get himself into an academy disciplinary hearing before he's back at the academy? Causing trouble over the summer would be a police matter, not academy), that's probably not long enough for the formal process of expelling someone. It just doesn't fit at all. I'm pretty sure that the whole disciplinary process was months earlier.

Besides, RR has been looping for years/decades at this point, and he's shown himself to be abrasive and arrogant. He's really going to sit around for a school disciplinary hearing? No way.
