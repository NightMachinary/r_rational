See, I agree with you that it sounds like a much too easy reveal for Red Robe's identity, even if Voldemort does sound like an asshole. That's why I don't think that it will be him. However, I do believe that he's related somehow. I think that RR may be one of his acquaintances, or an acquaintance of his family. I think that his role will be to become a key in finding RR's real identity, and that Zach was made to forget so that he wouldn't be able to set on this path in the first place.
