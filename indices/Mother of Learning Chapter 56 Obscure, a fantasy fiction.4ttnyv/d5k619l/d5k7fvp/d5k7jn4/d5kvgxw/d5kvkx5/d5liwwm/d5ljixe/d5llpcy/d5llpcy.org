Actually, now that I look again, I don't think that girl was in their class, I think Zach, Neolu, and that girl were hanging out together outside of class. Akoja mentions how Neolu finished her test in a half hour, but she never mentions the other girl's, just that "The point is the three of them do nothing but waste time together and antagonize the teachers and get perfect scores anyway. They even refused the chance to get transferred to 1st tier groups"
