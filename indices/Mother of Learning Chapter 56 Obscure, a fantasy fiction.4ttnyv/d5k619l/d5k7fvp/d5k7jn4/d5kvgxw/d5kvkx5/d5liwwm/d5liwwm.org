I completely forgot about that girl.

She could she just be a normal school friend of Neolu's that transferred into their class once Zach interfered. Even in chapter 7 after 7 months in the loop Zorian didn't know who she was, so she shouldn't have been an usual classmate, but in chapter 6:

  Like he suspected, the two girls Zach hung out with during Zorian's original month were nothing special without the Noveda heir there to help them out and hang out with them (and asking people about them led to some pretty annoying rumors being spread around; honestly, can't a guy ask about a girl without everyone assuming he's got a romantic interest in her?)

So apparently that girl was still around in Zorian's loops 2-7, but he never actually learned her name?

It's possible that we're underestimating just how little Zorian interacted with others due to his unchecked empathy and general assholeness at the beginning of the story, but that doesn't explain why Akoja wouldn't know the girl's name either.
