As a class representative Akoja had to know every transferred student and all that, but she did not. Overall this is a bit muddy. I took it as Zorian asking mainly about Neolu and failing to ask meaningful questions about 2nd girl. What would he ask? "Hey, do you know this girl that kind of was hanging with Zach a several time loops ago?" Yeah, fat chance.

As a confirmation we have chapter 7:
