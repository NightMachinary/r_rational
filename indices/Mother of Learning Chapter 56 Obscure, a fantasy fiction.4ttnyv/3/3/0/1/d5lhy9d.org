I don't think a normal teleport spell has the range to cross an ocean, but if there are islands along the way it might be doable. Plus, there's more exotic teleport and gate spells besides the normal one that probably have much greater range.

If there's an island teleport route possible, even if it wasn't practical for an individual to learn, I think that either governments or private enterprises would have developed it. After all, the quick transmission of information and small amounts of goods and people is a pretty valuable thing to have.
