I'm afraid I can't remember, and after several minutes of searching I still can't find it.

As I recall though, you basically have to take a boat or airship to the continent Daimen is on. You /could/ teleport there, but that would require you to have seen the location you want to arrive at.

Since the trip over the ocean, plus the trip to the jungle Daimen is in would take longer than a month, you'd have to go part of the way in one loop, then teleport to you last know location, and continue in another loop.

Obviously, Bakora Gates, hiring someone else (who has already been to that continent) to teleport you there, or some sort of flight spell could you get there faster.
