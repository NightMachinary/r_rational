From this newest chapter. It's possible that Zorian is wrong about when he got expelled, but I think he is probably correct. It doesn't make sense for a decision like that to be made too close to the start of the school term.

Damn, this feels almost like too easy a reveal for RR. Though it still doesn't explain how he would have ended up with a marker that didn't expire and let him leave the loop. I guess I can bury any Daimen as RR theories I had, which is good, because it never made much sense for him to support the invasion. I could probably still suspect Daimen of activating the Sovereign's Gate by fiddling around with the Key(s).
