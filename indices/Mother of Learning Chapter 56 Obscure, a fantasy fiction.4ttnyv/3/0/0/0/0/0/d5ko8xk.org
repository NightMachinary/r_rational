I don't think that RR anticipated the possibility that Zach would have this kind of discussion. He didn't think it was possible for another looper to exist, after all, and since he was already absent from the academy and unlamented, who would tell Zach about him?

Besides, neither Veyers nor RR have shown signs of being especially patient and meticulous. Cunning, yes, but not really a chessmaster. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he failed to cover every base.
