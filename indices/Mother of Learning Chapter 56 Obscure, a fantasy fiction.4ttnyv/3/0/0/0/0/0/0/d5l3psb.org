If Zach had his mind altered, then it was done very early on. Like decades ago. I think that at that time, RR or one of his more talented mind mage acquaintances, would have put measures in place so that he wouldn't be discovered in the coming decades, until RR was ready to leave the time loop. This isn't so much a deep, intelligent tactical-genius chessmaster move as much as a basic counter-measure to allow himself more freedom. If Zach has forgotten his very existence, then what are the chances that Zach would look for him? Even if Veyers is not RR himself, this obviously means that he is key in finding RR's identity.
