  He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn't be joining them this year -- apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy.

The way it's worded, we don't know exactly when the disciplinary hearing happened. I took it to mean the hearing happened during the last month...during the time loop.

  "I am Ilsa Zileti, from Cyoria's Royal Academy of Magical Arts. I'm here to discuss the results of your certification."Color drained from Zorian's face. They sent an actual mage to talk to him!? What did he do to warrant this!? Mother was going to skin him alive! "You aren't in trouble, Mister Kazinski," she said, smiling in amusement. *"The Academy has a habit of sending a representative to third year students to discuss various matters of interest. I confess I should have visited you sooner, but I have been a tad busy this year. You have my apologies."*

Zorian was visited at the beginning of the time loop by a representative of the mage academy, who said they send representatives to discuss "various matters of interest." This easily could have happened to Veyers, with a result more similar to what Zorian apparently expected.

It's possibly it happened during the last school year, but that brings up the big problem of how he was able to join the loop with Zach early on. They've both been in the time loop for decades now. I suppose it could have happened when Zach initially tried to convince everyone of the time loops existence, but he would have to track down Boranova to wherever he lives.

It would be much easier if he was simply attended the school to start with, because he kept his temper during his hearing.
