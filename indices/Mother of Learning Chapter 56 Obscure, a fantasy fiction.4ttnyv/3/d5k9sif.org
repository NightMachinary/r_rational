I didn't catch it on my first read, but on my second read-through (which was about a couple days after my first), it seemed very suspicious that a fellow student who was a massive jerk was mentioned but then never showed up again.

Zorian's search for another time traveler (mostly among other students) specifically excluded him by accident, and he

  He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn't be joining them this year -- apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy. He wouldn't be missed. Honestly, that boy was a menace and it was a disgrace they hadn't expelled him sooner. Fortunately, it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova.

Veyer's reaction during his disciplinary hearing reminded me a great deal of Zach's numerous spats with his asshole caretaker, and the third time-traveler obviously couldn't hiding in plain sight (Zach and Zorian experienced first hand that they would go crazy or detected doing that.)

Evidence:

1) The time traveler is almost certainly someone who would have been near Zach during the original summer solstice, when the spell was originally cast. This could be a fellow student, teacher, or diplomat at the party.

2) Zach and Zorian have demonstrated that it's nearly impossible to do the same thing over and over again. They certainly couldn't/wouldn't do so without showing their increasing skills.

3)If Red Robe was present at the school, he would have noticed Zorian becoming better, and eliminated him. So he can't be someone who is present during the story.

4) Zach starts most loops by kicking Tesen's ass. Zorian started hating Kirielle for her annoying actions at the beginning of the loop, before he got to know her better. This sounds awfully familiar to Veyers losing his temper, although this could have happened before the loop.

5) Veyers is a briefly mentioned character, at the very beginning of the story, who never appears again. The author doesn't put in unnecessary details very often--he was mentioned for a reason.

6) He's mentioned as decidedly unpleasant character, although early Zorian was sometimes an unreliable narrator.

7) He's a member of a noble house, which we have just learned in the last two chapters (actually further back), may have reason to hate Cyoria, which has shifted power from Nobles to first-generation mages.

I expected this reveal to happen when Zach and Zorian finally compared notes (as we've known Zach's memories have been messed with for quite a while), or more recently, when Boranova suddenly showed up to school (if he's a copy, and he left the loop, IIRC, that means he and his original soul switched places.)

Damien has always seemed like a red herring to me. He's too far away for Zach to reach him early, he's a blatantly obvious suspect, and Zorian was originally extremely biased against his family.
