Not at all.

Red Robe was cruel, impulsive and petty; Boranova was told to be a 'menace' who got himself expelled on a disciplinary hearing, and he is an adolescent.

Red Robe was helping the invaders; Veyers is from a Noble house, and has a political reason to destroy Cyoria.

Red Robe was an outsider to the invaders; pre-loop Veyers is almost certainly didn't know about them.

Red Robe hijacked the loop back when Zach was new to it; Veyers was his classmate, so Zach was likely to talk to him more-or-less early.

Red Robe must have had access to powerful soul magic in order to insert himself in the loop; Veyers is from a Noble house.

Red Robe seemed to have some sort of personal history with Zach; Veyers hated Zach.

In retrospective, it is obvious. Red Robe is a cruel influential adolescent male with a reason to help invaders despite not knowing about the invasion before, whom Zach knew from before the loop and had a reason to tell about it early. Pretty specific.

Yes, I know, hindsight bias. Still, all of those /are/ valid evidence, and denying their existence is irrational. It's Quirrelmort all over again.
