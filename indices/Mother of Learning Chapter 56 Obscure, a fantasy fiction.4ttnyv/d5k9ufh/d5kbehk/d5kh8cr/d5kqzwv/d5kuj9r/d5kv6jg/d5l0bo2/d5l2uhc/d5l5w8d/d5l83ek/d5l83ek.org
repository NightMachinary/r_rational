Yes, you're using the name-reveal as a focus, i.e. treating it as definitive evidence when in fact the strength of your conviction didn't match the strength of your evidence (some of which makes huge assumptions, e.g. Veyers hated Zach personally, Veyers has access to powerful soul magic because he's from a noble house). Of your 6 points, only the first 2 have any credibility and it's weak at that, for reasons Xtraordinaire pointed out.

The point is the hypothesis of VB being RR was never robust. Theories gravitate towards his candidacy mainly because his name was mentioned and he's never present during the story. Afaik, we don't even know his house's relationship with Cyoria and the government.

Even now, there's a lot of problems with the theory. Veyers was expelled before the loop started: how did he find out about Zach looping, especially when everyone in class hates him? Even assuming his family specializes in mind magic, how does an unruly adolescent extract and mindwipe Zach with such precision in a one month timeframe?
