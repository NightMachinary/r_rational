You're falling victim to a focusing bias by anchoring too hard to the reveal this chapter. Inductive reasoning is always equivocal, and most of the evidence you provide is not strong enough to make any conviction. Right now it's all circumstantial besides the fact that it's very suspicious Zach doesn't remember VB.

You misunderstood the causality break. If Zach was the original looper, he would have known he was in a loop and presumably known his abilities as the controller. He wouldn't need to talk to anyone. It's heavily implied that he was confused about the loop /after/ someone messed with his mind.
