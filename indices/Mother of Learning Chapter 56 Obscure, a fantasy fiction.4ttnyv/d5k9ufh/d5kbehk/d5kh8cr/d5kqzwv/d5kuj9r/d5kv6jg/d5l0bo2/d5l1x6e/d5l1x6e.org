  Of course no evidence is going to be good for you if you're just taking them in isolation and then discard as too broad.
#+end_quote

It is not about evidence being broad, it is about evidence being not available in the universe.

Allow me to illustrate: Silverlake.

We know Silverlake or her spider is going to be used later for some reason. We know that because the author has spent a valuable resource on Silverlake's exposition and has spent /a lot/ of that resource. If Silverlake was /not/ important the correct course of action (for the author) would have been to kill her off like every other soul mage on Kael's list or just make it so Zorian fails to find her.

But Zorian doesn't know that Silverlake will be useful. He can expect to bring her spider eggs only to find that her expertise is absolutely not helpful. There is no /reason/ that any particular avenue of research can't be a dead end.

The same with Boranova. We have been chekhoved, but Zorian wasn't. For him Boranova was a little inconsequential factoid among thousands of others. Thousands of such factoids were filtered out by the author /because/ they are not relevant. But Zorian is not the author he can not know.

  If there was a crime, and a criminal was said to be a white-skinned old male without one hand,
#+end_quote

How many people have one hand? This is pretty specific evidence, because amputees are rare.

There was a crime and a criminal was said to be white male in his 30s. Is that helpful? Not at all.

  He tried approaching everyone. Moreover, in the early loops, Zach was confused and scared
#+end_quote

No, he wasn't. That's the causality break. In the early loops Zach was not memory wiped and had better understanding of the purpose of the loop. Then he got mind wiped and /that's/ where his confusion begins. His memory wipe explains his lack of dedication because he doesn't know anything about his time limit and any purpose the Agents had to get him looping. He doesn't know that his dragon hunts are insanely wasteful, he doesn't know what should he do to exit and even that he can and so on.

It clearly had happened one way or another, *but* there was no watsonian evidence for that up until this chapter.

#+begin_quote
  I meant he knew Zach personally, enough to comment on his apparent persistent folly.
#+end_quote

If you mean comments made by Red Robe, well duh, he had to study Zach because he is the Controller. Any Red Robe would know Zach.

#+begin_quote
  I never said only Noble Houses have access to powerful magic; I said that being a part of a Noble House is an evidence of having access to powerful magic.
#+end_quote

It's a very weak one on par with the criminal being white male, because there are too many suspects /and/ there are irregularities. There are members of Noble Houses that don't have full access to their House secrets and there lowborns that are amazing mages (Xvim, Daimen, Sudomir, Silverlake to name a just a few)
