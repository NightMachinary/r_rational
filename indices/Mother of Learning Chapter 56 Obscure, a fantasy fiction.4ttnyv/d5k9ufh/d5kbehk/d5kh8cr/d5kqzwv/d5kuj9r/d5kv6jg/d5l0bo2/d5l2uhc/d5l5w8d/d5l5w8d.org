I'm not. I lampshaded hindsight bias above, and I suspected that Red Robe is Veyers Boranova long ago. If not for the namedrop in chapter 2, I almost certainly would have made similiar conclusions, about Red Robe being Zach's peer from a Noble House. Perhaps his childhood friend, or something like this.
