You would be correct if this weren't a novel written by an author who loves to foreshadow. In a more realistic world, Red Robe would be some complete unknown and the likelihood that it is a fellow student from the very same class is unlikely. However, it is not that unlikely that a mage like RR passed through the halls of Cyoria's school at some point as a student.

In that respect, Boranova is a very likely suspect.

But if the author wants to hammer the rationalist point home, RR would have been a mage with a more tenuous link to Zach---after all, RR has to have learned of the loop. That assumes that RR entered the loop via Zach, however, and that may not be the case. From the very beginning, RR may have piggybacked into the loop with Zach somehow.

However, the memory wipe is pretty damning evidence now. Zach's memory of his classmates is not all that spotty, so why has one particular student been excised from his mind?
