That's not evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe was cruel, impulsive and petty;
#+end_quote

Cyoria has a population of half a million (or more), the country has a population of millions. Thousands of Cyorians are cruel, impulsive and petty.

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe hijacked the loop back when Zach was new to it; Veyers was his classmate, so Zach was likely to talk to him more-or-less early.
#+end_quote

Causality break, if Zach was the initial controller, in his first restarts he had a perfect memory of Veyers and thus would not approach him, as there was no need and no desire.

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe was helping the invaders; Veyers is from a Noble house, and has a political reason to destroy Cyoria.
#+end_quote

Thousands of people are helping the invaders or have motive to do so: cultists, Sudomir, competing nations. In no way this is evidence specifically for Boranova.

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe was an outsider to the invaders; pre-loop Veyers is almost certainly didn't know about them.
#+end_quote

add: So pretty much millions of people. Red Robe was not a power equal to the lich and Ibasan nobility, yeah. Every cultist fits this description, every Eldemar citizen and perhaps every low-level Ibasan.

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe must have had access to powerful soul magic in order to insert himself in the loop; Veyers is from a Noble house.
#+end_quote

Thousands of people have access to powerful magic. House Aope (deals with mind magic) for example is large enough that they can send some of its members to work as teachers at the academy. Nobility teaching lowborns, right? And Sudomir is not of a House, let alone Noble one and yet he has a freaking undead augmented bone dragon. That's like owning a private B-52 in our world.

#+begin_quote
  Red Robe seemed to have some sort of personal history with Zach; Veyers hated Zach.
#+end_quote

That was unknown before this chapter /and/ it is false. Veyers did not have a personal history with Zach specifically. Zorian outright mentions that he hated everyone and everyone was happy to return the sentiment.

edit, double negative was bad: There are good reasons to assume Veyers got in a lot of trouble with other people, not just Zach.

So none of this is a valid watsonian evidence.

Now, the fact that Zach has no memory of him when he should /is/ a good piece of evidence.
