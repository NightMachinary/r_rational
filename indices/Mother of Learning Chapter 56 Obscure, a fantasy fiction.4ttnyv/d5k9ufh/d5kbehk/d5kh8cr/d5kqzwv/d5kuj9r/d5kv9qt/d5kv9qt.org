Nice write up! Some of these points would have pointed to Zach's guardian as well, so I'd still say that before the last chapter this wasn't /that/ obvious, to say the least.

Also iirc up until last chapter we didn't know that Zach and Boranova hated each other. The only obvious arch-enemies of Zach up until now were the Lich and Zach's guardian.
