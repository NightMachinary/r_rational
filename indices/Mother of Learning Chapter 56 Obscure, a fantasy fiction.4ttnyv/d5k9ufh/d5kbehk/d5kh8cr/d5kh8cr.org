It was always obvious that it was Boranovna. I don't know why people kept focusing on other theories.

Edit: I seem to be getting downvoted pretty heavily. I'm sorry people don't like this, but it /was/ obvious to me that RR was Boranova. I said as much several times and would have been more than happy to bet any reasonable amount of money on it. It simply fit too well and was far too large of a checkov's character mention for this author to be anything but.
