  give the mark to the Veyers left behind

Er...not to put too fine a point on it, but this sounds to me like a terrible idea. Even assuming that they could find a way to mark others reliably, which actually seems unlikely to me. Zorian was marked by an extremely dangerous lucky accident, and RR probably used something equally risky (because after all, if it hadn't worked, his soul would have been reset anyway). I think that placing some lesser markers on helpful individuals and eventually getting themselves out will be the most they can manage.

If there was any possibility of Veyers cooperating, then this might not be a totally crazy idea. But as it stands, I reckon he's just bad news, and shouldn't be touched with a ten-foot pole (although Controller!Veyers in the real world is a different story. Whack him around with a pole all you please, he'll doubtless be trying to kill you first).
