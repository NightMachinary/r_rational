That doesn't mean anything since Zach's entire early memories are suspect. We know he was worked over quite thoroughly by a mind mage and I doubt Veyers only had Zach's memory of himself removed. All Zach has is some ambiguous recollection that was probably left to keep him distracted and might even be false entirely.
