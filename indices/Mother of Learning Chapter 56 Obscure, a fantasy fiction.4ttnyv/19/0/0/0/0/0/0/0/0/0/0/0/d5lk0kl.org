  That's actually pretty strong evidence with this author :)

It is terrible evidence with any author, because firearms-based analysis is pure guesswork. I mean, we've just got an amazing piece of evidence. "It's a red herring!" people immediately suggested. No. That way lies madness.

  We don't know that he took only one month. He didn't necessarily mindwipe Zach immediately upon gaining access to the loop, after all. He could have pretended to be an ally for a time.

A guy threw a tantrum at a disciplinary hearing and then was open-minded enough to tolerate Zach's crazy ideas of time travel and then successfully faked 6 months of goody-two-shoes. Uh-huh.

I don't like the idea of Zach befriending him. It is /too/ dumb, even for Zach.

It seems more plausible that VB blamed Zach for his expulsion and wanted some revenge. Incidentally his revenge plan came to life on 1st month of school, thus on the 1st iteration of the loop when Zach was /not/ prepared to fend off the attack.
