  It is not about evidence being broad, it is about evidence being not available in the universe.

Oh. I thought you argued it was unfair for the readers? That the only evidence we had was a meta-evidence, the author's love for Chekhov's guns? But then I don't understand what you're arguing for.

That protagonists had no chance of discovering Red Robe on their own, if not for a lucky coincidence? No, they were going to look into Zach's memory sooner or latter either way.

That the only reason the readers could have been able to determine Red Robe's identity is because the author purposefully fed us random bits of relevant data? No, Red Robe's actions is his actions, the information about Noble Houses was specifically pointed out to be relevant to Red Robe in-universe, as were Zach's early actions. The rest is just logic and a bit of reasonable guesses.

Zorian /himself/ suspected and investigated their classmates, he just forgot about the expelled one. If anything, Veyers' expulsion is a... whatever the relevant analogue of Diabolus ex Machina is called, because if not for it, Zorian and the Cyoria Web would have caught Red Robe there and then.

  In the early loops Zach was not memory wiped and had better understanding of the purpose of the loop

No, he didn't, maybe. I actually made a post about it below.

In short, if Zach knew about the loop's purpose, he was even more unlikely to be screwed over by Veyeres, so he either never knew about it and was confused from the start, or was mindwiped by something /before/ Red Robe. But let's discuss that part [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ttnyv/mother_of_learning_chapter_56_obscure_a_fantasy/d5ku0fe][there]], instead of spreading this discussion thin.
