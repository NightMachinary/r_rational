  how does an unruly adolescent extract and mindwipe Zach with such precision in a one month timeframe?
#+end_quote

We don't know that he took only one month. He didn't necessarily mindwipe Zach immediately upon gaining access to the loop, after all. He could have pretended to be an ally for a time. I wouldn't be surprised, either, if his loop entry method involving tampering with a temporary marker - meaning he had six months to work it out, rather than one.
