Of course no evidence is going to be good for you if you're just taking them in isolation and then discard as too broad.

If there was a crime, and a criminal was said to be a white-skinned old male without one hand, are you going to say we have zero evidence and so no way to identify him?

Evidence paint a picture, not just show directions.

  Causality break, if Zach was the initial controller, in his first restarts he had a perfect memory of Veyers and thus would not approach him, as there was no need and no desire.
#+end_quote

He tried approaching /everyone/. Moreover, in the early loops, Zach was confused and scared of the invasion he had no hope of stopping on his own, and nobody believed him. Veyers was from a Noble house; from Zach's perspective, getting him on his side would be benefitical. Perhaps he got desperate at that point, to go seek help from someone he loathed, but there were both a need and a desire.

  Veyers did not have a personal history with Zach specifically. Zorian outright mentions that he hated everyone and everyone was happy to return the sentiment
#+end_quote

I meant he /knew/ Zach personally, enough to comment on his apparent persistent folly.

#+begin_quote
  Now, the fact that Zach has no memory of him when he should is a good piece of evidence.
#+end_quote

At that level it's not 'evidence', it's a dead giveaway.

  And Sudomir is not of a House, let alone Noble one and yet he has a freaking undead augmented bone dragon

I never said only Noble Houses have access to powerful magic; I said that being a part of a Noble House is an evidence of having access to powerful magic.
