In the comments on chapter 54, I also noted that RR seemed to have a specific grudge against the academy: on Zorian's first loop, the initial, highly-selective artillery barrage targeted /the empty residence building for third-year students/. No tactical advantage is apparent, since everyone was at the dance, and yet the very first strike specifically targeted it. That very neatly fits with RR having been /expelled before he started his third year at the academy/...
