An interesting revelation, it will be useful at the end, but for now, how much does it really help Zach and Zorian? They still have the same basic intractable problem of escaping the loop. I'm glad we got to see more Xvim, though, that guy is great. Also Zach spending a bunch of loops trying to date all the classmates, that's really amazing. Zorian would never be so inefficient. I guess for most of the time Zach wasn't really feeling like he had crosshairs on him but it still seems very... Zach.
