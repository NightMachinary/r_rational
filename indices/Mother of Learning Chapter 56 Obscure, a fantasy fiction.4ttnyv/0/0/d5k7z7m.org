  how much does it really help Zach and Zorian?
#+end_quote

A lot!

Remember, RR doesn't know Zorian's identity - but they now know his. If the marker remains on their souls when they leave (which it might, since the Guardian explained that there is already a mechanism to designate an old marker as non-functional), then Zorian might even be able to find him with the marker tracking ritual. Then Zach can beat him senseless, and/or Zorian can loot his mind of everything he knows about the loop and the invasion.

Ideally, Veyers wouldn't even suspect that they're coming for him in the real world. However, he hated Zach's guts to begin with, and we know he holds grudges, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if his first action in the real world is to ambush Zach.

They can also check out in the in-loop Veyers to determine his status. Did his Controller soul get swapped with his template, turning him into a regular loop denizen (probably)? Does he start each loop soulless? Or something else? Is it even, perhaps, possible for them to persuade the Guardian that he has menaced his template and should be switched back (admittedly a long shot)?

And this is clear proof that Zach's memories have been altered. Maybe that will persuade him to let Zorian into his mind. We know that RR was very much a novice of mind magic; what if Zorian can find traces of Zach's old memories? Like whatever loop instructions he was given, so they know how to use their Controller powers? And the reason the loop was started, and why it was started early?
