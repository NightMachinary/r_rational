I originally thought so, but then I noticed that the Guardian said the Controller was marked by the Key, or the Maker, or the Maker's agents. So, holding the Key does not designate you as the Maker; they are distinct. And there are aspects of the loop (like erasing people) that can only be altered by direct intervention of the Maker.

The only confirmed powers of the Key are to mark Controllers and re-open the barred Gate, plus probably (from what the matriarch said) allowing non-Controllers to reach the control room.
