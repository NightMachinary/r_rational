  Zorian was tempted to bring Zach to Silverlake after this, just to show him the true meaning of annoying. At least Alanic and Xvim were each helpful in their own way in addition to being hard to deal with. He wondered if Zach was good enough to deal with the grey hunter... he probably could kill the beast, but could he do it in a way that keeps the eggs intact?

I think [[/u/nobody103]] is just trying to get people to stop asking if Zorian had thought of that yet.

  It's strange, though. Why is Alanic willing to help me refine my soul defenses now that I've brought you along? Why does your presence make him less suspicious of me?
#+end_quote

I'm calling it now, function of the marker that isn't usable/known by Zorian.

  Though he really could have gone without that last conversation -- now he couldn't stop thinking about the various girls in his life.

Maybe this is [[/u/nobody103]]'s 'get people to stop asking questions' chapter.

  Two hours later and 5 ward refinements later, Zorian had a warding scheme that Xvim couldn't just casually dispel whenever he wished... And then, when he finally couldn't dispel the ward, Xvim promptly teleported into the area as if the ward had never existed.

I love Xvim so much.

  "I did experience a few unexpected restarts while sleeping, but I'm pretty sure those were due to assassinations."

I wanted Zorian to respond with "Yeah, that's always annoying."

Veyers Boranova all but confirmed as RR, that was possibly one of the most difficult tasks if they didn't get lucky.
