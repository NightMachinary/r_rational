Back in chapter 46 when Zorian is thinking about his magic missile spell, both in regards to his capacity and execution, he mentions:

  None of the books he'd found actually outlined this method as a possible training regimen, instead suggesting endless repetition of the spell as a method, but Zorian felt his idea had merit. He had little to lose by trying it, since the officially suggested training method consisted of mindlessly practicing the normal version for years and even decades at the time. Yes, he was stuck in a time loop, but there had to be a better method than that.

A perfect cast should be a peak efficiency cast, both from the context in that chapter, and if you go back to when Kyron is first explaining about magic missile and its variants: "The lightshow you usually see is magical leakage resulting from an imperfect spell boundary." I think a mage might get some further negligible bonuses from telekinetic shaping skill mastery, but for the most part those are already factored into the casting of the spell.

Zach has essentially been practicing "the officially suggested training method", and his shaping skills are pretty good, so I think he's probably near max efficiency when it comes to magic missiles. Even if Zach did a perfect invisible magic missile, I doubt his max casts would go over ~240.
