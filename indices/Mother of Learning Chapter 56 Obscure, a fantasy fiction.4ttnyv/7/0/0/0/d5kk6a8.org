I don't think nobody103 wants us too reliant on thinking in terms of reserves, but I don't see why Zorian couldn't use it as a benchmark.

I'd say a perfected magic missile is either half-cost or slightly lower. Zach's aren't quite perfect, but they are very good, since he's probably cast the spell at least 50,000 times.

Zach can cast 232 in a row, I'd expect Zorian's eventual max to be around 64-70, which doesn't sound that impressive, but if you consider that he initially thought his max casts would be 32, is pretty good.

I'm still hoping Zorian can fuse his loop soul to his real soul to double his max mana capacity and strengthen his mind magic abilities. But I'm not sure it works that way, and he'd probably have to logic trick the Guardian of the Threshold to even attempt it. Nobody103 has said a few times that soul splices can cause insanity, but he's always talking about mixing different souls instead of two the same.
