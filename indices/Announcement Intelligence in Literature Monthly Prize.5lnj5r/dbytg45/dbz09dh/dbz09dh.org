If you think those fragments will stand alone as their own thing, then submit them, but try to make sure that either you're submitting a complete fic finished in the last two months /or/ you're submitting a fragment that was all published within the last two months. (If you've got a chapter or arc that's relevant, submit them, but don't just submit your whole fic up to the current chapter every month.)
