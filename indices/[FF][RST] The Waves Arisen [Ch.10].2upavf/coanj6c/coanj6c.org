Man, somehow knowing Lee is going to have to find out Gai isn't his dad hurts more than reading about him getting his arm destroyed. I dunno if you're taking deliberate inspiration from Gurren Lagann in writing his lines, but they're great nonetheless.

Also seems kind of weird that the crowd is looking on in horrified silence at Lee reacting to clone!Gai's proclamation when they were roaring with savage exhilaration at Neji being pulped. More values dissonance I suppose, but I'm not sure I'm understanding exactly what they're being horrified by here.
