On Orochimaru: it was pretty clear that the plan with Sand was called off because he had already gotten the seal on Sasuke, and that was the main objective. That is also probably why sound refused to participate in the exam.

On Hinata: She was fighting for her life, and Naruto's... The only question si whether she knew Neji was yielding, or if she could guess but chose not to know, etc.
