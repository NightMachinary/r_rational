So I guess Orochimaru is taking a much more direct and practical strategy in this rational-fic? Or is it the butterfly divergences with him no longer needing to overtly show himself that resulted in the alternate strategy?

Also, I am still wondering what was going on with Hinata's lethality. Good things this fic updates so often. Guess we will find out soon... unless you kill Hinata off.

I laughed at Naruto's Lee I am your father. It was good thinking, Lee might have kept going until he was exsanguinated otherwise (interesting, reddit's spell check does not recognize exasanguinated).
