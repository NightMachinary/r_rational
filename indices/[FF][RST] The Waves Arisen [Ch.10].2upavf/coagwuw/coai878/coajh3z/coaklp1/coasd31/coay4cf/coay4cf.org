Somehow, I really doubt she did that. Rather, she /lowered/ her (ex-)clan's status within the village, by first dissociating herself from them publicly, then insulting their style and avoiding using any of her in-clan advantages like the eye technique, and then demonstrating that their techniques are utterly dominated (at least in this situation) by easily-learned, not-too-costly, genin-level techniques.

She's aiming for getting on the village's good side against the Hyuuga, somewhat like Itachi. In fact, to be more specific, she is demonstrating that a "Hyuuga massacre" would not be an implausible feat, given that most of them don't bother to learn anything other than the Gentle Fist---and the implications this has for the Hyuuga's inter-clan bargaining position will do more to remove their influence from Konoha's politics than anything I've seen done in any other fic (e.g. assassinating Hiashi.)
