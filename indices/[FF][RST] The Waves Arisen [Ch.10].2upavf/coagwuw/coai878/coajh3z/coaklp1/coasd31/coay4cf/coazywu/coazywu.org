The problem with that is that the Hyuuga - as pointed out already - have all the dirt. And unless they are utter morons, will have some sort of dead-man switch set to spill it in the event of attack. Actually, no, it's worse - you can't organize an attack on their compound, because /the entire village/ is inside their aegis, so organizing it would inevitably be spotted.

The only plausible reason they don't rule the village is that they don't care to. - Their info gathering abilities are insane.

I think what she is actually aiming for is to establish she won't come quietly, and that bringing her in against her will is likely to involve casualties. - Because she, in her own person, and her team as a group team is every bit as ambush proof as the Hyuuga compound. Especially because Naruto can in fact leave his eye on permanently. (And he should.) Uhm. If Naruto wants to strengthen his team... Would getting a tailed beast as an adult increase regen? ;)
