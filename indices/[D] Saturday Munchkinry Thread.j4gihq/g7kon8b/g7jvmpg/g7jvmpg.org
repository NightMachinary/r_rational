Inspired by the [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/09/17/4-8-spoilers-dossiers/][Wildbow idea of Gilded Lilies]]

Every two weeks you receive by chance (a mail delivery you didn't order, a loose object lying on the ground, a bird dropping the item in your lap) a magic item. They typically have trade-offs in their usage. Some are minor with small effects: a bit of luck (with unluckiness for using the luck "too selfishly"), a bit of knowledge (a stone that whispers vague warnings that become audible in your dreams if you sleep with it under your pillow), a small wish, a small curse, etc. Every so often (about 4 times a year) you get a major one the sort of thing that could make the plot of a horror movie (for the items with more negative side-effects or primarily negative effects) or the plot of a family movie (for the relatively benevolent items: a kid wishes to be an adult, and is changed into an adult just long enough to learn valuable life lessons, or a mother and daughter switch bodies for a day, etc.) or the plot of a fantasy movie (you are transported into a magical land in your dreams, with challenges that mirror your real-life challenges).

With practice you can occasionally guess at the genre and subvert it: the mummified baby that whispers of your eternal suffering can safely handled with gloves and tongs and locked in a steel box to be disposed of; the lava lamp that grants wishes can be drained of its power with harmless minor wishes; etc. But some items don't cleanly fit into a genre, some don't follow narrative rules at all, and some may have a misleading genre.

Some of the more useful items avoid being munchkined too hard: hidden usage restrictions, karmic systems of payback, narrative driven limitations on their application. But for most items their limits can be worked around and leveraged.

Avoiding or refusing the items typically results in innocent people hurt by them. Innocent people are often slow to truly grasp that magic is at work and will latch onto other explanations, even to the extent of believing that the hallucinated things or had a psychotic break.

As much as the items seem narrative driven, they don't quite cleanup after themselves into neat endings: the kid that wished to be an adult might suffer from a bit of dysphoria when changing back to a kid and the absence of the role he had taken as an adult might send things into chaos.

Trying to reveal these items to the world see chance conspire against you, the item breaks, the video camera glitches, the video camera works but the resulting appearance of the magical effect looks like bad CGI, etc.

There seems to be people that know about magic... but all of them avoid answering your questions and at most will buy some of the items off of you or dispose of the nastier items.

So even with all those limit munchkinry ideas? Items to prioritize figuring out and leveraging? Obvious genre traps to avoid (keeping in mind you can't always predict the genre)?
