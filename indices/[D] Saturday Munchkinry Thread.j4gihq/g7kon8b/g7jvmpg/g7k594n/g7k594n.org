Small power, huge level of control.

You have the ability to disintegrate anything in a cube 10 cm (4 inches) in each dimension.

The power works selectively with great precision. You can choose what to disintegrate, which shape to carve, with a precision of a tenth of a millimeter.

You must see at least a part of the cube on which you apply this power, and can use it once every 30 seconds.

You also gain an approximate intuitive understanding of how matter is shaped inside the target cube, so you can for example vaporize the inside of a lock leaving the door intact.

Your goal is to gain as much personal power (Intentionally vaguely defined. Money, fame, political influence...) as you can, while keeping your power a secret.
