You have to imagine the shape, but let's say the power gives you a greater artistic sense, so you have an easier time visualizing the shape of a bear, but must still visualize as many details as you want in the finished piece.

The finish can be smooth if you want, one tenth if a millimeter is small enough to feel smooth to the touch.
