Important distinction: does the person asking the question have to know in advance the answer to the question, or can they simply recognize it /as/ the correct answer without specifically knowing that answer was correct ahead of time?

If it's the latter, there are a huge number of questions that could be answered in math and science, where there are many possible theories but little ability to distinguish correctness between them, or finding the correct solution takes huge amounts of effort. String theory comes to mind, but you could prove P=NP or something like that as well.
