Depending on what counts as "know" it seems like you would be useful to understand the zeitgeist of a group.

Have everyone write down the exact same question to you say have every history professor in the world write down "How did Hitler rise to power?" and then have all of the questions in front of you and reveal them all at once.

So read them the same question repeatedly as fast as you can using speedreading tools, since it's the same question I guess you just need to a millisecond to recognise the question has appeared and disappeared before you power kicks in and knows that it's written by someone else.

Oh I just realised how you can use this

Detective, police!

Force prisoners to write down questions like "Did I kill [X]?" you will know the correct answer even if they don't want you too.

Similarly you could tell if something is ghostwritten or something else by having the original author write an identical question as in the potentially ghostwritten thing
