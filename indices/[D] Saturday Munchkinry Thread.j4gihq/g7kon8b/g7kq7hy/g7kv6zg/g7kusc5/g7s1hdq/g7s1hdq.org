Does this work for any written statement, or only ones that end in questionmarks?

I'm thinking in terms of Fermat's last theorem. A notation scribbled onto the margin of a mathematical paper, giving a result and stating that he had a 'truly remarkable proof' which the margin was too small to contain. (A few centuries later, a several-hundred-page proof was found; but it would still be interesting - and possibly /very/ informative - to know which proof Fermat had had in mind at the time).
