This may be a stretch, but you may be able to prove that P=NP. Since when someone asks you a question, you automatically output whatever they would think is correct at the time of asking, for NP problems they'd be able to quickly verify anything you output, so the only answer they'd consider correct would be the correct answer, even if they don't know the correct answer themselves at the time of asking.

This has a bunch of fun effects ranging from super-fast protein folding to being able to crack any encryption algorithm. All you'd need is someone technically competent enough to verify your solution to ask the question (this reminds me of Watson in Sherlock Holmes).
