Hmm, you and [[/u/D0TheMath]] raise good points.

I don't think the ability should allow the questioner time to verify whether the given solution is correct, otherwise it would be extremely overpowered. You could just have them repeatedly ask things like "Where can I find unfound treasures?" and then automatically know the locations of treasures since it is easy to verify it by going to said locations. Or even ask "what is the code for a friendly AGI?" then know it because it is also verifiable just by coding the AGI and seeing if it kills us all.

Intuitively, I want the power to be some kind of limited mind reading, where people who ask you questions also inadvertently have the answers in their minds revealed to you.
