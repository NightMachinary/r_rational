This sort of works but sort of doesn't. It would work if the people asking the questions have a correct answer for those questions, but a lot of people will be asking questions they don't know the answers to, so your power would remain silent since there aren't any 'correct' answers.

Note that the correct answer is not necessarily the same as the desired answer. If someone asks whether you will lower taxes, they will desire the answer of 'yes', but they won't necessarily think that 'yes' is the correct answer.

So if they ask questions like "What will your fiscal policies be like during your term in office?", your power would be silent. On the other hand, if you can get them to ask questions like "What makes a good politician?" you could get a whole data dump on their political preferences.
