You automatically know a 'correct' answer to any question you are asked. Specifically, an answer that the ask-er would consider correct at the time of asking.

The question does not have to be verbal. When a teacher hands out written exam questions, you automatically know an answer that the teacher would consider correct at the time the teacher wrote those questions.

In the case where a question is copied, (like by a photocopier, or by a student being forced to write the same question over and over, or by an internet connection), the 'asker' of the question is still considered to be the person who originally posed the question.

Apart from doing really well on written tests, what could you do with this power?
