That's fair. Maybe the limit could be "verify that the answer is correct within the timeframe of the answer being said" or something similar, to maybe get a few things. You could be a good therapist with something like that, able to give clear answers to questions your client is confused on.

There are the standard mind reading uses, investigation, anti-corruption, verification of intent when making deals, stuff like that. It wouldn't be particularly seamless, since you would need the people to directly ask the relevant questions, but it could still be useful. I think if you did a lot of searching through records, you could answer various criminal and political questions if someone happened to put a rhetorical question in their speech. "Why would I do such a thing?" and similar. Effectiveness would heavily depend on the person's rhetorical style.

Oh, you mentioned that the power works through records and copies rather than direct speech. Does it work if the original person who asked the question is dead? You could probably get some historical information that is otherwise unobtainable by doing something like the above and looking through historical texts for people who happen to ask questions that are revealing when you can magically know the truth. May not be particularly lucrative or practical, but it would be interesting. No specific questions come to mind that this power could help with, but given how much recorded history there is, you're bound to hit something.
