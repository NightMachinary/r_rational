You can't easily predict whether these items will have a positive or negative effect on someone. What you can expect, though, is that they will add some more variance to the life of whoever possesses them.

Therefore, you should think of them as a way to distribute variance to other people by sending them an item. People facing long odds would benefit on average from their outcomes becoming more random, while entrenched harmful parties might be brought low more easily if they're affected by unpredictable outside-context effects. Sending the items as anonymous gifts seems like the easiest way to accomplish this.

As a somewhat cynical bonus, it's probably a lot easier to catalogue the effects of the items and try to predict them if each one is affecting a different person, rather than having to disentangle the supernatural weirdness of having all of them affecting you at once.
