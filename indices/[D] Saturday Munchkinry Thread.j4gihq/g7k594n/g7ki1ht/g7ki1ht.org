Depending on the definition of "see" you may be able to safely dispose of nuclear waste. There would be a lot of overhead to (falsely) explain how you're doing it, but it would still probably be worth it. Made a lot easier if a few people can know about your power, but not the world at large.

Otherwise, magic tricks, cancer surgeon, assassination, caper-style heists where you create a hole underneath molten gold and siphon it out. The sky is the limit! You could make a good living just carving intricate pictures into the inside of glass, but probably not as lucrative as some of the other options.
