Gambling.

If you can use your power to gain an intuitive understanding of things within the cube, that is in a sense letting you see through solid walls.

It won't quite work for poker, because cards all have the same shape, but there are other forms of gambling that depend on hidden shapes. There's that one game (whose name eludes me) where the host places 3 die in a small cup, rolls them about for a bit and keeps the values hidden to all, then all players can bet on what values the die are showing. Your power would let you know for certain what values are shown, because a dice typically has concave dots on each face, meaning the shape would be different depending on which side is up.
