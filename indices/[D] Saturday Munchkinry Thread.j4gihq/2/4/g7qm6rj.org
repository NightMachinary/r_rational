Do you want nobody to know that anyone has any powers, nobody to know that anyone has this specific power, or nobody to know that you have this power?

If the first one, you can assassinate a public figure during a speech to a crowd by deleting exterior membranes of blood vessels in their brain. This will cause aneurisms, but if you practice on animals first you should be able to make it so the aneurisms burst several hours after the speech. You could get another one by erasing sections of the pancreatic ducts, causing digestive enzymes to leak into the abdominal cavity, though this would only work if you could see them from behind or if they were very thin. There's a reason surgeons do not mess with the pancreas. You can't do this too often though, and you probably can't use the same method twice, or else people will start to suspect that somebody has superpowers. If you messed hard enough with the wrong polities, they might also be able to figure out that you were the only common denominator in the crowds where these people died, though they wouldn't be able to prove that you did it with just that.

Beyond assassinations, you can make impossible objects to sell to collectors of curios or projects which need them. Something like a perfectly hollowed out monocrystalline silicon sphere would be impossible for us to make, but trivial for you. Similarly, you could create perfect gearboxes of near-arbitrary complexity out of a solid lump of metal, allowing you to make some very valuable watches to sell to collectors.

You could purify veins of silver or gold with very little labor by disintegrating all the non-metallic material. If the deletion replaces the space with air at local temperatures and pressures, you could significantly extend deep-sea trips by refilling your tanks (though at the risk of causing the bends if you don't come up slowly), though you wouldn't be able to stay down indefinitely until local pressure increases the density of air by a factor of six. Interestingly, this means deep sea diving trips can be longer for you the deeper you are, with obvious applications for deep sea construction. This means you could also extend space travel indefinitely (at least the air part of it) by replacing canisters of highly compressed CO2 rich air with cannisters of breathable air.
