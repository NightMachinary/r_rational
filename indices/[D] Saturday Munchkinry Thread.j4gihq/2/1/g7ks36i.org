How precisely do you have to decide on the shape? If I think of a bear or a dinosaur or a bird, will this power fill in the details to carve that shape or do I need the exact dimensions of the desired sculpture? What finish does the stone take: smooth or rough? A tenth of a millimeter is some nice precision...

This is not a particularly valuable application, but easy to conceal and keep secret: pick a semi-precious stone and rapidly make precision carving that can be sold at a decent mark-up. You could also do carvings made to order for a bit more of a price. Depending on the exact stone used and the sort of market you find... guesstimating from Etsy prices maybe $5-$10 for crude shapes in non-valuable stones, $50-$100 a carving for intricately detailed carvings in more valuable stones?

So if you get a huge block to work with and churn through it as fast as your power can work and find a seller that can absorb your full volume (which at your rate of production is actually somewhat tricky, you could fake being an entire sculpture production company)... that is about 120 sculptures in an hour. At the low end, that is $600 dollars an hour (1.2 million dollars a year if you can manage to sell your full volume), at the high end $12,000 and hour (24.9 million dollars a year). Not exactly world changing money, but easily enough to fund any intermediate stages of your plans. Probably enough that you don't need to bother getting paid for assassinations or pulling off heists at least.
