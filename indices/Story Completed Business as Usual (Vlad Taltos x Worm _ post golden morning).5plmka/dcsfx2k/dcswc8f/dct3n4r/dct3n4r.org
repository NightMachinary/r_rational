There is certainly no need to defend yourself or the story. The work may well be perfectly faithful to sources, have many good qualities and even be rational, I have made no claims with regard to that.

My issue is simply with the "ha ha, now the protagonist must listen to how he was manipulated and why he can't get the thing he wants" ending. It's just an unsatisfying and frustrating closure to the narrative for me, regardless of any other qualities the work may have. Even then, it's not like you have an obligation to cater to my personal tastes in narratives.
