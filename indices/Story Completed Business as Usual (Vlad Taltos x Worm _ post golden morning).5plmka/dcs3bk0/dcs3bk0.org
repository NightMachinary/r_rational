While the story definitely is not strictly rational, it was the result of mostly-rational planned story-writing. There were two threads. One for planning the story, the other for writing it. There is a link to the planning thread on the first page of the story thread (which is what I linked here.)

Total story length is 110k words, so it's a bit longer than most fanfics.
