Writing a rational Vlad Taltos is very difficult, however I did state in my response that the story was based on rational story building, not fully rational.

If you don't know the Jhereg universe books, then you don't have the background knowledge to understand that Vlad himself is almost certainly a god, but he doesn't know it, and would probably reject it if he did know it. The two chapters before the epilogue hint at this based on his conversations about how gods think and act, accompanied by Tattletale's headache reactions to Vlad as he subconsciously meddles with reality.

Vlad does attempt to deal with everything rationally from a human point of view, with I would like to think are significant successes, but eventually he starts bending reality just enough to win.

If you would like to think of it from Verra's point of view, the story was a lot more rational, since one of her greatest goals was to force Vlad to utilize his divinity.

This is not a new thing. I am fairly certain Verra did the same thing, forcing Vlad to unconsciously utilize his divinity, in the Jenoine encounter where Vlad created Lady Teldra.

Perhaps I did a poor job of writing a story that is irrational on one level, and rational on a different level, but it's hard to write Vlad Taltos any other way.
