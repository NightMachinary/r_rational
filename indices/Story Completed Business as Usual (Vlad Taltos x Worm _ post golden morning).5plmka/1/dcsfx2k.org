Couldn't resist peeking at the last chapter, even though I haven't finished reading all of the preceding ones. I've got to say "somebody explains to the main character precisely how little agency they have and gloats about them not being able to do anything about it" is about the least favourite way to end a story for me. Don't think I'm gonna bother with the rest of it, since it has such a frustrating ending.
