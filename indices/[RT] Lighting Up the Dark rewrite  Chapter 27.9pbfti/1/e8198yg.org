Just re-read the whole thing over the course of the day while I should be doing real work. Still as quality as ever.

Two things: one, who the hell is Raijin, who ctrl+f only found four times but apparently took care of Naruto as a kid?

And second, wow, I forgot how frustrated reading that fight with Shikamaru made me. What a condescending prick with his super-Bayesian fighting style and throwaway koans, Sun Tzu-ish quotes, and references to solipsism. It's like he's only there as an object lesson that Naruto's not the smartest guy in the world whole while epitomizing some of the exact same character flaws, only without the protagonist's depth.

If I ever wrote Naruto fic myself I'd feel obligated to write a scene where Shikamaru proclaims he's, "ten steps ahead," and gets his nose broken immediately after by someone just plain faster and better than him. Laziness as a ninja vice should have real consequences beyond just social ones. Just once I'd like to see him be a little too slow to put one of his genius plans into action and watch things go wrong instead of coasting. Which, granted, happened in canon with Asuma, but still. It'd give me wicked schadenfreude to read.
