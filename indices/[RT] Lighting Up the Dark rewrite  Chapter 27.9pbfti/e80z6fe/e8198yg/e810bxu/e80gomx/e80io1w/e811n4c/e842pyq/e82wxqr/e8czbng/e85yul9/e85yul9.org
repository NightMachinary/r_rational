"The mood in Wave as a whole was changing. After initial disbelief that Gatō was really gone, there was general jubilation. A parasite rather than a ruler, Gatō had been smart enough to leave much of the Wave bureaucracy intact, albeit with overseers (now fled or dead) to make sure his ruinously high taxes were collected on time. Now, that bureaucracy was able to make use of the money Tazuna's supporters had originally gathered for mercenary hire, and start rebuilding the country's infrastructure and economy. Though Wave's rebirth would be slow and by no means easy, there was already a sense of hope blooming among the people."

​

This goes against the main thesis of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolution_Betrayed]]; the bureaucracy would expand to soak a big chunk of the new available ressources, and the people's hopes might be unfounded.
