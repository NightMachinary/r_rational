Informative, thank you, and there are two answers to that.

First, I struggle to think of a single parallel between the Russian Revolution and what has just happened in Wave. I hesitate to even call the latter a revolution, beyond the minimum requirement of a change of power accomplished through force.

Second, even were Trotsky's thesis applicable, Naruto certainly wouldn't be seeing this to be true a mere week after Gat≈ç's downfall.
