Not many parallels to the Russian Revolution, but I can see some parallels to decolonization.

In countries where the colonizers set ruinously high taxes, the bureaucracy took on a more extractive role and that remained the case even after the colonizers left.

Countries like India have relatively good institutions because many Englishmen lived there and didn't see the place as merely a tax base. Countries like Haiti on the other hand were left with extractive institutions because the colonizers didn't want to live there, only wanted to collect taxes.

If Gato was a parasite who lived far away and not a ruler who lived among his subjects, the bureaucracy he set up would be more like Haiti than like India.

I got that analysis from chapter 10 of the book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Economics][Poor Economics]], by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo.
