There are a few completely new scenes, and a bunch more rewritten to a single POV which gives a quite a bit more insight into the character. Plus things sprinkled throughout which aren't huge individually but enrich characterisation a fair bit when taken together.

To be honest, it's been so long since the original that I can't remember all the changes, but some examples that spring to mind are Chapter X (the Hokage conversation), the opening of Chapter XI (Kakashi and Naruto's self-reflections) and Chapter XXIII (the Sakura/Ino fight).
