First off, the whole politics is spiders thing. Someone on [[/r/rational]] deleted their account after I discussed politics with them, much the same politics. If this is an emotional issue for you let me know and I'll stop. I don't want to drive you away from the community or anything. I figure if you're here, you're probably in favour of discussions, but if you're not, or if that changes, I'll step down.

I'm not sure if there are any rules we should impose before we continue talking about spiders. If you have any let me know.

Anyway, onward to the debate.

  It did a good job of illustrating the rational argument for feminism: that racism and sexism are a form of bias, giving a false view of the world - and the past.

I don't think most of the people who consider modern feminism harmful (myself included) would consider that to be untrue in any important way.

Is an entirely supportable sentence, for the most part. Even if there are "biotruths" or what have you, we still need to be striving for equality of opportunity.

I don't think this is a good argument for modern feminism, because modern ferminism is pretty divorced from that particular view. Are you familiar with the idea of a [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/][motte and bailey doctrine]].

Is an obvious good thing. At the very least it's not something I'm going to debate right now, because it being true or not shouldn't change my actions.

Racism and sexism being bad is entirely defensible position, a talking point that only exists to make sure modern feminism is only ever debating assholes. It's the bailey in your motte and bailey. It's not a real political point.

We're not criticizing modern feminism for views like "Everyone should have equal opportunity" or "Generations of poverty and strife are a bad thing".

I'm personally against modern feminism because as a culture it seems to feel that it's /so/ in the right that it can use evil tactics. It's so in the right that it can violate the practicalities of equality (of opportunity) to get results a bit faster.

It's not because we don't think that a lot of social justice causes are very good, or that the far right is regressive and evil, it's just that social justice is increasingly populated by well intentioned extremists. People so convinced that they're in the right that they're willing to break [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/][social geneva conventions]], for want of a better term.
