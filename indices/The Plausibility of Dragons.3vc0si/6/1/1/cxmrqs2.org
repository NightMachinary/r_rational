Their interpretation of what this story is meant to mean is pretty clearly spot-on, and I do think it's a pretty good piece of social commentary.

I think it's an attack against the sad-puppies crowd though, not a support of the feminist phyle.

It looks like you're just attacking the other tribe. You shouldn't do that, even if the other tribe is terrible. It's bad for reasoning objectivly.
