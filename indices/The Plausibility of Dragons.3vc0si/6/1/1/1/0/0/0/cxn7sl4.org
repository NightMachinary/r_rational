I am. I just don't see it as relevant? It doesn't follow at all that instrumental and epistemic rationality are orthogonal.

I don't see how supporting organised mass religion from your point of view would be sacrificing epistemic rationality? I might consider it unethical to support religion because other people falling for it helps preserve your values; but unless you're actively making yourself believe (which doesn't seem to be the case, as you say yourself you don't believe any of the mythologies) it's not relevant to epistemic rationality.

Did you mean /not/ correlated in any way? I'm having trouble parsing this.
