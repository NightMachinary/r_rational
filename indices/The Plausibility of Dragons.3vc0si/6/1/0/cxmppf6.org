I'm not really sure how to respond to your comment.

I will pick out the one objection that I think's worth responding to: I think looking at the work through a feminist lens is /very/ relevant in this context. It's a story in a sci-fi & fantasy magazine that won a Hugo in 2014, so I'm going to assume that the author, editor, and publishers are familiar with the whole Sad/Rabid Puppies controversy. In that context, a story where a lady warrior and arabic scholar go fight to avoid being erased from the setting.... if anyone's 'inserting progressivism', it's the author. I'm just pointing it out.

But I might be getting a bit too close to the spiders, here.
