I really liked this. It did a good job of illustrating the rational argument for feminism: that racism and sexism are a form of bias, giving a false view of the world - and the past. They also distort the stories we tell and the genres we've built to place those stories in. As such, they should be opposed by anyone who values truth.

The contrast between the work as a historically accurate story and the work as a fantasy was neat. "I would suspect that I have stumbled into another world" - nope, you've stumbled into another genre. Good luck! The title reinforces that - "The plausibility of dragons". Even in medieval times, dragons were implausible to a scholar. And yet from reading fantasy works you'd assume that they're /more/ plausible than swordswomen. Why did it turn out this way? Well, it seems to work out for the dragons :P no surprise that they'd fight to continue it, to keep fantasy free from reality, history, and feminist critique. There's a deeper question in there - should /fantasy/, of all things, aim to be factual and based in reality even when telling stories - but on that topic I don't currently have an opinion worth sharing.

And I liked the moral of the story too, with the final conclusion of the protagonists to go around editing their fantasy story to permit their existence - killing dragons, magic, and false ideas of the middle ages as they go.
