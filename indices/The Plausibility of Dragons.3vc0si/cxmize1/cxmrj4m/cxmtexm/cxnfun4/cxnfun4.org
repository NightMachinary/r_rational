That seems pretty fair. "It did a good job of illustrating the rational argument for feminism" is a bit contentious, because now days feminism seems to mean more "the feminist phyle" including all those bad tactics, then particular feminist points like racism is bad.

That's all I'm getting at, I don't think it can be called a rational argument for feminism, because feminism is a sub-culture not the policies it talks about.
