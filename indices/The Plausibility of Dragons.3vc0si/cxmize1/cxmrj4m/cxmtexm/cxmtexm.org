I'm way too invested in this account to delete it. I'm not going to stop participating in this community. If I get really upset and decide that everything I said was so wrong as to be useless, I may delete my comments.

And I have no idea how to handle the spiders either, to be honest. I assume mods will start deleting things if the spider infestation grows out of control and becomes destructive.

I think this is the only part of that first paragraph of my original comment with something to discuss. You agree with what I said, and go on to explain that you disagree with opinions and behaviours that you've seen grouped in with what I said. Ok. Sure. Seems reasonable? I'm not trying to start a debate over "is racism bad", rather one about "what does this story actually say about it? In what ways is it relevant to any point the author may have been making?". I want to talk about how this story handles it, which is why I was commenting /here/.

  I don't think this is a good argument for modern feminism, because modern ferminism is pretty divorced from that particular view.

Modern feminism tends to argue from morality more, at least that I've noticed. From the position that racism is wrong because it's immoral. However, the argument against racism-as-bias is the one that I think the story is making, and I think it's interesting in that context and also because it neatly ties into a general rationalist principle. It was also new to me, as I hadn't quite put those two concepts together before.

I don't feel the evil tactics thing is relevant, unless you think either that I or the author is engaging in that behaviour. I read your links: Scott made good arguments, as usual. Maybe it's just fundamental attribution error, but I don't think I engage in the behaviour he's concerned about, and I'd be a least a little bit worried if someone pointed out that I was in fact doing that. And a lot of the examples he pulls up seem like lot of debate over simple problems, but then again I'm pretty solidly third-wave sex-positive and intersectional, and there's certainly a lot of debate within feminism and between different branches. But honestly, I'm not sure how to defend my ideas from the kind of people who hang out around them, or from examples of bad things that those people have done.
