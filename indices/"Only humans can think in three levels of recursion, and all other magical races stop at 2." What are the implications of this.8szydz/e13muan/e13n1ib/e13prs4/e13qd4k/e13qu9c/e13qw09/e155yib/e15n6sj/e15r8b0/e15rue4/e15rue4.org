In reality, you generally need trained /humans/ to detect double agents, otherwise they wouldn't be a thing. In reality, humans mostly can't detect simple single-layered lies, and have all kinds of weird deficits when you do simple stuff like repeating the same lie over and over again. They need actual training to deal with that.

How about a fantasy world where humans didn't have that problem, and the "big lie" didn't work on them?

Or one where humans didn't need 50,000 years to develop the scientific method?

One where humans are inherently rational?
