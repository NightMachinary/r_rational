Ah... You are aware that you are in [[/r/rational]], not [[/r/hpmor]], yes? Even the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/870yhg/bst_ways_to_make_mugglesmortals_interesting/dwa703i/][original statement]] wasn't about HPMoR. It was just a hypothetical way that, in /any/ story, an author could make a meaningful difference between humans and other magical races. In fact, the specific question that Mr. Yudkowsky was responding to is: "What are the best old, wrong theories of mind/cognition/mental faculties that, if taken to be true for different magical beings, would make for the most interesting characters or civilizations?"

OP's question in this thread is this: Why would failing the course prevent a goblin from working in Gringotts? What useful skills would it teach them? What problems would it help them avoid?
