Okay, but suppose that while different races /can/ learn anything, humans find it much, much easier to learn about thinking about thinking about thinking about things than goblins do. Regardless of whether that's how it works in the real world, suppose you're writing about a world where that is how it works. Most goblins can't get their heads around third level recursion before they're college age. It's your job to set up the curriculum for that class. What do you say, on the first day of class, to convince your goblin students that they should care about third level recursion and higher, instead of dropping it in favor of easier and more interesting classes like Microeconomic Effects of Promissory Notes in Eighth Century Ruritania II?
