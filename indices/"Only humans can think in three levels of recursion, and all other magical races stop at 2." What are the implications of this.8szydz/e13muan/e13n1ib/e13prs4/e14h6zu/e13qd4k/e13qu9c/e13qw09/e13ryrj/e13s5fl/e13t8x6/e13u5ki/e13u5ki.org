  You are aware that you are in [[/r/rational]], not [[/r/hpmor]], yes?
#+end_quote

Sure, and HPMoR is frequently discussed in both.

#+begin_quote
  Even the original statement wasn't about HPMoR.
#+end_quote

I missed that. It looked like it's a quote about HPMoR, and the OP didn't link to the original context. Sorry.

OK, that's basically a fantasy application of "humans are special" (TVtropes link left out). There's no end of stories about the elves being incapable of lying or bound by their word or otherwise having artistically interesting cognitive defects, and humans taking advantage of that to win over them.

Personally I would have picked [[https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Consciousness-Breakdown-Bicameral-Mind/dp/0618057072][bicameralism]] as the defunct cognitive model. Bicameral elves would be REALLY interesting.

So I've pretty much covered the skill it would teach them, to keep track of previous statements and see if they are inconsistent... for extended discussions, or where you find an inconsistency, you'd have some kind of signal for a clerk to patch in and keep track of what you're hearing and make notes and prompt you to ask leading questions though a magical earphone...
