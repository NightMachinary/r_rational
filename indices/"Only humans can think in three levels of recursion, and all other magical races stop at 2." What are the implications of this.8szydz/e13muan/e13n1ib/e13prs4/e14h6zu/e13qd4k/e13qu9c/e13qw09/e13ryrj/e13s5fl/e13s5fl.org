  Regardless of whether that's how it works in the real world, suppose you're writing about a world where that is how it works.

My point, which I'm trying to close in on, is that the HPMoR world seems to be one where the Strong C-T hypothesis holds, so it's not actually consistent with the way that world works.

If you want to read some rational stories set in a world where the strong C-T hypothesis is REALLY taken seriously, I suggest /Permutation City/, /Diaspora/, and /Schild's Ladder/ by Greg Egan.

Permutation City was about his first book, so the climactic arc is kind of forced and kind of breaks consistency, but the Copy society and Solipsist Nation are fascinating. Diaspora and Schild's Ladder are totally solid (and the latter has some existential fridge horror that's worth the trip).

But assuming the counterfactual, that's easy: "If you don't pass this course you can not work in any human-facing position in Gringotts."
