That's a narrow way to think about learning.

In practice, given a group of people X, you can find concepts that these people have an easier time understanding, because most people in group X already have experience dealing with similar concepts or have thinking patterns that adapt well to them. These concepts could reasonably be designated as "intuitive" or "intuitive to group X".

In the context of this thread, Anakiri is saying that humans would have an advantage over elves, because they'd be able to create and spot complex multi-layered lies "intuitively" (as in, in the case of most humans, without needing to spend a lot of time/effort learning it), whereas elves would need to spend much more time training to keep up with human deceptions, and only long-trained elves could do it without a mental effort (the same way skilled mathematicians start internalizing complex math concepts on a gut level after a while).

As an aside, I really don't like the "Nothing but the nipple" quote (especially when discussing UI) because it erases a lot of that nuance. In practice, people aren't Turing machines, and they deal with some concepts better than others. Saying "but /really/, nothing is /actually/ intuitive because everyone learns at some point" is often pedantic, the same way epistemological nihilism (eg "your point about ethics is invalid because morality is subjective anyway") is often pedantic.
