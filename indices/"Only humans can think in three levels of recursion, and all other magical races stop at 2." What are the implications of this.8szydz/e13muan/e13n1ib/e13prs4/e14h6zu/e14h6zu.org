It's not that we /can't/ go deeper intuitively, it's that it's impractical to go any deeper than a really good lie unless you can model the other person very well, since it's so easy to backfire. Simplest solution and all that. You're more likely to succeed with a good lie than with trying to convince someone you were trying to lie to them recursively.

We usually figure out lies through body language and context, if you can control those well enough to lie there's no reason to go any deeper.

Say Alice is a good liar, Bob knows this. Alice seems to fumble in the lie, Bob knows she wouldn't do that. So the fumble must be intentional. Alice knows Bob knows she's a good liar, so he knows she wouldn't fumble except on purpose, so it can't be the obvious (that the car really is red and she's trying to convince him it's blue) since she knows he'd see through that. At this point you enter a bunch of recursions where Bob is wondering how well she predicted how he interpreted what she did, and then decides to go one level above it...unless she predicted /that/. Alice can't reasonably predict how Bob will think about this, so you basically just have it down to random chance.

By fumbling the lie intentionally, Alice gave away that she was trying to lie about something. She would have better odds of succeeding by just lying since Bob wouldn't have suspected anything.
