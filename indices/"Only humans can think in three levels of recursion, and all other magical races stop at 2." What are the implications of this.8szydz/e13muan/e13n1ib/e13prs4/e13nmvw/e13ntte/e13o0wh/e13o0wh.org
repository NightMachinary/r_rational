I don't think you're understanding what's going on here. Yes, a nonhuman would be able to figure this out with pen and paper, but it seems the practical implications that matter are the ones in the moment. Bob could determine Alice wants Bob to think she's lying if he thought it through and wrote out the steps, but intuitively he wouldn't realize it. It would take him a long time and some clues to figure it out, if he ever did. The thing with making up nonexistent races with different thought processes is that you have to entertain that they think differently than we do. If that means functional illiteracy (which this doesn't), then so be it.
