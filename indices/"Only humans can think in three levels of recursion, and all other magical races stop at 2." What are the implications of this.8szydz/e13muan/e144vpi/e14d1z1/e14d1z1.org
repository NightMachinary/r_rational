No, your examples go: agent, double agent, triple agent, quadruple agent. A Russian spy in CIA is already a double agent:

- (agent, recursion 1) works for cause A;

- (double-agent, 2) pretends to work for cause A, works for cause B;

- (triple-agent, 3) pretends to pretend to work for cause A, pretends to work for cause B, works for cause A;

- (quadruple-agent, 4) pretends to pretend to pretend to work for cause A, pretends to pretend to work for cause B, pretends to work for cause A, works for cause B.

Recursion here means the number of relations with a particular concept ("cause"). An agent has one relation [agent] → [cause]. A double-agent has two: [agent] → ← [cause], triple-agent has three: [agent] → ← → [cause], and so on. If you treat arrows as vectors and sum them, you would see that agents and triple-agents work for the cause, whereas a double-agent doesn't.

Another way of looking at it is, an intelligence agent is expected to model/predict the behaviour of the agency's enemies, which is already recursion 1. Double-agent thinks at recursion 2, and triple-agent thinks at recursion 3.

Humans aren't usually able to be quadruple-agents, which means non-humans wouldn't be able to be triple-agents, i. e. be fake defectors.
