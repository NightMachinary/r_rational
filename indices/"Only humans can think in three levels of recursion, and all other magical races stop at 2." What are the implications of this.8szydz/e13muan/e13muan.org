Forget about thinking about what /you/ think. If you can't think about what /other people/ think you think, then you can't be a very good liar. You can tell lies - try to get other people to think certain things - but you can't think about your lies, and adapt them based on what you think other people think. This will cripple your ability to engage in deception.

But I think you're still one level down from what Mr. Yudkowsky meant. Thinking about cars is level zero, the object level. Thinking about how you thought about the car is recursing once, and thinking about that is recursing twice. So magical races actually can think about their lies, but only humans can go further. This means that while magical races can believably lie, only humans can believably lie about lying. Magical races can use spies and informants, but only humans can use double agents. Only humans can even think about the concept of double agents, without going cross-eyed and needing to work it out on paper.

Also, only humans can realize that someone is trying to make them think that they are lying. Say, Alice saw a red car, but wants Bob to think that the car is blue. Any magical race can say "The car is blue," and fill in details of the story, adjusting to the picture Bob has (2) of the picture Alice is trying to make for him (1) of the car (0). But if Alice is human, then she can avoid eye contact and fidget uncomfortably and mumble, "The car is bl- I mean, /red/." Bob instantly thinks: Alice wants (2) Bob to think (1) that the car is red (0). She is lying badly, and the car is probably actually blue. Bob congratulates himself on piercing the deception. Alice wins, because humans can pretend to pretend.
