A troll would not go to all this effort to explain themselves and would go after easier targets.

Things still have to make logical sense and specific enough to have a proper answer . E.p What if people were triangles? Is not a proper question.

If you take the strictest reading where elves are simply not able to understand deeply nested loops expressed in mathematical notation then they will simply devise a different but equivalent notation using iteration to express the same mathematical truths. They could also get a human to develop an iterative algorithm for transforming nested recursive functions to their iterative equivalents.
