You don't have to comprehend recursion to simulate it. You aren't thinking in terms of recursion, you're thinking in terms of iteration.

What you're talking about is some kind of memory limitation that can't be bypassed by reading and writing information in external memory. This amounts to functional illiteracy. Even something like "they can't recall more than two items they've read" wouldn't do it, because you could still build a Beowulf Cluster of Grendels. I'm not sure that a being so limited would be able to pass as a human in casual conversation.

So there's your answer.
