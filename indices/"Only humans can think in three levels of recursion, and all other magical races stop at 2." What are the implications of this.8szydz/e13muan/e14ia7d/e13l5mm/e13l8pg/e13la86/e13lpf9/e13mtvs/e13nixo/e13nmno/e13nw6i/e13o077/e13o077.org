  I don't think you understand the difference between iteration and recursion.

I have been a professional computer programmer for almost 40 years. I wrote my first compiler in 1979. I have implemented at least a dozen arithmetic expression parsers (an inherently recursive algorithm) in Fortran (a language that doesn't support recursion). I know the difference between iteration and recursion. Given indexable storage they are Turing-equivalent operations.
