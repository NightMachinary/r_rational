This idea is inspired from a quote "in practice, infinite recursions are at most three levels deep."

The zero level is generic statements about the world around us such as 'the sky is blue' and 'Alice is a nice woman'.

The first level is any statement/reflections about yourself which includes statements like 'I (Bob) am a nice guy' or 'I (Bob) like Alice'. A common question of the first level is "What do I think of myself?" or "What do I think about other people?"

The second level is any statement about other people's conceptions about yourself or another person. For example, 'Alice thinks I'm not so nice' or 'Alice thinks Carl is nice'. A common question of the second level is "What does Alice think about me (Bob)?" or "What does Alice think about Carl?"

The third level is any statement/thought about another person's thoughts about what they think of someone else. For example, "Alice thinks Bob believes Carl is rude', 'Bob thinks Alice thinks he is attracted to her', and 'Carl thinks Bob thinks Carl wants to date Alice'. A common question of the third level is "What does Alice think I (Bob) think about Alice?"

The first level is a model of your own mind. The second level requires you to have a model of other people's minds to reason about how they think about you. The third level is required to have models of how other people are modeling your thoughts.

In this way, the magical races can reason about themselves and how other people think about the people around them. But without the third level, you can't know how other people think /you/ think. The third level is required to lie or bluff convincingly. Without it, you can't model how other people will react to your lies.
