#+begin_quote
  Iteration and recursion are both tools that can be used to implement a recursive algorithm.
#+end_quote

But this is false, yes? Iteration is a necessary part of a working recursive algorithm, and recursion is a word that encompasses everything a recursive algorithm is. They are not at all the same, as you can, for example, iterate through a list without recursing.

#+begin_quote
  The claim that I made is "being unable to understand recursion at three levels given bookkeeping tools requires being functionally illiterate".
#+end_quote

But the word 'intuitively' /does/ change the meaning of that sentence. If they are able to work it out in the end, but can't grasp it immediately, it puts an advantage on the person who can. Plus the one without intuition may not ever realize there was something to work out if they aren't that rational.
