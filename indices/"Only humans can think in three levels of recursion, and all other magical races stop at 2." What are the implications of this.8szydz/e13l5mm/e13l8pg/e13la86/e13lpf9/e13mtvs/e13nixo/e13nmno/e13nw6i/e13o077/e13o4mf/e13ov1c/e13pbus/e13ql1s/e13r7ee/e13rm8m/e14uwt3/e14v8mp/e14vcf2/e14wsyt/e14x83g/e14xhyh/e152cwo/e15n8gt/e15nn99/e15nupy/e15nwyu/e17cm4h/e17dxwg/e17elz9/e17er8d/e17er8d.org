  Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where *a function being defined is applied within its own definition.* While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.
