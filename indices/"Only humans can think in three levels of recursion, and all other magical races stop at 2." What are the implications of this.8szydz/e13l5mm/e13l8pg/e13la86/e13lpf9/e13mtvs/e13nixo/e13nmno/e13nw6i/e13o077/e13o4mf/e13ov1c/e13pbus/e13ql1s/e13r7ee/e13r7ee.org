I feel like allowing that to be called iteration is kind of muddying the words. Recursion has a specific meaning, right, and when it's allowed to mean the exact same thing as iteration, it kind of adds unnecessary confusion.

But that's off topic---people have biases. Why can't reducing be level of recursion that humans can intuitively think in by one for a magical race be hypothetically considered? No need to reduce the speed of thought.
