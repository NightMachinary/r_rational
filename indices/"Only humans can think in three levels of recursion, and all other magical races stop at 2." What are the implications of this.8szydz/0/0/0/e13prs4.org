I can do it in my short term memory without needing paper because I'm human. An elf would need paper to work through it, once they realized that there was more to the problem in the first place. And the elf /could/ work through it, it just wouldn't be intuitive. As opposed to a human Bob, whose literal first instinct would be "Either the car is blue, or Alice wants me to think the car is blue." If Alice is a known competent liar, then it might not even occur to human-Bob that Alice might be having an off day - the car is definitely not blue.

Humans can't actually get much deeper than that in practice, on an intuitive level. We tend to immediately get stuck in a loop of, "But what if that's what she wanted me to think she thought I thought she thought? Damnit, get me some paper." At some point in recursion/iteration (you're right, there is no computational difference in this context), every higher level of abstraction is indistinguishable to you. It's entirely possible for different people/races to hit that point at different levels. That fact can have interesting worldbuilding implications.

Not every elf will notice that the problem even requires further thought. Not every elf will care to give the problem more thought even if they recognize that the human is being all /human/ about it, and would prefer to just ignore all information from humans. Not every elf will have the Nobel Prize winning insight to be able to work through the bizarre twisty nature of human minds even if they wanted to. Some will. It is very unlikely that this is a hard limit. But the difference can have interesting implications for interactions between random people on the street.
