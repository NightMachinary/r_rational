Sure, but should be looking at it from an outside point of view, not from the spy's point of view. At face value, Bob is an intelligence analyst as far as his coworkers are aware. His Russian recruiter goes a level or two deeper, knowing he's a mole and wondering if he has become a double agent. His American boss goes two or three steps deep, knowing he's a double agent and wondering if his loyalties actually still lie with his home country. His Chinese handler goes three or four steps deep, knowing he's a defected double-agent, and wondering if he's had opportunities to start collecting money from other countries as well.
