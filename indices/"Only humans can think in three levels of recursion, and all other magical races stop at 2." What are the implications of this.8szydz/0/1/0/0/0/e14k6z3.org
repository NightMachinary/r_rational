Hmm. Yes, you're right, I misread this definition.

The terminology seems confusing, though. A spy visibly works for one organization, but in actuality works for another. From the perspective of the first organization, their agent/worker is betraying them to another party. Why wouldn't this agent be termed a double-agent?

... Because the definition of the term "agent" used by intelligence services is different from the definition of the term "agent" used by game theory, isn't it.
