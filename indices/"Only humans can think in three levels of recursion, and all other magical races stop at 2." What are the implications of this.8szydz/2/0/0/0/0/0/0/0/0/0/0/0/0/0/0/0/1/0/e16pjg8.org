Not in my opinion it wouldn't. It seems the only thing three levels of recursion is really useful for is lying, so that's really the only disadvantage they would have. And rational works definitely have concepts in them that break physics, such as actual magic in HPMOR. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine a race without one single ability that doesn't affect anything else. Because really, what are these certain instructions that you couldn't give an elf?
