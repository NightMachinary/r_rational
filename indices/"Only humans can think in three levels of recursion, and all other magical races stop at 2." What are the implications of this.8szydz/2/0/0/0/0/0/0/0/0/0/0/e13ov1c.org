  Fact: iteration is basically looping.

  Fact: recursion is a function that calls itself each iteration.

Iteration and recursion are both tools that can be used to implement a recursive algorithm. Therefore iteration with a simulated stack is equivalent to recursion. This is basic computational theory. This is literally what "Turing equivalence" means.

  Fact: you also claim that being unable to intuitively understand recursion at three levels is equivalent to being functionally illiterate.

The claim that I made is "being unable to understand recursion at three levels given bookkeeping tools requires being functionally illiterate". You believe that the noise-word "intuitively" changes the meaning of this sentence.
