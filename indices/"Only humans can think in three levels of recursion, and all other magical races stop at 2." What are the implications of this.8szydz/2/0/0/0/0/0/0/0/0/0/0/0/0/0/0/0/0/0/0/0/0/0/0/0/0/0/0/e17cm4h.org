Recursion and Iteration are equivalent because they are both simply different ways of specifying loops. A computational process does not become a different computational process just because you different notation.

Recursion is mostly different from iteration because it has an implicit stack however a recursive algorithm can always be represented as an iterative program with an explicit stack. Likewise any iterative algorithm can always have its sequence of repetitions represented as a stack and made into a recursive program.

If the people can't handle nested loops then they wouldn't be able to function because most actions like walking and eating are made up of actions which are made up of sub actions which are themselves made up of smaller sub actions.
