  I feel like allowing that to be called iteration is kind of muddying the words.

It's perfectly conventional computing theory. This kind of equivalence is actually kind of central to the whole structure of computing. No processor in the world implements "recursion" as a basic operation, they all put it together from iteration and bookkeeping.

The point is that this oddly specific deficit is probably computationally impossible, and violates the Strong Church-Turing Hypothesis. Which I'm pretty sure EY didn't intend. It was a throwaway line that sounds good, but it's not essential, and can be treated as a minor oops.
