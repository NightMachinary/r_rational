So, my question this week is about "point of view" in third person stories. You know, lines like this:

#+begin_quote
  “That doesn't make it okay.” Red stared at him; why did he always do that? Primp and preen himself when they were having important conversations?
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Red tried not to cringe; his master? Her Italian really was bad. Then again, his wasn't much better. “Yes. My boss needs one to put his things in.”
#+end_quote

Or even internal monologue:

  After a few months, Red had begun to adjust. The days were long but mercifully growing shorter, and were punctuated by trips into the town to abate the boredom. Especially on days like today, when William had fed on him recently, and he felt no desire to sleep. It was lonely when the sun was up. He'd made a habit of reading the paper and drinking coffee at the local cafe each morning. Even when he needed to sleep a full eight hours, he could never stay asleep past ten, regardless of how late into the morning he stayed up with William. He wondered if he would grow out of it. Perhaps, after enough time, he would be a creature of the night, though in a less literal sense than William was.

  That line of thinking drew his mind to the future. He was pretty certain he loved William... but was this all he would have? A couple of glasses of coffee, some pleasantries with some villager who couldn't begin to understand the details of his life, and then returning home to read until sunset?

My story started out as third person but told entirely from the human character's PoV, because the other character is a 1500 year old vampire and thus a bit difficult to write, since I am not a 1500 year old vampire, and while I have ideas about how they think and act (hence writing a supernatural romance story about one), I don't think I'd be able to properly cover it in writing.

I realised that there are some times when the vampire PoV is useful, but I'm worried that switching inconsistently would annoy the reader. In particular, the story is going to be 90% human PoV, but the first chapter is going to be vampire PoV. Another scene about halfway through is going to be vampire PoV too, and I will probably write one of the very last scenes in vampire PoV. Ther rest will be human PoV.

Is this "false advertising"? (In other words, would a reader have an expectation that the entire story is vampire PoV and then feel disappointed when it features very minimally?).

I'm reading a rotating PoV story at the moment and it switches PoV every chapter, and I find myself only wanting to read one of the PoVs and wishing all the other chapters were in that PoV. I think that's what's made me worried about putting vampire PoV scenes in my story.

Also, is it confusing to put PoV dialogue tags/etc for the vampire in human-PoV chapters? Specifically, in situations where the human doesn't have any way of knowing the vampire's state of mind? For example, I have a "he lied" here and there.

Here's another scene, to show how they get mixed:

#+begin_quote
  “But you can't enslave people. It's not right.” Red said, finally.

  “It is the way these things are done.” He said simply, threading the laces onto his shoes.

  “That doesn't make it okay.” Red stared at him; why did he always do that? Primp and preen himself when they were having important conversations?

  William paused. He was still not used to the subtleties of the human mind, despite being so close to one for so long. But it was clear that this was a sensitive issue for Red, even if everything seemed clear to him. “Some things are beyond your understanding, my dear.”

  “I don't have to be a thousand years old-” Red started; William seemed to flinch, “-to know that it's wrong to keep another person, to not let them have free will. We've thought wars for that!”

  “I fought a war for you.” William replied flatly, his voice firm but not overly loud. He pulled his shoes on.

  “That's not...” Red hesitated; he was grateful for everything that William had done, but this whole situation was frustrating. Worse still was the horror that was boiling up in him, that perhaps William was worse than he could have expected, that all those little things he wrote off as misunderstandings, as vampire codewords, as mistranslations, that they were real. That William actually thought that way. “That's not relevant here! And it's not...” Red sighed heavily, trying to pull himself together. “I appreciate all you've done. I do. But you are talking about slavery. You can't really be okay with that. What if... what if it was me? My free will? You would be okay with that?”
#+end_quote

Bonus question: that last paragraph, Red starts and stops speaking three times. Should I be formatting it differently?
