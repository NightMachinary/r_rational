Thanks for both you and [[/u/MagicWeasel]] for the responses!

I think that perhaps when reading I, to some extent, like reading the extended descriptions you describe, but there's also a part of me that just wants the dialogue, all the other adverbs, verbs, etc. be damned.

And I think it's that side that I'd like to cater to for my own writing, I think.

But Yudkowsky, as an example, does use a lot of the extended descriptions. And that's fine; I like it too.
