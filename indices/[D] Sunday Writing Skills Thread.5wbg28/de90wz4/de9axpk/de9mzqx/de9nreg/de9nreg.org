I think the extended descriptions are absolutely great for hard-hitting sentences like "I can't believe I ever loved you", because they're important and you want to ensure that your intention with that line is communicated to the reader, or perhaps emphasise the emotional impact.

But you could use that same line and have the intention pretty clear without any extra bells and whistles. Let's go back to my pineapple pizza example...

  "I really love how we have this silly tradition of coming to this pizza place on our wedding anniversary." Amy remarked.

  "I know. It doesn't look like much but it's still excellent. Just like me!"

  "Ha! You're not so bad!"

  "Did you want to get the usual? Vegetarian with extra pineapple?"

  "Actually, honey... I think it's time I told you. On our first date, when I told you I loved pineapple on pizza, I was lying. I think it's disgusting and I am /not/ spending our third wedding anniversary trying to choke that stuff down."

  "Really?" Tom laughed. "Eight years and you're telling me now?"

  "I wanted to impress you and then it seemed like the lie had gone on so long that it was awkward...."

  "So, you're being serious?"

  "Not only do I not like pineapple on pizza, but after the amount of pineapple pizzas I've had to eat, I don't think I like pineapple on /anything/ anymore."

  "I can't believe I ever loved you."

  "Oh shut up. We can get it with extra olives instead."

  "Actually, Amy, there's something I've been meaning to tell you..."
