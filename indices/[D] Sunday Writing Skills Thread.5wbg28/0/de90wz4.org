[Probably normal not necessarily r! fiction question]

Interested in what people think about the use of adverbs when it comes to writing character dialogue.

I've noticed Yudkowsky, for example, is happy with using lots of varied words and descriptions to get his points across.

For me, though, I've been focusing on only using said, with the focus being on actual word choice and other details to convey information.

I'm interested to know, not what people think is "better" (for some arbitrary metric), but which they /enjoy/ reading more: lots of varied verbs for speaking + adjectives or sparser verbs (mainly "saids") and little to no adjectives.
