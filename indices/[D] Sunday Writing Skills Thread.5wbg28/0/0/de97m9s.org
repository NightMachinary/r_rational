I'm loathe to say what I'd enjoy reading more because people are bad at predicting what they enjoy. My first thought is that I'd prefer just "he said" "she said" because it lets me focus on the dialogue. I mean, take this example:

#+begin_quote
  "I can't believe I ever loved you!" He said furiously.
#+end_quote

The adverb isn't really helpful, since context will help you figure out whether the speaker is furious or not. (Potential preceding lines: "I don't think minorities are people", or "I love pineapple on pizza!")

Changing the verb to "he spat" would probably be the best way, since you can't really spit dialogue anything but furiously.

At the end of the day, I think both are acceptable, unless the adverbs are constant and become distracting. During talky scenes, dialogue is meant to be front and centre and the tags are just meant to emphasise it. Especially if you overuse a particular tag.

So, do whatever you prefer to write.
