As [[/u/MagicWeasel]] (correctly) stated, people are generally not very good at predicting what they enjoy. This being the case, I'm going to give you my thoughts, not as a /reader/, but as a /writer/:

My philosophy for writing prose is to try to write the same way I talk (minus all of the disfluencies, breaks, and various other assorted grammatical errors that occur over the course of ordinary speech). This is particularly useful, I find, when writing in the first-person, since it really helps to convey the feeling that a /person/ is talking, rather than some omniscient third-person narrator (though I tend to write the same way even then, so maybe it's just a stylistic quirk). Because I'm used to explaining things to other people in real life, I tend to try to insert as much information as possible in my writing; this means, among other things, profuse usage of both adverbs and other forms of description. (Especially similes and metaphors.) As an example of this, consider the following line of dialogue (credit and apologies to [[/u/MagicWeasel]], since I'll be using your example to make nearly the exact opposite point that you used it to make):

#+begin_quote
  "I can't believe I ever loved you!" he said.
#+end_quote

The above is perfectly acceptable, but it's simply not the way I'd write; nor is it, I suspect, what would affect me the most were I reading the above line in the context of a story. Adding a single adverb, like so,

#+begin_quote
  "I can't believe I ever loved you!" he said furiously.
#+end_quote

still doesn't feel like it conveys enough information (and worse yet, what little information it /does/ convey could have been inferred from context, making it redundant). So, here are a couple of examples of what I might write instead:

#+begin_quote
  "I can't believe I ever loved you," he said, but despite the anger apparent in his words, both his expression and his tone were calm and controlled, almost as if he were simply discussing the weather.
#+end_quote

Or, alternatively:

#+begin_quote
  "I can't believe I ever loved you!" he snarled, his face twisted into an ugly rictus of rage. It was not a flattering look; indeed, it made him seem quite unhinged, like a patient who had just broken out of a psychiatric ward.
#+end_quote

Here, have another one:

#+begin_quote
  "I can't believe I ever loved you," he positively /hissed/, his eyes narrowed. In place of the affection that had graced his features mere hours earlier, now there was a coldness that seemed to spread to the rest of the room, making the very air itself feel chilly.
#+end_quote

Anyway, I think you get the point by now. Basically, while it's true that the /gist/ of a character's mood can usually be inferred from context, there is still quite a bit of additional information to be gleaned by being more descriptive. Obviously, YMMV; I'm aware, for instance, that there are people who prefer a more spartan approach--who simply want the bare facts of what happened laid out before them, with minimal decoration and/or embellishment. That's also an acceptable way of doing things, even though it's one I personally feel less at home with.

What you /definitely/ want to avoid, however, is falling into the uncanny valley: not descriptive enough to appease someone like me, but possessing just enough useless details to irritate someone like [[/u/MagicWeasel]]. Single-use adverbs without any accompanying text (such as the "he said furiously" example given above) generally fall into this region, since they don't really provide /any/ additional information that couldn't have been inferred from context, serving only to bloat the text. In other words, if you're going to provide additional information, make sure that the information you give is actually /useful/ and not redundant. And if you /do/ decide to go down that route, don't be afraid of going overboard--after all, you've already committed to being as descriptive as possible, and going only halfway is an excellent way to fall into the aforementioned uncanny valley.

Well, that was my 2 cents. Do with it what you will.
