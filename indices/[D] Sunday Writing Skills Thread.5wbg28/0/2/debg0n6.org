I'm personally rather against using adverbs, since they tend to be overused a lot and even if you go out of your way to avoid them, you'll probably still have a couple left somewhere.

Adverbs add extra information, but they do it in a boring way. It's generally more impactful if the reader infers stuff rather than having it spelled out for them ('Show, don't Tell' basically), so descriptions and metaphors are generally much better to use.

It's fine to not use said /all/ the time, but it's one of those really useful words that you can repeat a bunch without the reader noticing (like pronouns and names, a lot of newer writers - especially in fanfiction - often try to avoid reusing 'said', which makes for a not very good reading experience).

When you avoid using the staples 'said(/asked/answered)', it should be rare. That way, you keep a lot of the impact. If everyone's always shouting/whispering/screaming/sobbing/etc., then no-one is. If you feel like your dialogue has become repetitive and boring, you can also drop the dialogue tag altogether and just imply the speaker.

Compare:

#+begin_quote
  "This is the worst day of my life," he sobbed despairingly.

  "This is the worst day of my life." He closed his eyes and sank back into his chair, a cliff finally eroded into nothingness by the ceaseless pounding of the waves.
#+end_quote

The second one is kinda purple, but it's much more vivid. In general, you'll either not want to go into massive detail about a person's reactions in dialogue, and just imply it with what they say for the most part:

#+begin_quote
  "I had one beer at most!"

  "Charles told me something /very/ different, you know," Sarah said, smiling.

  "Charles needs to learn to keep his goddamn mouth shut."
#+end_quote

Change 'smiling' for 'frowning', and that's all you need to do to vary the tone. Any long metaphors and descriptions and adverbs are unnecessary.

Or you'll want to linger, painting a comprehensive picture of a person before the next line of dialogue falls into place (see the earlier example). This is for when you want to be rather more precise in describing the characters, because it's either a key moment for the reader (in terms of understanding the character) or a key moment for the character (in terms of developing).
