In addition to what others have written I think you're working under a different definition of rational than me. For me there is no clash between rational and emotions, a completely rational character would still feel a full array of emotions. Acting on your emotions can also be rational insofar that your current emotions are a calibrated reaction to reality. Rational people are bounded by lack of knowledge, lack of resources, lack of time, and lack of brain processing power, and so it's completely fine for me that they in many situation takes a decision that ends up being suboptimal.
