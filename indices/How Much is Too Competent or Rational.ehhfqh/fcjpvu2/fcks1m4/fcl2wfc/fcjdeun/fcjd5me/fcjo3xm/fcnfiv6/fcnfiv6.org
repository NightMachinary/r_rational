I don' think the problem you are presenting is tied to rationality, it's just a universal problem where you expect characters to behave consistently with human nature plus how they were presented in the story so far. In fact, one of the main goals of rational writing is just that.

Too much competency is a different problem and of course it can be a bad thing (Mary Sue) but it doesn't mean it can't work (One punch man). Again, this is just about good writing.

But one trap that was already mentioned in another comment that seems to happen in rational fiction is that characters end up analyzing situations for apparent minutes (and it takes minutes to read that analysis) while only a second has actually passed. How bad (or good) this is, is unclear. A different approach would be to do the analysis before the scene in a form of preparation, or do it afterward as a retrospection of instinctual thought processes that happened at the time. That would be more realistic I guess.
