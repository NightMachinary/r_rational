I was trying to write rational fiction in a Lovecraft/Eternal Darkness style setting, because that was recently mentioned as an interesting challenge. and actually I noticed that the thing that contributed heavily to the viewpoint character's feeling less competent was when she had less time to think. She'd encounter some weird thing, and if she had time to think about it, she generally seemed to do quite well.

But if things just kept rushing along, with her phone turning on, followed by the contact being weird, followed by detention and then a flicker in the mirror, followed by seeing a picture of a tentacle monster, followed by being yelled at by an unidentifiable security guard, who shoved her into a library that inexplicably locked behind her after the guard left, she felt less powerful, and more scared.

By contrast, when Harry pulled off his best moves in HPMOR, he had an entire group of people doing his thinking at enhanced speed.

Or during a fight in Optimized Wish Project, during a fight against a high level opponent, Goku was explicitly called out on spending too much time thinking about a smart move mid fight, allowing the opponent to steal initiative, whereas against slower opponents, Goku could practically play the fight in his head, spotting and moving to blind spots and having prepped counter moves.

So after considering that, I suppose a character might come off as too competent/rational if circumstances seem to be such that they're never out thought, never rushed, and no one ever tries to blow up their computer servers or steal their intelligence artifact?
