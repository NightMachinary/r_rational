Personally, rational fiction isn't about characters who are calculators and always preform the logically correct action with emotionless, mechanical, ease. *Rational fiction is about authors/storytellers not using character stupidity as a crutch for bad storytelling.*

Too often in fiction, characters make stupid/irrational decisions, not because /that's what the character would actually do/ but rather because the author needs them to do so in order to advance their plot. This is what rational fiction is about--and IMO where the genre came from. Readers and writers were frustrated with fictional characters who make stupid decisions for plot reasons, not for character reasons. This is especially prevalent when characters are introduced in highly skilled professions (doctors, scientists, marines, experts) but then make elementary mistakes or overlook the blindingly obvious. Having a stupid character in a rational fiction is perfectly fine, as making bad decisions would be part of their character.
