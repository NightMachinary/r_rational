  As long as the main story arc cannot be easily resolved from the beginning by either character, you should be able to flesh out an outline for your story and then revise the details while you continue to learn relevant information and writing techniques.

That doesn't sound right to me. Why does the story not being resolvable /from the beginning/, imply that the story doesn't have the possibility of being resolved after the first or second chapter instead, thus meaning that working up any part of the story after /that/ chapter will have been a waste?

That's more what I'm worried about. I'm not worried that I'll write some characters that, if they were smarter, wouldn't even fight. Instead, I'm worried that I might write a plot that, three chapters in, introduces (and heavily depends upon!) a magic-system with an inherent "game-breaking flaw" that I don't notice at the time. I'd put in all the effort to write the whole rest of the story, leaning on that flawed magic system. And then, half-way through polishing, I'd notice the flaw, determine that there's no way that my protagonist /wouldn't/ spot the flaw, and then ...give up, I guess, since the story would now end right there in chapter three.
