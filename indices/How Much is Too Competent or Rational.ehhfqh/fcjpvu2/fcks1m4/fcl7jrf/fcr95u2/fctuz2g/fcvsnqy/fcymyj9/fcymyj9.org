  And then, half-way through polishing, I'd notice the flaw, determine that there's no way that my protagonist wouldn't spot the flaw, and then ...give up, I guess, since the story would now end right there in chapter three.

Find a way to edit the flaw out or obscure it with imperfect information or make it too costly to use, then revise the rest of the story to be in line with your edit. There's always a way to do it, you just have to see it. Often the best part of the story arises from the burst of inspiration and complexity that comes when you find the path forward, the clever and natural seeming fix.

And there's always going to be something you miss, something that slips by.
