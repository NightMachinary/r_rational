Except that if you really want your characters to be /smart/ - not even rationalists (necessarily), just people who try to make decisions that either get them what they want or put them on a path to getting what they want, and avoid making decisions that don't do that, doing what's best for the narrative doesn't make sense. Remember, the characters don't /want/ the narrative to occur. The good guys don't want to go through hardship and win by rolling the dice on impossible odds. The villains don't want to beat the heroes at every turn, then lose because of something they never saw coming. Both sides want to /win/ - and moreover, they want to win /as quickly as possible/.

â€‹

Doing what is best for the /narrative/ is having the Rebellion try an impossible assault against the Death Star in snub fighters and win. Letting the /characters be smart/ (even the villains!) would be having the Death Star jump in, allowing the snub fighters to approach, then jumping in a few Star Destroyers to glass the surface of Yavin IV.
