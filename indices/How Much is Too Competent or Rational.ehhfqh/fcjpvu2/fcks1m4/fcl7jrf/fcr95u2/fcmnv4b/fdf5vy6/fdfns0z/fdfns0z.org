That results in boring stories. No one wants to read a story where both sides either curbstomp each other or do nothing.

I don't want to write stories like that - there ought to be a way for characters to be smart while also avoiding both boring one-sidedness and boring lack of anything occurring.

Look, no one wants stories to be reality. That's why they're stories - to warn us against things we /shouldn't/ be doing.
