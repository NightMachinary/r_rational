Ok, it looks like we basically agree.

Your way of thinking about it just isn't very good to me though. I feel like you don't often post on r/r?

Let's see. We do have smart ~ characters on path to getting what they want, and the author doesn't want them to get it easily.

I suppose this suggests a way of writing characters smarter than yourself - do research, or write as a team.

The problem, and I'm going to say it is a problem, with your view is that it treats stories as optimisation problems with definite answers.

That just isn't the case for stories.

We /want/ a lot of variation in stories, because variance is how you learn.

So if you want to write a story that's "like an optimisation problem" (and the consequence of your view is that you do want that) then you /are/ writing rational fiction, possibly rationalist, whether you want to call it that or not.
