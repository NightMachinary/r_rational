I was going to say: No, just strengthen the challenge to match the stronger character.

Then I read a wise comment, and afterwards was going to say: Depict their cognitive power level consistently. There's no punch too strong for a superhero, but the author should know how many Newtons they can exert.

Then I read another comment, and remembered Vinge's Law. If characters are getting "bogged down in thought" or seem "too logical" (lol) in an inorganic way, it means you're overrunning by too far the level of good reasoning that you can fluidly use yourself and explain to others. So that's how much intelligence is too much.
