With Zorian I think it kinda makes sense because he's been in a time loop so long, he's grown desensitised to all of it, including the death and violence. In fact it was an explicit worry of his, that he might be /too/ desensitised once he leaves it. That said, yes, MoL certainly isn't big on the "exploring emotional states" side, it focuses more on just expanding the world building, the magic system, and munchkining the two. I think it's fine and can be fun if that's what you want to write too.

In general, sure, characters can and should act irrationally or make bad decisions from time to time. That actually also gives you some wiggle room in writing the story: there may be times when such a bad decision is better for you to keep the story interesting, and at the same time plausible for the character the way they've been defined. The key thing is, if a character's trait is that for example they're too proud, they could make a mistake out of excessive pride, but a mistake out of excessive humility would seem straight up forced. And if they make too many mistakes, realistic or not, they'll just grow unlikable, and like they simply deserve whatever shit outcome they get.
