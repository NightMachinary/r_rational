I suppose the short answer is "when it would negatively affect the plot." Rational characters are supposed to intelligently use their resources to accomplish their goals. Stories are about struggle, conflict, suffering, things that rational characters want to avoid. Sure, you don't want a story that involves a bunch of conflict that was easily avoidable, something that anyone could or should have thought to prepare against, but you also want your story to be more than a page of "so yeah he thought of this ahead of time and none of it was a challenge and happily ever after. The end."

As seen in the recent chapters of Worth the Candle, sometimes the thought process of being rational would interfere with the pacing of the story, or there would be far too much thought happening in a far too short amount of time. At this point in the story, Juniper has a lot of options to do lots of things, and a lot of time and resources to prepare a lot of different things. But, as the author pointed out, when faced with some challenge that the author already decided will work for whatever reason, it would be super boring and kill the pacing for Juniper to go through a huge list of the things he might be able to do and giving reasons why that probably wouldn't work just to satisfy the commenters that he did the "optimal" thing. When time is short, you can't have someone giving paragraphs of thought in 4 seconds, because people just don't think that fast.

If you try too hard to show that your character is doing things rationally, it can come across as masterbatory. Just a bunch of long winded "look at all the clever things that I can come up with" that is maybe occasionally enjoyable for other people to read but isn't generally considered good writing.

There's of course the very common case where you don't want you character to be particularly rational, for lots of sensible reasons. Being extremely emotional is usually a detriment to using your intelligence to solve problems, but if you go too far the character comes off as an emotionless robot. Sometimes people do get seriously emotionally affected by circumstances, combat being a good example. Sometimes people have strong aversions to things that the reader knows would actually help them, or conversely not having strong aversions seems odd, as in the case of Zorian dying very casually. Sometimes you just don't want your character to be a paragon of rationality in the first place. Most of the time really.

So basically, yes, there's lots of reasons to make character less than perfectly rational. This subreddit focuses on stories that showcase certain themes and tropes that we enjoy, but it shouldn't do so at the cost of writing a good story.
