Funny you use /Mother of Learning/ as an example, because that is one of the few examples I go to for a perfectly done (by m standards) rational character.

Conceptually, yes, anything can be overdone. In practice...that's not really the major where rationalist writers go wrong. A much more common problem is inconsistency. Authors who lovingly Munchkin things in one part and then have the hero behave in a ridiculously moronic way elsewhere. The Munchkining Murder Hobo for instance. Or Lyra in the Golden Compass TV series...who is waaaay too smart for a child in places and an idiot elsewhere.

Actually, making kids too smart is a common problem that is close to what you describe. Also blunting the impact of your drama by having characters not angsty enough...I find that is a problem in Portal Fantasy. Really, characters should be a nervous wreck after inexplicably being sent to another world.

Personally, I like characters who have a quiet internal breakdown and then when push comes to shove make reasonable decisions.
