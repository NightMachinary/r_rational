IMO, the sweet spot to aim for when you want to show off rationality (as opposed to when you want to show your character not yet knowing how to be rational in a given context) is "the character is as rational, /before/ learning the lesson the hard way, as you would be immediately /after/ learning the lesson the hard way."

Otherwise, they should remain entirely human, including in their emotional reactions, hotheadedness, inability to cope, etc. etc. They're "too rational" if they're e.g. 25 years old, and react to a situation as coolly as a 55-year-old battle hardened grandmother who's seen it all before would.

But if they, like, see the problem a split second /before/ it's too late, instead of a split second /after,/ like a normal person, this is exciting and inspiring and gives people something like a roadmap to learn from.
