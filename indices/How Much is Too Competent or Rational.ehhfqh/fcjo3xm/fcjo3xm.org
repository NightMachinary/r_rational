I think the answer always depends on the character. I believe that a not-too-smart character can still be considered rational if their behaviour is portrayed consistently, and conversely a "smart" a character can and should have blind spots in their reasoning from time to time, be they caused by a personal failure or things like time pressure or stress.

Whichever way the author chooses to take the character is up to them, but once a character trait is established, it can't change on a whim to suit the story.

On the other hand, all rules are made to be broken, so if the author can get away with some handwavy stuff to make a better story, it might be the rational choice.
