I want to note that I feel like altering the strength of the character or the difficulty of the challenge to suit the needs of storytelling feels backwards to me, as a rational author.

Like, it feels like a violation of the genre to tinker with the settings mid-stream just because it makes the story flow better.

From my perspective, the right way to write in this genre is to lock in your settings, and then see what naturally emerges, with the tinkering being mostly /choosing from among possible options/ the one that makes for the best story.

It may be that you were talking more about "which things do we show, and which do we skip over?" But I wanted to note the objection to *a* claim, even if it's not the claim *you* were making.
