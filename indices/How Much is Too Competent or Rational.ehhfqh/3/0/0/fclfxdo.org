I'm not sure which line in particular you're referring to. If you're talking about choosing a story somewhere between easily avoidable conflict and easily solved conflict, yes you would ideally set the story up so that you don't have to change the characters or the setting half way through. Hopefully you have enough wiggle room for both so that you can tell a compelling story even if you slightly misjudged one aspect of your story at the beginning.

If you're responding to "a challenge that the author has already decided will work for whatever reason", I include "the antagonists have resources and information that the protagonist doesn't know about and has no current way to completely counter" as one of those reasons. It doesn't need to be railroading, where the author decided the plot beats ahead of time and is altering the characters and setting to create those, it could be for anything.
