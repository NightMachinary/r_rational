Re: Vinge's Law:

Is there such a thing as a rational story you can't tell /yet/ (for lack of your own reasoning abilities), but where you /can/ “put away” the story (by e.g. writing down a plot outline), and then come back to it to successfully write it years later?

I know this works for non-rational fiction writing, where the block is either that you haven't built your Creative Writing abilities enough; or that you're trying to write in someone else's setting, and you don't understand said setting well-enough yet.

But does it work for rational-fic?

It seems to me that in ratfic, the story beats you can follow are necessarily constrained by what intelligent characters should be doing (or rather, by what errors they would avoid making.) You can't have a beat in a ratfic that requires someone to be holding an idiot ball. And seemingly, in ratfic, these idiot balls are still idiot balls /even if you don't recognize them as such at the time/.

So, is there any point to trying to outline a ratfic you don't think you can write yet? Or will the outline inevitably be trash when you come back to it with enough understanding to write it?
