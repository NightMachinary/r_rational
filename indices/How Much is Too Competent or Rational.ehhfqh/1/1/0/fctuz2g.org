As Yudkowski notes in his [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/thoughtful-responses][Thoughtful Responses]] post, rational characters don't want the drama and conflict that your plot would entail. The hero and the villain both want to use whatever resources they have to end the conflict before it even starts, or at least well before the end of chapter 1 if possible. They're good at solving problems, and your entire plot /is/ a problem, so your challenge as a rationalist author is basically to come up with circumstances and logical reasons for why the conflict can't be quickly or easily solved while keeping both characters consistently acting with a reasonable degree of intelligence and forethought.

As long as the main story arc cannot be easily resolved from the beginning by either character, you should be able to flesh out an outline for your story and then revise the details while you continue to learn relevant information and writing techniques. It's likely that you'll need to change some of your details, but that shouldn't derail the story as long as you have a solid understanding of why your antagonist/protagonist have no good choices other than conflict, and (at least initially) no quick way to resolve that conflict.
