My point is that it's the author's job to craft the setting and events of the story such that smart people would make decisions that result in a compelling narrative. One side curb-stomping the other does not make for compelling reading, but neither does one side making stupid decisions and the other side winning because of that.

I don't want to read a story about the good guys winning because the bad guys are stupid, incompetent, or both. I don't even necessarily want to read a story about good guys and bad guys. The best books - the most compelling stories - are about smart people making good decisions in the service of what they believe to be right coming into conflict with /other smart people making good decisions in the service of what/ they /believe to be right/, with both sides being morally justifiable to the audience.

But even if you have clear good versus clear bad, no one, including the villain, should /make bad decisions/. Sub-optimal decisions? Good decisions based on incomplete or faulty information? These are reasonable mistakes and ones which can make stories much more interesting. But I cannot stand when characters make /stupid/ decisions.

This is part of why I love Timothy Zahn's original Thrawn trilogy (/Heir to the Empire/, /Dark Force Rising/, and /The Last Command/) so much. Until his final defeat, the only times the bad guy (who demonstrates that he is a /very/ smart man) loses are not because he does stupid things. Most of the time, in fact, he makes /better decisions than the good guys/, and thus wins! But when he does lose, it is almost always a fluke; it is due to something that he could not know and could not reasonably have surmised. /This is what makes the story compelling/. The villain is /smart/; in many cases, /smarter/ than the good guys! He is not handed the Idiot Ball for the sake of advancing the plot.
