Any time you're distinguishing "rationality" from "the right thought to think", it means you haven't grasped that form of rationality.

Design a problem that would fool /you/ even if you were trying to think the right thoughts, if you knew only what the character knew. [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/thoughtful-responses]]
