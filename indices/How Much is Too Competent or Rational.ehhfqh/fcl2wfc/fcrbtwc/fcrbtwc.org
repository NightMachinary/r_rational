Fair. I would say that a lot of people here are trying to write things that are both rational fiction and “competence porn”, though: things where the /setting/ and /antagonists/ are rational, but where the /protagonist/ always makes optimal choices, not because that's realistic, but because that's a kind of power fantasy (and also, kind of soothing for people who are socially anxious: “competence porn” stories are a guarantee that the story will contain 0% secondhand-embarrassment.)
