  Except that if you really want your characters to be smart - not even rationalists (necessarily), just people who try to make decisions that either get them what they want or put them on a path to getting what they want, and avoid making decisions that don't do that

That's really my definition of 'smart', though I suppose that I should add that smart characters generally know what they want as well. Characters need not be rationalists to be smart. Tywin Lannister was smart (/mostly/ - he did have a couple of blind spots, largely regarding his children). Cersei Lannister was not.
