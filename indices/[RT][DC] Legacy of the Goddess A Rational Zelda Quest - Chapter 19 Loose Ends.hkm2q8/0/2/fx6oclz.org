I'm super late to discussion, but I'm not sure about the math for marking a fighter if we're eventually going to have a marked that stays in castletown (Which I STRONGLY support. I also think it should be Taetus for several reasons*). I'm not super against marking sheikah, I just have some doubts.

Also, as Cariyaga's been saying, I hope Ibosso can be approached and resolved without fighting.

Other than that (heh) I approve of this plan.

*Not getting into them since we're not marking him this update.
