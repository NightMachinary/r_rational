  Ask Naibi more about Ibosso, and if there are any Gerduo traditions indicating what might be necessary to free him from his cursed state. Basically, anything that might offer clues to resolve Ibosso's situation that can be conveyed to Link.

Might want to rephrase that to 'ask old grandma/grandpa Gerudo for traditions about Ibosso. Naibi already said all she knew. Totally stealing this btw.
