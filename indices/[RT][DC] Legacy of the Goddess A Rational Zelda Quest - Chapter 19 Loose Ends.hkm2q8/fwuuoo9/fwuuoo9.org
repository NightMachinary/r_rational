[Plan: Who You Gonna Call?]

Elements of this plan are borrowed shamelessly from [[/u/Mathematicae]], but I'm focusing on prioritizing prep for the ghosts.

Link Actions:

- Study the training manuals, prioritizing sections on ghosts, spiritual entities, and anything in regards to Lightsworn powers.
- If there's anything in regard to Lighsworn powers that Link could potentially practice that he hasn't already been practicing, practice it if currently makes sense to do so.
- While en-route work with Fi to refine use of the Circular Stone Disk aoe detection, using the Transfabrulator as an example of something to detect. Also complete her own version of the same aoe effect, using at most 1000 VP to complete both items. Since Ibosso is such an old legend, there might be some more artifacts to find.
- Mark Koja. The intent here is to get a third marked before we engage in potential combat with ghosts, which may generate increased VP for heroism, as well as have significant dangers that may require powerful healing (or energy blasts, if normal weapons don't work on ghosts). Explain that we intend to mark all three sheikah with us eventually, but that we are prioritizing marking the healer first so she can make use of Fi's mana transfer immediately in emergencies.

Link Tests:

Ignore these if they are already presumed to be covered by the training he did in the previous update.

- Test if you can make yourself float or fly.
- Test to see if you have stronger wind blast capabilities.
- Test if you can imbue a weapon with wind.

Zelda Actions:

- Ask gerudo tribe members that Naibi recommends more about Ibosso, and if there are any Gerduo traditions indicating what might be necessary to free him from his cursed state. Basically, anything that might offer clues to resolve Ibosso's situation that can be conveyed to Link.
- Get orders to whoever is appropriate to capture a few blin so Fi can study their language.
- Resume the regular meetings with the Council. Inform them that thanks to the blessings she received from Hylia, Link was initiated into the Lightsworn. Spreading this news would hopefully improve the country's morale (and it's going to spread anyway since everyone in her traveling party knows it happened). How should she best announce it?

This is deliberately brief (especially on Zelda's side) with the intent of trying to make it easier for the QMs to write. Hopefully this will be an easy update, then we can focus the next one on ghost fighting for Link and research for Zelda.
