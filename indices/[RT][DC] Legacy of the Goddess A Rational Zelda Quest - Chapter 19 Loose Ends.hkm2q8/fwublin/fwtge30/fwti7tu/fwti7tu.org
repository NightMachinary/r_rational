Zelda is 1 day away from Castletown and Link & co. are 2 days away from the location indicated by a Gerudo navigator in the caravan who was familiar with the area.

*What do you do next?*

- Ibosso the Damned? I ain't afraid of no ghost!

- Keep ignoring Ja'bu and maybe he'll go away?

- [X] No seriously, do /all/ the research

- Zelda's only a day away from Castletown and she isn't seeing any flames yet. It's probably fine. Stop to take a bath in Lake Hylia and admire the scenery.

- BLIN DEATH CULT

- Wait, wasn't there a fragment in the Lost Woods or something?

- Other (write-in)
