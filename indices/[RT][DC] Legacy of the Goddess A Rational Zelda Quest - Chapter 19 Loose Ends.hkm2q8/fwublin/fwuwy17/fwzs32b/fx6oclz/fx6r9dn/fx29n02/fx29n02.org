It looks like your plan is going to win at this point, but I'm going to make one quick request: Can we mark one of the sheikah near Link? I'd like to accrue the VP we would earn from any heroism they'd do in our upcoming ghost busting, and I think it's wise to start earning VP more quickly in general.

We have a lot of VP right now, and I think investing some in a third mark is a wise expenditure. The earlier we do it, the better, and we're just about to get a chance for a possible spike in earnings. A Mark could help improve our chances of surviving if there are significant combat threats, too.

(I'd also advise we work toward marking all three of them eventually, as noted in my own post.)
