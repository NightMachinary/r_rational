As written, the section :

#+begin_quote
  If she travels outside of Castletown again for diplomacy or research, having a third marked that stays in the country would be very useful as the Zora crisis proved. Wymar, or shudder Taetus might be suitable choices. On the bright side, it would give her an excuse to grill Taetus on his motivations before agreeing to marking him.

reads a bit unclear to me insofar as "What is the intended action for Zelda to actually take as a result of this bullet." but others' mileage may vary. It could mean a variety of things to me, including "Ruminate about possible candidates for the next Marked (insert more guided and directed thoughts thoughts thoughts). Definitely (!!!)don't do anything yet.", "Ruminate about possible candidates, (But Do Something as a result if Zelda decides.)" and also possibly (though I am picking up signaled intent for this interpretation much less strongly than the other two) "Think about some stuff, then Go Mark Taetus."

In general: You all may want to avoid (potential) vagaries like that if the meaning isn't overwhelmingly clear from context, at least when it comes to important items on your checklist. It could help to highlight which actions specifically you'd like taken, or prefacing thought prompts and scaffolding for characters with "Zelda thinks about Thing:", "Zelda negotiates with Dumbbutt:: Appeal to common interests and highlight advantages with cold utilitarian logic.", and "Link kills seemingly invincible StayPuft Monster: (Insert how he does that in a clever cool way)" or something or the sort.

Ignore any and all of that if its just something where what action you'd like the characters to take is clear ("Go read the books!") and/or you want to leave specifics up to the character ("Link: Go kill stuff!") or its something where the specifics are something you don't really care about one way or another ("Zelda does relaxing stuff for 24 hours.") vs. 1000 variations on how specifically Zelda must optimally relax in the bestest way possible,

Just pointing this out in advance, since illusion of transparency is very much a thing from time to time within the general topic of "quests and action plans for them." I /don't/ feel like this has been a super large issue so far in any way, but I'd like to point it out just to get ahead of any potential future ones so that we don't end up in some awkward scenario as a result of a misunderstanding.
