I'm calling it now, the fact that the artifact acts the same way (emitting one tone for each power) whether it is taking powers or giving them will be a major plot point in the next few chapters. I predict somehow Welexi is tricked into thinking the artifact has someone's powers in it (maybe he hears the tones, and then sees someone acting weak), and puts his hand in to get them, only to have his own abilities stripped.
