One of my favorite parts of this work (and I've seen this in other works by alexanderwales) is characters without the benefit of our scientific and philosophical traditions figuring out the basics for themselves. Understanding incentives or behavior that follows from rules, or trying to do things like figure out the risk of someone with superpowers destroying the world given the random odds of psycopathy.
