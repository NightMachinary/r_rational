Milo calls the DM the Dimensional Maestro in Ch 53.

Tangentially, recently, the new munchkin slips out of character a few times.

Milo mentions that the very rules of the universe will be changed as the result of the tower shield exploit.

I'm going to go with a slightly lenient DM who allows /some/ exploits if they're in the RAW, but patches them up with house rules after the first time.
