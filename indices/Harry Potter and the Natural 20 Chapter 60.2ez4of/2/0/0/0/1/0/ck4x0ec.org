It's a matter of the players and the DM respecting each other. There are big sections in the books that talk about the social contract between everyone in the game. If you've got the wrong sort of player who doesn't respect the assumptions at the table, then you definitely have a problem, but those players are easy to weed out, or at least talk to.

Asking why D&D doesn't just end in insanity is like asking why improv doesn't end with one person as the king of the world - that's not really what it's about.
