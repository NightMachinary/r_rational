D&D is only theoretically broken, because in reality you have a DM that will (hopefully) note the differences between "Rules as Written" and "Rules as Intended". The DM is a built-in release valve for all those corner cases and wording ambiguities that result from giving the player characters a simulationist experience without actually providing the rules for simulating everything ever.
