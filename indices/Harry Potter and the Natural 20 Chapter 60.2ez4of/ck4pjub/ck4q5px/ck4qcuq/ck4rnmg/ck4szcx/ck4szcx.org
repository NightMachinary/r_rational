seriously how does any time people play this game not turn into a munchkin-fest /instantly?/ Being a DM sounds like a desperate holding action, sticking your finger into the hole in the dike while a raging tsunami with hundred-foot waves is coming toward you /because a bunch of commoners got together and started handing each other cups of water/.
