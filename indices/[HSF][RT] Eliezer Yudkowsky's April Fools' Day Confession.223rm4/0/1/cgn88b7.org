It's not very expensive to dig tunnels, particularly using cut-and-cover, when there are no pipes, cables or other infrastructure to consider. That's how all that junk got there in the first place - it was relatively cheap to put stuff underground until they made it into an obstacle course. Hence the 'test city' concept.
