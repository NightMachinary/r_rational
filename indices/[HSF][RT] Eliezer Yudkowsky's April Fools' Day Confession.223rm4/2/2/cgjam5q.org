That's exactly it. There was something bothering me about this story, but I couldn't put my finger on it and you crystallized my thoughts! As a slightly introvert person who sometimes gets anxiety attacks while in the midst of people, the feeling of not being able to "escape" anywhere is really distressing. But if growing up in a city really does make you value closeness (true?) then wouldn't that solve the problem?
