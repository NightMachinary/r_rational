There's the important point that digging tunnels is /hellishly expensive/; even for short roads or cabling (fiber-optic internet basically only exists where they didn't have to dig it in new places, either aboveground or in old conduits). A single large tunnel in a city might cost a few billion dollars; calling it a few million per person would be /very generous/ for this kind of scenario and still impractical - yes it's physically possible, but there's no way it's a value proposition. Similar problems apply to the overhead cables - it'd be cheaper to use big helicopters I think, and still very expensive. Modular skyscrapers sacrifice a large proportion of their volume in unusable structure if you want swappable units.

Not using public transport is a bizarre American blind spot, caused by the sprawling cities. Everywhere else in the world, where cities are more compact (as seems to be proposed) uses mass public transport in urban centers.
