A year later at your yearly scheduled mammogram, you discover you now suddenly have stage 4 breast cancer.

You realize after some experimentation that whenever you levitate anything, you also cause the levitated object to emit radiation. The longer it's levitated, the faster it's moved and the larger it is, the greater the radioactive energies generated.

And you had spent almost the entire year showing off your telekinetic powers to audience after audience...

All of which are doomed.
