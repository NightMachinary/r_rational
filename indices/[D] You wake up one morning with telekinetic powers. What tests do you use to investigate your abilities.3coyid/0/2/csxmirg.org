Darn it that's way longer than my answer. Better, too. I would just recommend that you take a video of your abilities before you call your doctor. That way if the telekinesis stops working you something to fall back on instead of looking like an idiot. Also there's a few more things you could test

- how small the telekinetic field can be (can you manipulate a cell when looking through a microscope?)

- whether you have to know about or see an object to lift it

- whether field has any identifiable properties (light outside visible spectrum, electric field, radiation, etc.)
