I agree with quick, safe checks. Maybe make a Youtube video and send it to a family member. Something totally safe. Maybe levitate something in front of your roommate, who has to deal with your shit anyway. Just don't say anything. Walk into the room, levitate, wait.

The only problem is, you need to have pre-arranged decisions for what to do when they look at you blankly, or claim not to see anything. That's where mentally ill people fail, because their rationality itself is damaged, so they keep themselves attached through painful logical contortions to ideas that have no actual basis in reality.

Starting out with detailed personal analysis of /highly/ unusual personal phenomena is what I'm saying is a horrible idea.
