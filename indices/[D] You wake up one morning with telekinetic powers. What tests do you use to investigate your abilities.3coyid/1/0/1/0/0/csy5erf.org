Unless you are bitten by a unique epistemological artifact, you've gotta think you aren't alone in what's happening. I'd be afraid of supernatural daisycutters even before my personal testing began because of that. In fact, that's the only reason I'd hesitate to get professional mental help as a first step.

The Sunnydale Effect seems more likely to me than being a unique snowflake, to the point where I think it beats out Occam's Razor as, without it, things don't add up. Where are all the other people with telekinesis throughout history? Or just in modern times?

That would only require a shared psychological effect in humans, something akin to the glitched concept processing of people with dementia or other organic damage, as a secondary effect to a reality-bending power.

It's a stretch, sure, but whenever you appear to be in a unique situation, assuming that's in fact true is not the best course of action. This one is easy enough to test, and is an obvious enough possibility that I decided to mention it. The idea is a classic in fairytales and the supernatural, after all.
