Does the power work on objects out of my line of sight?

- Do I have to know about an object in order to lift it?

What level of control do I have over the telekinetic field?

- Is it even a field? Is it just focusing on specific objects or can I apply the affect to an area?
- How many objects can I lift at a time?\\
- If it is a field, how large can I make it? Can it be different shapes?
- How small of an object can I manipulate?

How powerful is my telekinesis?

- Do I get tired?
- Is power linked to anything? practice, time of day, concentration, emotion, etc...

Does the field have any identifiable properties?

- Test for radiation, electricity, light outside visible spectrum
