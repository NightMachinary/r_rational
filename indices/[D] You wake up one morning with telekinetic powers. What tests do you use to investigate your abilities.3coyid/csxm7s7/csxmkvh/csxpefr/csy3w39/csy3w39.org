  And if that video recording appears to have evidence of what you thought was happening, maybe you do have weird powers that warp minds that see it happening live.

Uhhhhhh... isn't that actually /even more/ implausible than telekinesis? Human minds may be error-prone, but they're also much more complicated than Newtonian dynamics. A superpower that "works at the level of" exerting fairly plain blunt forces is much more likely to be real than one that has the highly specific, customized, fine-detail-affecting effect of warping minds to produce customized delusions /at a distance/.
