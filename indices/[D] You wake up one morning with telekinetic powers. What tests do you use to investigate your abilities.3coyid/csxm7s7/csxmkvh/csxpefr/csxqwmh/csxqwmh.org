A mental health professional would be your best option, if you are okay with him/her knowing. You do bring up a good point about the dangers of walking around deluded in public, but you could just check with a trusted friend / family member in private. It would be very simple: float an pencil. If they go ''holy shit! You're floating a pencil!' and you can start having a rational conversation about it, then it's likely that you're sane. (though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to go to a mental health professional anyways, just to be sure)

That being said, if you have a family history of mental health problems, or feel irrational / paranoid, then I would agree with you 100%
