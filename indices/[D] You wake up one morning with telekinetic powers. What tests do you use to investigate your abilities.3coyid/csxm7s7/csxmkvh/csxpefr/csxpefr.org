If you are having a psychotic break, that is really irresponsible. Ignoring the wilful endangerment of yourself and the public, the problem here is any /positive/ result sounds exactly like being crazy, as well as any rationalization for negative results.

No one can see what you see? Maybe Muggles rationalize your powers away.

You hit them with a floating object and they run away screaming? Maybe you /threw it at them like a crazy person./

They do see it, and run away screaming? Maybe it wasn't the powers.

They do see it, and get excited and want to hang out testing it? Maybe they think you're crazy and are going to steal your wallet, or they're just humoring you until the police arrive.

You can't win if you're working on this with disinterested strangers. The human brain can do horrible things to justify errors in perception and even high-level belief.

Paranoid disorders go along very well with this and you might not be in a position to judge your own environment, so wandering around poking strangers is not a smart idea. You need someone who not only is familiar with what is /almost certainly/ happening to you, but is able to deal with the consequences.

Remember, we're not looking for confirmation of our /almost certain/ delusions, we're looking for someone to examine the evidence of them calmly and professionally. If you don't tell the psychiatrist what you /think/ is happening before showing off your "powers", and they then jump up, knocking their chair over and go, "holyshit, you're floating that thing with your mind!" and the rest of the visit is /them/ trying to come up with ad hoc tests, you're probably in really good shape. And if they don't see it, you calmly listen to their advice and get your prescription filled.

Then you write down everything you think you know, including some physical tests for your abilities (like recording a ringing bell from inside a tupperware container across the room.) Then you take your pills and wait before reviewing your notes again. Then you run your tests.

And if that video recording /appears/ to have evidence of what you thought was happening, maybe you do have weird powers that warp minds that see it happening live. So time to hop on TOR and post that shit to a brand new youtube account. Watch the comments. I know of few mental health issues that leave people coherent enough to operate complex computer software and lie to themselves about rigging up a complicated special effect for a video without realizing it.

But the moment you start making excuses for your abilities, like they don't work when a disbeliever is nearby, or they only work with suspicious amounts of environmental requirements or preparation, that's the time to give up. The moment you start claiming things like "science can't study magic" you're lost.

Basically, don't act like a paranoid internet toughguy. Instead, get help when it looks like everything you know about physics, causality, and reality in general shifts violently, like an actually intelligent person. Because shit like this doesn't happen in reality, and that's where you're living.

In real life, mental health professionals don't lock people up by default when they are calm, communicative, and no apparent danger to themselves or others. Risks are minimal with talking to a professional about your perceptions and experiences. Risks wandering around in public with some heavy delusions are astronomical.
