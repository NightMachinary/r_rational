How do I realize that I have telekinetic powers?

1. Do things start flying around spontaneously?
2. Is the knowledge magically in my head?
3. Is there some form of external notification? (eg, a note)

My next actions depend on the answer to the above:

1. If 1, concentrate on making it stop. Do I need to be calm? Do I need to consciously focus on each moving object and release some sort of mental grip? Do I just say "telekinetic powers, deactivate!"?
2. If 3 (it's a note or such) check that the apartment was empty, look for other evidence that someone was here.
3. If 2, holy crap. How do I just have this magical knowledge? Am I dreaming? Did someone edit my brain? Is this the Matrix? Test this!

Testing for case #2 would involve trying to break reality by simple effort of will (dreaming), or trying various actions that would require a lot of effort to render graphically -- spin-toss a book so the pages flap, whirl around and watch how my hair moves in the mirror, etc. These are, of course, things I've done before, but I was never actively /looking/ for flaws.

Assuming I can't determine an answer to the above, let's move on to the actual experimenting.

If I woke up with things moving, that suggests that my powers are at a level that can be experimented with indoors. That's good. If it was either of the other cases...well, the odds of the note or internal belief being true are pretty low, so I do a quick Uri Geller test and try to bend a spoon. (I have some junky spoons I'm not fond of.) If I can bend it smoothly and then completely restore it, that suggests that "there is no spoon" and this is the Matrix. If I can only bend it like a regular object (ie it gets creased) then that's reassuring. Presumably the test succeeds.

At this point, I know I have powers but I know nothing else, so let's stop and think about failure conditions. Here's the ones I get in 5 seconds; spend 5 minutes by the clock coming up with more.

- Lose control; things keep moving after I want them to stop.
- Clumsy; crush objects accidentally, slam them into walls, launch them into orbit, etc.
- Self-damaging (brain explodes) if moving a too-heavy or otherwise inappropriate object.
- Self-damaging on every use, like the dad in Firestarter. This would suck.
- Can't control the activation -- triggers automatically whenever I'm startled / frightened / etc.

I /really/ want the always-self-damaging option to be false, because then I can actually play with my new powers. Still, it's a hell of a risk.

I do one more test to make sure the power is actually repeatable. Then I call my doctor and the Randi Institute. The plan is to get an MRI, then do Randi's test, then get another MRI. Since I'll need to use the power at least once more between MRI tests in order to judge the "self-damaging" option, I might as well make a million dollars from it. Obviously there are coordination issues here -- I need to convince my doctor to prescribe the tests and then schedule things appropriately. Explain the circumstances to Randi and say that it's possible I will fail, but I was able to do this at least twice.

For the next several weeks, resist the nigh-overpowering urge to experiment. This would be an absolutely horrible period of time.

Once I have a million dollars and the assurance that using my abilities won't automatically kill me, it's time to have some fun!

Get some camping gear, rent a car, go off into the boondocks away from breakable things like people. Time to start experimenting for real!

- How much can I move? Start with grains of sand, work up to large boulders. Move each one just a little bit and always straight up. If I accidentally lose control and fling them super-hard, the worst I'll need to do is duck for cover. Well, or hole the ISS, but that's unlikely.
- Is there a counter force applied to me, or is it reactionless?
- How fast can I move a thing, in terms of acceleration, velocity, and jerk?
- Where does the energy come from? Does using the power make me tired, or is it just magic?
- Can I compress things?
- Can I apply force to part of an object?
- Does it always do what I tell it, or does it sometimes run wild? If I'm tired, is my TK clumsy?

Startle testing: hook up a really loud alarm that will go off sometime during the night and wake me up. What happens? Note: do this one well away from my car and the rest of my gear. Also, spend 5 minutes coming up with more safety protocols.

Okay, now the scary part -- living things! Find an ant, repeat all previous tests. Work up to lizards, birds, etc. It is possible that I will accidentally harm some of these creatures: I'm okay with that. Better a sparrow accidentally during testing than a person accidentally while eating a bagel.

Try to find a way to test the effect of anger. Does it make me stronger? Less controlled? Make my powers activate without intent? I'm not sure how to safely test this.
