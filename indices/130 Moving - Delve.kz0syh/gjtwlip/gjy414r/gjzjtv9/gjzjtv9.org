Eh? I remember that Vaatrice considered doing that. [and Lavarro going ballistic at the thought of her talking to Maria]

And then "Lavarro" fake-angrily punching the barrier and being locked out by Rain (who was not thrilled about letting Lavarro in).\\
And then Vaatrice discussing with the Fel Sadaanis commander to extend a friendly invitation to Rain for doing soul-stuff.\\
[which I'm not sure was seen actually being extended?]

Did I miss a scene where the mother/daughter reunion actually happened?\\
Might not have been convenient to stick around Fel Sadaanis as the most wanted criminal and all that.
