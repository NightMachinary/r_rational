I actually liked this one. Not much plot development, but a little bit. Setting up conflicts with the mayor and the crimson swords, longer term plans of farming the crack, Ameliah actually acknowledging that they need a room together. And biggest of all, our first actual lead in like a hundred chapters on potential higher than level 20 monsters.
