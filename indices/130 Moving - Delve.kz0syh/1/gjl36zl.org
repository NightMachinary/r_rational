It occurs to me that Rain's purity aura casts light. Do you suppose that there might be some way to enchant a crystal or something with a low level purity spell as a way to make light? Might run into the same issue as everburning torches in the long term, but at least it would draw on different resources - purity cysts instead of fire, maybe.
