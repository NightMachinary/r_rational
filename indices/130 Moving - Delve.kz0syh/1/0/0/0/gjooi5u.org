It seems logical that purify has a higher runtime cost than a light spell, since purify only generates light while running and performs additional functions. Purify also seems to need a user to imbue it with subjective meaning in order to operate, so that can be chalked up to additional operating costs.

So you'd get 'light + purify', at a higher cost than just 'light'. Except once a space is clean, purify still consumes mana / resources but does not provide any additional benefit over a generic light source; other than the fact that it would also remove any new waste introduced to the space.

Toilet-light is a poor use-case, if you have access to purify, you would no longer build or need bathrooms.

Purify as a lightbulb would probably be useful while performing dirty jobs like mining. Running purify in checkpoints or high traffic areas might be worthwhile too.
