No, I don't. I have worked with procgen in the past (tho it was to make caves), but the first several iterations will no doubt have handmade maps for a while. The bigger focus at the moment is to get the mod system design finalized, which will also be heavily involved at world gen (so whatever world you have will be tied to the mods that were enabled when it was generated). Once I have screenshots, I will be sure to put them here in the weekly updates.
