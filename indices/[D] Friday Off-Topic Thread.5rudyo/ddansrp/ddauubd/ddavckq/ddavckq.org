I, and everyone I know IRL except for my anarchist friend who has always thought weird things, condemn violence, rioting, political physical attacks, and so on. We don't carry signs that say "shoot republicans" or whatever, we carry signs that say "equal rights for everyone" and we donate to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood.

Fuck those people who would weak our movement by defending violent people. They're doing evil, and people who enable violent people with signs like "kill all the whites" and so on are also doing evil. I condemn these people.

I also don't know who they are. I don't know them; most people don't know them. The vast, vast majority of leftists, like every leftist I know, is mostly just afraid and trying to do what they can to keep our society together and protect those who need protecting in a peaceful way.

I've been to the protests. I've talked to and been a protestor. We're not violent. We're just afraid, and trying to show that a lot of us don't agree with what's going on. We want to encourage our elected representatives to protect those who need protecting, and to tell women, gay people, black people, and middle eastern people... you'll be safe. We're here for you.
