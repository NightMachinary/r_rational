So, I used to be one of those people who saw the crazy leftists on college campuses and on the internet and went "Who are these crazy kids? It sucks that these people are giving liberals a bad name." Most of my friends are liberal, some extremely so, but none have really fallen into any of the "Tumblrina/Feminazi/SJW" stereotypes that conservatives and libertarians love to bash.

After this election is the first time I've ever seen some of my liberal friends showing some of the craziness. Not a lot, only like 2 out of the 20 or so I have, but those 2 are fully invested in the whole punching nazis thing.

My other liberal friends and I have spoken out against it, so it's obviously still a minority, from my experience, but it's scary seeing how quickly people will justify violence just because the person being punched or doxxed is a "literal nazi." I really think that the election of Trump has not just demonstrated the radicalization of the Right, but confirmed so many fears on the Left that the perception that actual fascism is on the rise in the USA requires violent resistance.

And I've been asked by a couple people in one minority group or the other why I'm defending people who call for their extermination, and I can't really blame them for feeling betrayed, even while intellectually I still feel justified in insisting that violence is not the answer. They're scared that something akin to the not-too-distant Japanese internment camps will be next, and that all the peaceful protests in the world aren't going to stop that. And if that's the direction things are headed in, I can't say I disagree with them: I'm only against violence when it's not to confront violence. So I can see why, if people actually believe that lives and freedoms are in danger, they'll resort to violence.

The worst part is this is all only going to continue to feed into more people on each side becoming more radical. I don't know what's going to break the cycle.
