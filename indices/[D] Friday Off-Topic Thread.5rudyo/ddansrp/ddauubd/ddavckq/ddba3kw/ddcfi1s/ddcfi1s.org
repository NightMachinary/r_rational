  And I've been asked by a couple people in one minority group or the other why I'm defending people who call for their extermination, and I can't really blame them for feeling betrayed, even while intellectually I still feel justified in insisting that violence is not the answer. They're scared that something akin to the not-too-distant Japanese internment camps will be next, and that all the peaceful protests in the world aren't going to stop that. And if that's the direction things are headed in, I can't say I disagree with them: I'm only against violence when it's not to confront violence. So I can see why, if people actually believe that lives and freedoms are in danger, they'll resort to violence.

Bingo! The question is not, "Why are you being so tribalistic/sensationalistic?". That assumes we've already examined the evidence, found that nothing is wrong and nobody's in danger, and thus started looking for alternate explanations as to why people behave /as if/ in danger when actually not.

The question is, "Well, /are/ people in danger?" Personally, I think when you actually examine the evidence, the answer is /yes/. We are in danger. /I/ am in danger.

But the discussion to have is about the probability of danger, as the explanation for endangered and enraged behavior with the most prior probability. Hell, in addition to the prior probability, it's also the most /object-level/ explanation, which shows that its prior should be robust against changing to different possible complexity priors.
