  there's problem enough demonstrating that that punching nazis reduces risk of nazi violence: how does it reduce the risk of any racist violence beyond it

The following is my understanding, but I have to go look up the source again.

Nazis, or rather authoritarians, operate on an opposite psychology to normal people. Normal people are attracted to underdog causes (or don't care), but authoritarians are driven to /overdog/ causes. If you give authoritarian movements a visible defeat, the /potential/ authoritarians who would have supported the movement get discouraged about authoritarian politics and go back to their normal lives. If you let authoritarian movements have too many visible victories, latent authoritarians start coming out of the woodwork and joining the movement as a way to acquire power over other people.
