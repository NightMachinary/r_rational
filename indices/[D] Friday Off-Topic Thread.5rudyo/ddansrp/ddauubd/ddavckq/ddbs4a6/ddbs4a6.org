Keep in mind that most conservatives feel the same way. They think things like "Sure, I know some people who are kinda racist, but all of us hate Nazis as much as any red-blooded American!" I've always thought it was a telling statistic that of the ~35 arrests made during the 90's Right-Wing Militia movement, all but two of them were reported by /other Right-Wing Militia members/. I imagine those conversations went something like: [whispered tone] "Hi, is this the FBI? Look, I joined this militia group, and we have a lot of fun getting drunk and shooting skeet in the woods, and bitching about Clinton, but this guy, Billy Placeholder? He's talking about a fucking /shooting war with the US government/. Will you please come arrest this fucker before he gets us all killed?"
