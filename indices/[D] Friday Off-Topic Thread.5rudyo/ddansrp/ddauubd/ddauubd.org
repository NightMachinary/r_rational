I'm Swedish and left wing even by local standards, but I have somehow found myself even more frustrated with the American left than its right. Trump is a complete asshole, and he's giving the Republicans everything they want on a silver platter /plus/ plausible deniability they can turn to when his ship sinks. But there are so many incredibly hateful and counterproductive behaviours on the left. Try to understand their perspective here. I will start with saying some things about muslims that overgeneralizes and lacks context, but the point I want to get to is drawing a parallel that ends up just reinforcing the views of many Trump supporters. Please don't think I agree with everything I bring up, I am trying to illustrate the perspective of someone who is genuinely right wing, not just sick and tired of 'my camp' the left as I am.

The muslims who commit acts of terrorism are a minuscule minority of muslims, many of them from war torn areas who never had a very good shot at life. Alright, fine, but the sympathy, compassion and respect for those terrorists is /way/ higher among non-terrorist muslims than among non-muslims. 25% of British muslims think suicide bombings against British troops in the Middle East are a good thing. 12% think that suicide bombings /in Britain/ could be a good thing. The number is 16% in Belgium. 18% of muslim students in the UK say they would not report a fellow muslim /whom they knew was planning a terrorist attack/. 25% of UK muslims say no muslim has an obligation to report any such knowledge. 37% say violence is justified if the target is a Jew. 45% of British Muslims agree that clerics preaching violence against the West represent "mainstream Islam". I got those numbers [[http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/opinion-polls.aspx][here]]. That site is pushing an agenda, but the polls they link to are done by BBC Radio and other organizations, not all of which are crap. It's fairly undeniable that while only a small fraction of muslims use violence, a very sizeable minority think it's /good that they do/. A majority of muslims in the West are against violence, but that minority is not small. Attempts by the left to pretend that there is nothing to worry about are extremely counterproductive, and make a lot of people in the middle feel like the only people actually taking this cultural divide seriously are the asshats who are clearly racist but are at least not blind.

Now. A while back when four black youths kidnapped a mentally handicapped white kid and tortured him with cigarette burns while livestreaming, there were a /lot/ of people ho said 'racism has nothing to do with this, despite comments on tape along the lines of 'Fuck Trump! Fuck white people!, along with a slew of phrases that Breibart reporters probably hadn't dreamed of in their most racist narcissistic wet dreams they would ever be able to report on. The police chief said it was not racism that motivated them and that the only reason it was a hate crime was because the kid was handicapped. Before that we had the black church that was burned down where someone had sprayed 'Vote Trump' on the wall. The media and most of reddit immediately screamed "racist hate crime!" It then turned out it was a black church member who did it just so they could pretend evil rednecks were behind it, and that development was in the mainstream news cycle for less than a day, always with reporters saying how it turned out race had nothing to do with the incident. After the election white people got beat up in the street, sometimes on film, sometimes filmed by the attackers themselves, meaning there is now footage online for anyone to see of two dozen black kids spouting racial slurs while beating up a lone white boy and trashing his car yelling 'Fuck Trump'. Now I'm telling you, I know no matter how many examples I bring up, the response from the left will always be 'It's a tiny minority who commit crimes, you can't blame everyone on the left/all blacks/all muslims'.

Now. While you have all that, you also have /millions/ of people /in the US/ who proudly shout 'Bash the Fash!' You have celebrities joking about how it's time someone bombed the White House. You have a [[/r/rational]] mod advocating violence. You have comments with thousands of upvotes in [[/r/politics]] saying people deserve to be beaten up for wearing a MAGA cap. You have people defending the actions of rioters in Berkley, even shouting 'Bash the fash!' /in the context of hundreds of masked people looting Starbucks and hitting an unconscious white kid in the head with a shovel/. And with all that, they also say Trump supporters are Nazis who overgeneralize and refuse to take part in civil discourse.

I'm way to the left of most Americans on most issues, but the left in the US frightens me. It's becoming a monster /and/ it's helping to radicalize the right. Everything is being made worse, day by day by day, and it's only going to keep getting worse every day that the left behaves this way. Because people in the middle and people on the right are not blind. They have their bubbles and their prejudices too. Some of them are definitely racist. But when so very many people on the left keep tolerating and even /promoting/ violence when it's used against the right, and then say that Trump supporters are /Nazis/... I find it impossible to even identify with the left anymore. I want high taxes, awesome education and healthcare, I want a clean environment, I want solar energy, I want electric cars, I want stronger unions and labour safety regulations, I want a higher minimum wage... But I do not want anything to do with so very many people on the left. And it's making me sad and tired.
