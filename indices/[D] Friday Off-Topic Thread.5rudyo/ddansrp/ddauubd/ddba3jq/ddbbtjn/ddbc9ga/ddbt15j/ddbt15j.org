The problem is that that net is being cast ludicrously widely. I think a large chunk of the left was already primed to think of the Right as /evil/. Think of the debate over the ACA, with it's undertones that all that nonsense about "economic reality" was just a smokescreen for the desire to see poor/old/sick/minority people die in the streets. Think of the abortion debate; pro-choice isn't a natural consequences of a sincere belief in souls, it comes from a malevolent desire to control women's bodies. Etc, etc, a pattern seen again and again. So when the Nazi meme hits the stage, with Nazis as the perfect embodiment of Pure Evil, I think a lot of people were ready to accept that most/all of their opponents were driven by evil, and would /of course/ support Nazism, even as actual Nazism is basically a fringe of a fringe of a fringe. As Scott phrased it in his post-election article, I'm not saying they're on a slippery slope, I'm saying they're at the bottom, covered in dozens of feet of rocks and snow.
