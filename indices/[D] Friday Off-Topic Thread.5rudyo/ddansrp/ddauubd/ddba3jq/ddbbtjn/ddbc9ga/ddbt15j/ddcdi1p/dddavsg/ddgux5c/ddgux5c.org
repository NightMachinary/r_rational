CouteauBleu I don't think it would be a good idea , In America they have a private healthcare system and their healthcare is way more expensive(they spend more proportionally than any other country) , the government doesn't pay all of it, but in the end the people on the country has to pay it in one way or in another , and the fact that the healthcare is private creates lot of problems and the government still has to pay for the healthcare .the situation can seem bad but there a lot of things other than healthcare that one country can eliminate to reduce its spending ,and personaly I think just cutting spending isn't going to improve the economy like most of the union seems to think .
