  It seems to me that the number of people who support violence against "Nazis" is vastly larger than the number of actual Nazis.

This is true, and definitely troubling. The alt-right is disproportionately vocal and influential, and that makes it harder for us to argue that the violence is unnecessary. I've had people ask me why I'm defending people who literally call for them to be killed or forcefully deported, and any answers I give them about principles of free speech and the value of maintaining the law don't emotionally satisfy their fear that the country is swiftly approaching a state where violence /would/ be justified (as in, if actual lynching parties and pogroms start, I'm all for violent resistance, but we're nowhere near that point, and I don't think we're actually getting there anytime soon).
