  Thank you for justifying the exact point I was making. You might want to go reread You Are Still Crying Wolf, the lesson might as well have been meant for you personally.

As I said elsewhere, if there are:

- Pawprints in the snow,

- Yellow snow with a nasty ammonia smell,

- Howls, and

- Dismembered rabbits outside

Then don't tell me about "crying" wolf. There's either a wolf or there isn't, and the concrete, object-level evidence tells us what probability we assign to the presence of a wolf.

Speak in terms of evidence, not in terms of rhetorical tactics.
