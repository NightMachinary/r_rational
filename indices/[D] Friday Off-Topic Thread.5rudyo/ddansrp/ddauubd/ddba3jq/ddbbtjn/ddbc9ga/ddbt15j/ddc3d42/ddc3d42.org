  Think of the abortion debate; pro-choice isn't a natural consequences of a sincere belief in souls, it comes from a malevolent desire to control women's bodies.

I believe you mean pro-life? But meanwhile on the other side, pro-choice people don't just disagree about things like when something is given the rights of a person, or bodily autonomy, they're /baby murderers/ who don't care about killing people as long as they get to have consequence-free sex. Or the idea that Obama is literally a secret Muslim working with ISIL to bring down the USA from within.

Seeing the other side as the embodiment of Pure Evil is not unique to the left.

A few of them, sure, but to apply that description to "a large chunk of the Left" seems very hyperbolic.
