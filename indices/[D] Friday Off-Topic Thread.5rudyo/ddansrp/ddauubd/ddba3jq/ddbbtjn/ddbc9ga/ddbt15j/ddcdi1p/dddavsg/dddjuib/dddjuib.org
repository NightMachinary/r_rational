Huh. That's actually very weird to hear, since AFAIK that's relatively uncommon. I've heard of money troubles for the British NHS, but not so much that it would be worth privatizing. And as to systems in places like Germany or Italy or even Australia and New Zealand, no, nobody seems in a fiscal rush to move to privatized health-care.

For countries I've actually lived in, bizarrely enough, Israel has a Bismarck-style system and seems perfectly content with it. I rarely hear complaints or politicization about money spent on health-care -- which is weird, since most other things get complained-about.
