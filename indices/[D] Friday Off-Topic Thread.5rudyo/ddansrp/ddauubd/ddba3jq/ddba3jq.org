  But when so very many people on the left keep tolerating and even promoting violence when it's used against the right, and then say that Trump supporters are Nazis... I find it impossible to even identify with the left anymore.

Let's be clear here: these people are not advocating violence against Trump supporters, only the ones that literally /are/ Nazis.

I know that's not that much better, and there's a very real slippery slope that might lead to labeling more and more people Nazis or Nazi sympathizers. I've spoken vocally in person and on facebook against violence, specifically calling out the couple liberal friends I have who cheered at the punching of Spencer.

But there's no need to make them seem more crazy by misrepresenting their justifications. The fact is that there are very clear indications of a resurgence in white supremacy in the US, not necessarily in number of people, but in their boldness and influence in government. People are afraid. Conservative fear of Muslims and immigrants is what elected Trump, and it's stoking liberal fear of racists and fascism. This cycle of fear is going to continue to drive both sides to the extremes, and that's the problem that needs to be addressed somehow.
