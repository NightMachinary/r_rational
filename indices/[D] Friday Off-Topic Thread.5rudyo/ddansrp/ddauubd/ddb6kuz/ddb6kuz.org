I feel similarly, and I also worry that the issues with perception of the American left aren't going to be fixable. The people responsible likely aren't going to change their mind or behave any differently, at least not as long as they still feel like the tribe has mainstream support, and this will only mean the people in the middle increasingly distrust not only the radical left but also the mainstream culture that supports it and liberalism in general. As liberalism comes to appear less and less desirable to identify with, Americans who still choose a side will more and more side with the right, and the left will undergo a sort of evaporative cooling in which, to an extent, the only people who want to associate with it anymore are the ones who legitimately don't mind or even advocate the actions of the radical left. If that happens, then liberalism will suffer a sharp decline in popularity as it becomes widely known as the party full of hateful bigots and conservatism gains mainstream support.

Eventually, however, things could still turn out fine for the left as an ideology. If the radical left becomes as ridiculed for their vitriol as they should be, then some of them may stop feeling like being in the liberal tribe justifies atrocities against other tribes if they receive only scorn from the community instead of praise or blind eyes. It's also possible that the remnants of the tribe would collapse in on itself and redefine itself as something different, which would free up the concept of being in the liberal tribe for the people who once couldn't stand being associated with the now not-liberals. From the other side of things, with more centrists or even liberals on the conservative side, the party as a whole might drift closer to center, making the parts of conservatism which are denounced by liberals less prominent in the tribe.

Always remember that the same people will still be there with roughly the same opinions, no matter which labels and groups they fall under. Even if being 'liberal' falls out of style because of entitled radical liberals, the nature and opinions of the voterbase hasn't changed much at all, and we'll sooner or later settle into new groups and labels that let us adequately express our divisions against each other like normal.
