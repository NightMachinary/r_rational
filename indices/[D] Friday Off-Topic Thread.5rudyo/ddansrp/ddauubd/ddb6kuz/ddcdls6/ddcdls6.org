  I feel similarly, and I also worry that the issues with perception of the American left aren't going to be fixable. The people responsible likely aren't going to change their mind or behave any differently, at least not as long as they still feel like the tribe has mainstream support, and this will only mean the people in the middle increasingly distrust not only the radical left but also the mainstream culture that supports it and liberalism in general. As liberalism comes to appear less and less desirable to identify with, Americans who still choose a side will more and more side with the right, and the left will undergo a sort of evaporative cooling in which, to an extent, the only people who want to associate with it anymore are the ones who legitimately don't mind or even advocate the actions of the radical left. If that happens, then liberalism will suffer a sharp decline in popularity as it becomes widely known as the party full of hateful bigots and conservatism gains mainstream support.

If this is really how it comes across to you, I'm leaving this country before you crazy people throw me in a death camp. How far-right does the government have to get before you stop thinking the /real/ problem is leftist protesters?
