  Now I'm telling you, I know no matter how many examples I bring up, the response from the left will always be 'It's a tiny minority who commit crimes, you can't blame everyone on the left/all blacks/all muslims'.
#+end_quote

Well... dramatic, well-publicized examples don't actually alter basic statistics. Sure, that's a rationality thing to care about statistics instead of dramatic examples, but you're on [[/r/rational]].

  Now. While you have all that, you also have millions of people in the US who proudly shout 'Bash the Fash!'
#+end_quote

No. This is just plain numerically wrong. If we had millions of committed antifascists in the USA, /this government wouldn't be in power/.

#+begin_quote
  You have celebrities joking about how it's time someone bombed the White House.
#+end_quote

Has the President tried not modeling himself after Mussolini?

#+begin_quote
  You have people defending the actions of rioters in Berkley, even shouting 'Bash the fash!' in the context of hundreds of masked people looting Starbucks and hitting an unconscious white kid in the head with a shovel.
#+end_quote

Who's defending that? Fucking hell, how the /fuck/ do you defend beating an unconscious child as antifascist action?

  But when so very many people on the left keep tolerating and even promoting violence when it's used against the right, and then say that Trump supporters are Nazis...
#+end_quote

Well, what's your assessment of whether they /actually are Nazis/? I mean, I rate them as Mussolini supporters: a lot of them were outright conned, a lot voted for the Republican-branded ham sandwich over the Democratic ham sandwich (but ultimately aren't committed fascist ideologues), and... a core of them are fascists.

/Why can't it be happening here/, given all the appearances saying it /is/ happening here? Why does this have to be the Left's fault, when the Right holds every branch of government, and has held 2/3 for the past six or seven years?

In fact, in general, why should political problems be blamed on the people who /don't have power/, rather than those who do?

And speaking of supporting violence, [[http://www.newsweek.com/2016/02/12/right-wing-extremists-militants-bigger-threat-america-isis-jihadists-422743.html][how]] [[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html][much]] [[https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/01/west-point-report-americas-violent-far-right/319302/][evidence]] needs to come in that /far-right violence is a severe social problem/, a greater threat than Islamist terror actually, before you're willing to believe it even exists?

How many people have to die for people to stop believing the far-right are innocent lambs?

Hell, I don't even /commit/ violence. I just support violence against the far-right when it acquires state power, because far-right governments have a tendency to throw me into death camps. Auschwitz was a thing, remember?

  I want high taxes, awesome education and healthcare, I want a clean environment, I want solar energy, I want electric cars, I want stronger unions and labour safety regulations, I want a higher minimum wage...
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, most people on the American "left" /don't/ actually want strong unions, higher wages, or stronger labor safety regulations. Witness the Democratic primary campaign.
