The populist movement that has embraced Trump endorses ideas that are fundamentally incompatible with my views of what is morally right and factually true, and they are not open to persuation. When Trump was elected I committed to showing empathy towards those that disagreed with me, and I have failed in that. I now see them as deluded at best and openly prejudiced at worst. They frighten me more than anything else and I don't know what to do.
