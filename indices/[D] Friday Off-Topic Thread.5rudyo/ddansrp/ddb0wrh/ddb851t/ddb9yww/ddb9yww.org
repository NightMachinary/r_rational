Do not despise humanity. That is most certainly against all of your core beliefs, and it won't help anyway.

I must admit that I agree with the rest of your points, though. These people are dangerous, existential threats to humanity, and the world would be better off without them. However, harming them won't help either. Both because there are more of them than there are of you, and also because you won't be able to win others to your side while harming others.
