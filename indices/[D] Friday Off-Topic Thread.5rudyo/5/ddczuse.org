I went to see "Kimi No Na Wa." this week. It's really good, and incredibly beautiful. Alas, not very rational, so if you get easily hung on a out of nowhere 'mechanics' reveal, well, that happens once around the middle of the movie.

It wasn't that important though, and I got back into it very quickly. So, strongly recommended unless one plot hole can destroy your enjoyment instantly :P (in which case, can you ever enjoy a movie anyway?)
