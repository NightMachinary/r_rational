  The question is, "Well, are people in danger?" Personally, I think when you actually examine the evidence, the answer is yes. We are in danger. I am in danger.

Yes, people are in danger. My friends and loved ones are in danger. But how much danger? They're in danger from riding in cars and not exercising too.

Even if the chance has tripled in the last year, that only means going from .01% to .03%, or similar. So is it /probable/ that they will be harmed by fascists, or only /possible/? Rational beliefs are based on the former, not the latter, and right now, I don't see the evidence that punching and doxxing fascists actually prevents violence from minorities.
