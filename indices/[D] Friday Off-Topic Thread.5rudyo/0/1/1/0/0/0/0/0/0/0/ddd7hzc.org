But the behavior being discussed is punching nazis. Becoming a victim of any racist violence at all is undoubtedly higher, but there's problem enough demonstrating that that punching nazis reduces risk of nazi violence: how does it reduce the risk of any racist violence beyond it, which undoubtedly would account for the majority of that 8%? Bad policing alone should be like 5-6% of that.
