Ok, I can see that hypothesis having potential merit, but I'm not sure it has sufficient evidence behind it to justify actual physical violence, which has its own set of huge potential side effects and drawbacks.

Also one of which of course is that it might escalate and encourage them to reclaim face. I'm sure there are some fascists who will keep their thoughts to themselves thanks to the punching and doxxing, but if it comes down to a "which side is more willing to engage in violence" thing, generally speaking I'd bet on the more radical/extreme ideology.
