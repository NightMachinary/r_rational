  Keep in mind that most conservatives feel the same way.

Yeah, but if we go by policy, most of the Republican Party are not conservatives in any Burkean or Chestertonian sense. They're not taking a "wait and see" attitude towards social change. They don't value stability, or even fiscal solvency. They're basically just a coalition of military adventurists, tax-the-poor and subsidize-the-rich fiscal horrors, and people who believe in abolishing secularism.

And now they have actual fascists among them.

The Burkean and Chestertonian conservatives switched to the moderate wing of the Democrats, or just went full-on Libertarian, a long time ago. I like those guys. I'm friends with those guys. They're an important counterbalance on people like me, in any possible society.

But they were the /first/ to condemn a visible fascist running for President. Remember when the Weekly Standard and the National Review said, "Never Trump"? /That/ was conservative.
