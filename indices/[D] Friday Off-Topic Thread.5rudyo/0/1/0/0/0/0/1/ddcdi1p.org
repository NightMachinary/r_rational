  all that nonsense about "economic reality" was just a smokescreen for the desire to see poor/old/sick/minority people die in the streets

Well, a bunch of Republican primary voters once cheered, "Let him die! Let him die!" during a debate.

But to be more accurate, there is no real fiscal problem with universal health-care in /any country but America/. "Economic reality" is that other countries have managed appropriate universal insurance programs for /decades/ -- even though the ACA is a piece of crap.

So yes, saying America, for reasons like "it's big" or "it's diverse", cannot do things other countries have already done /for decades/, comes across as disingenuous.
