Right, meant pro-life. And I would by no means say it's unique to the left, but it certainly seem to be much more of a /thing/. Admittedly, this may be because I pay approximately zero attention to the actual pro-life zealots; if I were to find large sums of Pure Evil othering on the Right, that'd be my guess for location.

  A few of them, sure, but to apply that description to "a large chunk of the Left" seems very hyperbolic.

It seems to me that the number of people who support violence against "Nazis" is vastly larger than the number of actual Nazis. Even if we assume everyone in the vague ballpark of the "alt right" qualifies as a Nazi, the "Smash the Fash" group seems much larger. And more on point, the rhetoric I'm seeing from progressives indicates they think there are at least several million Nazis on the right, rather than maybe a half-dozen thousand.
