I agree with most of your points, I am however uncomfortable with your (and others' on this site) blanket condemnation of violence.

Yes, at this point in time violence is counterproductive if we want to affect the change we would like to see, which I assume to be a more liberal and/or egalitarian world with a rising standard of living and happiness for all, preferably along with a corresponding increase of rational thought in policy making and governance.

However, from usage of the word in your post and those of others I get the strong impression that you are opposed to violence of any form, in any context and for any cause.

That, to me, seems to be a dangerous limitation to impose on yourself as it can seriously impede your ability to realize your core values, even ones that place a high or the highest value on human life.

Or am I missing some subtlety that implies only senseless/undirected violence is to be disdained?
