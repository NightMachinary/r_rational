You investigate it. Don't force yourself to feel 'good feelings' for them, just honestly investigate what is actually going on inside their head. Empathy follows understanding. Right now when you put yourself in their shoes, you can't make sense of their actions. How can they possibly be so different from what I would do in their place? You might even conclude there is something /wrong/ with them, that they are so different from you. They're something other, they're the outgroup.

This is map territory confusion. Notice that. When you ask yourself "how can they possibly do and believe that?" notice that your beliefs conflict with reality. Then remember that an entire country of presumably ordinary people followed Hitler. Remember that all it takes to cause conflict between people who are otherwise identical is to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/lt/the_robbers_cave_experiment/][arbitrarily split them into groups]]. Remember that your religion, your politics, your education would almost certainly be different had you been born elsewhere.

I /think/ your mistake is that you're vastly underestimating the magnitude of the effect tribalism has on humans. Politics is the mindkiller is more than a cliche saying, your brain is hijacked. Don't take my word for it though. Actually sit down by the clock for 5 minutes and think about it.
