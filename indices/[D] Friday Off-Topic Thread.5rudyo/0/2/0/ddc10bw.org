I have come out of my depression so now I agree with you, but I can't help but point out that many policies supported by these people can and are causing preventable harm to people who are already needlessly suffering. When they are confronted with this fact, they either don't care or believe that the harm is punishment they deserve. How can I have empathy for people who promote ideas that I find so abhorrent?
