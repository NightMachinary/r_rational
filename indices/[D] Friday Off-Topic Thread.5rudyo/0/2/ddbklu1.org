Time to summon up your rationality superpowers trekie140. What do you think is really going with these people?

  People go funny in the head when talking about politics. The evolutionary reasons for this are so obvious as to be worth belaboring: In the ancestral environment, politics was a matter of life and death. And sex, and wealth, and allies, and reputation... When, today, you get into an argument about whether "we" ought to raise the minimum wage, you're executing adaptations for an ancestral environment where being on the wrong side of the argument could get you killed... - [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][/Politics is the Mindkiller/]]

Rationality is hard. Our brains our optimised for life in a small tribe, not for obtaining true beliefs in the modern world. These people you've lost empathy for might be mistaken about a whole bunch of things, but does that make them bad people? Bad at discerning truth maybe, but bad /people/? Most of our beliefs are adopted from social groups which we were born into. They aren't Evil. Consider to what your brain is doing when you talk with Them.

  We see far too direct a correspondence between others' actions and their inherent dispositions. We see unusual dispositions that exactly match the unusual behavior, rather than asking after real situations or imagined situations that could explain the behavior. We hypothesize mutants.

  When someone actually offends us, the correspondence bias redoubles. There seems to be a very strong tendency to blame evil deeds on the Enemy's mutant, evil disposition... On September 11th, 2001, nineteen Muslim males hijacked four jet airliners in a deliberately suicidal effort to hurt the United States of America. Now why do you suppose they might have done that? Because they saw the USA as a beacon of freedom to the world, but were born with a mutant disposition that made them hate freedom?...

  Realistically, most people don't construct their life stories with themselves as the villains. Everyone is the hero of their own story... If you try to construe motivations that would make the Enemy look bad, you'll end up flat wrong about what actually goes on in the Enemy's mind. - [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/][/Are Your Enemies Innately Evil/]]

I'm not trying to convince you everything is roses either. Letting everything just play itself out would be a mistake. The world is in a dark place right now, even before Trump. But a dark world is not a lost world. Do not confuse a sense of hopelessness with a sense of meaninglessness.

  While our world is dark, it is still filled with color, and indeed many spots of light and even brilliance. Children laugh. Lovers meet. Right now, someone is just understanding one of the deep secrets of how the universe works for the first time, and their mind is filling with awe. Right now, someone is building a close friendship for the first time in a decade. Every day bears witness to a billion acts of love and kindness. This world is dark, yes --- 150,000 people die every day --- but it is not lost. So don't let despair or hopelessness weigh you down. Instead, let them be a reminder: those are feelings you can only get from something worth saving. There are things here that are worth fighting for. If you begin to despair, then let that feeling be a reminder of what could be, and let everything that this world isn't be your fuel. - [[http://mindingourway.com/dark-not-colorless/][/Dark, Not Colourless/]]
