It isn't about connecting with them at this point. It's that I have allowed myself to be overcome by my hatred of Trump's actions and people defending him. I see people embracing an agenda that I consider to be immoral and counterfactual, and when they are confronted by rational criticism in civil discourse, they reject the criticism for completely irrational reasons while maintaining their maturity.

At first, this was merely infuriating. Now it feels like a direct challenge to my sanity. I am living in a world with people who are proudly acting and thinking in ways that I consider to be madness or outright evil, and there's nothing I can do to stop the harm they are going to cause whether intentionally or not. All I can do is wait until their time in power is over and regret that the needless suffering goes on as long as it does.

I'm probably in the middle of another depressive episode just looking for reasons to feel bad and refusing to do anything that would make me feel better, but it feels all too rational to be cynical right now and I can't be a cynic if I want to function. My faith in humanity is one of my primary sources of motivation, but right now I feel inclined towards despising humanity and myself for being a part of it.
