Stupid question time:

I was rereading the Metropolitan Man recently, and it gave rise to a question.

Would Luthor / people that sympathize with Luthor be more or less concerned about a more alien / high functioning autistic spectrum-ish Superman (meaning either completely not raised on Earth, or raised on Earth but largely detached from a lot of the general moral programing of most people)

Like, something along the lines of:

"Yeah. I like your entertainment, food, etc. and there's a lot of neat things you people do. I'm not really here to be a super hero, though. If something comes up that will cause sufficient disruption to these things, like an asteroid, I'll deal with it. If you fucks decide to launch all the nukes to wipe yourselves out, I'll deal with it. Otherwise, there's enough backlog of said entertainment that anything short of an extinction event / knocking you back to the ston eage in mass doesn't really concern me. You want that really cool (non-weapon, I said I'm not here for politics and I meant it) space thing put in orbit so you can skip the fuel issue getting it there? Sure. Hook me up with lifetime netflix, internet, and steam. Want something else done that's basically trivial for me and a pain in the ass for you? Well, I'm following this fanfiction and it doesn't update as often as I'd like. Maybe you should pay that guy/girl to get on it? Stop that reactor from melting down? You know, I'd really like a new season of Firefly. Friends? Loves ones? Nah. I'm not an idiot. I'm basically a nacient God as far as you're concerned. Developing attachments is a good way of giving myself a weakness. The variety that's bad for me and you. Me because why should I give you a way to hurt me? You because that risks what I would do if you successfully emotionally attacked me. And going by your history / fiction, someone totally would, and statistics say they'd eventually succeed. Better to just avoid that.

Why am I concerned with the human race? As far as I can tell, I'm immortal. I can also travel near/at the speed of light. Space is still really goddamned big and empty, and I have no desire to spend hundreds of thousands of years searching for other forms of sentient life that makes interesting things and hoping they're compatable. Do you know how irritating it would be to spend 250,000 years finally finding the sentient Blorb race and finding out that their form of entertainment are sound waves in a range I can't hear coupled with chemical stimulation of body parts I don't have?

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play some FFXV and binge some Star Trek while dicking around on reddit at my house on the moon because frankly listening to all the horrible stuff happening on Earth all the time is irritating."
