I think I'd be concerned that he'd change in what he found amusing in his long, lonely, friendless immortal existence. This is a Superman who's still only lived, at most, a few decades? (he mentions the possibility of traveling for 250ky, so maybe his values are fairly inflexible? OFC b/c of time dilation that journey would be near-instantaneous for him, subjectively, depending on how close exactly to c he's traveling... as well, if yellow sunlight is still needed for his abilities to function, he might run dry traveling through the vast emptiness of space... but that's beside the point)

So I'd worry that after a few decades or centuries of shits and giggles, what tickles his fancy would drift and he'd decide to give being a sadistic god-king a try. A Superman with a rigid moral code would be less likely to do that.

Though I suppose our abilities to entertain might keep pace with Superman's hunger for entertainment. Who knows what delights the Netflix and Steam of 2117 would bring?
