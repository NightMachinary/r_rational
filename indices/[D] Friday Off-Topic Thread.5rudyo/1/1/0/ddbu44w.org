A very valid concern.

The core gameplay loop itself isn't /conceptually/ all that different from canon Pokemon. You wander around in the woods until you run into something worth fighting, at which point the game switches to a turn-based grid strategy view and you pull out your first pokemon. You select your moves, they select their moves, and you see who comes out alive. The devil's in the details--you now have to consider positioning, Area of Effect, endurance drain over multiple matches, and, of course, lethality. In addition, wild (and tamed) pokemon have their own goals and natures--a timid pokemon is just going to bolt, while an aggressive one might get the the drop on /you/.

But at the end of the day, you'd play it (on the surface) very similarly to canon. The trick, I think, is to A: build the systems in such a way that they feel intuitive even when you /can't/ see their underlying mechanics, and B: permit access to those underlying mechanics the more you progress.

The original gen 1 games had it right with EVs--even if some people would jump down my throat for saying that. The original intent for that system (I'd bet) was to make it so that there was a difference in power between the pokemon that had been trained by the player via the grind to level 100, and the pokemon who had eaten 100 rare candies. This system was not revealed to the player--it was intended to /feel/ stronger, that if you were to compare the first kind of pokemon to the second there'd be no contest which was stronger.

The issue came later, with online play, where suddenly everyone was level 100, and to be competitive you had to have the best EVs, which was really still a hidden system and so you had no good way of reading the inner workings. It had gone from an intuition-based system to just another stat.

Which brings us to Aspects (and similar systems). If I have an Alakazam who has spammed Teleport, and an Alakazam who has spammed Psybeam, they are both going to be effective at different things--the first can teleport a few hexes more each jump, and the second can deal proportionally more damage. In addition, the first will find more advanced Teleport moves are much faster to learn, while the second finds that advancing to Psychic is a very straightforward advancement.

It is not necessary to know that Aspects even exist to get this sort of intuitive feel--and this is true for more than half the systems I've designed. There are ways in-game to get this info--various Psychics who will read your pokemon's status for a fee, advanced pokedex plugins that let you get a readout, advanced pokemon center analysis, etc. But if you ignored all of that and just played through the game, you'd do just fine--just like a casual player in canon doesn't have to give a rat's ass about Natures, EVs, or IVs to still enjoy playing. And if it /doesn't/ click, well, then as far as you know, this Alakazam is genetically predisposed to Teleport, and this one to Psybeam, and that's that.

There will definitely be a tutorial of some sort, but the game is intended to be explored and figured out. I won't just drop you at the main menu like Dwarf Fortress or Nethack, but since the game is intended to have procedurally generated worlds, it won't be structured in such a way that allows for a gentle difficulty curve in every situation. Plus, as a roguelike, it's sort of assumed you'll die a lot. Start playing, manipulate the system as well as you can, fail somehow, die, wash, rinse, repeat. The second or the fifth or the twentieth time you play through maybe you don't even know some of these systems exist, but as you explore and stumble upon hints in-game and have "aha!" moments, you'll slowly get better at not dying, and eventually can abuse the system in your favor and have the world eating out the palm of your hand.

Or you won't, and you'll "just" get through the game. That's the goal, anyhow. Sorry for the wall of text.
