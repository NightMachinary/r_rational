Mm. There's something to be said for either direction, but I think I'd be more inclined to feel comfortable with the disconnected Superman vs. the "morale" one.

Reasoning for this being is one that's trying to live a normal life, has strong morale views on the world, etc. is in the situation of acting on those things. Friends and family can be targeted which can lead to a variety of unpleasantness situations for the human race. Having strong morale views means likely getting involved in political situations like civil wars, terrorism, etc. which opens up an entire quagmire and shit storm.

Superman chilling on the moon watching netflicks because of the admitted selfish reason of "Space is really goddamned big. I know I find your stuff fun, and even assuming other lifeforms exist somewhere out there in the vastness of everything and that I can even find them, it's a crap shoot that they will also have things I enjoy" worries me personally much less.

It's also a fun and possibly even somewhat reasonable answer for "Why is this super powered alien interested in us?" "Because space is big and likely at least mostly empty, and via some quirk (either a cosmic fluke or the origin story being them starting as a human originally) our entertainment / food / whatever is applicable to them."

For the more pessimistic, and idol Superman is one you can plot contengencies against in case he does change in 100 years.
