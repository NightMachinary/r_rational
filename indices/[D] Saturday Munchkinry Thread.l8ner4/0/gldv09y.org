How do different formulas, boundaries, and secondary for super speed effect the applications of the power?

For instance compare Flash from DC comics, with wildly varying limits, to Flicker from Doc Future who has superspeed with secondary power but still needs to direct the kinetic energy away to slow down and thus releases the equivalent of nuclear bombs when she gets going really fast; to Velocity in Worm or Velocity Mages in Worth the Candle who can barely do anything because there ability to affect the world is reduced.

To give some examples:

- Unlimited super speed except for absolutely no secondary powers: friction builds up heat, movement displaces air, friction against the ground is required to push yourself forward, etc. As a safety measure, you instinctively hold back the super speed from levels where the friction or air resistance get harmful to you, but you can push past this instinct.

- Mach 1 super speed with all secondary superpowers. You can manipulate the secondary effects in the most beneficial way: ignoring the air unless you want to create a sonic boom or wind, control the friction on yourself to be negligible unless you are trying to start a fire, negate the g-force unless you need it, your mind works as fast as it needs to so you can react if you need to and operate at normal human time perception if not, etc.

- Same as above with complete control over secondary powers, with secondary powers able to scale up to super sonic speeds... but your actual super speed is limited to around only 4x normal human speed.

- Total effective kinetic energy is limited so that it increases linearly with speed (as opposed to quadratically). To make units work... let's say that KE=1/2/mass/(actual speed)*(normal human max speed). You have a reasonable amount of secondary powers, and your max speed is just over Mach 1.

- Total effective kinetic energy has a hard limit so that you can't actually exert more force or transfer more energy than you could as normal human. (I think this would get you Velocity's power and Velocity Mages, but maybe I missed some subtlety or exploit or extra limit).

For some straight munchkinry... pick one tier 1, one tier 2, and one tier 3:

- Max speed: is 6x normal speed (tier 1); Mach 1 (tier two); Mach 23 ie around orbital speed (tier 3)

- Secondary powers: you have an instinct for when speeds would become dangerous from effects like friction or reaction time and your speed of though scales just barely enough with speed and only as relevant to avoiding obstacles but no other secondaries (tier 1); you automatically and instinctively reduce friction, negate air resistance, manage/manipulate g-forces, adjust your speed of thought, in general secondary power activate automatically, etc. (tier 2); all the tier two abilities but you can precisely control them and tune them up or down and apply them in arms reach around you, you can also smash through minor obstacles with no damage to yourself (tier 3).

- Kinetic Energy/Force Scaling: Energy transferred/force exerted is limited to what you could exert without super speed (tier 1); Energy transferred/force exerted is limited by KE=1/2/mass/(actual speed)*(normal human max speed) (tier 2); No limits, also you can magically get rid of excess kinetic energy without need for braking or friction (tier 3).

You can raise a tier by one by taking up to one of these quirks/drawbacks:

- You can only use your super speed for 20 minutes each day (can be non-consecutive)

- You need a 20 seconds to a minute to build up to your max speed when starting from a standstill. You lose speed when changing direction.

- You lose one of your secondary powers (friction reduction, speed of thought, air resistance, or centripetal force management): if you are already at tier 1 you lose everything including even safety instincts, if at tier 2 or 3 you have the danger instinct about the secondary effects but no other benefits.

Thoughts?
