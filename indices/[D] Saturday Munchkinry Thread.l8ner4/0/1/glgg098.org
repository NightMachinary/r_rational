I've always liked speedster heroes. I think the quick thinking aspects are my favorite usage of the power. It would be interesting to see a speedster that basically created a "quick thinking" mode.

Tier 3 secondary powers to maintain perception.

Sacrifice power of moving outside of a small bubble to rank up raw speed to tier 3. Or don't do the sacrifice, tier 2 is probably fast enough.

Take the tier 1 power scaling.

You can read books as fast as you can flip pages. Or Get a large computer monitor to view a bunch of text at once.

Get a keyboard that can keep up with your typing and you can output crazy amounts of writing.

Method of fighting would be to do massive amount of research, find weaknesses launch online trolling campaign and spread information about weaknesses. Let others do your dirty work. Fighting other speedsters would be incredibly risky. You would have absolute advantage in your own bubble of speedy time. But you wouldn't be able to catch any other speedsters.
