Super speed without super thought-speed is an interesting limitation. Your instinctual reaction time is not sped up, but what you can accomplish with a reaction, is (so others can still surprise you). You can plan things in advance of moving, but you still only do one thing per move, then you have to either transition into the next thing without caution, or stop to get your bearings.\\
You have to get a sense for how far one step will move you, because you won't react in time to stop from hitting a wall. If you had the other secondary powers that protect you from hurting yourself, then you'll destroy the wall easily, but if you don't, then you have to be very cautious.
