Prosthesis counts as finger as long as it attaches to the finger-hole, and you can choose a point along the finger to spawn balloons (though, the balloons will always attempt to spawn "upwards", where "up" is defined in reference to Earth unless you leave Earth, in which case it's whatever gravity well affects you the most).

Couldn't you just attack the finger? Although, tiny wires might be very hard to find. I actually can't think of a defense besides actively seeking and killing Balloon Lad.
