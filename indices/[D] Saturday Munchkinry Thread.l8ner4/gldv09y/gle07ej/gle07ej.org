At a young age, you were dipped into a vat of radioactive helium, giving you the superpower to spontaneously generate balloons. Here are the rules:

1. You can generate up to 50 balloons a day, and per "summon" you can use up at max 10 balloons of that quota. It takes a fourth of a second per summon.

2. When you summon balloons, you choose a hand and a finger. The balloon will summon in tied to that finger (in a one loop basic knot, like first step of shoelace tying). The balloon is a perfect sphere of rubber with radius 20cm. The string is .5m long. If you summon multiple balloons in one go/summon another in the same finger, the original balloon is shoved out of place with a little force (imagine the new balloon repels balloons, and the old balloon will get shoved according to that). The force maxes out at 10 Newtons. If summoning multiple at the same time, assume the universe computes what happens if you summoned one by one and then pops into existence the result.

3. You draw the helium from a pool of 50 atmos of helium You can choose to invest however many of this daily quota into a balloon. You recharge this after 24 hours.

4. If the balloon has no space to appear, it will replace anything in its way. If you summoned multiple, when the universe computes the displacement of the balloons it pretends there is nothing in the way.

5. You cannot predict the direction the balloons will move due to displacement (unless you munchkin a way. What I really mean is, the displacement works like a balloon repellent appears in the space where the new balloon would form, and by chance the old balloon could basically go anywhere).

6. The balloon being summoned starts off with the string taut (unless it gets displaced)

7. You can magically made the strings stop attaching to your fingers.

8. The magic helium is normal helium, it's not radioactive.

EDIT: 9. Note that putting 0 atm helium into a balloon makes an instant vacuum

EDIT 2: 10. The isotope is chosen from a distribution of it as the frequency found in nature.

1. A "finger" is a thing touching the hole where your finger comes out. This means you can attach to a building with a finger port. However, there must be a part of that that is small enough for the string to make a single knot around. You can choose where on the "finger" the balloon appears above.
