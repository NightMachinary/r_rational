- Your rules do not specifically state that when you choose a hand and finger to spawn the balloons on, that that hand and finger needs to be yours. As read, I'd say I can pick anyone's hand and finger to spawn the balloons, even at infinite, non LOS range. Eg, I could be watching the president live and then have there suddenly be balloons on their hand.
- You state that the helium is non-radioacive, but can it be a valuable isotope like helium-3? If so, then it would likely be valuable enough to sell at >$1000 per gram.
