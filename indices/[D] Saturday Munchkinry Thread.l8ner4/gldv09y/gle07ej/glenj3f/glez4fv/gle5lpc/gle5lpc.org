10 balloons isn't enough to lift you in the air, but it is enough to lift many objects. Then you can launch your hobbyist drone that weighs exactly as much as one balloon's buoyancy (to extend battery life). You would fly it to the object and push the object around, maybe pop one or two balloons to prevent it from rising higher.

Then you'd get arrested by the FAA.
