I imagine you could attack the finger, yeah, though of course the specifics are up to you. Though if taken at its most literal level, that the 'finger' need only be attached to the finger hole, is there anything stopping you from just plugging into a building?

As an example, say the floor of some facility is made of metal, and there's a prosthetic 'port' welded to it, such that it may as well be the same piece of metal. If you plug in your finger hole, can you then spawn balloons anywhere on the floor? How would the string be tied in that case?

In a lot of interpretations though, a villain who can delete matter using balloons so long as that matter is 0.5m above a place which their finger is contiguous with is both oddly terrifying and intersting to speculate about. Depending on how contiguous the contiguousness has to be, you could pull off some very long range deletions. Imagine creating a tarmac prosthesis, for example... That happens to be contiguous with the road.
