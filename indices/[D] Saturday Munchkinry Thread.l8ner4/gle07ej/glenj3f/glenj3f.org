The nice thing about this power is that rule number 4 essentially makes it a limited matter deleting ability. So, assuming there are other superpowered villains out there, you might be able to murderfy at least one by summoning a balloon in their chest/head/regeneration core. if you want to make a lot of money, there may be some in wearing a big thick radiation suit and then deleting nuclear waste. Though I'm not sure how much people would pay you for that. You also, I believe, could make either of these dangerous activities a little safer with the knowledge that the balloon could initially be summoned 0.5m to your side. Or, if you hold your arm behind you, closer than that.

The next thing that comes to mind is how we define finger. If my finger gets lopped off in an industrial accident, does the prosthetic still count for string tying? What if we increase the prosthetic's length by one joint? What if we were to, say, create a miles-long finger prosthesis that winds its way through a compound containing critical materials or information, and then attach it to your finger stub? Would that let you summon the balloon attached to any point of that finger, thus giving you matter deletion coverage for the whole compound? Because that seems like very effective security, should you have security camera coverage. It also seems extremely scary.

Lay out you custom prosthesis in the foundations of a building, with a network port to plug your stub into for a later date. Months later, a rival political figure holds an event at the establishment. As they stand up at the podium, beginning to speak, the front and back of their suit rips, and they gasp, falling backwards. A string leads from their body, having pierced through flesh and the wood of the stand. Later investigation reveals it tied to a small metal pipe with seemingly useless wiring to allow for articulation. An assassination attempt, with the method only found out much later. Another one-time trick, but if you save it for long enough, many of these buildings could be built this way. Perhaps Balloon Lad was an architect in his civilian life, until he quit after a traumatic event. He now stalks the city, an unknown unknown, taking out everyone he deems a poor fit when they walk within point five metres of one of his famous designs.

Depending on how loose you consider a finger to be, I'm imagining something extendable, shot out (perhaps via air pressure). When plugged into the stump, the entire thing becomes a deadly weapon. No durability powers can stop it - the only people who have ever survived were regenerators.

Eventually, our lad gets more ambitious. 50 atmospheres of helium is, if I'm reading it right, quite a lot. Balloon Lad hides behind 0.45 metres of concrete, beneath the surface of a venue he didn't design. His quarry thinks its safe - his civilian identity wasn't involved in the construction at all. A balloon is summoned, filled with huge amounts of helium, and an explosion rings out, fire spilling everywhere.

Using his Long Fingers, provided by a mysterious backer, Balloon Lad is now never without a bomb. Just as someone might lay a fuse, he lays a finger, stands back, and blows the foundations of a local monument to the sins of an enemy.

Balloon Lad is a national threat. Nuclear waste technician turned government security, turned architect, turned assassin, turned terrorist. He's eventually caught - powered masterminds guiding national superheroes, all regenerators. But he left a mark upon the nation. A mark that said that no power, no matter how seemingly harmless, could be dangerous. A mark that showed how any level of secrecy or influence could magnify that threat greatly. A mark that his hidden backer, who designed those finger prosthetics, who realised his dream of being an architect, who enflamed his hatred of the Other Side, very much intended to make.

... This got a little out of hand, but I started to get invested in the tale of Balloon Lad and couldn't stop. Hope this helps in any case!
