  I think Naruto is applying Occam's Razor by taking the direct link between chakra costs and summon time at face value. That implies that chakra is being pooled up and then actively spent to keep the summoned creature around. He guesses that the return effect is either a natural phenomenon (space just... snaps back after a while?) or built into the technique itself. He uses his knowledge from the Forest of Death and gets Jiraya to confirm that there's another link between summon time and ambient chakra level - that the technique is effectively indefinite with enough present.

I know you are defending my own explanation, but reading this I actually realize I made a mistake: Based on what Jiraiya says, chakra put into the technique lets you summon bigger frogs AND lets you summon the same frog for longer. That means one input variable determines two output variables which... isn't possible, unless the two output variables are connected. I.e. It costs more chakra to summon more powerful animals (i.e. animals with more chakra of their own), and then the animal's own chakra determines summon time as they automatically get teleported back when they are close to running out. I think I'll make that canon actually.

(the alternative you mention, that the two chakra pools get combined with preference given to human chakra, feels like it should get a complexity penalty)

  Anyways, moving on to speculation - perhaps Naruto will discover a way to sustain a stronger summon for longer by replenishing the jutsu over time without having to pay the full cost up front?

Pff, as if Naruto would seriously consider an incremental improvement to an existing technique as a useful expenditure of his time :P
