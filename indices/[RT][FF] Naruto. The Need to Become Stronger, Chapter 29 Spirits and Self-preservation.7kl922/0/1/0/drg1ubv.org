  Then, he did in fact test between his two hypotheses by asking Jiraiya for experimental data (It is NOT necessary in science to do your own experiments if others have already done this for you). Yes, it's possible for the toads to naturally be able to teleport back, however, Naruto does not take this possibility seriously because he already knows that you can summon frogs in any shape and size (even tadpoles) and they will still teleport back automatically, despite teleportation generally being incredibly difficult.

1. Considering he seems to just be learning about the toad contract, where does he get in character knowledge that tadpoles can be summoned? Why would Jiraiya tell him.about that before telling him what the toad contract can do at all?

2. For only a minor complexity penalty, there could be some agent that teleports the summoned animals to and from the summoned realm. To me, this makes more sense than a technique that makes two points in space converge, is intelligent enough to return the toad when it becomes sufficiently damaged, and also can sustain itself off of natural chakra.

  Despite that, Naruto still implicitly tested for this by asking Jiraiya about contract length, and it turned out that animals automatically go back to their place of summoning after a length of time which depends on A) how much chakra the caster put into the original technique and B) the amount of natural chakra in the area, of which Naruto already knows chakra animals rely on (from the Forest of Death chapter)

He knows that the length of the summon correlates with the input chakra and surrounding natural chakra. He hasn't established causation, nor has he tried to disprove his hypothesis. He never asked for any other scenarios where the toads might stay longer than they normally would.

  None of the summoned animals so far have displayed any ability for speech - this is because they can't talk in NTBS (no human vocal cords, for one thing), and both Jiraiya and Kakashi seem to treat them as pets, so it's perfectly logical for Naruto to assume they are the animals they appear to be. But I'll agree this is not obvious from reading the story.

So he knows that they use tools, and water techniques, and can understand language well enough to take directions in the middle of combat and be trusted to follow them, but still thinks they are animals?
