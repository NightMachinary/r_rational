  where does he get in character knowledge that tadpoles can be summoned? Why would Jiraiya tell him.about that before telling him what the toad contract can do at all?
#+end_quote

He grew up with Jiraiya in NTBS, and has made references to seeing Jiraiya's toads before. He was just never taught about the technique, because ninjas don't share secret knowledge like that for no reason. He might not know about tadpoles, but he definitely saw Jiraiya summon a small frog in the chapter with Minato's letter, and that one still teleported back automatically.

(I do realize that Naruto comes across as a bit too ignorant/shocked in this chapter, given the above)

  For only a minor complexity penalty, there could be some agent that teleports the summoned animals to and from the summoned realm. To me, this makes more sense than a technique that makes two points in space converge, is intelligent enough to return the toad when it becomes sufficiently damaged, and also can sustain itself off of natural chakra.
#+end_quote

This is in no way, shape or form a 'minor complexity penalty'. I do acknowledge that 'a wizard did it' is more reasonable in the Naruto world, but then you would have to posit a single agent governing ALL ninjutsu as part of a radically different theory from everything the Second Hokage etc has established so far, since then all attempts at naturalistic explanations are redundant. You absolutely CANNOT invoke a seperate agent each time you run into a technique you don't understand, regardless of how many actual wizards there are in-universe, because then you have no working model at all.

Your argument for "the technique does it" hypothesis being complex does not work because it is already a given that the technique connects two points in space: For one thing, it had already been shown to teleport humans. You can't shift probability weights merely by pointing out that a fact which has already been observed had a low prior probability. (though given the existence of other teleportation techniques, it wasn't all that low to begin with)

Given the above, the correct question to ask is: "Why don't humans teleport back automatically, and why does it cost so much more chakra to summon humans?" That's the part that Naruto's hypothesis can't yet explain.

#+begin_quote
  He knows that the length of the summon correlates with the input chakra and surrounding natural chakra. He hasn't established causation, nor has he tried to disprove his hypothesis.
#+end_quote

You're putting up requirements for publishing research in a scientific journal, but all Naruto is trying to do at this point is establishing the most likely hypothesis in order to get a working model.

#+begin_quote
  So he knows that they use tools, and water techniques, and can understand language well enough to take directions in the middle of combat and be trusted to follow them, but still thinks they are animals?
#+end_quote

You're right about that one, which is why I deleted that comment. Actually, Naruto strongly implies that he suspects they're more than just animals (given Kurama's quote, and the unnerving look in their eyes). However, the only thing this really argues for is trying to establish some method of communication.

(also, I maybe should have removed the tool use thing. I mainly removed their ability to speak because having quirky talking animal companions around felt stupid)
