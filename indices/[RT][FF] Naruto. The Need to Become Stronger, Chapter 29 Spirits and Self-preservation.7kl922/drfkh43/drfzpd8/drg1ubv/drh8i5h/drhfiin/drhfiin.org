  He was just never taught about the technique, because ninjas don't share secret knowledge like that for no reason. He might not know about tadpoles, but he definitely saw Jiraiya summon a small frog in the chapter with Minato's letter, and that one still teleported back automatically.

I was under the impression that the secret knowledge, the things that ninja put effort into not spreading even in their own village, is /how/ to do the techniques, not what their effects are. Everyone knows that Kakashi can do his lightning hand thing, and he makes no secret of that or generally what that technique can do, but he guards how to do it. Similarly, I see little reason for Jiraiya not to tell Naruto at some point what his toads can do, even if he doesn't share the mechanics of how it works.

Also, I haven't reread this story, and have been reading it as it comes out, so I may have forgotten some bits.

  This is in no way, shape or form a 'minor complexity penalty'. I do acknowledge that 'a wizard did it' is more reasonable in the Naruto world, but then you would have to posit a single agent governing ALL ninjutsu as part of a radically different theory from everything the Second Hokage etc has established so far, since then all attempts at naturalistic explanations are redundant. You absolutely CANNOT invoke a seperate agent each time you run into a technique you don't understand, regardless of how many actual wizards there are in-universe, because then you have no working model at all.

If, as you say, the summoned animals don't have human level intelligence, then it's rather odd that the technique requires a contract, as a contract implies two intelligent parties. I'm not proposing an intelligent agent for any particular technique, I'm positing a mediator for a technique that already involves a human and what I believe to be a nearly human level intelligence animal.

Anyways, I'm kind of getting off track. My original post wasn't meant to say "this is the correct solution and Naruto should have seen it", it was more "Naruto didn't have enough evidence to justify his belief in his particular hypothesis over other plausible ones." Yes, his hypothesis fits the data, but he seems rather certain of it given that he only has a few data points.

  (also, I maybe should have removed the tool use thing. I mainly removed their ability to speak because having quirky talking animal companions around felt stupid)

I'd recommend against it. There has to be some reason why elite ninja would use potentially huge amounts of chakra on combat summons over any other technique they know, and said summons would have to be intelligent enough to be more than minor obstacles against opposing ninja. If they're smart enough to be useful, then so long as they can hold weapons it makes sense for them to use them. They don't necessarily have to have made said weapons themselves though.
