I'll agree with you on the general note that it's a bit unrealistic for Naruto to just instantly figure things out, but I have to disagree with the specific issues you mention. First off, he does not come up with the correct solution right away, as I explicitly had him think of another (wrong) explanation first to address that issue.

Then, he did in fact test between his two hypotheses by asking Jiraiya for experimental data (It is NOT necessary in science to do your own experiments if others have already done this for you). Yes, it's possible for the toads to naturally be able to teleport back, however, Naruto does not take this possibility seriously because he already knows that you can summon frogs in any shape and size (even tadpoles) and they will still teleport back automatically, despite teleportation generally being incredibly difficult.

To put it succinctly: It is not /impossible/ for all summoned animals to have the ability to teleport back specifically to the place where a ninja just summoned them from without spending chakra and despite being injured and unconscious after fighting, but given that the phenomenon you're trying to explain is teleportation and given that this only happens in the presence of those rare individuals who already have the ability to teleport animals, this alternative possibility carries such a huge complexity penalty that Naruto rightfully dismisses it.

Despite that, Naruto still implicitly tested for this by asking Jiraiya about contract length, and it turned out that animals automatically go back to their place of summoning after a length of time which depends on A) how much chakra the caster put into the original technique and B) the amount of natural chakra in the area, of which Naruto already knows chakra animals rely on (from the Forest of Death chapter)

None of the summoned animals so far have displayed any ability for speech - this is because they can't talk in NTBS (no human vocal cords, for one thing). But I'll agree this is not obvious from reading the story.

Basically, Naruto is cheating by working out the entire chain of logic above instantly, while a real scientist would have to sit down and gather all the information and think about it for a while, but the actual reasoning he performs is entirely sound as far as I can tell.
