I think Naruto is jumping to conclusions in his analysis of summoning and how it works. It's perfectly reasonable that the chakra the summoner pays is the payment for the summoned toad that they want for whatever reason, while the toad is the one who does all the teleportation on their own. He basically has come up with a single plausible solution, but he has effectively zero experimental data to back up that particular conclusion over any other explanation. The toads are intelligent, even if this one seemed not to care much about talking; he could ask them how it works. Not entirely sure if it was confirmed to be in this story, but the fourth Hokage had the ability to teleport over basically any distance. It's not much of a leap to think that the summoning process just gives the toads a beacon to teleport to.

There are of course other possibilities I haven't thought of, but my point stands.

Essentially, Naruto is failing as a rationalist or even as an intelligent person, because he believes the first hypothesis that fits his limited data is how summoning actually works.
