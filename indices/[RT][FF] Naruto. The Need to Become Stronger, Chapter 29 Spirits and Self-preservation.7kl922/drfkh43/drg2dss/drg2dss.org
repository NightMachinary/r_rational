Naruto thinking =That settled it.= is overconfident, but we get to see him being curious, asking questions, and making inferences from the available data. I think that it's both in character and potentially very valuable for Naruto to come up with a plausible working model like this to begin with.

Plus, even at the end, he doesn't sound like he's committing himself too much to his current theory:

#+begin_quote
  That settled it. “Dad, it */sounds like/* (emphasis added) these giant animal spirits can only survive in areas with lots of natural chakra...
#+end_quote

Naruto actually first comes up with the beacon hypothesis:

#+begin_quote
  “Okay. Then I'm guessing they get a chakra signal when you try to summon them, right? And the blood contract functions as a seal network set up to let them know it's you. So then does a toad with the right size and chakra get summoned automatically, or do they choose who answers the summoning themselves? ...
#+end_quote

But then Jiraya clearly implies that the length of the summoning is dependent on how much chakra was used in the summoning jutsu:

#+begin_quote
  “I didn't put a whole lot of effort into it just now, so it's already gone back to mount Myōboku.”
#+end_quote

So now the beacon hypothesis implies that the two-way teleportation chakra costs are a fixed part (and probably relatively small part) of the total jutsu cost, are being paid by the summoned creature (because maybe ninja chakra is highly valued over their nature chakra or something), or are being supplied by a third party (perhaps an ability imbued in the contract itself, which Naruto doesn't look into).

I think Naruto is applying Occam's Razor by taking the direct link between chakra costs and summon time at face value. That implies that chakra is being pooled up and then actively spent to keep the summoned creature around. He guesses that the return effect is either a natural phenomenon (=space just… snaps back after a while?=) or built into the technique itself. He uses his knowledge from the Forest of Death and gets Jiraya to confirm that there's another link between summon time and ambient chakra level - that the technique is effectively indefinite with enough present.

By assuming summoned creatures are chakra animals, he neatly explains the cost and the increased duration because he already knows that they need ambient chakra to live. It fits together. If the universe snapping back was the primary cause of return, then Jiraya's experience implies some sort of mechanism which uses ambient chakra to refill or supplement his initial summoning pool.

Anyways, moving on to speculation - perhaps Naruto will discover a way to sustain a stronger summon for longer by replenishing the jutsu over time without having to pay the full cost up front?

Started writing this before [[/u/Sophronius]]'s reply above. Pleased to see that I hit on a lot of the same points.
