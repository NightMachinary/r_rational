Part of acting rationally (for me) is maximizing happiness. So on that front, I think creating and consuming rational fiction is a win. I could probably make some other arguments in favor of rational fiction, but they're tantamount to post facto justifications. I think that simply, "because I enjoy it" is enough. (I also think that in comparison to my other hobbies, writing is probably the most productive, given that something of at least marginal worth is created in the process.)

Edit: I also receive money through Patreon, but that's the lesser reason for writing (for me). If I /really/ wanted to make money from writing, I would probably work on polishing up my superhero erotica novel, since that's where the money is at. (I am aware that saying "money isn't really a motivating factor" is a really terrible way to get people to voluntarily give me money, but it's the truth. I /like/ having patrons, and I smile when I see an e-mail come in, but that's much more for status/ego reasons than utility-of-money reasons.)
