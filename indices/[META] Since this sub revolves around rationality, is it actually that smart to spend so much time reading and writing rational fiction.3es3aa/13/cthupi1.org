It's an interesting question and to be honest I'm more curious about why you felt you needed an alt.

However I don't think being a perfect agent of rationality, which people here are not anyway, would involve denying yourself luxury time. And if you need luxury time to best perform towards whatever optimal goal (ending death, transcending humanity etc) what better method of pleasure than that which also reinforces good practice when working toward said goal.
