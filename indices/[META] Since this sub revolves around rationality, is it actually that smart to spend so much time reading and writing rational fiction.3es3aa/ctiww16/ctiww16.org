Having one's brain primed to take advantage of "munchkinable" opportunities in real life seems like something that is arguably high-value (provided those munchkinries are likely to be used for altruism, which rational fiction usually primes you for as well).

That said, I haven't convinced myself of this being the most-optimal use of time. My reason for spending time on reading seems to be addiction/enjoyment/escapism, which seems to be time that would probably go to other less productive activities if I didn't spend it here. At the margin, I should probably cut my Netflix watching time first.
