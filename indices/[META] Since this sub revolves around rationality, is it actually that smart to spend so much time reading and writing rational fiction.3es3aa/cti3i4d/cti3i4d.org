I agree with other commenters in the thread that rational fiction is mostly about entertainment.

"Rationality" part makes it more fun and enjoyable, but the goal here is to have fun, not to learn. Of course real textbooks in your field will always be better at teaching you things than fiction.

But besides rationality, I also value new interesting ideas and creativity. And this is where rtf wins.
