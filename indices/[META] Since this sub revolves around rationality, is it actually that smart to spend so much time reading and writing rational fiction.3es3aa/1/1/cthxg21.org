  Go full-time writer. This has been enormously negative financially and so emotionally/creatively satisfying that I don't care.

Peter Singer or someone else from the effective altruism group might say that you could have saved dozens of lives with your earlier job if you had given something like 10% of your salary to charity. Then he might say, is your personal well-being really more important than the lives of those people? What would you say to him?

(Personally I don't care.)

edit. If you're interested about Peter Singer's opinion on this, [[http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/magazine/the-singer-solution-to-world-poverty.html][this is a good article to start.]] His views have gotten milder and more pragmatic on this issue, but at some point he said that if you want to be maximally ethical person you should work so hard, and give so much to charity that you're suffering at least as much as those you're trying to help.
