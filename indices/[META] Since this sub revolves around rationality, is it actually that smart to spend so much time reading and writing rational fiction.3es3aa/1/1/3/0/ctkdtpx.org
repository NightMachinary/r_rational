  You get better performance when high performance is proportionally rewarded with quality of life and status rewards, to whit capitalism.
#+end_quote

My experience with capitalism has been that this is not entirely the case, especially in the corporate world. It is very difficult for someone to get fired for laziness or incompetence, while at the same time, it's difficult for someone who works hard to get promoted. More than any other factor, it's /politics/ that gets people raises (and promotions) and /politics/ that gets people let go. The reason for this is largely that it's difficult to accurately evaluate performance, especially given human biases.

(This is without going into the other failures of capitalism, like its tendency towards local maxima instead of global maxima.)
