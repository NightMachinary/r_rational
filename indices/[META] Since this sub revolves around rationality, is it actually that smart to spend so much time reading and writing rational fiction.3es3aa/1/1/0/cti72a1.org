  Peter Singer or someone else from the effective altruism group might say that you could have saved dozens of lives with your earlier job if you had given something like 10% of your salary to charity. Then he might say, is your personal well-being really more important than the lives of those people? What would you say to him?

Not if he burns out, loses the job for underperforming, and then has to try to put his writer career in a bad financial situation.

Resigning a job isn't actually destroying money, it just goes to someone else. Don't think you're morally obligated to optimize your life around other people refusing to be charitable.
