Patreon is a successful business, meaning that it's a viable market. The interface isn't great and things that I consider basic functionality are missing. Customer service is also not all that it could be -- I've submitted multiple tickets and never gotten a human response in less than 24 hours. It's also not complicated, so a replacement would be relatively straightforward to build.

Right now I'm working out a requirements doc and evaluating whether I want to put in the effort to build it. Given that I'm a Patreon creator, I could dogfood the product. The real question is "can I build something that that Patreon couldn't incorporate quickly, and could I build it better enough to overcome first-mover advantage?"
