You know what I think internet REALLY needs? Universal and convenient micropayment system. There should be a universal way to pay for an article/video in one click(embeddable button on any page). It could be a paywall that gives you access to the article, or a tip-jar kind of donations. Imagine there could be a system that everybody uses, like patreon, and a person has to enter his credit card info only once, and he can pay/donate to his favorite articles all over the web. These could even be microdonations, like 50 cents, and function similar to a like button.

Now that a lot of the people use adblock, ads are less and less viable, and this kind of system could be a solution. And it could totally compete with patreon, without straight up copying it's functionality. What do you think about that idea?

I am working on a fiction hosting website, and I'm thinking about a perfect way to monetize the content for writers(that would be benefitial and convenient for both writers and readers). So far I figured that an ebook store and an Apple-music kind of subscriptions are the best way to go, but I am very curious about the alternatives. If you have some clever ideas on how to monetize writing or how to improve patreon - I will probably be an early adopter.
