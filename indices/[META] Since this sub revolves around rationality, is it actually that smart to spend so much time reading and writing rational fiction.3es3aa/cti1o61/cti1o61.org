Here's a post with some relevance to this topic: [[http://dogearedanddogtagged.com/2015/07/27/harry-potter-and-the-unwritten-epic-of-tomorrow/]]

Short answer: rational fiction can be used to set up a self-sustaining reaction of motivation and energy that can THEN be turned toward actual, real progress in the larger world. Like all things, you can go too far with it, and it can turn into navel-gazing, masturbation, and lotus eating. But done in moderation, it can make you a better and more effective person than you would've been without it entirely.
