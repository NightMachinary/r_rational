Well, the monk still has to do business with the economy. If the monk is completely self-sufficient (growing own food, etc) then he's not a drain on the economy. If he's not self-sufficient then he somehow has to be putting enough value back into the system to support himself. The one exception to this would be if he was on welfare, being supported at state expense, but typically you're only eligible for welfare if you're actively looking for work.
