A lot of these arguments seem to be coming from the zero sum assumption that entertainers and monks do not contribute to economic output. Conversely if you understand that people who generate recreational activities for others, be they authors, monks, amusement park attendants or actors, have a positive impact on the productivity of their serviced audience. Arguably a zen Abbott or the author of a book, of any subject, that leaves many people more motivated could contribute more to society's productivity than an assembly line worker crafting screwdrivers or websites.
