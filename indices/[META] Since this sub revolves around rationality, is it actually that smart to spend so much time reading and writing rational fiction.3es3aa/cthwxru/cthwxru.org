In my case it's been pretty effective. My progress went something like this:

1. Be professional programmer in job that I hated
2. Write for amusement
3. Have someone link to me from [[/r/rational]] and tell me they had done so
4. Discover and explore sub
5. Start posting my stuff here
6. Find that people actually enjoy reading my stuff
7. Go full-time writer. This has been enormously negative financially and so emotionally/creatively satisfying that I don't care.
8. Try various creating-oriented websites, discover something that might be a market niche. Am currently exploring, might start software business if it turns out to be so.

So, yeah. This sub has (indirectly) drastically improved the quality of my life and could possibly end up with me having a job that I enjoy and is financially worth it.
