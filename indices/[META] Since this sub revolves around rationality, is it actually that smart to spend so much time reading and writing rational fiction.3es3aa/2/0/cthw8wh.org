This same type of critique was given about LW many years ago, and I think the same critique applies to this subreddit. If you read it, you might better understand what the problem is about:

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/2po/selfimprovement_or_shiny_distraction_why_less/]]

I'm gonna quote the relevant sections, you might as well replace "Less Wrong" with "[[/r/rational]]" in the text and it would still apply relatively well:

  Less Wrong is explicitly intended is to help people become more rational. -- Unfortunately, I think Less Wrong is a failure at instilling abilities-in-practice, and designed in a way that detracts from people's real-world performance.

  Work: time spent acting in an instrumentally rational manner, ie forcing your attention towards the tasks you have consciously determined will be the most effective at achieving your consciously chosen goals, rather than allowing your mind to drift to what is shiny and fun.

  What is the enemy of consciously directed attention? It is shiny distraction. And what is Less Wrong? It is a blog, a succession of short fun posts with comments, most likely read when people wish to distract or entertain themselves, and tuned for producing shiny ideas which successfully distract and entertain people. As Merlin Mann says: "Joining a Facebook group about creative productivity is like buying a chair about jogging". Well, reading a blog to overcome akrasia IS joining a Facebook group about creative productivity. It's the opposite of this classic piece of advice.

  Unfortunately, in this framework, Less Wrong is probably of negative value to those who really want to become more rational. I see it as a low-ROI activity whose shininess is tuned to attract the rationality community, and thus serves as the perfect distraction (rationality porn, rationality opium). Many (most?) participants are allowing LW to grab their attention because it is fun and easy, and thus simultaneously distracting themselves from Work (reducing their overall Work time) while convincing themselves that this distraction is helping them to become more rational. This reduces the chance that they will consciously Work towards rationality, since they feel they are already working towards that goal with their LW reading time.

The writers here are ridiculously good, and consuming this type of fiction is about as close to wireheading as possible with current methods. Although since this sub is about fiction, and we all know that fiction is supposed to be fun, the problem might not be that big.
