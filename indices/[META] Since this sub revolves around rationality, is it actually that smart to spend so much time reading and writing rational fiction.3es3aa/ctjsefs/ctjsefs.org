I think part of the appeal of rational works is that a careful reader might be able to figure out in advance what is coming. Even if they don't know exactly how the scenes will be delivered.

The closer the reader gets to figuring it out, the happier they are at the end. Like a mystery novel where all the clues are actually present, or a many-piece jigsaw puzzle with no reference picture.

If the writer manages to write an entertaining story that is also predictable in at least some of it's elements, it makes the rational reader happy, because they saw what was coming!

Pleasure is not useless :)
