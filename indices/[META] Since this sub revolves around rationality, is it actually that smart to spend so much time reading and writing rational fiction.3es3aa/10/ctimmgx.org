It's only irrational if you believe that a person should, let alone is capable of, being engaged in actively productive things at every waking moment.

Most people believe that there is room for leisure time in life - to do something solely because you find it enjoyable to do, whether or not it does anything at all to benefit you or expand your mind. If leisure time is an accepted thing, it is no better or worse to read enjoyable fiction, rational or otherwise, than to do any other form of enjoyable leisure.
