That's a rather different criticism, though. This forum exists to help people find and disseminate fiction for enjoyment. LessWrong exists for people to discuss rationality and become more rational.

I've found LessWrong to be something of a shithole. When I've discussed certain topics, specifically related to feminism, people started regurgitating stereotypes at me. I did the research. I responded with that research. I got more regurgitated stereotypes. I got annoyed at it and suggested that people should maybe do some research on their own. The consensus was that I didn't have enough karma to make suggestions and I was just being a whiny brat trying to shut down opposition, and that half a second of someone else's thought (if you can call it that) can be worth more than an hour of my research.
