I can definitely agree with there being a system of perverse incentives, if you consider the "goal" of rational fiction to be education. The most upvoted stuff in [[/r/rational]] is going to be the stuff that's the most entertaining, not the stuff that tries its hardest to teach or instill rational values (or which is the best at doing so, especially since people are very bad at evaluating whether they've learned something useful).

So with that said ... no, it's not rational to spend time reading here if you're trying to optimize for becoming more rational. It's probably the best place to be if you were going to read /anyway/, and want to optimize that reading for thoughtfulness and science.
