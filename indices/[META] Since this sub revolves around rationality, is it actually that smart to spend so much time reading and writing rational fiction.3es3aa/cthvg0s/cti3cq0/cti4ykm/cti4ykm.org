I actually don't even know what rational erotica would look like. "Safe, sane, consensual" is a starting point, I guess. Experimentation? Optimization? I don't know. Perhaps by those standards it would be rational erotica.

But if you have a bunch of teenagers getting superpowers and primary using them for sexual purposes instead of ... I don't know, saving the world or something, I think you're missing something of the "rational".
