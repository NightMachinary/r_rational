Rational, not rationalist. The characters don't have to be TRYING to be consciously rational. I mean, I know I'm just parroting the sidebar, but having things happen for rational reasons instead of because of the force of plot, having conflicts and partnerships defined by beliefs and values instead of "good" and "evil", having the characters behave intelligently according to what they're aware of (or at least having narrative defense for their behaviors if it's something the reader would see is foolish), and having a consistent world are the defining characteristics of rational fiction.

And honestly, these values applied to erotica could work VERY well.
