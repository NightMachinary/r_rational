  I actually don't even know what rational erotica would look like.

... I'm not sure I should actually write this comment, but what the hey.

As soon as I read that question, I immediately thought of a candidate for an existing set of stories, [[http://pendorwright.com/journals/][The Journal Entries]] by Elf Sternberg (admittedly more rational than rationalist, and while science-fiction, extremely soft SF); plus the start of the background for an original story.

(... Okay, fine: Lowered robot costs and better conversational software leads to increased automation in many jobs, a not-very-successful job-protection measure mandates robots in human-replacing jobs must be 'clearly distinguishable' from humans, 'think of the children' morals leads most such robots to be sexless, one company experiments with a line of humanoid-animal chassis that include more anatomy, the protagonist manages to get hold of one that would otherwise be destroyed, and gets to work on jailbreaking the OS... and contrary to many other similar stories, this would /not/ a story about 'conscious' AI, but more about pareidolia and various of the basic drives that humans have evolved to have. ... If anyone wants to pick up this idea and run with it, go ahead, I'm still wrestling with my writing block.)
