I'm unsure there will be any such thing as a "singularity", or that if there is, we'll get anything out of it.

I'd like to get /everything/, to rewrite life in ways our ancestors would have considered acts of God Himself, to smash the things they thought were everlasting truths of the universe, to live lives with horizons that always expand rather than contract, to abolish the darkness our ancestors feared and fill the universe with light.

But there's really no hard guarantees, chances are difficult to forecast due to missing information and yet-determined causal links. Really my hopes and dreams are no better than escapist fantasies at this point: I can't live in them or plan on them, so what good are they?
