I have not. I've done a little research, and it would be very inconvenient right now, especially since I still feel irrationally immortal because I'm young and healthy. I live in Sweden, and the laws here make it pretty difficult to set things up so your corpse gets released quickly. Wanting to hand your head over to a company to be taken abroad is not something the laws were designed to handle.

Also, it's expensive. And the companies I've looked at won't preserve you until the money clears, so life insurance isn't fast enough.
