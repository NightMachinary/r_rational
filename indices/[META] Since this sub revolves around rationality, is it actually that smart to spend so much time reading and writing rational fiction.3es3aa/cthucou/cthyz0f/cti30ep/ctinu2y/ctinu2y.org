I have. Even if you think you can't afford it, talk to [[http://www.rudihoffman.com/][Rudi Hoffman]]. He'll discuss options with you, and at the very least you'll have an estimate on how much it would cost you.

I'm currently spending between $3000 and $4000 for two people, but we could be spending a third of that. (I preferred Alcor over the Cryonics Institute for various reasons, but they're appreciably more expensive, plus I'm paying for more life insurance than needed.)
