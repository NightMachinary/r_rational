Very nice speculation! Of course I can't tell you whether you're on point or not, but I'll record your predictions for posterity and reward you rationality points if any part of what you said turns out to be correct :)

What I can tell you though, is that the identity of the main villain is meant to be a rational, solvable riddle, and though it's very hard for me to judge how obvious some things are you're certainly not meant to rely on meta-level knowledge. One of the main themes of the story is 'cleverness will get you killed', so 'it's too obvious that this person is the enemy therefore it can't be them' type logic is right out :P

That said, this chapter came out right after I decided to make some of the possible suspects more obvious in order to get speculation going, so our dear friend Oro might be getting a bit of a suspiciousness boost as a result of that.

Edit: Ok, I'll give one hint, just to keep the speculation going. I can tell you that the Mind Transmission block is one of several lesser mysteries which I designed to already be more or less solvable at this point, and if you figure them out it should provide a pretty big clue as to what's *really* going on w.r.t. the main plot and the true Enemy.

I think a big part of the reason why there isn't that much speculation about the main plot yet is because I overestimated how easy the sub-plots were to solve, and without them there really isn't much to go on. Right now, the only plot that has been correctly figured out on this subreddit is that Sasuke has been secretly reading Naruto's mind, and that by itself really doesn't tell you enough to figure out the rest.
