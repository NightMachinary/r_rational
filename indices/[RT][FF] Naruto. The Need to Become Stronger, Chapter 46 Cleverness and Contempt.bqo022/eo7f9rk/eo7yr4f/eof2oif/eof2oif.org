I also like your Sakura, particularly because you seem to have created a setting where her main advantage (perfect chakra control) is actually comparable to what others get.

In canon Naruto, perfect chakra control means nothing if others can access absurdly broken techniques due to their bloodlines or demons inserted at birth, while you're stuck using academy techniques, albeit with maximum efficiency.

The way Jutsu work in NTBS (as I understand it), perfect chakra control should theoretically let you learn any technique? Which is partly demonstrated when Sakura approximates Ino's mind control Jutsu.

Since perfect chakra control lets you mold chakra any way you wish - therefore giving you the ability to perform any Jutsu's mental component - all Sakura needs is to learn a Jutsu's physical component and she should be good to go with practice. Am I right?

If I am, Orochimaru also seems like the perfect tutor, since he is the most focused on Jutsu research/exploration out of the Sannin, at least in canon.
