I instinctively recoiled away from the idea of considering Orochimaru being The Enemy. Then I reread it three times and realized it was my own bias from reading canon and wanting to know where the story is going while feeling clever because of my meta knowledge.

I think this perfectly encapsulated the feeling the Naruto author tried to get across when first introducing Orochimaru. He HAS charisma, whether in this story it is chakra induced or not, he got all those people to follow him to his own village. He got the Sand to betray Konoha. But this is the first time Ive seen his charisma, other than Chiaroscuro and Team Anko, properly done.

As always your action scenes leave me breathless. How do you go about writing them? The foreshadowing to the lamp was gorgeous.

Your characterization has been shining brighter than a diamond.
