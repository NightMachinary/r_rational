Great chapter! Loved Sakura's fight, and Orochimaru's introduction.

I wonder what was up with Ino. Someone, probably Orochimaru or an ally or subordinate of his, is interfering with the Yamanaka mind-transmission technique, in a way that according to Ino is impossible even if they were somehow reading her mind. The only possibility I see is that her mind is being controlled rather than read. Perhaps suggestions were implanted in all Yamanaka minds in the past so that if their technique was being blocked they would try certain frequencies in a certain order, making it easy to appear to be predicting them. Or perhaps the Yamanaka (or Ino at least) are being controlled *right now*. Ino definitely seems like she's being influenced into being irrationally driven to solve the interference problem.

And of course this links back to Naruto's belief that if you were a shinobi with a powerful mind control jutsu and dubious ethics, the first thing you should do is use it to control everyone with a mind control technique, including the famous clan of mind controllers.

So yeah, everything points to Oro being The Enemy. Except of course that from a meta, literary point of view, if everything points to something it's probably false. But since this is rational story Sophronius could be subverting that expectation. Grrr. :)
