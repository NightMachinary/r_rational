Thanks for the long reply! Yep, you mentioned something along those lines before, but that's fine because you're helping cement my own ideas and plans for Orochimaru. :)

With regards to biology... I'm afraid I'm somewhat limited by my own poor grades in the subject there. I always do my research of course, but it's hard to do extreme munchkinry on a subject without being an expert myself.

I was actually really helped by having my own 'Sakura' who force-fed me science during my youth, just like Naruto's Sakura did in this story. That's pretty much where their characterisation comes from, so I'm glad you like their relationship! The other reason why I went in this direction was because the very first decent Naruto story I read was Time and Again, wherein (spoilers!) Naruto gets kidnapped by Orochimaru instead of Sasuke. I really like those kinds of twists where you take key plotpoints from canon and give them an entirely different twist. So seeing how Sasuke and Naruto had already been done, in this story I wanted to make it Sakura :)

And of course, Sakura is horrifically underused in canon, so I really wanted to show how to do a character like hers properly. Lots of other fanfictions tried to 'fix' Sakura by just making her 'one of the boys', but this is dumb because I've always thought that you don't *have* to be like everyone else to be strong. Canon Sakura wasn't weak because she couldn't punch things hard enough (as Kishi seemed to believe), she was weak because she lacked agency and she wasn't important to the plot. The author could have easily made her a civilian without any training to justify her weakness, and then still have made her smart and interesting and important. Instead, when he finally did give her agency, it was just so she could create more problems for the MC to solve -_-'

So yes, Sakura being captured by Orochimaru provides an excellent way to develop her as a character, without turning her into just another dumb bruiser. And aside from her practical abilities, she always did have that violent side to her that was really just used as a joke in canon, but which I always thought would have made for a great potential character arc. So in NTBS, it's what attracts Orochimaru to her and sets her on a new path.

Also, at risk of bragging too much about my own foreshadowing, I just want to highlight the difference in Shikamaru's fight versus Sakura's. Shikamaru loses his fight because he never learned from his flaws, and dismissed Naruto whenever he brought them up:

#+begin_quote
  The slouching Nara clan heir looked just as disinterested as ever, but Naruto was starting to think it was more than just boredom that made him that way. “But then, haven't you ever wondered... didn't you ever think about finding a way to fix all of that? I mean, what's even the point of having brains if you don't /do/ anything with them?”

  Shikamaru glanced back at him. “What have /you/ done about any of it?”

  “Me? That's not... I mean, I've done a lot of things,” he protested, but Shikamaru was already heading up the stairs again, and Naruto had to hurry to catch up. /What have I been doing all these years, exactly?/

And again, when Naruto starts his jutsu-sharing scheme:

#+begin_quote
  “Seriously? That's your excuse?” Naruto clenched his fists. “Shikamaru, you're too smart not to realize what's at stake here. This fake peace isn't gonna last forever, and we need to be prepared for when it ends. You're just pretending not to understand because you don't wanna put in the extra effort.”

  “Yeah, you figured me out.” He turned to Ino. “Are we about done here? We still have our own team training to attend to, plus whatever it is you guys do together. Dissecting frogs or whatever.”
#+end_quote

Contrast this with Sakura, who originally derides Naruto like everyone else, but does eventually come around to seeing her flaws. She is shocked when she finds out how much she enjoys violence, talks to her teacher about it (like a sane person), Kakashi chastises her about the way she treats Naruto relative to Sasuke, she resolves to treat Naruto better, and as she results she actually ends up listening to his advice and learns the chakra-strings technique which ends up saving her life (not to mention heeding his warnings about Kabuto).

I really enjoy writing that kind of theme into my stories, where the fate of characters ultimately depends on whether they are able to overcome their primary flaw (hence the title of the story), but at the same time it can also be frustrating. You see, Naruto's primary flaw is that he can't get anyone to listen to him because he is too stubborn to adapt to the unfairness of the world, but my intention was always for the reader to realize that this does not make him /wrong./ It was supposed to be a rational lesson in understanding the difference between /seeming smart/ and /being smart,/ where Naruto is just really bad at the former. Instead, I think the lesson was kind of lost on a lot of people, and the way I wrote it he just came off as kind of whiny.

Of course, the advantage of publicizing this chapter by chapter is that I can learn from the feedback, so hopefully I can still correct this and make Naruto the kind of awesome protagonist he deserves to be :)

Edit: Oh, and to answer your question: Yes, Naruto does have healing factor, but only if he draws upon Kurama's chakra, which he adamantly refuses to do:

#+begin_quote
  */“Hurry, child. Your time is running short. Undo the seal on your stomach, and let my restorative chakra flow freely with yours. I may still be able to heal your wounds, but we must act swiftly.”/*

  Naruto looked up at the being of living fire, the flames seeming to dance and flicker before his eyes. It looked smaller than he remembered, and weaker -- appearing almost frail in spite of its vast power. “Kyūbi? How... how come you're talking to me? I thought Jiraiya had to undo the seal for that to happen.”

  */“All techniques require chakra to function, and this one draws upon your own. As your power fades, so does the seal's -- but there's no time to consider. If you lose consciousness again, I do not think I could still restore you. Hurry and suppress the chakra flowing through your stomach, before it is too late.”/*
