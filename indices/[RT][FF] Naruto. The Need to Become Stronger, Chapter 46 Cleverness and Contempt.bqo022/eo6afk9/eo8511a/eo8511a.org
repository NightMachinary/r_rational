I love this depiction of Orochumaru.

I might have commented this on one of these posts before, but I always felt that, of all the Naruto villains, Orochimaru (and Danzo) was one of the most rational. He lived in a world where biology truly was, hands down, the most important science- where the right combination of genes could grant literal godlike abilities, and specialized organs could be more powerful than any technology - and he actually took advantage of that. More than anything he is the actual self-made man of the setting, only instead of other clanless ninja who sat around lamenting about their lack of bloodlines, he decided to use his intelligence to essentially give himself a bloodline.

This depiction of him as, even at this 'early' stage, already a vaguely transhuman being, with inhuman servants, is perfection. Its everything I ever wanted from a depiction of Orochimaru, and more. The fact that this Sakura might already start looking into the darker side of medical jutsu (something her canon counterpart never did) is enough to already start making her my favorite character.

Normally authors decide to maintain the Sakura-Tsunade relationship, but I do think Orochimaru-Sakura works even better. He's just as medical as Tsunade after all, and much better suited to be a mentor/foil of a rational protagonist. Plus I would find a Naruto-Tsunade mentorship kind of interesting, if she was free as a teacher. A Naruto that can boost his self-regenerative powers , and can mass produce super-strength clones, would be awesome.

Though, does he have Kyuubi-healing in this fic? I can't remember it being mentioned. If not, it would be pretty interesting and novel if his legendary canon healing powers were something he has to actively work towards, and would give a pretty good meta reason for him to study for a bit under Tsunade.

Plus, as you can probably tell, I'm very interested in biology (both in real life and Naruto) and the idea of this fic doubling down on the medical/biological aspect of the Naruto universe is a prospect I find incredibly exciting.

Also I'm the guy that wrote about how Naruto didn't seem that smart in the beginning of this fic, because of how you had Sakura be the source of his insights in the Haku fight. However reading this chapter, and Sakura's arc in general, makes it a lot more clear what you were trying to do with the Naruto-Haku fight. I think what you've done with Naruto and Sakura's relationship is actually one of the best takes on the duo I've read in a long time, and the way they both learn from each other actually kind of makes me want it to be Sakura who ends up Naruto's rival, instead of Sasuke.

I especially like the way you write they think, and how they fight. They're both so similar, and yet so different. Their approaches to battle are interesting to compare and contrast; both are analytical and creative, but Sakura tends to use her smarts to figure out clever, yet conventional ways to win, while Naruto often opts to go for completely out-of-the-box solutions. I never thought I'd say this about any fic, ever, but a Naruto vs. Sakura grudge match to the finish, seen from both their perspectives, sounds like it would actually be a pretty awesome read, and is basically 70% of the reason I want it to be Sakura, instead of Sasuke, who becomes Orochimaru's apprentice.

If you've done Naruto and Sakura this well, I can't wait to see what you do with Sasuke!
