Thank you! That's some glowing praise right there. :)

I want to say that action scenes come naturally to me, but that's not quite true. I actually spent a ton of time preparing them, but I enjoy it so much it doesn't feel like work to me. Basically, what I do is:

1. Write down the abilities of each of the combatants. Decide on why they are fighting in the first place
2. Get a feel for the 'style' of each character. How can I make their personalities shine through?
3. How would these abilities match up? What's the first thing I would do? How would it be countered?
4. Repeat step 3) until I reach an equilibrium strategy that cannot easily be improved on.
5. Does this strategy result in a fun fight? If not, adjust the environment/circumstances and go back to step 3.
6. Play fast action music, write to that pace, and try to fit in as much awesome stuff as possible.

The biggest challenge is that the characters have to be rational, and so I end up going through endless loops where I ask "what if the other guy does X", and I ask myself what I would do to counter that, and then I have the first person ask themselves what they would do to beat /that/, and so on. And like I said, it still needs to be fun *and* it has to further the plot, plus I have to develop the characters along the way. So the whole thing is like a huge optimization problem. But the actual writing process is super fun, and so it's not rare for it to turn out that what I end up writing is quite different from what I originally planned. :)
