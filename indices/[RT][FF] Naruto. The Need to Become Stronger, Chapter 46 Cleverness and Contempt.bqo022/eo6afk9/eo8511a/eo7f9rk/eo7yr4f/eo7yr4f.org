Thanks! He's going to be a lot of fun to write, I think. I always saw him as this ridiculously over the top stereotypical villain in canon, and those are always a ton of fun. Rational fiction kind of seems to disdain those types of villains I think, and to be fair canon Orochimaru had basically no motivation (I think Sasuke even called him out on that before he killed him), but there's a reason they're a classic. :)
