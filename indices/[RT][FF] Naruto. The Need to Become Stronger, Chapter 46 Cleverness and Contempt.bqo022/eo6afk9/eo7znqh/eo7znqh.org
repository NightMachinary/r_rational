Cheers! Yeah, I really wanted to give Oro a proper villain entrance, in line with how utterly terrifying he was when he was first introduced to us in canon. Part of what made him so frightening there was that he came out of nowhere and you literally had no idea who this guy was. So to fit with that, here he a gets a whole 3 (!) paragraphs of description before he says anything, and even then you can only see his feet.

So yes, this scene was mostly the result of my realisation that in order to get readers speculating, you have to speak to their imagination and imply things without ever stating them out loud. Characters have to *feel* like they have the narrative weight to be the villain, rather than there just being a logical reason for it, in order for the reader to take the possibility seriously. Which of course is tricky in rational fiction, since potential villains have a very strong incentive to not sound like bad guys, but fortunately Orochimaru just doesn't care :P
