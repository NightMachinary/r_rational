Yeah, Sakura is definitely a lot stronger than in canon, since unlike the others she can actually get away with inventing new tricks on the fly. Just like Shikamaru's ability to think up strategies mid-combat is justified in NTBS by his use of a forbidden technique that accelerates his thoughts, Sakura was able to create a makeshift sensing technique versus Kabuto only because she has shown the ability to learn new skills on the first try. With someone like Sasuke that would never work, because unlike her he still needed a couple tries to get e.g. tree climbing to work. The difference between succeeding the first time and the second is actually huge, in this case.

And it makes sense that she has this strength, because let's be honest, why else would the Konoha leadership put some random nobody on a team with the Last Uchiha and the Junchuriki? They clearly saw *something* in her.

It doesn't let her learn any technique, though. Her chakra control is the result of her ability to hyperfocus, which gives her incredible fine control when it comes to physically manipulating chakra, but it doesn't actually help with the mental or psychological aspect. Someone like Sasuke is attuned to destructive elements like fire and lightning as well as darkness because it fits his personality, while Naruto can use wind and light for the same reason. In other words, Sakura excels at areas where she only has to manipulate chakra in its purest form as is the case with medical ninjutsu and genjutsu, but with nature manipulation she is still limited to using water right now.
