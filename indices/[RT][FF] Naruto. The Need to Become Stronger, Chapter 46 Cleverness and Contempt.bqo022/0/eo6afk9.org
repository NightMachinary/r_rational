Oh shit.

Edit: To be a bit more specific, I think having Orochimaru's feet and voice be the only part of him that show up makes for a great villainous debut. He makes so much sense as /The Enemy/ that I'm afraid you're bluffing; he's powerful, evil, charismatic, and has the /ambition/ that's required of someone who has managed to bring the village to its knees twice in as many decades. No other big-bad candidate has managed to make me think that they are both capable and motivated enough to actually be The Enemy.

I think you've done a great job raising the emotional stakes and giving us something a bit more meaty to chew on. Maybe he is the Enemy, maybe he's not, but I'm definitely a lot more invested in figuring out who exactly it is after the invasion arc.

Edit 2- Orochimaru's imparting some great wisdom here: "If you underestimated your opponent, it only means she managed to outwit you."
