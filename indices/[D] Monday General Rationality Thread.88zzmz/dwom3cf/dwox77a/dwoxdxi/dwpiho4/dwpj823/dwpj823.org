You still have to do it by PMs or else malicious people find their way in. The two most successful groups I've seen so far are [[/r/neoliberal]] with 52 members before betrayal that was advertised through comments and password sent through PM. The owner got careless however and accidently gave the password to an hostile commie.

The other group is [[/r/hellointernet]] (a subreddit for a podcast)which got betrayed at 59 members but started up again and is now at 53, unbetrayed. They are doing really extensive checking now, I had to go through a voice interview to get in and they're not allowing the password to be even communicated through text or image, only voice.
