[[/r/CircleofTrust]]

Reddit's April Fool's prank this year involves creating 'circles' which are threads in that subreddit, in which you can give people a password and invite them in. It appears that getting more people is 'good' in a similar way to how 'karma' is good.

You can get betrayed however. Every person who enters the code has a choice to join or betray, so be careful who you trust. You do not know who betrays your circle.

It appears to have something to do with game theory and the prisoner's dilemma. People in the subreddit have flairs in the format like 0,0 or 7,5.
