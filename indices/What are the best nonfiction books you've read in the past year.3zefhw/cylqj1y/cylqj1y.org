"Thinking, Fast and Slow," by Daniel Kahneman. There's more "useful" psychology in it than an entire Bachelor program's worth of classes. Hell I'd throw my Master's in there too, if not for the profession-specific value. If you legitimately want to know more about how you and people in general think, and why, it's the first book I'd recommend.
