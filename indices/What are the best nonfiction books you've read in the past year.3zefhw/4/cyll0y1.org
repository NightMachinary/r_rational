How about [[http://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Spoon-Madness-Periodic-Elements/dp/0316051632/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][The Disappearing Spoon]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/Violinists-Thumb-Genius-Written-Genetic/dp/0316182338/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][The Violinist's Thumb]] by Sam Kean. They are great books about chemistry and genetics.
