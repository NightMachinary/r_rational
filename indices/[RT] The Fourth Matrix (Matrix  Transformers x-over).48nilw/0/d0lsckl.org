Its dead Jim.

But in all seriousness, it has great detail in combat startup programs and environment detection, i like it. The word replacement is bit hard to read, both due to having to learn new words and the difference in time standards, dont know whats the point.

Learning how to translate was also good, if a bit lucky the both sides had similar programming to transmit with.
