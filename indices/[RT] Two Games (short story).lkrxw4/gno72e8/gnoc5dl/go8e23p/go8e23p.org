late reply, but [[/u/SpecialMeasuresLore][u/SpecialMeasuresLore]], I know exactly what you're thinking of, because I had the exact same thought---it's probably [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdiSNDXT-ZL5gMEZ7C7ikcZixX4X7ZkcC1K39F3siQI/edit][Sisyphus]], a 2015 Alexander Wales short story released via Google Docs. To be wholly honest, I think I prefer your take, it was just hurt by the fact I'd seen it before!

I checked out the other shorts on the site; "Two Games" was my favourite, really great concept told well, but the other two both had some compelling ideas going on too. Looking forward to seeing /Crescat/ when it's ready!
