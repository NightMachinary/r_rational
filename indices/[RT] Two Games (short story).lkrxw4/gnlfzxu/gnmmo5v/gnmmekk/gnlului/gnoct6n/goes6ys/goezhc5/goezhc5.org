I read ~2/3 of Pact when it was being published. I should probably go back and finish it.

Pact's milieu is absolutely amazing, and Wildbow's writing is very addictive, but I eventually stopped reading because I was frustrated that even hundreds of thousands of words in I couldn't model the magic system very well.

In Worm when something cool happened in a fight I would usually go "ooh, that's clever" or "ooh, I didn't realize this cape could do that, that has implications X and Y". The exact mechanics of magic in Pact were never quite nailed down enough to produce that same feeling. I would be reading a fight asking myself "I wonder if this time magic will turn out to work in such a way that things are OK" rather than "How is this set of tools I understand going to be used to get out of this one?".
