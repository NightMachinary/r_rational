Definitely that problem, and imo it's barely ameliorated in the same-universe sequel /Pale/, despite extensive efforts to do so.

The basic issue, I think, is that the magic is fundamentally shaped by people's desires, and since the world/spirits are conceptual in nature, their limits are more in line with "what are you willing to pay". Which is cool but definitely not as Rational as Worm.
