  Pi, as an irrational number, contains all possible combinations of numbers (does it?).

This is not yet known. Irrational numbers are ones which never terminate and never repeat. But this does not mean they contain all possible combinations. The number .1101001000100001000001... doesn't terminate and doesn't repeat, but it also doesn't contain a 3. So 103 isn't a string you'll ever find there.
