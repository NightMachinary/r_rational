copy/paste man. ;) But in all seriousness, I gave the character roughly the same time to think as I did, so he's just spitballing. Finding an easy way to get all useful knowledge was something I thought up, and while this specific way doesn't quite work, it's enough to convey to the reader what he wants to do, while also setting up the punchline to the story.
