What a powerful GAI removes is humanity's ability to believe in their own agency and primacy. The ability to be the ultimate arbiters of their own destiny. Many theists already believe that we don't have that, but they either actually only /believe/ that they believe that or they think there is already a greater and more perfect intelligence doing that and that the manmade GAI is an imperfect disruption of the order of things as wanted by said higher intelligence.
