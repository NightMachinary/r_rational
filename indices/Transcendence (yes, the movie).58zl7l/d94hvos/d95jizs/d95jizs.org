I thought *spoiler* was exactly what he /did/ do. Pretended that they both died, then left the humans to rot in their self-created disaster, having no further interaction with humanity beyond running and existing on the networked environmental improvement nanites. My understanding was that the virus was completely ineffective on him.

You think the nanites could do what they were shown to be doing without an AI directing them? How would they know what to eat and what not to to improve the environment? How would they know where to make forests grow back? What would keep them from eating cities? He won by transcending his opponents so completely they didn't even know he existed afterwards.
