That is more or less the jist of the story. Also all the transhuman stuff he did? It was for his wife.

He didn't actually care, transcendence is the story of a husband who loves his wife but made a value judgement failure of what she wants and when he gets the resources to provide what he thinks she wants it all goes pear shaped.

In other words exactly what I'd expect from an AI trying to emulate a man as he was.

All it was trying to do the entire time was recreate/be what he was. It just so happens the wife who created the AI / uploaded the guy had a lot of very loud and obvious transhumanist flavored technology to the rescue goals.

So it gave her what she wanted.

Then when the error was finally resolved it just stopped doing that.
