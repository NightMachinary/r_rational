Hmm. I suppose that makes sense. But it seems that they assume he /has/ already modified himself away from that, or more precisely, that he is merely PINN (the weak AI) able to exploit the memories and personality remnants of the upload to become a strong, unfriendly AI.

I don't know, I may just be having trouble wrapping my head around their logic. They seem to feel that an AI would automatically eliminate some essential part of the human experience by virtue of its very existence. That just seems highly inconsistent, because /all/ tools remove something from the human experience. For hundreds of thousands of years, hunting and gathering was an essential part of what it meant to be human. The advent of agriculture robbed us of that experience. Penicillin robbed us of the experience of dying of bacterial infections, the domestication of horses robbed us of the experience of walking everywhere.

I don't get it.

But I guess that's why the bad guys are literal terrorists, huh?
