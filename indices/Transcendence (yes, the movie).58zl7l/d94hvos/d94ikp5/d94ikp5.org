Yeah, lots of plot holes.

I mean, honestly, if he actually cared about humanity, he would be willing to allow his wife to die. Their whole model is: 'if he lets her die, he's an unfriendly AI... and now he's unstoppable' or 'he saves her, in which case he /isn't/ an unfriendly AI... so now he's dead'. So dumb. Massive bummer. It's actually one of the things that started prompting me to try and make a genuine Hollywood style scifi action blockbuster about an /actual/ strong, friendly AI, but I'm not super good at that sort of story so...
