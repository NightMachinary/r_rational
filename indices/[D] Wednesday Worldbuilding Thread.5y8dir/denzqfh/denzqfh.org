I have a primitive computer in my book, powered by magic. It can't really break without a whole mountain being destroyed. It's a simple archive of text and audio/video recordings, with a yes/no flowchart series of questions tacked on to help people navigate it. The civilization that left it behind had a few years' (prophetic) warning that something apocalyptic was going to happen, and they built the archive to preserve as much of themselves as they could in case they failed to avert the coming apocalypse. Given that they had years to prepare it, anything they want to include they can. Storage space is not an issue. What should be included? Already stored in it are everything they could think of to help identify and avert world ending scenarios (which didn't help /them/ much), all their science, technology and magic, what they could think of to summarize their culture, their history, including competing theories, competing religions, etc. All their musical instruments and the music itself. Much of their art and tools. Literature. Games their children played, folk tales, little things like that. Also stores of food, seed banks, raw materials and weapons. They also made daily video diaries mandatory for all their citizens, and those are included too. The most critical information they entered in all the languages they could, with extensive materials to help others learn their main language and their alphabet. Is there anything really obvious I'm missing here that you would want to leave behind in case almost all of humanity perished and the survivors eventually stumble upon your hoard?
