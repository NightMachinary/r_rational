Good point. I'm planning to have the machine leave out "how to start using magic if none of you have any training at all" because in that civilization everybody learned magic from childhood and they couldn't imagine a world in which at least the basics were not passed on, but there is no reason they would make the same mistake with regards to technology, since even in their own time there were isolated pockets of humanity who had not gone through the industrial revolution yet.

I hope that one oversight on their part is not too unreasonable. It's really convenient for me the write to have the main characters forced to search for the basics on their own, and the old civilization would have found it alien indeed to think that magic use would go from 100% of the population to less than one in ten thousand with summary execution for anyone who learned magic illegally.
