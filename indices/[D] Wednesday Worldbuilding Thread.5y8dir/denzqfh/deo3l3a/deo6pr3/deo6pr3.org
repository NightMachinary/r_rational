Well, the first thing they get is a quick probe to see whether they understand the main language, which they do because it hasn't been two centuries yet. After that is a series of questions about whether the world is ending, in case the leaders of that civilization are blown to hell and the apocalypse is still ongoing and there is something the survivors should be doing right bloody now. But yes, if the finders do not communicate that they understand the default languages the machine will switch to Rosetta mode, with visual aids in case no common language exists.

Does that seem reasonable?
