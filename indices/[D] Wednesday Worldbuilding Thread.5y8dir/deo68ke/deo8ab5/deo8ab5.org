In humans, purplish-blue skin is a condition that results from metal poisoning in the body (most commonly silver). Maybe silver is the best metal to channel magic or they live in an extremely radioactive environment which would make it an advantage instead. Since some types of radiation are easily blocked by a few millimeters to centimeters of metal (don't know which types, so you'll have to research that part), the extra metals in or near the skin could help prevent radiation damage.
