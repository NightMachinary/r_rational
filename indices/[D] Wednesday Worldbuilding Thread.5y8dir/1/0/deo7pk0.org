Make that rune really eye catching and hard to cover up? Like have it glow strongly with a different colour than the rest, and place it partway up a wall or in the ceiling or some such? Or have the dungeon he able to communicate any way it likes like Castle Heterodyne from Girl Genius? If you haven't read it that's fine. It just skips the runes and telepathy and straight up talks out loud, though it can also communicate telepathically if you put on a magic hat.
