I have a sentient dungeon in my book and he has creatures that evolve over time. Now there are the first sentient creatures and he tries to gradually teach them a language, how to use and make weapons, the concept of trade, etc.\\
My first idea was altars that are strewn throughout the dungeon transmit the information telepathically if the creatures look at a specific rune on it. The problem I have with this is that maybe they just don't look at that rune, or a strong creature builds its nest there and then essentially locks all the other species out of that knowledge.\\
Do you have any ideas how to elegantly transmit the information to the creatures?
