Sorry for the late answer, I hope it is still relevant.

How powerful the dungeon is? Why it can't just create eye-catchy runes in front of these sentient creatures? Assuming that the dungeon can't change itself quickly (so the aforementioned solution is impossible), I have two ideas.

*"Cursed" tools*. Probably, the dungeon can generate artifacts or, in this case, tools. For example, farming equipment that haunts the dreams of its wielder with a simple farming manuals. Even with rudimentary communication abilities, these creatures will eventually be able to replicate such items and take advantage of new knowledge transmitted through visions.

*Reward-based learning*. Let's assume that the dungeon can create puzzle-protected treasures. In order to advance its inhabitants, dungeon should make simple puzzles that gradually increase in difficulty and require cooperation abilities. If this solution works, the creatures will slowly develop simple forms of communication. Maybe puzzle-protected treasure caches will even become sacred places for them.
