Although the reason why chlorophyll is green is slightly bullshit.

The first organisms that evolved to gather energy from sunlight were purple-coloured, absorbing green light for energy (retinal). Once cyanobacteria evolved chlorophyll, the most abundant unused light spectrum was not-green. Chlorophyll was more efficient, and thus outcompeted the purple organisms, which is the reason why all plants are green today (they reflect green light).

(This is only one theory about why plants are green, but it makes sense looking at evolutionary timing, etc.)
