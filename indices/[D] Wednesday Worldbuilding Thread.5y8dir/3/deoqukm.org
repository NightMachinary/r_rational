So, I'm giving my vampires titles and a social hierachy. But I don't know about the names for the different levels. I didn't want to go like King / Prince / Duke / Lord or whatever, since vampire society is ancient and multicultural so it's kind of weird to use them. Plus, I found a really cool word ("janissary") that was used for a certain type of slave-turned-bodyguard in Turkey that seemed pretty applicable to a concept of a vampire hanger-on, so I'm interested in finding more such "international" words.

Here's what I have so far. I've used English words to go for the sort of concept I'm going for. It's hard, because while I want to incorporate multiple cultures, I also want them to read cleanly and be easily pronounced in the English language.

Does anyone have suggestions for terms that

*Vampire “Royal” titles:* (titles listed between slashes are ones I haven't chosen between yet)

- Samraat / Sovereign / Archon: Potential title for “the king of all vampires”; does not really exist, though some greedy vampires with no decorum might be pretenders to this title. As globalisation spreads, some vampires want to use this for a person who will head the no doubt imminent global convocations of several “Pharaohs”. Usage: Would just be a simple title: “Samraat Bethany”
- Pharoah / Anax / Ard Ri: “High King”: Someone who rules over several Crowns. Usually used at a convocation (happens about once a century) where a Crown is selected to temporarily act as the chairperson-equivalent. This title usually lasts for a few years as negotiations about territory boundaries, policies for dealing with humans, ways to enforce the masquerade are discussed. Usage: Would be a simple title: “Pharoah Elizabeth of Terra Australis”
- Crown: Highest title commonly in use. This vampire has a large swath of territory and is subordinate to nobody. They are all officially considered equal, but in reality there are more and less prestigious lands to hold and vampires will sometimes obliquely mock one another for this. A weak Crown may have her territory subsumed under a neighboring Crown's and be demoted. A strong “Duke” may secede. Crowns “rule” over several “Dukes”. Usage: Have the title of Lord, e.g. “Lord William of New Holland”
- “Dukes” (real name: Dey / Oba / Pasha / Baron / Duke): Control and maintain a small area. They have to look after their Shudra and ensure they are behaving appropriately. They must ensure that no new Shudra are created without the Crown's blessing. Usage: Have a title, e.g. “Duke Karnya of the Kimberley”
- Shudra: Vampires who live in areas controlled by “Dukes”. They will have their lands assigned to them and moved around at the Duke's pleasure. Usually young, weak or disgraced. Usage: No title; maybe “Red of the Swan River” (using name of their Duke's land) if needed to distinguish them from others, or potentially even “Red of Lord William of New Holland”

My concerns:

- I really like the word Oba, which is a Yoruba/Bini (Africa) word for a special type of king who controls a single city - which is the exact connotation I was going for. The problem is, it's a word that's still in use today and is used for a sort of religious leader, so I don't think it's appropriate to use in my novel about gay vampires.

- I'm using the word Shudra from the Indian caste system and again wonder if it's an inappropriate choice.

- The position Crown corresponds to the title of Lord. This is kind of weird isn't it?
