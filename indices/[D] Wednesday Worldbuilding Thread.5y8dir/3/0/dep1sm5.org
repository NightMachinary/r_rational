Is this setting on Earth? If so, you should probably use regionally appropriate ranking systems, and make not of what is equivalent when necessary. If not, a hybrid of different earth terms seems kind of weird, compared to either sticking to one scheme or inventing your own (Drashu -> Kude -> Helm -> Ropha ->Ratsaam).
