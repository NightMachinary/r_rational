  I'm using the word Shudra from the Indian caste system and again wonder if it's an inappropriate choice.

Not really, it doesn't really work with what you're going for.. Something Chevalier like from blood+ could work, or a knight in any other name.

I would recommend that all the titles should correspond with each other in some way - say depending on the place of origin of vampirism. India - then Samraat, Egypt - then Pharaoh and so on..
