Thanks for the comment!

Unfortunately, vampires originated A Long Time Ago, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away, so there's no "one" culture they're from.

I think I might do what another commenter did and just have people use the titles from their "native" languages, so you'd have a bunch of people of equal rank but with completely different titles. I like the idea of a term used by, say, a particular individual sticking and being in vogue though.

But really it doesn't add much to the universe and can be hard for readers to keep track of. I might do the old standby of seeing if I can find titles of ancient Roman nobility and change them slightly in the vowels (you know... instead of a Duke you're a Duki...) and see how that looks.
