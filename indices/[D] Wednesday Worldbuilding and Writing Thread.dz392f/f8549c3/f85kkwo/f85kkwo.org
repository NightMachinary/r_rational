  let's say that doing the 'proper' thing for your type is how you gain levels.

You could also have the roles possess levels so while you can switch careers, you have to start over.* (And going back is easy.) Thus people specialize because they'll do better that way, while allowing for rare shifts - the town of starving citizens might turn to banditry, or if a bandit becomes a regular citizen, they may still be viewed with suspicion because they can go back to their old ways, and still be about as good at it as they used to be. While this might enable weaker combinations (people who fight monsters during the summer/when the slimes attack, but are citizens the other half the year), the strongest heroes will be the ones who just do that.

* This is imperfect in that there is reasonable overlap, and with the right transitions, you might want to allow that. Heroes and bandits both fight, so a hero who becomes a bandit should at least be good at that. Heroes might lead, say in emergency situations (especially those involving monsters), so if a hero (particularly a leader) retires (from hero work) and becomes an official that should work okay. Also, since bandits perpetrate evil, if someone turns them into monsters maybe there should be bonus (a lot when compared to citizens, less so compared to heroes).
