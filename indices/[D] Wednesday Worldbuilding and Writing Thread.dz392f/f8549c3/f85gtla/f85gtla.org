This might be a bit meta, but what about if the powers for each group are different unrealistic parts of the cliche setting? For example:

- Officials are able to perform long rituals that create and maintain large-scale magical effects. Two of the most popular are safe zones - warded regions within which violent conflict is prohibited, typically encompassing the insides of the city walls, and resurrection points - floating glowing gems that can restore people to life. This encourages holding a fixed position and gives them a legitimate claim to rulership, and without their support the heroic lifestyle is impossible. Based on save points and the player's inability to attack NPCs around town.
- Heroes are able to grow stronger by defeating enemies, rather than by training. When they defeat enemies, they are also converted into useful raw materials or items. This allows them to quickly grow strong enough to defeat demons, provided they have the motivation to endure the constant painful battling this growth requires - otherwise they can generate enough income for a luxurious lifestyle with little effort and have no need to become stronger. Based on levelling up and monster drops.
- Demons have the power of temporarily breaking the rules of the setting, bypassing impassable obstacles and killing experienced adventurers with a single attack that prevents their resurrection. The most powerful can even briefly render bystanders incapable of action. Because this can't be used often, it is most lucrative to take infrequent, high-reward actions, like raiding warded villages, kidnapping princesses, and breaking in to steal magical artefacts. This of course makes them the natural enemy of Officials. Based on the unreasonable effectiveness of villains in cutscenes.

As for story ideas, the first one that comes to mind would be following the people who don't use their roles in the ways their powers encourage.

- The brave ritualist always wanted to be an adventurer, and learned the magic of officials with that in mind. She lives as a hero with her trusted bodyguard and has weaponised the standard hero-summoning ritual by shortening the cast time so she can summon her ally multiple times in the same fight, effectively teleporting them out of danger and into advantageous positions. Later on she arranges another summoning contract with a giant/her pet boulder, who she summons directly above her opponents.
- The evil sorceress was kidnapped to be a sacrifice to a demon lord but somehow managed to slay them. Now she rules over his city, each district covered by a different safe zone that she can lift whenever she wants the rest of the city to fall on that quarter to pillage and murder. Her trusted subordinates have access to her save point, enabling them to take on missions with no chance of survival, and she maintains their loyalty by summoning heroes into slaughterhouses in bulk for them to feast on.
- The entitled hero always felt he deserved more from the people who summoned him to this world, and trained furiously so that he could prove that to them. Before he became strong enough to defeat the Maou, he realised he was powerful enough to lord over his starting village and has taken over. Now the rituals are going unperformed and the wards around town are falling apart, turning it into a safe haven for scum and villainy, and attracting true heroes to bring an end to his reign.
- The warrior king grew so powerful after slaying the Maou that no-one could hope to challenge him. Each day he delves to the deepest level of the local dungeon and returns with enough loot that the economy of the entire region is structured around him. With this much influence, his ascension to the throne was inevitable. What happens when he ages and can no longer keep up the pace of his adventures, or when a demon finally gets lucky and manages to slay him?
- The demon heir always chafed at the injustice in the demon realm and wanted to rule it as wisely as the officials. They can't create sustained magical effects, and so make do by instead stalking the night as a vigilante, slaying the worst offenders with dramatic and poetic executions until the capital is as peaceful as the best human cities, for criminals are a cowardly and superstitious lot.
- The edgy avenger is a demon who aspires to heroism. They can't stay with their party for long, for fear of them discovering their heritage, and so lurk in the shadows to save them from impossible situations using their natural magic, only to return to hiding until their magic recovers.
