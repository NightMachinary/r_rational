I feel like you are kind of solving this from the wrong end. Like, the only answer for this kind of thing is 'when author says it is".

Like, don't let the tail wag the dog. If you want the discovery to be in the 70's for story reasons, then explain how it happened then because of X Y and Z. If you want it in the 90's, same. You can't avoid 'contrived observation' in a world you are just making up. Everything is contrived, by the author. Whatever the % chance you come up with, you are the one rolling the dice. You can say a 1% hit instantly, or a 99% missed a bunch of times in a row.
