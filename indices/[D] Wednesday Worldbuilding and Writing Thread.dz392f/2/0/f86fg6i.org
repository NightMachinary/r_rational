5% actually seems pretty safe.

My childhood medical records probably still exist somewhere. But my current doctor doesn't have them or ask about my childhood history with the flu.

And once you get to adulthood, it's actually reasonably rare for people to get a flu that's so severe it puts them in the hospital.

So, from the medical systems perspective, a typical person shows up as "patient present for checkup. Reports good health in last 5 years,"

I think you might catch this effect much later on in life, as the non-perfectly healthful people who were born in 1950 start dying.

But then the medical paper might be something like, "people who had childhood chicken pox or cold sores are at 50% greater risk of death by pneumonia in their 70s"

(Figure that 95% of adults had chicken pox as kids in our world. Your change would decrease that that to 90%, with half of the no-chicken-pox people being "normal" and half having immunity to all disease"
