*Skysong Worldbuilding Part II: Resistance!*

Hi! I posted a couple weeks ago introducing the world and got some great input. Hoping for more productive discussion!

First thread can be found here:

*Short Background Summary:*

A continent of floating islands orbits a massive crystal obelisk high above the clouds.

The islands are inhabited by the Kipii, tribes of sentient flying squirrels.

In the past few generations, they have been invaded by the Azkhal, a warlike civilization of Dragon Riders. The Azkhal drive the Kipii out, burning their forests and establishing strongholds. Over the years, the Azkhal grow rich and prosperous, finally putting down roots in the lush, resource rich islands. Their culture shifts from warlike to aristocratic and luxurious.

With the Azkhal came the Gragir, dwarven thralls that build their weapons and armor. The Gragir have lived as slaves for generations, but are starting to industrialize and wake up to their potential.

*New For this week: The Forsaken*

The floating crystals that give the islands life and hold them aloft thrum with audible power - and exude magical radiation.

Over the past few decades, Gragir craftsmen have learned to harness larger Crystal Shards for power, anchoring them in factory districts to run their machines.

While the dwarves working closely with the crystals protect themselves with lead and iron suits, radiation from the crystals seeps into the surrounding slums and water supply, causing sickness in the poor serfs who live there.

Among these people it is most common for the Forsaken to be born- twisted babes with tiny horns and tails. The superstitious and fervently religious Azkhal cast these children out, leaving them to the wilds, or worse, simply throwing them from the edges of the islands like so much trash.

But, over the years a few have survived. For a generation they lived as woods-witches and reclusive hermits at the fringes of society, outcasts from the rigid Caste structure of the Azkhal.

However, with time they learned their curse comes with power - they are closely attuned to the crystals, and can sense the network of Ley Lines that run through the lands connecting them. Tapping into the crystal's energy, they can wield the same force that holds up the land, creates fresh water from the air, and even produce intense heat and light.

Their greatest discovery, though, is that the Ley Lines form paths and connections through the world that they can move along at right angles to reality, teleporting long distances in an instant. However, this magic all has a cost - life force must be paid, either by the caster, or a sacrificial subject.

*Questions for this week:*

1. What are some resistance/guerrilla tactics the Kipii might employ to slow the Azkhal advance? Hitting supply lines and convoys at night, harassing outposts, assassinating scouts...How might the Azkhal adapt to these?
2. What tactics could the Forsaken employ, given limited telekinesis and teleportation, but very small numbers and few natural resources? Their top priority at first is saving other Forsaken children - what networks or underground societies might develop to foster this?
3. What might some of the terms or limitations of Forsaken magic be? The Crystals are fragments of the original creative force in the universe, and still echo with the will of that first act. They contain the shadow of consciousness, and respond to Attuned minds - but there is some conservation of energy at play. To manifest matter has an equal cost in mental energy or life force - ie you might have to kill a bug to cast a cantrip.
