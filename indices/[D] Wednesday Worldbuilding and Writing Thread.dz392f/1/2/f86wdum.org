interesting basic concept.

first, why do only the good guys get summons? the bad guys get their own summons as well. now we can have a system where both sides need summons, and now its a conflict focused on the resources needed to aquire and maintain summons.

summons are from other worlds. its kind of a crapshoot of what you get, but the summon should always be on the summoners side (unless they mess up the ritual badly). summons from high-tech worlds mean that you get occasional tech boosts, so the entire world has schizo-tech and spies looking out for new tech from summons.

heck, why do we not see more stories where the summons change the world with their tech? the 'guardian of the flame' series does this with gunpowder. its an older series of novels, but quite good. you could have a mechanic enforce the status quo, but that will just punish the summoned hero for trying to be clever.
