i asked this in a different sub's misc thread

--------------

this question might be better for [[/r/rational][r/rational]] or the SSC sub but they don't have catchall threads rn so i thought i'd ask here:

say there's a group of people who never get sick, and live to the maximum of their window of longevity. so if they come from the type of people who live to be late 80s, that's typically when they pass. if they come from the type of people who live to be 100 or older, that's when they pass. they just in the meantime have completely healthy lives, so they only ever need to receive medical attention when they've suffered severe trauma.

this group is distributed equally, functionally identical in proportion to population. it's a very small number of people, but as a trait a person passes it on to all of their children.

at what % of world population do you think it would pass from being unknown, to becoming rumor, to becoming accepted fact?

in this hypothetical the world wouldn't notice until the present so when the phenomenon starts doesn't matter

is it 1%? Less? 5%? More?

--------------

i received only one response, which was useful for my consideration but not a solution, i'm including it and my own response:

  Doesn't matter about world percentage of population, there would simply be different assumptions about disease prevalence, the higher the percentage, the less likely you'd notice by pattern matching

  What really matters is plague incidence near families who carry. It would be instantly recognized if there was a family or multiple families that didn't get sick in the middle of a plague zone

  When it starts matters because if the gene is passed 100% reliably to all children and is not a recent de novo mutation, it's quite likely that the totality of the population has it, especially since it's a major fitness adaptation

*my response:*

#+begin_quote
  it's a detail of a story i'm writing

  after world war 2, a very small percentage of children who are born don't ever get seriously ill or perhaps sick at all, and as the trait passes on to all immediate and subsequent progeny, the population of these "healthful" only ever grows

  what's the maximum amount of time that it's plausible to say it takes before the phenomenon is studied? where the standard goes from "this person never gets sick" to "there's a group of people who never get sick, what's up with that?"

  like obvs you can imagine a person who noticed it early on and started studying it but i'm trying to stay away from that sort of contrived observation and instead go with: every year there's a % chance they're noticed as a population group, right? how many, and what % chance of being noticed, would it be to reasonably take 70 years to notice them?

  a big event in the story is US and European society learning of the "healthful" and i don't want readers to wonder "why'd it take so long for them to notice?" without a plausible answer
