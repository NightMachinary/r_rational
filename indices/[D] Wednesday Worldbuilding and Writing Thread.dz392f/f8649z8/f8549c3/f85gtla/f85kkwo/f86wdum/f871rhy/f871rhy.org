My guess as far as why you don't see more stories where the world is changed via tech is that stories tend to work in the other direction.

That is, evil gets an unfair advantage, and good has to work desperately to counter it. Going all Connecticut Yankee lacks drama, yeah?

I liked the first of the Guardians of the Flame books a lot, "Definitely and Ohmlin", hehe. Been a long time since I thought of that, thanks for the reminder!
