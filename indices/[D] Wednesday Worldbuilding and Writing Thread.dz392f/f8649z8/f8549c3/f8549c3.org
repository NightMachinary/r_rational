So, what if you have an isekai world of the basic type, like, say, the world konosuba is making fun of. It occurred to me that the important people follow basically the Dudley Do-Right model of characters.

The Summoner is Nell.

The Hero is Dudley.

The Maoh is Snidely.

Let's take this as read. So, ok, it would follow then that the heroes defeat the villains, who kidnap the princess, who summon/order the heroes. We seem to be ok in terms of still being what the readers will recognize. Say each archetype has many members, lots of officials leading up to one summoner, lots of heroes up to one Chosen Hero, etc for the Maou.

What does the world look like, if the Rock Paper Scissor structure holds true? Say you defeat anyone of lower level, lose to anyone of higher level, and if the levels are equal the outcome is determined by the RPS system, with squiggle room for plot/willpower.

Well, the first thing I notice is that the roles have no reason to stay fixed if they are identical. So let's nail them down a bit by giving them special powers that encourage them to do what they are supposed to (officials lead citizens, heroes grind mobs, bandits perpetrate evil). Still feels squishy, so let's say in addition to having powers useful for that, let's say that doing the 'proper' thing for your type is how you gain levels.

Now everyone is inspired to do what we want them to do, and rewarded as well. So the world ought to look roughly 'right' for the classic Dragon Warrior dealy. You have people led by officials, mobs being hunted by slimes, and antags doing nefarious stuff.

What are some hooks to pick at this concept with? Anything interesting coming to mind, in terms of stories to tell in a world like this? My web serial is approaching its end and I'm starting to ponder the next topic...
