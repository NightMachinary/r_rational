I'm looking through DnD-related threads now, and most advises to dealing with it that I found so far are either to rush the caster with the forces that aren't trapped (doesn't work on an actual battlefield, with armies, fortifications and all) or to use a spell to escape (which isn't really a viable course of action with thousands of soldiers, multiple force panes and three gate makers at best). The only thing that could somehow work is to cast ranged spells through the gap between fences, but even that isn't likely to make a big impact on the battle.
