I kept thinking of alternate ways to break through those walls...

- Arcadian portals to bypass the shields.
- Goblinfire (demon munitions versus divine light? Sounds like they'd wink each other out).
- Have Masego attack the priests rather than the shields.
- Have Archer use some kind of piercing arrow Aspect.

Now I'm sure there are reasons those all wouldn't work, the most obvious being that Cat and Juniper were caught unawares this happened in the span of minutes, so they didn't have time to do more than react. But I still feel there were some wasted opportunities.

Besides the weight of the narrative (as several comments here have discussed), Cat still has some things going for her:

- Procer's army still has a supply problem. If more of their levies had been killed it might actually have been /better/ for their army if the battle goes on for longer than a day, because it means fewer stomachs need food.
- It's possible that the priests have more tricks up their sleeve, but while this use was extremely harmful to the Callowan army, it tipped their hand and wasn't a complete disaster. Now Juniper can plan to use it against them in the future.
- With 7 heroes stepping up, Cat can either tap into Woe synergy with Archer and Hierophant (and possibly Thief) to take advantage of the lack of heroic coherence... or she start handing out Winter titles... or she can start using her Aspect trinkets... lots of ways to take them down.

Beat up, back against the wall, outgunned... that's when our scrappy pit fighter usually shines. Looking forward to the next chapter!
