  Arcadian portals to bypass the shields.
#+end_quote

Even in full swing of Winter's power Cat only used portals on short notice to avoid an attack she couldn't afford takind. As she is now, a portal would take a lot out of her diminished pool of power, would require her physical presence in the immediate vicinity of the pane, and would nudge her closer to the Winter mindset. Add to that that Catherine only has three gate-makers and that the time it would take for any significant force to pass through a narrow gate would be more than enough for the priests to bar it, and we can discard this idea for anything other than emergency.

  Goblinfire
#+end_quote

Goblinfire eats /magic/. Against a miracle it may well prove inferior, and the main problem is, again, redeployability of the fences. If a burning one is shut down, the goblinfire would bar the passage in its place while the fence is put up elsewhere.

  Have Masego attack the priests rather than the shields.
#+end_quote

Priests in numbers that big, especially if they are talented ones like the one that had been with the Exiled Prince, would be able to cancel magic out. Since that guy was the reason Silver Spears couldn't have been scried, and Principate, as the biggest nation on Calernia, provided enough priests to cover the entirety of crusaders' camps, magical attacks are a distraction at best.

  Have Archer use some kind of piercing arrow Aspect.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, I've been wondering where she is. She'd still need line of sight, and it's her arrows that are special, not the shots themselves, but I think Catherine keeps back her in case she'll need to manage multiple heroes.

  Cat can tap into Woe synergy with Archer and Hierophant (and possibly Thief)
#+end_quote

Archer wasn't yet shown to have returned, an Thief would be better off raiding the backline now that there's onle five heroes are left unaccounted for. That said Catherine and Masego /do/ have a shared attack, though I find it interesting that they aren't together for it (Masego is with her mages, Catherine was with the general staff and prepares to take the field).
