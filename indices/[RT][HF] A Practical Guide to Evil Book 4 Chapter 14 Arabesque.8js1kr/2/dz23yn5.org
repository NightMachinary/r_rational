Well, that looks grim. Over the course of the entire chapter, the defenders, with Masego's help, managed to break /one/ fence. It's a miracle, so it can't be shut down by magic directly, only through physical impact. The only evident limitation on them is their total amount; otherwise they're just instant mobile fortifications forty feet tall, anywhere, at any moment the crusaders feel pressed.

The only upside to this I can see is that Catherine didn't have to fight that in a narrow passage that would allow to cut anyone off with just one pane. Regarding the current confrontation, only thing that could break a pane so far was concentrated mage fire, but that's something that can be used only on one point of the front. Other options include tying them down with continuous fire directed on the crusaders, but that doesn't seen to tie down /enough/. The fences won't do much against traps and landmines, but given that Cat let out her skirmishes and cavalry on the very same field, there's gotta be limits to how much munitions she had buried.

That said, avoiding the direct clash where crusaders can deny engagement and ignore siege engines at will and instead taking advantage of the both camps being in sight of each other is seemingly Cathrine's best bet. The only way the panes become manageable is if there's not enough of them to suddenly encircle a legion's worth of troops, and that means not enough priests to form them. Cat doesn't have enough Watch to stall until sundown and then dispose of the priests permanently, but they aren't going anywhere for the duration of the current battle either. How would you fight a numerically superior army with the ability to instantly make walls and cover?
