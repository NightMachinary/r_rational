  My soldiers returned a ragged volley of their own, save for the Watch. Throwing hooks above the fences, the Deoraithe found physical purchase and began to climb.

  The charge continued. The remainder of the Watch split in half, heading for the edges of the fences on both sides.

It's too bad they keep taking these losses, because at that rate I don't think there will be any of them left by the end of the book.
