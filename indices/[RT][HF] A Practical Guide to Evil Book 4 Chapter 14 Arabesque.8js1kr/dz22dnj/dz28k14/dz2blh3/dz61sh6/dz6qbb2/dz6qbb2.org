Yes, most definitely. Within the context of medieval society, you don't have the necessary resources to maintain a prison system, and so with the need for a functioning justice system, you pretty much have to rely on financial, corporal and capital punishment. And Labour camps (which pay for themselves) or forced military service, I suppose.

Within that context, cutting the hand or ear or a pair of fingers off an offender, is not necessarily evil. Making them eat those afterwards though, would definitely be both cruel and unusual, even within the context of Callow. It's the difference between hanging someone and torturing them to death. One is evil, one is not.

And your last question is rather disingenuous: it's not like the only other option was execution, or as if the fae had a choice in the matter.
