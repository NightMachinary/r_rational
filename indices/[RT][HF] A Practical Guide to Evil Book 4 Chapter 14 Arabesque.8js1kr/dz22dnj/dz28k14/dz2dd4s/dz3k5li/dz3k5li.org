I'm with Black on this one: the problem with the world is also the /point/. Villains aren't Villains because they are evil, they are Villains because their role is to serve as a foil for the story of the Heroes.

Cat isn't following the path that Black has laid out precisely, but she's still very much his creature. She isn't here to try to be the least-evil Villain that she can. Cat is here to /change the genre of the story/.

It might be wise to judge her cautiously, if at all.
