The prologue of the story isn't the be-all end-all of what defines villains and heroes, but it shouldn't be ignored either.

First of all, follower-Named are in a special position because their alignment likely just depends on what their leader's alignment is. If a Named changed alignment (and possibly Name with it) their follower-Named, like Adjutant, Captain, Page, etc. would most likely follow, partly because what caused their leader to change would have affected them as well.

Now, /independent/ Villains always work towards their own agenda. That can be entirely selfish one, as many Dread Emperors and Empresses probably had (I want to rule the world! Why, you ask? Why not?). Arguably Black's as well, because his fight against fate is motivated by personal frustration and disgust with the game of the gods. But it can also be one concerned with the welfare of others, as with Squire!Cat.

"Independent" heroes always follow a higher authority, at minimum that of the Heavens. They believe that someone else knows better: they have faith. Connected to that, they feel compelled to adhere to the heroic paradigm. Even the Saint of Swords doesn't just slaughter every noble she comes across, even though she'd obviously like to, because she is bound by the paradigm. Heroes refuse to accept the possibility of peace with Villains because the paradigm proscribes that Heroes can never suffer a Villain to persist.

As to the chaos/order dichotomy: Heroes try to impose the specific order of the Heavens upon the world, but are ready to effect whatever changes are necessary to achieve that. A villain's agenda could be to make the entire world run like clockwork, and as long as that's his idea and he's ready to work at it against any and all opposition, he's a right proper villain. Actually, in theory a Villain could even work towards preserving the status quo at any cost, if he's motivated to do that.

Thaaat's my perspective on the matter, anyway.
