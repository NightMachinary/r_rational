I don't foresee Catherine losing this: She has every side of the story nailed down. Trickery by a foreign religious authority killing her beloved soldiers, the inevitable doom of her fight with a single Name changed to mere doom as she takes down 7, only 7k infantry engaged (very managable by Army of Callow).

Angels can't be used, this is not a holy war at all from the Story's perspective - this is an invasion for political reasons against a struggling country. Everything points to Catherine winning.
