There's also the fact that the story has to decide you qualify for a Name that is villainous without already being, or rapidly becoming, evil. Becoming an apprentice to someone evil in exchange for power and being corrupted by it is a common trope, so it's those transitional and follower names that are probably the only ones with enough leeway.
