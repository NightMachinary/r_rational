I don't know if you would. In villain-aligned cultures, those villains that aren't ruthless and vicious probably get outcompeted; in a low-trust culture being 'good' isn't very successful.

In hero-aligned cultures, villains get vilified no matter if they're good or evil.

Also you see quite a lot of really evil heroes.
