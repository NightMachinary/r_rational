I just crossed into the thirties and find certain information slipping from my grasp. Specifically street names, names and phone numbers just take time to retrieve now. Instead of being in fast-access memory I have to actually rememember and cross-reference the info. Its a tad annoying.

Does this sound like standard cognition post-thirties to you? Just small stuff like this that adds up over the decades?
