The authour of a HPMOR Jumpchain is seeking comments at [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/general-jumpchain-thread-7.762914/page-953#post-62720740]] .

If you're not familiar with it, Jumpchain is like a single-player CYOA, where the jumper usually buys powers and goodies from a setting, spends a decade in it, then moves on to more settings, until they either fail a jump or pass a special end-jump and gain a Planeswalker oldwalker spark.
