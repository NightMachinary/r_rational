I'd prefer that, instead of replying to each comment which mentions an unlinked title, it made a top-level comment in the relevant thread and included there links to /all/ mentioned-but-unlinked works from /all/ comments in that thread. Maybe have it only work in the Monday thread, maybe have its posts pinned.

This minimizes clutter and annoyingness, and doesn't hurt usability too much.
