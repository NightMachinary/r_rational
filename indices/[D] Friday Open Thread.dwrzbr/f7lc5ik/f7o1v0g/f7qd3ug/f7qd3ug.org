Very nice! Though it seems to me that check and checkmate could also be made "implied". After all, if capturing works by double attack, why would a king feel threatened by a single attack?

So, implied check: you must always make a move that stops your opponent from double-attacking your king on their next move. Implied checkmate: if all your possible moves allow your opponent to double-attack your king on the next move, you lose. Though these might be really hard to see on the board, so instead you could just allow capturing the king :-)
