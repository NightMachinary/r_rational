It was multiple layers removed from trying to design a game around configuration spaces. You'd move a piece to all possible places it could move to then when you move it again something something decoherence? It never was a fully fleshed out idea. The relationship between threat and the set of spaces a piece could move turned into this.

As I said, it wasn't successful as a quantum mechanics thing. It's a really good chess thing though.

Yeah, I should get around to implementing castling at some point.

Edit: In pop culture quantum mechanics is always about randomness or how observing something changes it. But the part that was always interesting to me is that QM is a set of rules about the interactions between sets of possible states objects can be in.
