I've been kind of amazed by PC video game art design recently.

Sure, there are some obvious clones of other games, but there are so many that have some unique look. It is quite usual to see something weird and fantastical coming out every week.

Now if only the writing on these games was as good.

Speaking of... are there any video games that have rational-leaning plots or other aspects?

I'm finally getting around to playing the first XCOM, that's been fun so far.
