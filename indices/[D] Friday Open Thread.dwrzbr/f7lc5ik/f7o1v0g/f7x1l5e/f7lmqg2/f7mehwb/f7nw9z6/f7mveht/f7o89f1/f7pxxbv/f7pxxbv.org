  Once you're done with X-Com (I assume you mean the first new one, not the really old one), I recommend X-Com 2 with the expansion, really a strong game.

That is the plan. I need to finish the first one (Enemy Within), but I've already restarted it five times. I get a little ways into it, and then learn that I messed up something (sub-optimal base expansion, for example) and start over. I've actually started Divinity: Original Sin at least 10 times without finishing it yet. I'm not going to say how many hours I have in it already.

  Something I think some in this sub would like is Dwarf Fortress ...
#+end_quote

I've read about it here and there. Maybe when I retire... it seems like a lot of work. There's also various games where you are building factories and such I might try someday.

I'll check out Slay the Spire.

Edit: spelling.
