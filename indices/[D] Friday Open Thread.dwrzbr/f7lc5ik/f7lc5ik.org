What would people's ideal linker bot be?

My preferences:

- Posts are compact, preferably a single line\\
  (eg. “/[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]]/”)
- Avoids repetition where possible (eg. if multiple replies mention the same text)
- Links to text and maybe also discussion threads or some other Reddit post
- Avoids other annotations
- Open source, under community direction
- Easy to dismiss or block
