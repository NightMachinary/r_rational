I've always been able to remember a rather shocking amount of my childhood, but some of that's slipped since I've gotten older (I don't remember anything about the 4th grade). I thought that was an aging thing, but in retrospect I used to make a habit of reviewing everything chronologically as I waited to fall asleep, and that stopped being comforting years ago.

I've also noticed myself taking longer to remember certain things, but so far it feels more like bank switching than a general slowness in memory.
