I would like it to only activate when people wish it, to link more than one of the places the stories is hosted if there are more than one. Like so:

--------------

I would like to recommend <Mother of Learning> and <Taint> since they both have magic.

Mother of Learning ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Fictionpress]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Royal Road]]), Taint ([[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/][lsdell]])

--------------

I am not sure about discussion threads since they would probably die very quickly after being created for many less popular or discussion inducing works. Maybe putting the default sorting by new would help?

Also maybe people can use those character indicators to add works to the list? Web fiction gets created fairly rapidly so this might help the linker bot keep up.

--------------

ADD (Mother of Learning) LINK ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Fictionpress]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Royal Road]])

Acknowledged; Added to the list: Mother of Learning ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Fictionpress]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Royal Road]])

Though someone would definitely try and abuse this. Not just in the obvious way (by spamming a bunch of fake stuff or breaking the links to stories they don't like) but something subtle like an author defining several sections of their story as a distinct work (book 1, book 2, ect.) so they have a greater representation in a public list of works (if it is public). So maybe that would be more hassle that it's worth. If you normaly use old reddit blocking someone is a pain so being easy to block is definitely good.
