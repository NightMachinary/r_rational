Once you're done with X-Com (I assume you mean the first new one, not the really old one), I recommend X-Com 2 with the expansion, really a strong game.

Something I think some in this sub would like is Dwarf Fortress, which is notoriously difficult to get into but is very rewarding. The world is constructed with a new geology, geography, ,mythology, and history when you start, and then you're tasked with building a dwarven settlement. When it inevitably fails, you can start a new one or become an adventurer and visit the ruins of your once-mighty civilization. TheAI for the dwarves is pretty cool, they have complex thoughts and relationships and managing all that is a big part of the game. The building an economy stuff is all pretty interesting, as well, and you can make weird superprojects, some people have even built [[https://www.pcgamer.com/meanwhile-in-dwarf-fortress-players-build-computers-powered-by-vampires/][working computers]] inside the game.

Something that isn't rational but is quite cerebral is Slay the Spire, a card game rogue like. Just a verydeep game with an interesting style.
