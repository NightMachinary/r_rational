I'm a crazy gamer, really.

One the one hand, I want to squeeze out every advantage, to get the maximum result. But then I would win all the fights easily, which is boring, and I don't want that either. But I don't want to play a game either that requires the utmost careful optimization, because I doubt I'd have the patience for that either. And I don't want the game to silently up the difficulty, because I want to "beat it" by creating an excellent build.

Like I said... crazy.
