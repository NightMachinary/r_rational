Relevant for the upcoming "Underground" writing challenge: what's the scariest thing an advanced precursor civilisation would plausibly bury deep underground?

Criteria:

1. It must be able to be safely stored in a way that requires no maintenance and will last for ~10,000 years at a minimum (so needs to be proof against earthquakes, solar flares, incidental human activity, etc.).
2. There has to be a reason for it to be made in the first place.
3. There has to be a reason it wasn't just destroyed or ejected into space.

In real life, we're doing this with nuclear waste, although I believe there's work being done with refining the waste for reuse.

This hypothetical precursor race could be using any sci-fi tech you like.

The story idea I'm working on (which probably won't see the light of day, much like my last few attempts at the fortnightly challenge) involves modern day humans stumbling upon such a disposal site and, naturally, /not/ cracking it open immediately (because that would be really, really dumb; even a hoax could be trapped).
