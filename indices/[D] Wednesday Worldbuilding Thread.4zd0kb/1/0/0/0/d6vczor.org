Damn right don't experiment with it. One of the only ways this could be worse is if the AI [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zd0kb/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6v5yi4][came in a chassis designed for Von Neumann conquest of star systems]]. At that point you've got a lovely chassis made of interesting hypertech that you want to +steal+reverse engineer, but you know you don't want to wake the sleeping BESRMoW---and you don't know what's going to wake it. Something you've already done may have started the process, and it's only a matter of time. Does that mean the best course of action is to immediately start learning what you can, to try and get enough upgrades that you can survive the eventual wakeup? Or do you GTFO and hope for the best? Try to seal it, knowing it can probably break out if it does wake?

Unless it's in an interesting chassis (thus worth looking closely at) and possibly able to wake up on its own, I don't see how a depowered Seed AI is scary. Study it without running it. Or don't study it. Either way, don't even consider running the thing until you've got an AI that can be reasonably assumed to be the bigger fish and can enforce the sandbox until friendliness can be verified.
