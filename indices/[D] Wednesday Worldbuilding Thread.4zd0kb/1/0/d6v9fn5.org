Why is it scary? Well, what do you do with it? Its impact on your species could be huge, but every second you spend interacting with it risks it breaking out of whatever containment you come up with. /And/ you have no idea what this race's idea of friendliness is, or what it means that they're apparently no longer around. So it's too powerful /not/ to experiment with, but every minute of experimenting courts disaster.
