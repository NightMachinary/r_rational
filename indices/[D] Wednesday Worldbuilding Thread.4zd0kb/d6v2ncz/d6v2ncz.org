Would the world of Harry Potter make more sense if it took place 55 years earlier? I came up with this because I thought it would be /neat/ Voldemort's rule over the Ministry of Magic coincided with the London Blitz. The idea appeals to me, though, since I think the time period provides a better context for wizard culture.

If the books took place during the 1930s and early 40s, then wizard society would be old fashioned rather than archaic. It's also a period where it'd make more sense for wizards to be so isolated, since recent history would make them not want to get involved in muggle affairs and technology is only just catching up to magic.

The only major impact on the plot is, of course, the presence of WWII. I personally don't mind Winston Churchill getting involved, since I think it'd be awesome if he took charge over the Aurors during the crisis. How the relationship between Voldemort and Hitler would work is unclear, or even if there'd be one, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/4xdw57/harry_potter_how_are_the_muggles_world_war_2_and/][Grindelwald's connection to WWII was left unexplained]] so it's not like I'm adding a plot hole.
