I have a solution to your top speed problem. A side effect of shield interference could be that acceleration is cancelled out after a few seconds, so fast S-FTL ships are also fast in combat. If your thrust vector changes, then you have a new equilibrium velocity. You can probably push your drive to go faster, but it takes more power/fuel and risks burn out. There should be a reason why someone can't just turn their thrust off and on again to speed up, though.

I also thought of a way to justify WWII-style dogfights. Since fighters are too small for grav drives, they maneuver by riding or reflecting the gravitational waves generated by shield interference. The technology is based around the craft's surface area, so fighters are built with wings and fins. However, this increases the fighter's target profile and cost, so designers have to limit how large they are and how many they add.
