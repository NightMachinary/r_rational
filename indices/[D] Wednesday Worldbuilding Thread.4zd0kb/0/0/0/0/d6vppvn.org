Oh, good point about the sizes of the grav drive or shield. So, I'll introduce the following concepts, then:

1. Grav drive/shields are big and need a lot of power, so Corvette is the smallest reasonable ship size for this. Interceptors and missiles must use chemical rockets.

2. Shield merge instead of negate. So, allied ships often fly in formation to combine shields. Then, they take their combined unit it and fly it into an enemy and shoot the enemy from the combined shield that includes them both. Due to the unique properties of the grav drive, if you and and enemy both have a working grav drive and share a bubble, it is difficult to disengage unless the enemy is also trying to do so. Maybe the bubbles, when combined, have a sort of surface tension.

thanks for the suggestion!
