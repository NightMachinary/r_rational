Depending on the exact interactions between technologies and the factions' current meta, I think this might lead to Carriers + Bombers/fighters being a more dominant strategy than WWII style battles.

The goal would be to get your bombers next to the enemy ship to drop their shield, and then shoot their unshielded ship using the large weapons on your carrier.

One way to disallow this would be to bound the available sizes at a corvette at minimum (any smaller and it can't hold a grav drive/shield), to a battleship or carrier (any larger and it would need two grav drives, which would interfere with each other). Fighters, bombers, and missiles could still exist, but they couldn't have the shields or the shield interference powers that are implied by them.

Another idea is to have the shields merge instead of negating each other. If there's a group of five ships close together, they could each fire at any of the other ones, but no other ships could damage those five until they got closer. This would prevent the combo of sniper-ships and shield-dropping-ships from working.
