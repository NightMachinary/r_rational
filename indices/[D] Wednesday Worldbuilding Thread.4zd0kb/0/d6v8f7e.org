So, I've been thinking lately about spacebattles. Not the webforum named spacebattles, but the idea of manmade vessels fighting each other in space. I'm planning to run a campaign or quest based around a combat spacecraft and have been tinkering with the idea. Part of the inspiration has been my recent gaming: I've been playing a strategy game called [[https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris][Stellaris]] that is set in space. This strategy game has combat between fleets, and as common in science fiction, it's handled all wrong.

How, you ask? Let's explore!

*** Problems with space battles as depicted

Well, basically, our combat comes down to a problem of physics and velocity warring with our romantic sense of what we want out of space battles. People like to read about WWII or Age of Sail type battles, with big capital ships pulling up alongside each other at low speeds and duking it out with broadsides of short-range weapons. Perhaps there will be fighters (like in WWII) or boarding actions (as you'd see earlier). Heroic captains would pull stunts to get on the "tail" of their enemies and defeat them with careful positioning.

In fact, this is not at all how space battles with advanced technology would work. This isn't even how modern naval battles work today. A naval confrontation today involves ships shooting missiles at each other from over the horizon, or launching aircraft that shoot missiles from similar distances. There are no broadsides or boarding actions. This only gets more pronounced if you put everyone in space. In space, there is no drag, so there's no top speed for something like a missile. Even without a warhead, a missile can strike an enemy ship (or planet!) from beyond visual range at relativistic speeds.

Right now, today, we can and have fired rockets from the surface of Earth to strike a target on the surface of Mars with an accuracy of within 200 meters. This is a lot more impressive than it sounds, since the rocket had to exit one gravity well and enter another, dealing with atmosphere on both sides. We can expect future space weaponry to only be more accurate, with missiles flying across hundreds of thousands or millions of miles to strike their enemies at incredible velocities.

Missiles would not necessarily need a warhead, since they would have so much kinetic energy, but besides the standard nuclear payload, you might have a missile that carried a weapon (such as lasers or EWAR) in the way a fighter does today. Missiles would be basically unavoidable due to the high acceleration they could pull; whereas humans can't survive many Gs of acceleration, missiles could be engineered to handle it.

*** What space battles would probably look like

With no real top speed (except c) on missiles and ships, it's really hard to imagine close quarters combat. It would look like a joust, basically, albeit one at relative speed where nobody passes within 10,000km of each other. It would start when two ships identify each other from opposite ends of a star system, or from two different points in the system. Then, depending on the quality of their drive systems, they accelerate towards each other or a common objective. At some point, hundreds of thousands or millions of miles away from each other, they enter combat range and launch missiles. The missiles streak across the void between the ships, with multiple volleys being launched before the first one hits. Missiles hit, striking or destroying one or both ships. The ships then shoot past each other at relativistic speed and barring particular angles (like one chasing another) don't fight each other for quite some time. Turing around or slowing down takes as much time as accelerating does in space! Both ships being incapacitated/destroyed will be a common outcome here.

*** Honorverse, a series with accurate space battles

Interestingly, there actually are sci-fi novels that depict space battles fairly accurately. A classic example is the Honorverse novels. Although I consider the Honorverse novels to be a bit of a guilty pleasure, David Weber basically nails how space combat works and actually makes it interesting. Most battles take place at a distance of like 100+ thousand kilometers, and revolve around missiles and anti-missile systems. The science fictiony part of the technology (reactionless drives, FTL travel, etc) have their logical consequences explored so that combat makes sense. For example, missiles are fitted with smaller versions of the reactionless drives that are on space battleships, and are very hard to avoid due to their speed.

The technology is clever. The drive systems of the spaceships have generate force fields, as well as a pair of strong force field plates that can't be placed in front of them, but only "above" and "below" the axis of acceleration. FTL travel is only possible pretty far out, several dozen or perhaps nearly a hundred AU from the star. FTL travel is not instantaneous, and it takes several days to pass between adjacent systems. The same system that provides reactionless in-system acceleration is also an FTL drive and provides "inertial stabilization" allowing the spacecraft to accelerate at hundreds of Gs without destroying the humans or structures inside it.

If you're going to do spacebattles, this seems like the way to do it. If you want to read Honorverse works, I'd start with /Shadow of Saganami/ since that one stands alone and is a personal favorite (and lacks a certain character who gets boring over time).
