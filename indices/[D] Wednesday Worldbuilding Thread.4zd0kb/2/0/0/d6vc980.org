The books never explain how the relationship changed following Voldemort's takeover, I just like the idea of the surviving Aurors looking to Churchill for leadership and resources. The Death Eaters were running wild and killing muggles for the better part of a year, which is something the PM would definitely care about and the Aurors were already trying to stop.

I figure Churchill would just treat the situation as part of the Blitz. He'd only have to attend another meeting or two and allocate some resources to the wizard resistance movement. It would also open up a path for integration between muggles and wizards after the war, which would be necessary for wizard society in the modern age.
