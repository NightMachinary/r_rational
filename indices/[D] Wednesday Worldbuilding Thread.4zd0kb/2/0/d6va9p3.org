In canon, the magic ministry's relation with the Prime Minister is "Hey, we exist, here's a bodyguard. Try no to get killed once our government gets taken over by magical nazis". I could see Churchill being vaguely aware of the magic world, but not actually involved in anything since he already has his hands full with, you know, World War II.
