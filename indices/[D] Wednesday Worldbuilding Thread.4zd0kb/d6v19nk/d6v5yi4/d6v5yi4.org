I suggest that the scary-thing be a Planetary Annihilation Commander.

#+begin_quote
  Criteria:

  1. It must be able to be safely stored in a way that requires no maintenance and will last for ~10,000 years at a minimum (so needs to be proof against earthquakes, solar flares, incidental human activity, etc.).
#+end_quote

This is the premise of Planetary Annihilation: you're a commander that woke up after Progenitors-only-know-how-long.

#+begin_quote

  1. There has to be a reason for it to be made in the first place.
#+end_quote

Why do you /think/ the Progenitors made a sapient war machine capable of conquering a star system or three in a week, and a galaxy inside of a few months? So they could kill the /other/ Progenitors, of course!

  1. There has to be a reason it wasn't just destroyed or ejected into space.
#+end_quote

Pick one of the following:

1. It ran out of things to conquer and engaged Hurry-Up-And-Wait-modeâ„¢, reclaiming all its units and hibernating underground.
2. The Progenitors had one hibernating in storage, but caught SMS ^{{(Surprise} Mortality Syndrome)} before they could reactivate it.
3. The Progenitors were betrayed by their creations. Progenitors and Commander mutually wiped each other out, except for the Commander itself. Badly damaged, the Commander limped into a cavern and went into a repair hibernation. The nanofabricators used all the existing reclaimed mass of the destroyed units, but this only got them halfway. While the Commander slumbered, the minuscule amount of /ex nihilo/ mass and energy produced by the resource core were used to repair its systems. Unfortunately for the Commander (but fortunately for the rest of us), its systems were too damaged to properly set a wake trigger. It is fully repaired, but has continued to sleep.

Facts about commanders:

- They are built out of +Bullshit+Progenitor-grade hypertech alloys. As is everything they build. This means they're hard to kill, but can advance materials science quite a bit.
- They extract arbitrary metals from the ground with specialty structures, and combine them to make the aforementioned hypertech alloys.
- They produce energy using some kind of fusion, annie plant, or zero-point energy. Or maybe some kind of quantum nonsense. Suffice to say it's cheap, efficient, and doesn't seem to need much maintenance.
- They transmit mass and energy between their units (which fab ammo as needed) and structures through a wireless resource network.
- They contain a resource core---a fantastically complex, delicate, and volatile device that produces a wee bit of mass and energy ex nihilo. This is enough to allow a commander to bootstrap an initial base in all sorts of conditions. If sufficiently damaged, it makes a half-decent anti-matter bomb. (Half-decent from the perspective of entities that consider planetoids a valid projectile, mind-you.)
- They have better cyberwarfare than you. The upgrade mechanism in the game is killing the other commander and stealing its tech.
- The first thing a commander typically makes after constructing a metal extractor and a power plant is usually a fabricator. These are bots equipped with nanofab sprayers. They come in such convenient form factors as bot fabricators (walkers, usually quadruped), vehicle fabricators (wheeled or treaded), air fabricators (don't let the name fool you---they're space-capable), and orbital fabricators (these are specifically optimized for orbit, but can work in atmo too). Fabricators can of course make more fabricators.
- Factories are just like fabricators, except stationary, optimized for a specific class of killbot (walkers, vehicles, airborne, or orbital), bigger, and more efficient.
- The two biggest weapons a commander can make are the annihilaser and the halley:

  - The annihilaser is an enormous laser that you mount on a planetoid. You then point it at another planetoid. Your planetoid now functions similarly to a death star.
  - The halley is an engine. It also mounts on a planetoid, usually in several clusters spaced across the surface. It serves the purpose of altering orbits of planetoids. Including orbiting planetoids /into other planetoids/.

In summary, the Progenitors left behind a sleeping BESRMoW---a Brutally Efficient, Self-Replicating Mechanism of War.

TL;DR: There are things scarier than a sleeping BESRMoW. But not many.
