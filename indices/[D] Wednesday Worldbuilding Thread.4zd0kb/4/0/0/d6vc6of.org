  I love the fact that this does not narrow it down in any way. At this point there's what, ten? At least?
#+end_quote

Yep. And a SupCom, and a TA, and one or two ScrinTech from C&C. Love BESRMoW fics.

  Also: does the absence of Starcraft mean you won't get a Queen of Blades?
#+end_quote

Correct. No Queen of Blades, no specs for a QoB. No specs for human-shaped avatars at all, until the SI eats some human DNA. This will be a point of some stress for him, considering that he needs to negotiate with squishy humanoids who are easily scared by swarms of deadly bugs. And also, he misses being human.

  Maybe you can function as the Entity for Taylor when you hit Worm... that would make for a good possible ending.

Well, that's an interesting concept. Might be possible if the SI arrives before she triggers, breaks into her shard's dimension, and hacks it. Or maybe if the SI hacks her existing shard connection after she's triggered, introduces her to the swarm, explains the problems of the setting, and gives her the ability to Administer a swarm on a similar level to a cerebrate?

Hacking the shard would be hard though. Need to go through a setting with dimension-hopping mechanics, study those, capture some parahumans, study their shard connections, refine the ability to hack the shard, then contact Taylor and offer her an upgrade.

Is it ethical to rope Taylor into the war, though? She's arguably already in it, but at the same time she deserves to have less of it if she wants to. Given who Taylor is, though, she probably wouldn't choose not to fight, even if the Zerg!Seylerius can handle things himself, even if it would probably be better for her not to fight. Is it even ethical to /offer/ Taylor more involvement, rather than just showing up and taking everything on himself?

From Zerg!Sey's perspective, giving Taylor control over a local swarm would have the benefit of not needing to create another sapient to hold down the Earth Bet end of the portal back to his hub world (his portals are powered by ugly amounts of psionics; they can be held open by an overlord, but require an overlord and a cerebrate on each end for smooth communication and control of the swarms on each side).
