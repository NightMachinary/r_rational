Okay, folks. This isn't precisely "worldbuilding", but I'm in the early stages of a Zerg Overmind SI multicross, and I'm looking for additional worlds to... optimize.

What's a "Zerg Overmind SI multicross", you ask? It's what happens when the author gets copied by a ROB and dumped into the brain of a Zerg Overmind, then dropped in a fictional setting, and told to keep jumping from world to world, and he might get home eventually. The concept is based on Planetary Annihilation SI multicross fiction, where the author becomes a Planetary Annihilation commander. In either case, the SI is now a BESRMoW. Challenges typically start out more military, but become more socio-political, as the SI gets powerful enough to reliably say "I have the bigger stick" to nations unfamiliar with being outgunned.

My SI has the bonus feature of being a swarm of ugly-but-deadly critters, rather than a swarm of sleek-but-deadly robots. This debuffs his charisma a decent bit. Current world-list:

- Zombie Apocalypse
- Red Alert
- Mass Effect
- Master of Orion
- Dwarf Fortress
- Command & Conquer
- Firefly/Serenity
- Doom
- Warhammer 40K
- Worm

So, anything that you think could benefit from being "optimized" by a deadly swarm of ugly critters?
