  Didn't you see the Zergling in that HotS cutscene? Zerg can into cute.

I can appreciate their cuteness, but not everyone can.

  I'd guess it depends on the extent of the power conferred by the vaguely-defined "psionics".

Regarding hacking her shard, I'm thinking the straightest route there is to follow the dimensional tunnels in the Pollentia and Gemma. Once you've /found/ a shard, hacking it shouldn't be too hard with sufficient bioengineering and psionic might (which an Overmind can be assumed to posess in abundance). Take a bit of practice, though, which is why you'd need to test the process on some captured villains first (I'm looking at you, S9).

  Well, if Zerglings qualify as bugs.. I was just thinking, Taylor would make a good QoB. And it'd match the canonical story.
#+end_quote

Most Zerg would qualify as dumb enough, but they're already being remotely controlled. The trick would be to bridge Taylor's existing psionic potential (along with the control mechanism of the shard) into the psionic network of the swarm.

The real question, though, is /should/ the SI do any of this. Not /can/, as I think we've mostly got that figured out, but is it ethical to offer this kind of power to a lonely teenager? Maybe if butterflies killed off Danny, and thus she didn't have anything to go back to, but I dunno.
