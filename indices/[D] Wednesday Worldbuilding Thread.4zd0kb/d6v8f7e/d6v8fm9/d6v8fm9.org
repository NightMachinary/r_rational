*** What I'm trying to do

I want to /not/ do what David Weber did with Honorverse. He took what we know about physics and derived a pretty realistic style of space combat from that. I want to put together a set of technologies or changes to physics that give us space battles like we see in Master of Orion, or Stellaris, or any of a variety of space fiction depictions. Ideally, I'd like to, from a list of specific technologies (shield generators, FTL, etc) make it so WWII style naval battles are the only real way to fight in space. This is a big challenge, since it's already true that WWII naval battles are not effective, and people always want to be accelerating.

The main problem to address here is engagement range. As long as battles are happening from outside of visual range, they're boring. Star Wars understood this; for some reason all the spacecraft are always right on top of each other. Does this make sense? Maybe not. But it's sweet. I don't want to hand-wave away all that stuff though, I want it to make sense.

So, here is the mix of techs I think will fix the problem of "relativistic missile jousting is the best strat" that realistic space battles face. Please let me know if there are flaws here! I want this to stand up the the scrutiny of power gamers trying to optimize their ship and characters in the setting, so it must at least pass casual inspection.

*Grav Drive: L-FTL and S-FTL*: There are two usages of FTL, both generated by the same "grav drive" technology. L-FTL can be used to travel long distances between star systems, but this can't be done within like 100 AU of a star. S-FTL can be used for in-system travel, but can be interdicted easily by someone who is close, so it is difficult to escape using it. Neither L-FTL nor S-FTL grants you velocity; after the FTL sequence ends (duration higher for longer distances), you're dumped out at low speed. Grav drives are very large and expensive.

*Grav Drive: Inertial Control*: The Grav drive also works as a reactionless drive that converts energy directly into inertia/momentum. It can be used to accelerate or brake (which is just accelerating in another direction). It also allows for artificial gravity inside the ship, so the ship and its inhabitants are always under one earth gravity. The same technology that allows for the bending of space to jump to warp allows for power plant output to be converted directly to a change in speed via some kind of "gravity" technology that isn't fully explained but must be accepted as a premise of the campaign.

*Grav Drive: Interfering Grav Shield*: The Inertial Drive also generates a "gravity bubble" passively around the ship if it's not actively entering or existing an FTL jump. This bubble, called a Grav Shield is very sturdy and prevents almost all weapons from dealing damage. It is significantly weaker if in a deep gravity well (such as on the surface of a planet), or when close to (within 100km of) another Grav Shield. It also produces an S-FTL interdiction effect at this range. One common strategy is for smaller ships to power down their grav drives so they can stay close to the large ships without interference at range (probably inside the larger ship's Grav Shields). Once they close to combat distance with the enemies, the smaller ships power up their own Grav Shields, since interference will be happening anyways.

This doesn't solve the top speed problem like they do in Eve (by giving ships drag/friction in space, ew), but I think it removes most of the need for ships to move at relativistic speeds. To actually defeat an enemy vessel, you need to close the distance between the ships until they are close. Once they are in attack distance the Grav Shields interfere and become weak enough to penetrate. This is easily doable with S-FTL. Once they are at close range, S-FTL is interdicted by the Grav Shield interference, the enemy can't simply warp away every time you engage them in battle. Long range missiles on their own don't work well because outside of very close range, ships shields are hard to destroy. This might create a dynamic where some ships hang back and shoot missiles, while some ships go in to disrupt the shields of the enemy, but this could actually add to the fun.

So, the goal would be to have these be the FTL/gravity/shield tech in the RPG campaign, and to have this tech/magic system promote what we think of as romantic space battles, with fighters and close range combat etc. This particular set of rules that I worked back to starting from a final result of "WWII style naval battles in space" and has gone through a couple iterations of "wow, here's an obvious problem, how do we patch this" which is why it seems a bit patchy and weird. Hopefully it doesn't seem too obvious that the rules are a direct result of trying to reach a traditional spacebattle result.

In any case, is there anything I'm missing here? Obvious flaws in the system? Things that, if exploited by a canny player or reader, would show that the way spacebattles are done doesn't make sense at all? Let me know if you have advice.
