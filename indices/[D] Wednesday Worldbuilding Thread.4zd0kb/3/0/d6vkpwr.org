What do you mean by wingman? I love stargate but my rationality chops leave much to be desired. I'm happy to be a review reader, offer suggestions, point out gaping holes, etc provided I enjoy the story.

What angle are you hoping to take? There's already a very abbreviated rational SG1 on fanfiction somewhere, where the author has chosen several particularly bad episodes and rationalised them, but it's very third wall breaky and a little too comedic to be a "serious take" on rat!SG1 though I really enjoyed it nonetheless.
