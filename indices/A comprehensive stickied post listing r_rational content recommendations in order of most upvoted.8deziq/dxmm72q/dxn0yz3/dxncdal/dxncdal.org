The reason for the removals is because before the monthly threads were introduced, the subreddit was swamped with low-effort posts asking for recs or rational X.

One way to bypass the restriction is to just ask in the weekly Monday or Friday Threads. The mods don't care too much about what's posted as a top-level comment and there's enough visitors/readers who will comment with recs there.
