It's not exactly what you're asking for, but we already have a list of multiple works in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki of the sub]]. That also gives links to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlyrecommendation][Monthly Recommendation Threads]], which often have the best recommendations upvoted to top comments.

But the problem is that the sticky would be tough to keep current or adjust with time. HPMOR might be a hugely popular story, but as it finished up years ago perhaps people would be less likely to upvote it compared to a WIP putting out constant updates like Mother of Learning, A Practical Guide to Evil, or Worth the Candle. Similarly, a comment might be made for a WIP early in its run, but later the story changes drastically; if we only allow one comment for each piece of content, what if the poster never comes back to update?

For what it's worth, I go looking for new content pretty much by following my own recommendations above; the monthly recommendation thread comes first, then scanning current topics in the sub for anything that looks new or interesting, then checking out the sites mentioned in the wiki (as well as topwebfiction.com, which isn't all rational but usually has stuff I still enjoy).
