God, next week my self-imposed "write 50,000 words of my paranormal romance novel in january" challenge starts up, and I am getting MAJOR cold feet. Like major. Can someone please reassure me? My self-soothing like I did last week is not up to snuff.

- I don't want to do this anymore it's so much work

- What will it even accomplish?

- I will be embarrassed to show it to anyone

- Where the hell do I start??

- Do I even like the story I'm gonna write

Like... I know the answers to all of these! I've been excited to write it, my husband says he's excited to read it, my roleplaying partner is on board, I've planned out some plot elements, but... the thought of putting the proverbial pen to paper is terrifying all of a sudden.

I've even told a bunch of people I was going to do it, so I have that commitment device, and I really should get around to setting up a beeminder goal for it. But god, I just... don't want to do it anymore now it's actually on the horizon. Which is stupid because it's something I've wanted to finally do for /literally years/
