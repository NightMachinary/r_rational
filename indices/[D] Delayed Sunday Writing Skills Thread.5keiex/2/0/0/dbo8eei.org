  if you put updates somewhere, I'm sure people here can comment/encourage.

What would updates consist of? "I worked really hard this week"/"I didn't work hard enough how can I get better" or more like "here's a chapter I worked on any pointers?". I'm happy to do either, but I'm loathe to inflict chapters devoid of context onto anyone. But I suppose I'm not holding peoples' eyelids open and forcing them to read it, even if I did do that.
