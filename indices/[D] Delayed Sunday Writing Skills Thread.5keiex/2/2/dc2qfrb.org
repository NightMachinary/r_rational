Hello past MagicWeasel! You've been writing for, well, four days, but here's my advice to you:

- You're going to feel worse. MUCH worse. Like, "why am I bothering I am actually going to quit" worse.

- Then you'll feel better. Lots better. You'll be like, "SEE, I AM MAKING PROGRESS. Oh my god! I've written like 6,000 words! Things are happening!". You'll be proud of how much you've written

- You'll google about ww2 a lot but try not to feel bad about it, you're learning!

- Start wherever, because you'll have written it on poor, "I was up all night on NYE" levels of sleep, and you'll ultimately rewrite it

- Talk to your support system. They love you and will support you and will be a big part of making you feel better.

- You'll still be embarrassed to show it to people, but because you fear criticism about something so personal and so unpolished (the obsessive editing that your shorts get just isn't possible here). But the people who are important to you will be eager to see something you're so passionate about.

- You'll like the story better. You'll realise it's much bigger than you thought (MUCH), and you're going to have to include all that side plot with the vampire hunter. You'll want to ditch the prequel you originally aimed to write and start writing something different. You'll even plan to do so. But then it will seem natural to continue the prequel, so you will. And it will be good.

Anyway, I'm only like four days into it, but I hope that helps you.

Lots of love and support -

Yourself, 10 days from now.
