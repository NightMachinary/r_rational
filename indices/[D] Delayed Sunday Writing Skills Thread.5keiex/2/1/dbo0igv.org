I get a milder version of the same feeling when I'm quarter of the way into a short story. All the plot scenes that seemed so exciting to plan out, now seem like so much work to slog through. Questions to ask yourself: Will writing it give you a sense of satisfaction/accomplishment? If yes, that's a good reason to attempt it. Is it possible to write down the most exciting scenes first? That might keep you motivated.
