Hmm, yeah. I wish your feedback was better, but obviously it's good to get a perspective on how it looks to someone outside-context. I have a tendency to get too tied up in overarching ideas to be able to conceptualize the first impression for a new reader, so I feel like the introductions I write can be tiring and confusing, even if they seem relatively elegant from my position.

I'll see what I can do?
