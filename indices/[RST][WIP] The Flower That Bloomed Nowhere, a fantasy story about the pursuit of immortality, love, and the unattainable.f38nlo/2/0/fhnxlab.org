Thanks for putting the effort in and writing such comprehensive feedback! Lemme try and go over the stuff you seemed critical of point-by-point.

  Format: You almost lost me after Chapter 3. I'm all for time loops as a narrative device, but there's something almost cruel about introducing us to a POV character and then - this is the impression I got, which reading to the current endpoint has only slightly lessened - killing off that character and rolling back to an earlier version. It makes the prologue feel inconsequential, and made me feel like I shouldn't get invested into how events affect characters, because they might not end up having happened. There's a feeling of deja vu later at the end of Chapter 6 that makes me feel like the first few chapters might not end up being inconsequential, but that's a very short moment.

Hmm, it's unfortunate that you went away with that impression. My intention with the first three chapters narratively speaking, alongside the goal of just giving the story a running start and having a platform on which to introduce some basic world-building concepts, is to leave the reader with a question of, "how did we get to this point?" and then to have beats in the story that follows which lead to moments of "/oh,/ now I get it", where it pays off satisfyingly. As well as giving them meat on which to speculate on the mechanics of the time loop itself, since that's part of the hook. I'd hoped the intrigue would be sufficient that it wouldn't come across as pointless for the reader and the beat at the end of Chapter 6 would serve to sufficiently signal that it wasn't meaningless in-universe, either - but I guess not?

You're the third person to have a distinct complaint about the intro chapters just in this thread, now. It's really starting to make me wonder if their inclusion was a bad idea and I ought to cut them.

  Characters: I like the characters. They seem to have decently distinctive voices and personalities from each other. The only thing that bugs me is that there are a whole lot of them introduced in a fairly short span. And a trading card's worth of stats doesn't really suffice to help me get to know them enough that I'm not trying to remember who they are when they show up next. Especially when most of the stats on that card are either incomprehensible at this place in the story (Resistances: AMN) or irrelevant to forming an impression of the character (Blood Type: B-).

Introducing the characters in a short span of time is unavoidable for the type of story it is (a closed circle mystery), unfortunately. My only hope has been to try and make it as painless as possible, though if you had specific ideas on how I could do that better, I'm open to suggestions.

The "trading card" profile sheets are partially an attempt to reach out to the gamelit crowd who likes information presented in a direct way, although you're not the first person to question their inclusion - my hope was that people would see them as fun bits of trivia that would become more relevant later. To tip my hand a bit, I also wanted them to be something that exist in-universe, although that hasn't been brought up yet. They're going to be explained as part of the paperwork that it's mentioned the conclave requires everyone to submit. So the information is specifically the kind of you might give to a resort you're staying at; basic medical information, food tastes and allergies, etc.

  Setting: I like the world-building thus far. And I agree, in principle, with what you're doing here, to let the details of the world-building show themselves through the characters interacting with the world. For my personal taste, though, I'm coming across too many moments where it sounds like a term is important, but it's not mentioned after that (for instance: all characters are named "of [something]," which I assume to be a place-name, and given a Party of Origin, which seems to be a culture, as if these are important to understanding them as a character, but it's usually dropped without explaining what Ikkuret is, or why it's important that someone originates from the Mekhian Party). And, yes, I know it's early for all of that, but the ratio of unexplained novel terms to explained ones is just uncomfortably high for my liking.
#+end_quote

Hmm, this might just have been something I should have explained clearer. The "of <something>" names aren't meant to be super significant to the setting - they're basically just last names in function. You've probably noticed to some extent that the setting has a contrast between ultra ancient, bronze age aesthetics and ultra modern, futuristic ones, and this formatting is meant to evoke that. Last names as we understand them today didn't really come to exist until the Roman era for the vast majority of cultures. I thought a way to reveal this directly would be to have the class director use Utsushikome's functionally as a last name in chapters 8 and 9, but I guess not.

As for Parties of Origin, they actually refer primarily to ethnicity before culture, (for example, Ptolema has a Greek/Inotian name despite her party not being that) although this is a simplified explanation and it will be discussed more comprehensively in a few chapters from now. I tried to convey some of this with the discussion in Chapter 7, when they talk about how the different parties are groups that migrated together from the old world together and established the original societies, although I guess that must also have been too vague.

Do you have a suggestion on how either of these could be improved to help people get it sooner?
