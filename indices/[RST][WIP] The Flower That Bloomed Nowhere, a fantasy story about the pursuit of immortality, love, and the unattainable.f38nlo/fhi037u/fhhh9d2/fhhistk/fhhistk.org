Pfft, I actually wasn't totally sure about it either.

To be honest, I was a bit indulgent with the tags in wanting to attract readers. A lot of the royalroad tags seem to assume you're writing a very trope-y type of story, and aren't really built for things that stray from that. Like, this story is centered around a college-age class. Should that be school life? Is strategy just fighting battles, or trying to navigate complex situations against opponents...?

The main character is kind of a byronic hero in that she's a selfish, depressed screw-up with a questionable value system, and a lot of the story is going to ponder the question of if she's legitimately a bad person, but she can also be heroic and kind, too. There's no real tag to represent that, so I guess I just used it to kind of mean "not a conventionally good protagonist".
