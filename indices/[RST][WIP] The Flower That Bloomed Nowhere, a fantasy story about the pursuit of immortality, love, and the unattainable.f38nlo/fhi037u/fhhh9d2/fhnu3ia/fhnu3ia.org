Here goes.

1. Narration: I really like the narrative style. Both of them, actually. The introduction is a self-aware pastiche of pretentious narration, and, as such, it only gets better when the narrators call each other out on it. I'm not sure the style fits in with the rest of the story (the FP-POV sections are a lot more serious than what I'd expect given the introductory tone), but, given the protagonist's compulsion to joke about serious subjects, that may be intentional. And the first-person narration really sells the character's depression and anxiety.
2. Format: You almost lost me after Chapter 3. I'm all for time loops as a narrative device, but there's something almost cruel about introducing us to a POV character and then - this is the impression I got, which reading to the current endpoint has only slightly lessened - killing off that character and rolling back to an earlier version. It makes the prologue feel inconsequential, and made me feel like I shouldn't get invested into how events affect characters, because they might not end up having happened. There's a feeling of /deja vu/ later at the end of Chapter 6 that makes me feel like the first few chapters /might/ not end up being inconsequential, but that's a very short moment.
3. Characters: I like the characters. They seem to have decently distinctive voices and personalities from each other. The only thing that bugs me is that there are a whole lot of them introduced in a fairly short span. And a trading card's worth of stats doesn't really suffice to help me get to know them enough that I'm not trying to remember who they are when they show up next. Especially when most of the stats on that card are either incomprehensible at this place in the story (Resistances: AMN) or irrelevant to forming an impression of the character (Blood Type: B-).
4. Plot: Too early to form a coherent impression.
5. Themes: I have high hopes for this, based on how you explored a variety of different answers to the "What do you think about immortality?" question. It looks like you've really thought the question through, which bodes well for how that is going to come through in the conflicts of the plot.
6. Setting: I like the world-building thus far. And I agree, in principle, with what you're doing here, to let the details of the world-building show themselves through the characters interacting with the world. For my personal taste, though, I'm coming across too many moments where it sounds like a term is important, but it's not mentioned after that (for instance: all characters are named "of [something]," which I assume to be a place-name, and given a Party of Origin, which seems to be a culture, as if these are important to understanding them as a character, but it's usually dropped without explaining what Ikkuret is, or why it's important that someone originates from the Mekhian Party). And, yes, I know it's early for all of that, but the ratio of unexplained novel terms to explained ones is just uncomfortably high for my liking.

But overall, I enjoyed it, after I got past that hurdle at the start of Chapter 4.
