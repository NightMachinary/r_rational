  Even what you had at the end of Chapter 6 might be fine; the problem is, a reader, turned off by the sudden erasure of the events they'd just experienced with a character, might not make it that far.

I'll give this some thought. I do think it's a matter of taste to some extent, but so many people seem put off by either the content of the "prologue chapters" or their relation to the rest of the story, that I do feel kind of skeptical about them and how I can make them work now.

  I think it's just a matter of proportion. Spending so much time with Su and Ran makes the introduction of the other characters feel rushed in comparison.

That's true. Though, I thought Kamrusepa got a pretty good introduction.

  "Extra meat, please" gives a sense of character that none of the rest of items on the cards do. Enough so that I remembered specifically that was on Ptolema's card, whereas I have no memory of who has the nut allergy or the lactose intolerance.

I guess I didn't intend for the cards to be instantly explanatory, so much as something people would later reference back to as context built over the course of the story. Though I did try to slip a bit of character building in there: with Ptolema, I wanted the joke to be that she didn't quite get what they were asking for when filling out her dietary requirement. I tried for something similar with Lilith, where she has a ridiculously long list of things she won't eat.

  Likewise, what I can infer from everyone, of multiple ethnicities and presumably cultures, having the same naming convention of "[Person] of [City]," is that the city someone is from carries some social importance. And yet what importance that carries hasn't come up yet.

Hmm, this is actually a creative decision I regret a little bit - originally I was going to have different last name themes for each of the different cultures based on the bronze age civilization counterpart upon with they were loosely based. Mekhians were going to have title-nicknames, Rhunbardic characters patronymics, Inotian characters "of" titles, Ysarans complex forenames that integrated their last name and titles into one word in the vein of Sumerian cultures, and Saoic and Viraaki characters more conventional last names. I eventually did away with this because the result ended up being a lot of ancient-y sounding stuff that I figured would be indistinguishable to the average reader anyway, in favor of something more universal and evocative of the disparity in setting, but you have me doubting it now.

To be clear about one thing, the "of" titles don't even per-se represent where the characters are from anymore - like what happened in real history, their meaning has degraded over time to the point that children often just inherit them from their parents, like with Lilith. With the exception of Ophelia, they're basically just last names, though I could probably stand to make that clearer.

I do agree that I could be doing more to emphasize the characters cultures and make them distinct. I've been trying to drip that in rather than just have it be really blunt, but it's ended up barely coming up at all, probably because it's difficult to digress to the main character talking about how a character relates to the qualities of their home culture and ethnicity - especially in the case of someone like Ptolema, who is Viraaki only in regard to her ethnicity and has little connection to it other than skin colour.

But then, the setting /is/ meant to be really cosmopolitan and enlightened, so maybe it's appropriate? I dunno.

I appreciate your feedback, anyway.
