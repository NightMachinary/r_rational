"Like me, he wore glasses, but he was short rather than far-sighted, so right now they were tucked away in one of his front pockets."

I think you have short and farsighted backwards here? People that only sometimes wear their glasses usually are usually far-sighted, that is they have trouble seeing close up, like when reading. Where as most people who are nearsighted wear their glasses almost all the time.

(This is basicly because the two conditions are not actually symmetric. Myopia is a systematic distortion of the eye relative to the focal point of the lense+cornea system. Where as people who have trouble seeing close up usually have lenses too stiff for their eye muscles to adjust. So the first is treated with a continual treatment, and the second with a 'as needed')

And you probably know all this and just made a typo.
