Thanks for catching those typos! I'll fix them in a little bit.

I'm glad you're enjoying the story - and yeah, you do seem to have grasped the premise of Su's character, though it's a bit more complex than that. And it good to hear some positive feedback on the first three chapters, regardless of what I end up doing.
