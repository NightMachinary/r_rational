This is pretty interesting and I look forward to seeing where it goes. I'm really interested in the protagonist who, if I'm reading it right, is a depressed person in a society where people live a long time and may eventually attain immortality. This is an interesting concept to me.

Regarding your comment on the latest chapter,

#+begin_quote
  What do you think of the first three chapters, in the context of the rest of the story? I'm considering cutting them and sprinkling the exposition through other currents, instead, since I get so much negative feedback abou them relative to the rest.
#+end_quote

Generally, I - personally - am not a big fan of "action prologues." I wasn't nearly as engaged through the first 3 chapters as I was starting in the fourth, but I wouldn't say I got nothing out of them. These 3 chapters suggest something bizarre and metaphysical is going on that makes me want to know more. I probably would have enjoyed the section more if it had been shorter.

BTW, I really liked this line:

#+begin_quote
  I didn't recognize any of the faces, so they must have been wealthy
#+end_quote

It seems backwards and really makes you do a double-take and wonder, /what could that possibly mean?/ It's a great way to hint at a unique setting concept that you'll develop further later.

Also a couple of typos:

- You say "me and Ran" rather than "Ran and I" a few times (e.g., chapter 6). I noticed the construct pop up a few times.

- "the Ptolema's of the world" (chapter 8) There doesn't need to be an apostrophe. It's not possessive.

Keep up the good work!
