Ah, thank you so much for the compliments! I'm really glad you've been enjoying it.

Yeah, I'm really uncertain about the first 3 chapters. I mentioned this in the post to the other guy, but I wrote them primarily because my friends thought the first draft, which lacked that opener, was too slow and didn't give a good taste of the kind of drama and action the main story will eventually build toward, which would subsequently put off the majority of web serial readers who like those things. However, instead, it seems like most of the complaints I get are about them being confusing and overwhelming.

I think the reason the writing is probably bloated in the way that you describe is that I have trouble nailing pacing for first person narration when there isn't any dialogue between characters, and end up overcompensating. Do you think it's something that could be fixed by just cutting out some lines, or does the whole thing need a rework to make it less strange and intimidating?
