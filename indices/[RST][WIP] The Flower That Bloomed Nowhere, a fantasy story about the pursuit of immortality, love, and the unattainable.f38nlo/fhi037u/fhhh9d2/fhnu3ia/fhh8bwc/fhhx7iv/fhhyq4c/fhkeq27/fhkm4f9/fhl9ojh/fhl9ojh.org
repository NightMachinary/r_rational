I think the fact the opener throws you right in the mix and doesn't spoon-feed the reader is a valid stylistic choice. It's going to polarise readers but I personally tend to enjoy such openings. Given the general progression of the story, it's density and the more traditional published fantasy pacing, I think an opening that asks for some patience and implies later rather than immediate pay-off is selecting for the right sort of readers.

I think the first three chapters can be “fixed” through the removal of lines and superfluous words and adjectives on the sentence level to tighten it up. I don't want to imply the opening is a mess or anything, for the record, it was certainly readable :)
