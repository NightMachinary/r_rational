I already have it in my read later list haha, I must have come across it while browsing and tagged it instead of reading cause it was too short, I try not to read much that has less than 200-300 pages, for the same reason as you said, starting serving and enjoying it only for it to never really begin is painful.

I'll give your story a read soon! The only feedback I can give immediately is to wonder if the Anti-hero Lead tag is accurate, it is incredibly overused, being used on any lead character that is perfectly heroic or just mildly amoral, which just isn't what an Anti-hero is in my head.
