Thank you for your thoughts and reply!

The frustration can probably be safely treated as a measurement artifact--I happened to be in a coincidental situation of "Hmm, I have just enough time to read one chapter, and as it happens feedback is particularly desired for the first chapter. Let's do an in-depth feedback giving for this one chapter. Ooo, and there are immediately interesting questions I'd like to learn more about. [...] ...And now I have to stop, and I'm only more confused and with only more questions and having learned nothing! Nooo!" The time-constraint 'have to stop (for now)' is atypical and hypothesisable as the main source of the frustration at that point.

In terms of narration style, indeed I feel it's reasonable to treat it as a matter of taste. As long as it's a way that you're aware you're writing rather than done unintentionally (/without wanting to), I'm happy for you to able to write as you prefer!

Jumping around (following my thoughts) a bit, do the details of the man and woman also change? If so, then no helping it, and I'm surprised and curious. If not, then my preference for how we get used to them as people may still apply.

From my perspective the dispassionate nature could be inextricable from your preferred writing style, but I can try to think of how it could be done differently.

When reviewing, something I think I missed earlier (grammar)--'like ugly beast from a vulgar and foreboding crevice of my mind' -> 'like an ugly beast from a vulgar and foreboding crevice of my mind'.

Using that phrase as an example, the impression I got was that the speaker was having fun with the imagery of a beast coming out of a crevice, rather than focusing on or reliving any of the fear or horror of the moment itself.

Hm. I hesitate to try to write alternative-style versions of anything you've written, but perhaps I can portray taken-to-extremes different versions of an imagined scene, contrasted different ways it could be written.

'"No! Don't leave me!" I yelled as his breathing grew fainter, my alabaster hands wet with his blood which was the colour of the 'Nonstop Rose' begonia cultivar, while my tears dripped down like perfect crystal diamonds cut by a master craftsmen.'

Ver2:

'I can't remember what I said. I begged, I pleaded, I yelled at him to stop, to stay with me, and I tried to keep pressure on the wound but it kept coming, more blood, too much blood, more and more and more horrible red blood no matter what I did and he just-- I couldn't--

It was about 9 o'clock when I left the room and began the daily check of the barricades, some time later. Maybe I threw up at some point, but all those memories blur together and hurt to even think about. I didn't see, later, because after I'd checked and re-barricaded all the night's damage the last door I barricaded was his. I think I had thrown up, in there, because before I could do it I stood against the door for a long time, forehead against the cool wood, trying to make myself turn the handle and dry-heaving over and over again. I'd--we'd both had a large breakfast, so it had to have come out of me already sometime in there. In the end, I just left it closed and sealed it up with him inside.'
