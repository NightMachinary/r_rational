Feedback (written as I read through the first chapter, my impressions entirely subjective):

In the synopsis, the phrase 'time loop mystery' is a nice hook, snagging my interest/curiosity and ensuring that I start the text itself. If anything, I might even recommend that line to go at the start of the synopsis, to snag attention first and then start delivering the premise which then feeds into the context of it being a time loop mystery, rather than the mind going back and reevaluating the premise in the context of the new framing.

Starting impression, evidently intentional: /So bewildered./ No meaningful hypothesis possible yet, moving on.

'aside from window' -> 'aside from the window'\\
'two doors, one on' -> 'two doors, one each on'\\
' more negotiable concepts then they are' -> ' more negotiable concepts than they are'\\
' A simple way to put would' -> ' A simple way to put it would'

Maybe because I'm thinking closely about what's going on, but I'm finding myself bogged down in the descriptions. Maybe it can't be helped if there are clues hidden in the room details, but I might prefer more meat (content) and less descriptions-of-the-participants initially, then filling in some details later (maybe one by one, at different times, at times of individual focus?) once we know and care more about these individuals (and become more curious about their characteristics?), spaced/spread out enough that they don't become burdensome. As it is, I find myself trying to visualise and memorise these appearances with nothing associative to connect them to, rather than filling in or otherwise-updating mental images which have already formed for remembered minds.

For the old/new metaphor, just a single detail for each might have been enough, which is also easier to keep in mind as a starting anchor to associate with them.

'the fact that the fact' -> 'the fact that', probably. The comma after 'culture' in that paragraph also feels wrong, though I'm less clear about what could be satisfyingly done about it.

Though easier to process now, I'm still getting an impression of the writing being abnormally slanted towards /descriptions/--here, as though the character is mentally describing the sensations they are feeling, or even making an effort to describe them eloquently to the reader with simile, as though a poet were writing down their memoirs after the fact. Different, for example, from an impression of watching over an individual's shoulder and actually seeing what they're thinking in the moment. Hmm, or like a brought-into-custody person thinking back to and recounting everything they felt--with simile--to a police officer in an interrogation room who's writing down everything.

Hmm, 'ugly beast' as an example, I feel as though the character is using more thought to have fun with visualising their own fears than they are on the fears themselves.

I feel curious about the 'AM(N)', looking forward to when that will become understood.

Continuing, a deepening impression of this-is-being-calmly-recited-after-the-fact, leaving me detached from the goings-on. I'm starting to expect the view to switch, as the person this is being described to says something and we see (even for a moment) what's happening in the present instead.

I find myself rather curious about whether the bookmark is in the same place or not...

'open it's insipid' -> 'open its insipid'

'My mind felt was wracked with uncertainty' -> 'felt' or 'was', not both.

The last paragraph is similarly dispassionate. I've put my finger on another way that this 'fits'--this whole first-person section sounds much more normal to me if I imagine it all in third-person, narrated about the emotional character rather than the character emotionlessly narrating in the first-person past how emotional the character was.

Deliberately pausing at the end of the first chapter--besides which, I'm out of time for today--I mainly feel exasperation and some frustration. There is mystery/questions, but while I was drawn in by curiosity, all I've found is (more) ignorance.

For the moment, I have to go. I hope this feedback offers food for thought!
