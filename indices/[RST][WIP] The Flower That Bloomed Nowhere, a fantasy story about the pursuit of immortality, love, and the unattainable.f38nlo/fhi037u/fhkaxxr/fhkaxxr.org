Alright, I thought about your feedback a little more. I hope you don't mind me replying twice here - I thought it might slip by you if I just made an edit.

First of all, thanks a lot for catching those typos. I said this before already, but I don't have an editor, and a fair few end up slipping me. It feels very embarrassing when I finally spot them months after I've already published.

I think you absolutely have a point about the start being bewildering, and the early descriptive work being a bit too heavy. To tip my hand a bit, the reason for the intense description of the room is because, when the location comes up again much later, certain details are different and this is important to the story. It's also meant to evoke a stage-directiony quality, which is kind of a motif for the narrative; every arc opens in a similar fashion. Though that's just the creative justification for it. If it's off-putting to a lot of people, it might be better to do away with it anyway?

However, if you dislike the density and level of characterization from the first-person perspective, that might be a bigger problem. It's especially prominent in the first 3 chapters - which are kind of the "prologue arc" - but remains present throughout, and is kind of a stylistic choice on my part. I like first person narration with a lot of character, where it feels like someone is telling about something that happened rather than just being a vehicle for the audience perspective. So it might just be a question of taste in that respect, though if anyone else is reading this, please share your opinion.

That being said, I didn't want it to come come across as being narrated /dispassionately,/ so that's a bit of a letdown, and I'm not quite sure how to fix it? I'd tried to keep some parts sharp enough for people to get caught up in the moment.

Finally, was there any reason you left the chapter feeling frustrated? I recognize that a lot of stuff is unclear, but I also try to slowly drip out context and it /is/ just the first chapter. Is the amount of what-is-going-on feelings just too much? Because the whole first 3 chapters are kind of like that before it drops to a something simpler and less mysterious; they originally didn't exist, but I got feedback from friends that the story was too dull to engage them if they started at that point. If you like, you can try skipping a bit to Chapter 4 to see the disparity.
