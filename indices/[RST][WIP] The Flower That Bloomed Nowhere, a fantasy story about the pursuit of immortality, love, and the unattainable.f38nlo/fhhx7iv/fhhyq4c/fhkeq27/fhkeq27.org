I caught up on the story and it was really enjoyable so far. I think the first three chapters, when in Su's perspective, try a little too hard to emphasise how she's feeling (felt like some adjective overload at points) and over-describes the surroundings, sometimes at junctures where Su would be realistically more focused on other things (and the reader's attention wants to be focused on other things).

Chapter 4 onwards though it feels like this completely disappears and the writing really shines; far more than your average popular web serial imo. The characters have distinct and interesting voices, the dialogue flows, the introspection, observation and philosophising is all quality and well integrated, as is the world building which is really interesting in its own right.

Thanks for writing this, I'll definitely be following along.
