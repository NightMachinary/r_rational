Oh, sorry, I didn't see your two replies! I haven't been on Reddit for a couple days.

I'll just reply to both here. I didn't think your commentary was grumpy - it's interesting. I'm sorry you don't find that layer of the story interesting, but it won't be the focus for the majority of the time or anything, so hopefully it won't you too much.

I can understand Su's character voice coming across as a bit masculine, since I feel like people don't tend to write women characters with her specific kind of analytical, dour tone, and I'm glad you're paying close attention to the details! I always try to reward stuff like that, or at least I would if I didn't end up writing unpopular stuff and now being able to hold people's interest. This one seems different so far, at least!

Regarding the glasses thing, I think I might've got muddled there, I'm not certain. I'll check my notes later.
