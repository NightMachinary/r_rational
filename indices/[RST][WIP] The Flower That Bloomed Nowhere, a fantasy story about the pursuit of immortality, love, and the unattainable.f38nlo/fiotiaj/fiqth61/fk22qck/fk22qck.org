Okay typos and thoughts on the first chapter. (I'm in a grumpy mood so this will be fairly harsh, probably. Take it with a large grain of salt.)

s/House or Resurrection/House of Resurrection/

Hmm. We seem to be reusing some of the outermost framing devices from the other story, not the exact characters, but the premise is definitely related. I note a sense of disappointment on my part. That layer was the least interesting to me in the last work. Though it was also the least developed, so I am hopeful.

Lots of world-building terms thrown at us. I like it. I get a strong vibe of an elegant sort of steampunk without the steam or the punk. >.< That's maybe not the best description. It's intriguing. As is the info we get on the MC, both the information and the format. Occasionally I get these strong gender impressions for odd reasons, and I got a sense of male from her internal narration. This is almost certainly just idiosyncratic prejudices on my part and not something you should worry about, but it did throw me.

The MC sounds a lot like who I unconsciously wish/think I am. When I am in actuality a bit different. But that's neither here or there. Still, I like the strong sense I get of their personality from their self-description.

Knowing your writing "It was a pretty trashy adventure novel I'd picked up a few days ago, about a military ship overtaken in a mutiny." immediately stands out to me as foreshadowing, it also seems somewhat at odds with the MC's personality so far, not jarringly so but enough that it feels noteworthy, so I think I would remember it even if I hadn't read your previous work.
