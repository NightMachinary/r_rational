  leave the reader with a question of, "how did we get to this point?"
#+end_quote

And that worked pretty well, right up until the reset. Starting a story /in media res/ is pretty difficult to pull off under the best of circumstances, and you were doing it pretty well, but having your prologue take place both before /and/ after the events of the rewound chapter might be too much of an ask, if you want it to have weight.

Or it might be that you could entirely fix it by putting something near the top of Chapter 4 (Waking from a nightmare? An unexplained feeling of horror, quickly quashed? A moment of disorientation, as if she had thought she was somewhere else?) to indicate that the prologue wasn't all inconsequential. Even what you had at the end of Chapter 6 might be fine; the problem is, a reader, turned off by the sudden erasure of the events they'd just experienced with a character, might not make it that far.

  if you had specific ideas on how I could do that better, I'm open to suggestions.
#+end_quote

I think it's just a matter of proportion. Spending so much time with Su and Ran makes the introduction of the other characters feel rushed in comparison.

  The "trading card" profile sheets are partially an attempt to reach out to the gamelit crowd who likes information presented in a direct way,
#+end_quote

I don't take issue with the directly-presented information, really; it gives the first-person portion of the narrative almost a comic-book feel, to contrast the very formal descriptions of the setting that lead off Chapters 1 and 4. My only issue with them is that none of the information on the card is immediately memorable and/or useful to distinguish the characters, with one notable exception: Ptolema's dietary notes.

"Extra meat, please" gives a sense of character that none of the rest of items on the cards do. Enough so that I remembered specifically that was on Ptolema's card, whereas I have no memory of who has the nut allergy or the lactose intolerance.

  The "of <something>" names aren't meant to be super significant to the setting - they're basically just last names in function.
#+end_quote

I suppose it's just weird to me that there's only one naming tradition. Just in English, surnames can be based on the name of an ancestor (Johnson), or their profession (Smith), or where they lived (Milton), or some other distinguishing characteristic (Strong). They carry information about family, ethnic heritage, and social standing. And you can infer all sorts of things about Anglophone culture by those details.

Likewise, what I can infer from /everyone/, of multiple ethnicities and presumably cultures, having the /same/ naming convention of "[Person] of [City]," is that the city someone is from carries some social importance. And yet what importance that carries hasn't come up yet.

#+begin_quote
  I tried to convey some of this with the discussion in Chapter 7, when they talk about how the different parties are groups that migrated together from the old world together and established the original societies, although I guess that must also have been too vague.
#+end_quote

I may have just missed it.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have a suggestion on how either of these could be improved to help people get it sooner?
#+end_quote

Especially in a first person narrative, things that come across as unimportant to your protagonist come across as unimportant to the reader. I'm not saying to make Su horribly racist in stereotyping her friends, but stereotypes do exist for a reason: they're a convenient starting place for getting to know people. So, for Ptolema, for example: what would you expect the stereotypical Viraki girl of her age to be like? How is she different from that stereotype, and why? Ditto for the stereotypical girl from Rheeds. That will allow you to bring your world-building notes across in a way that both informs us about how your protagonist sees the world and its various peoples, as well as telling us about how your secondary characters were shaped by the cultures they came from (which would also help make them more distinct and memorable as well).

Remember that this is all just based on my personal impression. I'm only offering advice because you asked for it; if the stuff I've suggested doesn't fit with the story you want to write, or your style of writing, certainly ignore it. Don't write to anyone's expectations but your own.
