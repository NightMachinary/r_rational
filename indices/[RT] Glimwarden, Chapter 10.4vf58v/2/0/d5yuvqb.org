  I feel sorry for William. He is kind of an entitled asshole, but wow, Melanie is cruel to him.

What? How was she cruel to him? He wasn't just "entitled," he literally walked into her place of work and said she would make a fool of herself.

All she did was use his own words to question the consistency of his beliefs or motives. She was far more civil than she could have been in response.

It's bizarre to have that characterized as "cruel." What would you have done in her place?
