Damn you Shaun! You always ruin everything! That's why no one likes you!

- I feel sorry for William. He is kind of an entitled asshole, but wow, Melanie is cruel to him.

- Is it me or did Philip try to shake Sander off by dropping him into Melanie's lap? I can sort of see them keep doing that to each other in the long term, actually.

- It wasn't really flying, it was just falling with... it was just falling.

- Sander realized that almost getting transformed into horribly crushed body parts of Sander right after leaving the hospital may not impress Melanie! Keep it up, and maybe you'll internalize "Almost dying is very bad and I should avoid it" at some point!

- "I was young and naive". Yeah, I know this feeling. I also know the feeling of looking back to my past self who said "I was young and naive, but now I'm wise and sensible", which was incredibly naive of him. So now to be safe I try to feel naive all the time. Sander might want to do that too.

- It dawns on me that we still don't know what Sander thinks about Melanie. He didn't think about her in any of his viewpoint chapters. I'd be really interested in getting his opinion on her, actually. The others have described him as oblivious to her disposition, but that might not be true given his "notice things, but don't pay attention to them" tendencies so far.

- "So once you were in the air, you teleported straight down?" "Wel, um, yes! That is a very smart non-dangerous thing and it, um, it is exactly what I did."

- Did Philip forget to tell the council about the destruction of Langust, and the coming refugees? What the hell, Philip?

- It seems that Philip is trying to blame Gossom for some of the refugees' condition. Not sure what's his game here.
