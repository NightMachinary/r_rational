Well, realistically, it could happen. For instance, Gavin Masters could, after a long decade of life-changing adventures, learning Important Life Lessons, making True Friends, decide to come back to his daughter and apologize for leaving her (then leave again, because Light's Hollow sucks and everybody there is a jerk anyway). Or he could have died three years ago in a traveling lantern failure.
