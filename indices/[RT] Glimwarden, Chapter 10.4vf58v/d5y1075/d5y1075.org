I predict that the man in the red armor is not a spirit.

If that's the case, then why is his voice described as sounding "off in a subtly unpleasant way?"

Does he have a verbal tick? Is he some kind of darkling-human hybrid? Does he have a Russian accent?

All of these guesses are technically possible, and I look forward to finding out more in future chapters.
