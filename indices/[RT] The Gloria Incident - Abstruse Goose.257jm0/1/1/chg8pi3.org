Knowing the cause and reasons behind a pleasant experience doesn't diminish the pleasure, it only removes the imagined portion of that experience. If you are speeding down the road and feel a sense of acceleration, knowing what causes that feeling doesn't remove it from your feelings, but only removes a sense of wonder and any fantastical theories you may have about that feeling. There exist actual wonders of the world and if you want to experience them you have to actually make an effort.
