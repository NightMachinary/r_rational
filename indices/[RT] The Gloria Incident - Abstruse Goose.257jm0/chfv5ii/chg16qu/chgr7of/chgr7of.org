I'd add [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hp/feeling_rational/][/Feeling Rational/]] and note that things which help for me include acts of creation (anything from software to sculpture to a stranger's smile), gaining an understanding of something, spending time with people close to me, and going outside and deliberately /appreciating/ the world. It'll probably be different for anyone else, but the main thing is to give yourself permission to feel /and/ to deliberately influence what you're feeling. Remember: a stupid thing that works, isn't stupid.
