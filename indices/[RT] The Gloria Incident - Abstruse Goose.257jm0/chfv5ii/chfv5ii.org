I always prefer the brutal truth to a pleasant lie.

Nevertheless, I feel a sense of loss when I experience what this comic represents; the real world feels smaller, somehow, than the fantasy world the original idea provides.

It is in these moments that I most understand the pull of religion, of superstition, of irrational and comforting lies.

I wonder if anyone here feels as I do, and if there is a particular method you follow to help with that sense of loss. It tends to take me a while to recover that sense of wonder and beauty that the real world can, at other times, so easily provide.
