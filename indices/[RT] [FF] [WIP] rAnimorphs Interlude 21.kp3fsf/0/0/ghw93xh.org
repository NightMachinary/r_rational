Since my other reply may have been overly oblique - this is a brilliant synthesis and is now absolutely what I expect TK17's been leading up to. I'll add that I think that the reason that multiple times everything the protagonists have done has seemingly been obviated (all of Ventura, acquisition of the local yeerk fleet) is that the contest has come in multiple "Rounds", and the board is reset after each one's conclusion. What you describe may be the championship round.
