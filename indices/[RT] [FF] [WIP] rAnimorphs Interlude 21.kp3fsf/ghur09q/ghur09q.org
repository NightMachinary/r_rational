Yeerks have the right idea. To quote the skin tag, "leave the factory, leave the factory, leave the factory..."

Remember this line from earlier: “Yes. It had been the Howlers' /first/ move, as it turned out---they'd seeded the atmosphere with a plague that took weeks to incubate. The rest of it---the burning, the killing, the torture---that was just because they liked it.”

Everyone who was on earth at the start of the attack is almost certainly infected. A military victory might occur, but is likely not the point of the Elimist and Crayak's game. My guess is that all this is just to set the table for the final dilemma, which is that Jake has Quatazhinnikon's work and Visser 3 has the martian biolab, and synthesizing a cure would take both of these. The entities are interested in a scorpion/frog/river situation between those two.
