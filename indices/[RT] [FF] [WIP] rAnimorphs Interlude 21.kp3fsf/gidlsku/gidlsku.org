So the Yeerk fleet is planning to leave. It is somewhat sensible given the overwhelming nature of the enemy. But they could maybe also take into account the fact that this is only the start. A fleet like this is going to burn it's way across all the local worlds, Yeerk, Andalite and Neutral worlds will all die the same to the Howlers. They should be figuring out what they need to do to fight back, even if not here than somewhere.

Also they think the way out is clear, but they only know it's clear on this end, the Howlers might have mined the exit of the Z-space bridge. Bottlenecks in space are quite rare after all, the chances to kill prey by mining them is a very rare opportunity that I think some of the howlers/some fraction of the howler over mind would take advantage of. It would also be a convenient way for the story to keep the Yeerk fleet in system. They can still leave vial the slow route, but then they probably end up coming out in real space to all their planets already dead. Months of time is too long to be cut off from the universe.

Well, if you want to influence events. On the other hand a few months stuck in a Z-space slow time bubble might be perfect if you just want the Howlers to move on to the next region of space without noticing you.
