This is more young-adult/urban-fantasy, but it's written by a rationalist and the characters make clever use of the resources they have available.

It's not the kind of thing that typically gets posted here, I know luminosity wasn't very popular, but I quite enjoyed them back when they were first published, which was shortly after the first CFAR workshops.

They had disappeared from the internet, so this is me getting it back on the internet in case anyone else goes looking for it.
