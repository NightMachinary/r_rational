Those are all pretty fair responses. I guess I'm just so used to rational fiction driving toward some sort of world-optimization plotline that "hero stockpiling millions of dollars" raised some red flags when really it's just "hero needs to make a living, and the going rate for his powers is in the millions of dollars".

However, if he has no particularly pressing need for money, I'm confused why he's working so closely with the FBI. He seems to expect that they (or the CIA, or some other agency) would either lock him up for the rest of his life (perhaps in a very comfortable prison that looked an awful lot like a mansion in the best case) or assassinate him if the full nature of his power were disclosed. Given that fear it seems almost suicidally dangerous to be interacting with the FBI and other law enforcement bodies on a regular basis.

If he's just trying to hide, then why not register as a super with a limited version of his power - Viewing up to 10 minutes into the past in a 100 meter radius around him or something? I went back to Ch. 5 where it's discussed that Paris is also secret and unregistered, but there's not much discussion of why a person would prefer to be unregistered and risk the punishment for being such. Are supers drafted into service if their powers are deemed exceptionally useful, or do registration stations have a method of determining the full extent of someone's powers?

Maybe I'm not communicating it well but it's just that the full scope of Hector's motivations don't quite seem to add up to me - he's playing a dangerous game by supporting law enforcement with his powers, and if he's not exceptionally motivated by money or else /extremely/ good at maintaining his cover so that the risk is low, I don't see what's motivating him to do so.
