The comments are greatly appreciated. Most of them I feel like I should let ride and just keep in mind as I continue writing.

But I will make one point - I am absolutely not deliberately hiding things that Hector knows from the reader (other than what exactly Doc Stevens did, which is not intended to be a plot relevant reveal in the story but I do want it to have some impact on the reader when it comes up).

My intent has been to give the reader Hector's full perspective as much as I can while still advancing the story. Some stuff hasn't come up yet - some of Hector's other friends, some of his personal history. But I'm introducing these things when they come up, not hiding the ball. At least not on purpose.

Hector does not have some secret reason he needs money; he supports some charities in Detroit (which has not been brought up directly before, mentioned once offhand by May) and pays dangerous people for expensive things (primarily the Doc). You're correct that he has money built up. Again I intend that to be understood by the reader and not a hidden mystery.

I also don't intend there to be any mystery to Hector's paranoia. It is /my/ conclusion that, since Hector's actual power reflects a secrecy leak that is impossible to plug, disguising it is the only way he can expect to remain a free man. Hector has reached the same conclusion. I thought I conveyed that in the text and there honestly isn't more to it than that.

To the extent these points seem either unreasonable or unclear, I would love to hear more. And thanks again for the critique!

Also if I'm saying more than an author should while still writing, please let me know that too.
