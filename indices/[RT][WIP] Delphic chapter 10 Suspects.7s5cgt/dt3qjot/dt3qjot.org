Still really enjoying the story. A few comments:

- Delphic seems to make too many mistakes like the Tran vs. train slip up for his cover as an AI living in the internet to hold up. There's a certain hand-wavy threshold where I'm willing to believe that the FBI, CIA, etc. approach it as "there are way too many suspicious supers to investigate them all, and Delphic's useful so let's see-no-evil, hear-no-evil on the unregistered super who uses methods 'not legally available' to law enforcement", but things like that push the envelope. Of course, there's the plot with the probably CIA plant moving onto his street, so maybe his ID /has/ been compromised.
- What exactly is Delphic's game here? Peregrine characterizes $5M as more than he makes in a month, but based on the previously stated amounts of his bounties, Delphic is probably pulling in ~$5M-$10M a year. What's he doing with it? Even with a pretty severe tech junkie hobby, if personal finances were a motivator he likely could have retired by now. And, again, why the need for secrecy? I had thought that perhaps he was worried about being pressed into service by the gov't or others if they knew the exact nature of his power, but it seems like the feds are more or less able to muscle him into cooperating when they want to anyway, and he's willing to spend extremely valuable time checking in on convenience store robberies gone bad so it's not like he's got no moral interest in helping and just has a cynical, nihilistic take where he's just trying to take advantage of a system he sees as meaningless.

I can think of a few scenarios wherein the world as presented makes sense, and Delphic himself is presumably perfectly aware of all the facts germane to the need both for secrecy and lots and lots of money, but the whole setup starts to verge towards a Sherlock Holmes-esque feeling that the reader is being deliberately deprived of important info for the sake of a dramatic reveal down the line.
