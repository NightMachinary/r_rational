Im quite enjoying this story. MC is interesting and reletable and goes right alongside my weakness for nerdy characters. Really like this support character/secret mastermind wibe you got going. I hope you will keep MC in the shadows and dont try to push him into action.

I have only one worry and that is how you plan to balance his power. In its own way its way overpowered, given that he is not restricted by geography/distance and is able to solve most of the crimes in a few minutes/hours.

Im also a bit disappointed, that you did not make the MC a bit more morally gray. His mercenary like nature would be great to show also villian side of things.
