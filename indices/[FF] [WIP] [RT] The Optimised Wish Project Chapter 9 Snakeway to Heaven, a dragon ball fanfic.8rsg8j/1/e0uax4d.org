That's super horrific: eternal worsening torment because of a single argument. Doesn't that make Enma the most evil character introduced so far?

Frieza is killing planets, but a finite amount of suffering for finite beings is less than infinite suffering for one being. (Probably?) Of course, Enma has sentenced many beings to hell, in fact way more than Frieza could have possibly killed, so it is irrelevant.

Maybe Enma was going to let Bulma out after a few subjective minutes. I hope their next meeting involves Bulma being powerful enough to destroy him, and him trying to justify/downplay his earlier actions. "I was going to free you from hell shortly, I swear!"
