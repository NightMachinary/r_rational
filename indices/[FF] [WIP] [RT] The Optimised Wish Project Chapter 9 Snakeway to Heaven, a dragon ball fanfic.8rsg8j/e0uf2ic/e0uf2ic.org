Anyway, just to comment for myself: really loving this story so far. I'm a huge dragon ball fan, but I'm a fan despite its flaws, not because of them. It's great to see the setting I love in a way I can love even more; this is definitely one of my top 3 dragonball fanfics. Keep up the good work (Please)>
