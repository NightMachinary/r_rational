Yes, it's a whole other inconsistency that's really hard to settle. In fact the Kais seem just woefully weak, especially in light of the fact that they're supposed to be the Gods of Creation who balance out the God of Destruction; where Beerus destroys, Shin should create, so it's weird that they can't give life to a single person; they should be able to create entire planets. I still haven't decided what exactly to do with them, it's complex stuff because the canon really doesn't make much sense there. There's also the fact that Kami is supposed to be the first step on that cosmic hierarchy... except his powers come from him being a Namekian, and the Sanctuary is unique to Earth. Which in itself makes no sense either, if every galaxy has a Kai, why shouldn't every planet have a Kami? It's another situation in which Toriyama IMHO completely made shit up on the fly, he originally created Kami and Piccolo as basically God and Satan, supernatural entities, equals and opposites, then he decided they were Namekians and that whole thing flew out of the window.
