"if every galaxy has a Kai, why shouldn't every planet have a Kami?"

Don't they? I've always thought that impression was an artifact of how few planets we've seen.

Earth: Has Kami->Dende

Vegeta: Never seen directly, but King Kai mentions them having one.

Namek: Has none, but has recently undergone a massive catastrophe with only one survivor; presumably, the kami died with the rest of the populace.

King Kai's World / World of the Kais / Beerus' world / etc: Obvious reason.

Unless I'm missing something, there doesn't really seem to be a contradiction there.
