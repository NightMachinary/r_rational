Even if we take that into consideration (bearing in mind, again, that I have no knowledge of dragonball), there's no reason for those who go there to suffer. At worst, those who would be dangerous enough that it wouldn't be safe for them to be in a normal afterlife (insofar as such a thing even makes sense, since if you have the power to stop people from escaping an afterlife you should also have the power to stop them from harming each other) could be designated a personal afterlife of pure pleasure with simulated, non-sentient companionship who they can torture without harming anyone and/or a suppressed desire and need for socialization. Or if that's not possible, then depending on the severity of the torture, simple oblivion might be preferable.
