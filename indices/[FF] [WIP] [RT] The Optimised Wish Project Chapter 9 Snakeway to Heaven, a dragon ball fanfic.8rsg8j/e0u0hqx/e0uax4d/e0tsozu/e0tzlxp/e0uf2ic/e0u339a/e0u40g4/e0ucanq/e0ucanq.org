There's certainly a sense in canon that the dragon balls are weaker, particularly at moments like when piccolo just flat up kills him, but this isn't universal. Elder Kai, for instance, has to sacrifice his own life to revive one person, while Shenron casually does it to entire planets; similarly, shin is limited to transporting a handful of beings at a time with his kaikai, but the wish dragons can move entire planetary populations.
