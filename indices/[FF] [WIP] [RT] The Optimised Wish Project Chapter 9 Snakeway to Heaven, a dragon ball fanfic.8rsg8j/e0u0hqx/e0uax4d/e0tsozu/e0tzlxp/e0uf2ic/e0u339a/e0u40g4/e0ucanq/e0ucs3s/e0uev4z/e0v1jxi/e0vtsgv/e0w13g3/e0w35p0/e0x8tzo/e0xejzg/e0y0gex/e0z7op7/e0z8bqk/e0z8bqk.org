I'll have to do some work there. But at some point Supreme Kai (the old one) said that the Namekians were the only ones allowed to use the Dragon Balls because they were the wisest race in the Universe or something. The way I see it, it's a magical ability, but the ability is just that of creating the means of /summoning/ the dragons; and the dragons themselves are divine (while Piccolo does destroy Shen Long, that doesn't tell us much; we know a lot of divine beings who are relatively weak. King Kai is weaker than Saiyan Saga Vegeta, and Shin is stronger than Frieza but weaker than Cell). Perhaps the power of the creator of the Balls influences how much power the dragon itself can tap into. If this was HunterXHunter and Nen, you'd have an additional boost due to the limitations (seven Balls to gather, one wish a year, etc.) but frankly, those are still pretty weak for such a broken item XD.
