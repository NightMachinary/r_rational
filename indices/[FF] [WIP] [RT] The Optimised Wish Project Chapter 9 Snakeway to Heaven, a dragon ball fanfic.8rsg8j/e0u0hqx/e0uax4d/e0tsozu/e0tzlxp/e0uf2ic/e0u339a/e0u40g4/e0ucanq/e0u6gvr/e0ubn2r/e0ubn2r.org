The show never explored these topics as Hell is treated mostly as a joke; in the latest movie, it was shown that for Frieza (the planet killing villain I mention in the chapter, who's one of the major villains of the entire story), Hell is being dangled in a cocoon surrounded by cheerful and colourful creatures who sing and dance. To him, that's the worst torment imaginable, apparently. Other portrayals of Hell have varied - there's one whole non-canon movie that takes place in it, and it's perhaps the one that hints the most at the worst aspects of it, as one of the protagonists is currently residing there and his plea is taken more seriously than the villains'. But as I said, non canon. In the manga in fact I think Hell never appears even once; all its portrayals are anime original material. It's just said to exist.

So yeah, it's unclear. But it's said that the Dragon is only as powerful as the creator of the Dragon Balls; and said creator is shown in one scene to fear King Enma; so I'd say, probably impossible. This aspect however is confusing also because said creator is not able to resurrect people by himself, while the Dragon Balls can; so what does it mean that they're just as powerful as him is kind of unclear (my guess is that it was a last-minute patch by the writer to fix the obvious loophole that the heroes try to exploit: just asking the Dragon to defeat their enemies for them).
