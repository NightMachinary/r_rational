That's a good point about Freeza and the like having no apparent demons among them. I assume Piccolo got the Mazoku effect partly by being split from Kami, since otherwise there would be loads of demons among the Saiyans. (Broli refers to himself as the devil, but between it being a movie and Broli being particularly insane, I wouldn't count that.) My headcanon has been that Buu should count as a demon, or at least after the splitting and purging and such. But then Piccolo had to ruin it with that comment about disappearing halos (when there was no afterlife filler with Pure/Kid/Chibi Buu's victims).

The Dragonballs being a Namekian thing with nothing to do with divinity is kinda bizarre, yeah. The best I've got is that the average Dragon Clan Namekian wouldn't be able to make a dragon as powerful as Shenron or Porunga without being deified, but now I'm just pulling things from nowhere. The history of Namek compared to what we actually observe is perplexing (a space-faring civilization with no ancient ruins, even in filler?).
