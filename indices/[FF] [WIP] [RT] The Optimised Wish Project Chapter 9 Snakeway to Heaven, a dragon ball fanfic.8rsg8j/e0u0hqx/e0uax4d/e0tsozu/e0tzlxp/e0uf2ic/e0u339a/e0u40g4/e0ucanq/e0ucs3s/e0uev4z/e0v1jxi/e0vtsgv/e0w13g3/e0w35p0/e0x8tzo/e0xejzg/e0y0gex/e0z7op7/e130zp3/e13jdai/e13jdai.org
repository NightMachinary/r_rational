With Piccolo and Shin, I always imagined it was more because of his experience than some special power. That he knew more stuff about the divine hierarchies, and thus caught onto something the others missed. As for the special powers, true enough ("CLOTHES BEAM!"), but then again, Baba the sybil can travel to the afterlife too. Go figure. I don't think there's a single consistent rule. In general, I hope you won't mind if in trying to craft a more coherent rule set for my fanfiction I follow mostly my headcanon :).
