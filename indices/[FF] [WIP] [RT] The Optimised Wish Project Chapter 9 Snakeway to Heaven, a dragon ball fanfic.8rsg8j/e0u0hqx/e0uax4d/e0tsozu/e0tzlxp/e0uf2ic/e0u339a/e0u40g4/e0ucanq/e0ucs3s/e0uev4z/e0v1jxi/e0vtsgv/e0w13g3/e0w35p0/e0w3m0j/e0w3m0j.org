Or a very old dead one: they /were/ born hundreds of years before the current time, after all. But yeah, it's possible at that point Toriyama was already planning the alien twist. I don't think that was the case when he started with Piccolo though (given for example how he spawns random monsters from his eggs, not just other Namekians).

As for the editor, yeah, I knew, it's not like Toriyama even /has/ an editor now, I think? Since the DB Super manga is made by Toyotaro. I don't remember his name but the editor was his friend and I read an interview where he told this and other stories from his point of view too.
