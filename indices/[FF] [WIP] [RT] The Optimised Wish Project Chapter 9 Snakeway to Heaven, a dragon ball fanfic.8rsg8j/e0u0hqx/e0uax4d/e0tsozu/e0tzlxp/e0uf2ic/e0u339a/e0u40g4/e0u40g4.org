I can tell you, and read on only if you are okay with knowing something that any Dragon Ball viewer would:

per Dragon Ball canon (or at least, the parts of it I've decided to cherry pick as still valid in my story), existences like Hell and the higher gods are all FAR above the power of Shenlong and the Dragon Balls. Basically the Dragon Balls are magical items, very powerful ones, but still limited. The gods go in hierarchies up to a literal omnipotent multiversal creator (who's also a demented child). In fact, the latest show, Dragon Ball Super, would basically be Lovecraftian eldritch horror about the futility of mortal life in front of the whims of the gods if it wasn't so light-hearted in tone and faced its own subject matter with more of a straight face.
