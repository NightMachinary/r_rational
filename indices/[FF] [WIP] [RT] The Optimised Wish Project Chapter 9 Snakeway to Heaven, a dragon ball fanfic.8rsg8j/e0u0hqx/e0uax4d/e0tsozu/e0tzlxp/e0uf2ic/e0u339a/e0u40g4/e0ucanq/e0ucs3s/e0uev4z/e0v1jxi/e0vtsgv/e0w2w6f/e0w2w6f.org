Yeah, that was an anime only line. In the manga though, it still isn't a contradiction: we just plain don't know. We never really get to see planet Vegeta, and especially not in the detail that would be required to find out about a kami (remember that most of earth doesn't know the lookout exists). To clarify, I wasn't saying that guru was its kami. I was saying that the kami of Namek presumably died, the same as every other namekian did; as such, I think it would be a reasonable exception to the rule of 1 planet:1 kami.

It may well be the case that toriyama changed it, but I don't think we have any real evidence one way or another (since we just don't see many planets), so it seems unsubstantiated.
