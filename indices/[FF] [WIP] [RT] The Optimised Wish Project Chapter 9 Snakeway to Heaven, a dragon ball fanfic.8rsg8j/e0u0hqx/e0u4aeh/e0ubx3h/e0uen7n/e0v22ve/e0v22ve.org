Pretty much. OWP Goku is better at lateral thinking, or strategy in general, but his tendency to overthink might effectively bog him down in battle if he lets it take over. Good for him, he also has his "instinct mode", a tendency to regress to a simple animal-like fighting attitude left over from his Saiyan personality, but as seen with Boss Rabbit, that also comes with its own share of problems, like utter disregard for the opponent's life.
