King Kai was pretty productive while dead, to be fair.

Also goku was still training after the piccolo fight; that was, in fact, his specific motivation for allowing piccolo to go, and he became significantly stronger during that timespan. I dont forsee this being more efficient, except insofar as goku is already more efficient than his canon counterpart (which also isnt as much as you'd think, because canon goku is a really good example of what it means to actually, seriously try at something).
