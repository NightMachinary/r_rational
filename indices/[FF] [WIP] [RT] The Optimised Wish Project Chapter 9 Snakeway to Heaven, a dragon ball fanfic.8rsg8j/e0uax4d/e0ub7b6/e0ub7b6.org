Well, I'd say it's two different issues. At an absolute level, sure, Enma may be worse (though it's unclear how Hell works in Dragon Ball: it seems to be inspired by Buddhism and there's occasional references to purification and reincarnation, so it may not be permanent; however, erasure of one's memory and personality do not seem a much better fate). But Frieza, or any other mortal, does not know about how and what the afterlife looks like, so if you factor in that ignorance, indiscriminate killing is still potentially as bad as what Enma does, /from their point of view/. I'd argue that how "evil" one is depends also on what they /think/ the consequences of their actions are. If one did something horrifying in perfect good faith, thinking they're doing the good of those they're hurting, they may be dangerous, but they're not necessarily evil.
