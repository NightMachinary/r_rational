It's good, if a bit silly at times.

The sales pitch from the author themselves is:

  A "rational" Dragon Ball fanfiction. When Goku was a child, falling and hitting his head erased his memory and completely changed his life. What would have happened if instead of making him forget, that incident had made him much smarter than he was? Meet a new Goku - who's much more clever, has a taste for philosophy, and a bit of a dark side...

It's mostly just taking the hot mess that is DB (and in the future hopefully DBZ/DBS) lore and characters and constructing some semblance of internal consistency around it while sticking as close as possible to canon. Having never watched DB, I can't vouch for how well it succeeds at this last part, but it's been a very fun read so far.
