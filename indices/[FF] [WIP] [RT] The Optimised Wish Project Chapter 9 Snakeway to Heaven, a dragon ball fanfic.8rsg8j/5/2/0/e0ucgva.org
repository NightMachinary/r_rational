You need to consider that people aren't corporeal any more when they get to the afterlife. This isn't expounded much in Dragon Ball, but the general impression is that the only ones who get to keep their body are those whose merits earned them that privilege (and who might be useful to get to train so that they will defend the Universe in the future): so Goku & friends, basically, because the whole place runs on recommendations anyway. If Frieza ends up in Hell, it means he ends up in front of King Enma and gets kicked down, and that wouldn't be possible if he were at full strength (we know Enma trained with King Kai, and we know he's probably somewhere below Saiyan Saga Goku in strength). So the whole idea of Hell as a prison is inconsequential: Frieza, once dead, is inoffensive.

The only material that really contradicts this view is non-canon: some parts of the Afterlife Tournament filler arc, when Goku and Pikkon go settle a riot in Hell, and various parts of Dragon Ball GT, like Cell and Frieza fighting Goku in Hell, Dr. Gero and Dr. Mu managing to build an android inside it and escape (lol) or Piccolo purposefully fucking up Heaven so he gets sent to Hell to open a portal and let Goku escape (double lol). But honestly, if you ask me, Dragon Ball GT does not exist. I'll stick with the idea of souls being incorporeal, or there's too many inconsistencies anyway.
