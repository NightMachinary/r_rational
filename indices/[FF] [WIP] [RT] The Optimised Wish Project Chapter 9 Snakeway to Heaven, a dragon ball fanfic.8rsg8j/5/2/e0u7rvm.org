Well, from an reader perspective hell seems suboptimal but neccesary; if hell doesnt exist, then the likes of freiza will be up their in normal otherworld, and that would be a serious disaster all around, not to mention unfair to all the people whos QoAL would greatly decrease as a result of him walking around up there. I think its important to keep in mind that in canon, the list of people in U7 who can beat freeza and are currently active consists of Dabura and Shin, but when he's in hell he has no way to escape; that kind of thing is insanely useful. That being said, as this chapter shows the metric for who goes where could probabky use some work.
