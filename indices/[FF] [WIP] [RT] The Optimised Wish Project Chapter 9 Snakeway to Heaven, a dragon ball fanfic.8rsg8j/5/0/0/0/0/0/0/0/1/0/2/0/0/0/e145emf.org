Ah, thanks. Well, part of the fun of fanwriting is anyway to play a bit with the material, and tackling any franchise from a "rational" angle probably will always require a bit of tweaking. For me perhaps in this case the one where I feel the need to do that most is the villains, to build them up with understandable ideologies and motivations, even almost sympathetic ones for that matter. You can already start seeing from this chapter how that has led to me radically overhauling the Piccolo arc. I love the original character, but he's, by definition, well, just evil for its own sake. He's literally presented as a pure evil, demonic presence.

In general, I can't deny that I also do it because I don't want the experience to be too dull, both to the readers and to me first and foremost. I've recently read the first arcs of a long fanfiction focused around the idea of Raditz surviving his first fight with Goku and ultimately joining the heroes (if you're interested, it was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400080/1/Break-Through-the-Limit][Break through the limit]] ), but I ended up not liking it very much because I felt like it was too pedantic; beyond the initial change, it deviated as little as possible from the canon timeline. This feels both unrealistic to me (any amount of butterfly effect should guarantee a far greater reach for such momentous changes as important characters living or dying), and also just sort of boring, because in the end, it's just the same story we already know re-told with marginal changes.

So yeah, I don't think there's a problem with changing stuff a bit - though I can't stress this enough, I really do it from a place of respect for the source material anyway. I love Dragon Ball as a story a lot (and it means a lot to me in general since it was my gateway into anime/manga, it got me into writing fanfictions and helped me shape my writing as a whole, it was the push and the basis on which I learned to draw after years of assuming I just was bad at it... plus it's just a huge piece of teen nostalgia), so I don't feel like I'm improving it or anything, just weaving a different tale off the same fibre.
