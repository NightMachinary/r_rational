I don't have any problem with headcanon, they can add a lot to the world :). For instance, in my headcanon SSjRage is to SSjBlue what SSj is to FPSSj, because it's got the same sort of power, the blue coloring on top of the normal super Saiyan abilities, and notably after reaching it trunks is able to sense divine ki. I doubt it'll ever come up in canon, but it's just something that makes sense to me.

My sole problem is that too often, it seems, people seem to think that using headcanons for something is their only option; I find that better results are obtained when people break from canon when they have a reason, rather than because they think they have no choice. I'm glad to see that isn't really necessary on my part here, since you seem to have that part down nicely.
