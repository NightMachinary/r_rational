IIRC, there's an interview where Toriyama said that he came up with the alien retcon around the introduction of Kami, which leads me to believe the way it played out with Kami and Piccolo, at least, was intentional. I mean, Daimao is a title, more than a name. You see this title thing in Buddhism with figures like Mara. We also have Akuman being officially a native of Hell, and later we have Dabura, and even here we have Gyu-mao (Ox demon king). While Toriyama definitely flew by the seat of his pants, forgot things, and let his desire to minimize work influence things like tails and the SSJ transformation, it seems more likely that he knew what he was doing when it comes to the gods, up until the almost-certainly-unplanned expansion post-Cell.

Also, while it's a movie, I think it is relevant that Slug and his minions are referred to as Mazoku, long after the Namekian revelations. There's just this really strong implication that divinity and diabolism are attainable by mortals, with the Kaioshin being the only exception. After all, Kami offerred the job to Goku before Z.
