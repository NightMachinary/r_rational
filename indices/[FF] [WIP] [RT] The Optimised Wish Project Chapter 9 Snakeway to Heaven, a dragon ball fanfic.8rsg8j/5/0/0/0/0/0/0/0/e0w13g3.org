Yes, but see, there's pretty much no question that Toriyama often wrote Dragon Ball by the seat of his pants. An egregious example is the Android saga - there's an interview where he explains how his original idea for the villains was #19 and #20; then the editor said they looked ridiculous, so he introduced #17 and #18; then the editor said they looked too wimpy so he introduced Cell; and again, he had him transform to answer the complaints of his editor about his design - but I think this also applies to the big "now we have ALIENS!" reveal that opens DBZ and that sets the tone for everything that follows. Dragon Ball started as a comedic/kung-fu themed reinterpretation of Journey to the West, but by the time DBZ rolled around, Toriyama had to completely revolutionise the setting to keep it interesting. In that sense, a lot of the stuff that happens before is contradicted by what happens later.

What I mean is, all those things were said mostly before DBZ; and I think the main explanation for them is that Toriyama retconned them, or straight out forgot about them. He does that a lot.
