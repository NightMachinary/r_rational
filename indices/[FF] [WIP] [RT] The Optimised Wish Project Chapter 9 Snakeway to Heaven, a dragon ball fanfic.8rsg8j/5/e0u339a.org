I know nothing about Dragonball, haven't seen it and have little desire to, but I'm surprisingly enjoying this fic. I wonder if someone is going to wish to get rid of hell? It IS a rational fic, after all, and since Bulma has gone to hell (and knows she will again if she dies), it'd make sense. Don't know if Goku or Bulma would feel the same way I do about infinite torture, though, and some might see it as something of a rational fic cliche (if it is, it's a cliche I don't mind, but some people might not see it that way).
