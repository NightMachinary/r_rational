That Kami is a job, not a nature, is established - Kami himself split up in two in order to be worthy of it and receive it from his predecessor. My issue was not with that, but with the fact that his ability to create the Dragon Balls was his prerogative as Namekian, not as Kami. Perks of being Kami may or may not include the ability to peer at the world from the Observatory, for example.

That said, this whole issue is left muddy, though I agree with your idea that it would be in line with Buddhist thought to consider divinity attainable by mortals. The process however has only been formalised in DB Super, with Goku literally obtaining "divine ki", which does indeed have an existence separate from ordinary one. I don't think there's enough to work with to figure out a consistent rule. Let's say that if you become evil enough you become a "demon" - then why would Piccolo have been, but not Frieza, or Vegeta? "Demon king" as you mentioned is just a title, something people will call you if you become infamous enough. Akuman is a one-off joke character with ridiculous game-breaking powers and who was probably just put in there as a reference to Devilman anyway (all enemies in that battle besides Son Gohan are references to monsters after all: Dracula, the Invisible Man, the Mummy; while Baba is a witch and her servant a ghost). Dabura has been said to be from "the Demon Realm", so /not quite/ from Hell; rather, I always had the impression he was from some kind of parallel dimension.

Let's just say that my personal approach in this fanfiction will be: mortals gaining "divine" jobs isn't impossible. Mortals gaining the /essence/ of divinity is possible too but far more rare and with long reaching consequences (e.g.: Super Saiyan God). The position of Kami is unique to Earth (insofar as it has not been seen explicitly on other planets, even when, as on Namek, it would have made sense for the heroes to look for anyone occupying it, and would also have been very easy thanks to energy perception), and not necessarily part of the same grander divine hierarchy that includes the Kais and Beerus. The current Kami is not a God, nor is Piccolo a Demon; they are so by name only. Also, for any position that carries with itself meaningful powers or responsibilities (such as that of Supreme Kai, tied to the God of Destruction, and including that of Kami of Earth), there must be some sort of ritual that sharply marks the moment one assumes or leaves the role, so that they may be invested by the required powers. Otherwise, there could be an item, a place etc. that allow them to use those powers (for example, it could be Kami's sceptre that gives him those powers - not saying that's what I'll go with, just as an idea).
