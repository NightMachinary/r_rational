WRT Namek: Even if there are Kamis for every world, Krillin had no reason to know that. Unlike Goku, he wasn't trained to potentially take Kami's place; he and the gang have a very intense "beat the saiyans" training course. Furthermore, on earth the lookout isn't sensible from the planet under normal circumstances; up until buu, no one managed to enter the lookout without permission. Even if he did think that Namek has one and decided to go there (but its not like kami ever had the dragonballs up there, nor would kami have been useful against the freeza force), he had no reason to think he would be able to find it, or to enter it if he did. As for why it doesn't have one IC. Guru is literally the only survivor of the catastrophe, and we know that the guardians of a planet are explicitly mortal. We have every reason to think that if it had had a guardian, the guardian would have died then and there wouldn't be one on namek in the modern day.

As far as god in name only goes this does seem to be the case, but it is worth noting that Kamiccollo was able to sense something out of shin's divine energy, while none of the other Z fighters could sense divine KI. Kami also shows some abilities not available to ordinary namekians, like traveling to otherworld, matter creation (which is an explicit ability of the Kaio, interestingly), and possession.

I think there's definitely room for an interpretation where kami is just a title for some earthlings, but I don't think its overly supported or true in canon.
