The reference to Vegeta's Kami is anime only, as it's repeating the lie about the planet being destroyed by a meteor. Unless you want to assume that Freeza counts as a Kami, which, considering that a Kami's role is said to be guiding their people toward happiness, kinda makes sense for the Saiyans.

Also, regarding Kami and Piccolo: the idea of Kami with linked good/evil aspects apparently comes from Shinto. Super invokes this again by linking the Kaioshin to Birus, but there's also the Makai. It's also pretty apparent that Kami and Daimao /are/ a god / demon, respectively. This is apparently a spiritual thing, independent of species (presumably there's a minimum required intelligence, but you seem to have taken that into account with the afterlife scenes in this chapter). The Dragonballs are apparently still a Namekian thing, but Kami comments on Raditz and Goku going to the afterlife, when Daimao's victims did not, as a sign that Piccolo is no longer considered a demon for spiritual purposes.

I haven't kept up enough with Super and the accompanying supplementary material to know if an answer has been given regarding King Kai's planet / life. Kami did apparently restore Earth's Moon, and I would have expected the other characters to comment if this had been done with the Dragonballs,
