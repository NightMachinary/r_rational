It's never been clarified, really. I don't remember King Kai mentioning a Kami for planet Vegeta, who would that have been anyway? Kamis seem to be picked from the populace. If it was said, I can guarantee at least that was some kind of anime-original line, or a translation artefact - I've read the manga enough times to remember very clearly these details, and it was never mentioned. What I remember King Kai telling, in the anime, was the story of how the Saiyans overtook their planet from the previous dominant race, the Tuffles. Now in Super it's also been made canon that the Saiyans weren't even original of Vegeta, but they were from Sadala.

As for Namek, you could argue that Guru was its Kami, or at least had a similar role, but really, he was more of a planetary leader (in a fragmented tribal society anyway). The main point though is, creating the Dragon Balls isn't a special Kami power: it's a Namekian power. So whatever power is infused into them is simply the magic possessed by the original Namekian who made them. But while they can heal, Namekians can't resurrect people, teleport them, or recreate planets. So really, the power of the Dragon Balls does not seem to emanate from their creators; rather, they seem to be using their magic to harvest and control power that already exists independently of them.
