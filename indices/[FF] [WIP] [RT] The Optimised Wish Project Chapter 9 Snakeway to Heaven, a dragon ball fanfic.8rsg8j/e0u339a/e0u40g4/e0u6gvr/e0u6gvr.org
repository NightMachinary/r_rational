Ah, I see. So getting rid of hell is probably a much longer term goal, if it's possible at all. Thanks for responding. Would a smaller scale wish like for no sentient being from earth to go to hell work? Or is anything to do with hell or afterlives just completely outside of the limits of what they're capable of?
