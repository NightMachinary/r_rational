That's been said in Super, yes. But it's not like Super doesn't have plenty of plot holes... Frieza also managed to train from Super Saiyan level to Super Saiyan God level in five months, whereas Goku needed a couple decades and a magical ritual involving every surviving member of his race to do the same. It's impossible to reconcile everything, so whenever such a contradiction exists, I'll just go with the solution that seems more reasonable to me. Case in point: I'll assume souls are incorporeal. There's no way the likes of Frieza or Cell could be confined to the afterlife otherwise. We know for sure that Cell is stronger than Shin (Dabura was said to be of equal strength to Cell, and Shin feared him greatly), and so, basically, no one in the afterlife outside of Beerus (and possibly a few fighters in heaven like Pikkon) would be able to really keep him in check, since Beerus doesn't give a damn. That's not consistent with Cell, y'know, /staying/ in Hell. It's not even a matter of not there being an escape route: in Dragon Ball it's basically canon that you can brute-force your way out of /anything/. Not only Goku himself manages to escape from Hell - /twice/, if we count GT - but Buu manages to escape from the RoSaT pocket dimension simply by screaming. If barriers between worlds can be torn down with enough sheer power, there's no reason why Hell should be such a safe prison for monsters strong enough to threaten the Universe.
