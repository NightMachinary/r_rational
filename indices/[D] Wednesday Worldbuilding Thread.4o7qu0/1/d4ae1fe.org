I made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/4nrs66/rings_of_power_cyoa/][CYOA]] and posted it over on [[/r/makeyourchoice]]. It wasn't rationalist or even particularly rational, so I didn't crosspost to this sub, but Wednesday Worldbuilding seems to be a general enough for it to fit.

The second comment from the top I list some feedback I asked for. I am aiming to buff some of the weaker rings and to slightly nerf some of the more obviously OP rings in my second revision. Also I am planning at more hints at the implied meta-plot [[#s][spoiler]] Of course, this CYOA is meant to be open ended enough that the reader doesn't have to take this implied plot line as canon if they don't want to. There are also hints leveraging the rings to uncover extinct or nearly extinct forms of magic in the past. Finally, I was thinking of another page allowing for some minor bonuses and trade offs to the ring, to give the reader slightly more choices to customize their ring and the story they will tell themselves with it.
