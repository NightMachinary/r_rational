The Atlantean Rings also doesn't fit thematically, because it makes travel to other realities too easy, so I am almost certainly removing it.

Not sure what is wrong with the Planeteers ring. You could create a tornado or tidal wave with it, but it would cause ecological damage. Seems like a reasonable tradeoff for raw power.

I actually had someone else think that the DnD Ring too versatile... but compared to the Green Lantern ring, it is weak. I think I will add 1-level-1 spell to to it. For thematic reasons I am thinking of moving the +5 buffs to another ring that gives multiple +5 buffs (+5 to saves, +5 to stats, and +5 to 5 skills).

I was going to add Martial Trances (the berserk combat state dwarfs can go into in dwarf fortress) to the Dwarf Fortress ring. And maybe one more Dwarf Fortress themed buff to it? Video game like skill/stat increases (repeating the same action over and over boost skills and stats)? Or maybe ability to turn ordinary thrown object into deadly weapons? Free conjuration of materials for the strange moods? Precise control of the materials required for the artifacts? Still brainstorming.

I am definitely nerfing the Green Lantern Ring. I was familiar with the Justice League Cartoon, looking at the JLU and the reboot and the comics, high end Green Lantern Ring is too OP. I was thinking no power battery means it needs charging directly from willpower. Slow flight and weak shields can be almost charge real-time, but fast flight and powerful constructs/shields requires hours to days of charging, and high end feats may be weeks of charging, months for the one-off feats shown in the comics.

I was thinking of nerfing the Genie ring, but I was thinking in the opposite direction of you. I would nerf the wishes to having to be just within the theoretical upper limits of current human engineering and technology, and to have the ring get 1 more wish a year (also adds to the moral dilemma of keeping the Genie bound). (Weaker but more spread out effects to be more balanced with the other rings). So you no strong AI or nanotech factories, no instant massive intelligence boosts, but you could get an intelligence boost equal to the best combination of nootropics or a fabricator equal to the best 3d printers or an AI equal to the best combination of Google's algorithms, Deepmind, self-driving cars, and Watson. Sounds more balanced? The Genie will protect you if you free him and perform small favors and may be persuaded to occasionally perform larger favors and teach you magic.
