I'd recomend removing the atlantean rings (either incredibly overpowered or horribly underpowered, depneding on interpritations) and planteer rings, buffing the dnd ring(most of what it does can be mimiked or improved upon by a lantern ring) and dwarf fortess ring, and reducing the number of wishes from the genine.
