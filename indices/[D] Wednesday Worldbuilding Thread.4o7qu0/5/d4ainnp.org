Any meteorologists in the thread?

- How long can [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)][inversion layers]] stick around?
- What can cause the cap to be broken, and how quickly will the cap collapse and cause the formation of thunderstorms?
- What will the weather conditions be like inside the cap be while the cap is breaking? If there is a lot of smog under the cap, will it dissipate before or after the thunderstorms fall?
- How is all of that affected if it forms over a [[http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Lake-town][lake near a lonely mountain]]?
