We don't just have multiple sapient civilized species, but multiple sapient civilized /clades./

Great Apes, Elephants, and Cetaceans at the minimum, and possibly corvids as well.

Not everyone is at the same level of civilization or sapience, but we're all social, tool using, communicators.

And I'm suspicious that humans are placing evolutionary pressure on the other species and clades to get smarter, in order to live in a more complex human-centric world. (Dolphins, at least, seem to be getting a little better at tool use.)

Yeah, if you look at modern society it's sharply different to how the other species live, but modern society is, well modern. An early hunter-gatherer using wooden spears to catch animals, and crafting crude clothing isn't too different from a gorilla coaxing ants out of an anthill with a branch or a dolphin using a sea sponge to extract difficult prey.

Now, I admit I'm being a little encompassing with my definition of "sapient," but it's food for thought, no?
