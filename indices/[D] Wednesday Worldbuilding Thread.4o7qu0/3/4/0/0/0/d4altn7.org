Nah, it's just a probability thing. Now that I think of it, Drake doesn't work here /at all/, since there is no "willing to make contact" element - just a rift that opens randomly, connecting two worlds that both might or might not contain sentinent life. The number of worlds is infinitely big, the probability of a rift connecting any two of them is infinitely small.
