I like the first. If the mutagenicity is consistent across magical traditions, then you can have plotlines where one can tell by how inter-species someone is in which magics they're proficient, or two lovers separated by species who, together, vigorously practice the opposite magical tradition in order to converge at a shared state of sexual or reproductive compatibility. It allows for more character agency.
