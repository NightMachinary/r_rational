I don't actually know a full argument of the objection. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4aku6h][This]] is what I go by - basically an offhand comment, but made by a person who knows his stuff.

I have, in fact, considered magical gene-tinkering. However, this is indeed not what I'm looking for, since an uplifted race wouldn't have a separate culture for at least a few generations, and even then, it's culture would be pretty much secondary to it's parent species.
