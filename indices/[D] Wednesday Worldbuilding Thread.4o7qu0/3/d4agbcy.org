One fairly known evolutionist and a fantasy fan once said that the existence of multiple independently evolved, sentinent civilized species on the same planet is absolutely improbable, if not impossible.

So I'm thinking about a world that is populated by several such species, while fully adhering to that principle. High fantasy setting, of course.

The easy way would be just say they were created that way by Gods, but let's not go that way.

One solution would be to simply declare that magical practises are highly mutagenical by their nature, and simply having a different culture with a different magical tradition would quickly - in a span of a few hundreds years - turn a nation into species. Since only sentinent species with some civilization would be able to develop a magical traditon in the first place, the evolution process that took that species to sentience would remain singular.

The other way is to have different sources of those secies. The world I have in mind is a home for, so far, three of them: 1) Native species 2) Interdimentional travellers, whose homeworld was connected to this one for exactly thirty years by a dimensional rift, which closed the same way it opened, unexpectedly. Thirty years were enough to build some colonies here, though. Ah, and that was about a millenia ago. 3) Elementals, living manifestations of magic and nature, who are exactly as sentient as the planet's magic users are - since they are reflections of their surrounding magicsphere. They always existed, even before the appearance of organic life on the planet, but only became capable of high thought when other species did so, and only in heavily populated regions.

Thoughts? Additional races for the second version? Thanks!
