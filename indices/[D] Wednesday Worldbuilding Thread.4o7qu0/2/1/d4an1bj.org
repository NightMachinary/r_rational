It's best to release chapters in logical narrative chunks that hopefully either comprise a single complete arc of the story, or a single section of an arc. Since arcs tend to be fractal in nature, this can be difficult, but I would aim for chunks of no less than a thousand words, and ideally no greater than 10K words. I think in the past, writing serially, the longest chapter I ever posted was ~11K words, and there were never any complaints about length (there were numerous complaints going the opposite direction though). Aiming for a proper splitting of the narrative seems much more important than aiming for consistent length (to an extent).

The calendar gimmick seems neat though. (Edit: I mean gimmick in a value-neutral sense, not in a negative way.)
