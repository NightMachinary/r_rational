I have a story that has distinct chunks based on the days of the calendar inside the story. Is it better to release the story:

- in one go (~15k words),
- in chapters independent of the days, (aiming for same words per release)
- tied to Earth's calendar with only one day being released per day (variable words per day)

This is the same story as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4ainnp][my meteorology question]], but a separate topic entirely.
