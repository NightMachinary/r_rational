I can read 15k words in one sitting, so its not too big for a single release if that is what you are thinking about. However, I would actually recommend trying to select the release to give the readers time to think about each significant section on its own (so I guess the 2nd option), unless you are really set on the Calendar theme to the release, which does sound pretty interesting to be fair. Do you have a beta? Maybe you could compromise between the Calendar release and the chapter organized releases. 1 day per release might not be enough time if there are twists, or clues, or foreshadowing for the readers to figure out. If there aren't any plot features like this that benefit from reader contemplation, no need to space out the releases.
