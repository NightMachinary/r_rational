Basically a small number of people called ouroborans get 'reincarnated repeatedly into their own bodies, so they get to live their lives over and over again. You can do different things, and make some changes to time, but history seems resilient, partly because there's an organisation of ouroborans called the Cronus Club who object to you changing anything significant. Cronus club can help you with money (because betting and investing are a lot easier if you remember the last time round) and also send (slow) messages from one instance of the world to the next, via messages from old ouroborans to younger ones and visa versa. One reason they don't want to change things is that one such message talks about the end of the world...
