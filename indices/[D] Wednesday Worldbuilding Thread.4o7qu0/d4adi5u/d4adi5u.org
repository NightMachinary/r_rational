I am thinking about a rational fanfic of The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August, but I wondered how many people have read the book? The premise is fairly simple, so it wouldn't be essential to have read the original, but if anyone has read, or even has a thought of what they'd like to see tackled I'd love to know...
