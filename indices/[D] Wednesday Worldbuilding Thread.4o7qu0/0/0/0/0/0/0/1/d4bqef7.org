I was vaguely envisioning this as like Green Lantern or Lensmen, a high concept sci-fi adventure with human superheroes chosen by aliens to represent and protect our species. Your idea of a secret think tank that makes contact with aliens is just as good, though, and you've put much more thought into this idea than I have. You're welcome to take a shot at it, and I'm glad you care about delivering interesting human characters and dialogue because that's a common issue I've found in stories here.

I'm willing to collaborate on this with you and others, but I'm really not a good writer. However, I am a very good editor for both style and substance so I'd be happy to do that. I'm not very experienced with rational fiction and am a bit more concerned with how a story makes me feel than how it makes me think. I love HPMOR for doing both very well, but hated Fine Structure for using interesting ideas for a plot and characters I simply didn't care about. I definitely prefer a compelling narrative over realism.
