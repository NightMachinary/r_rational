  I was vaguely envisioning this as like Green Lantern or Lensmen, a high concept sci-fi adventure with human superheroes chosen by aliens to represent and protect our species.

If you are aiming for soft-scifi, you could probably make your idea work just by giving each race hidden +magic+ psychic (its sci-fi as long as you use the right labels) potential that is expressed uniquely for each race.

  However, I am a very good editor for both style and substance so I'd be happy to do that.

Thanks! I have a bunch of snippets in my head now, I will try to get some of them written down over the weekend. If I actually start to pull them into a story, I will probably have trouble getting good narrative going (as opposed to a bunch of disjointed alien perspective and dialog with the aliens), so I might ask for help with that. Are pms okay with you? Either way I am thinking of asking for help in the next Worldbuilding Wednesday, if I get a good number of snippets churned out.
