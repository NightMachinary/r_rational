For a less civilization wide and more individual blind-spot...

As humans, we have limited introspective control of our own thoughts. Like think how much effort learning meditation requires just to be able voluntarily and willfully quite our own minds and become more aware of our own thoughts, much less reach any arbitrary mental state. People can also have emotions that they consciously know are bad for them, but they can't help themselves. Also, think how much human memories are prone to confabulation.

I am not saying every other alien race has perfect mental self control, but most of them could have developed better introspective awareness and control as they developed civilization, making humans one of the more limited races in this aspect (Several races were like us in this, they modded it out when they went through their singularity. Only a few races actually currently have limits on their cognitive control close to as poor as humans... these races did think it an advantage in coming up with unexpected strategies, even if it is a major trade-off in raw intelligence).
