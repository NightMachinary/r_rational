That is both everything I was thinking of and way beyond anything I was capable of imagining. The only difference I had with you was that I was thinking peaceful coexistence was only possible between post-singularity civilizations, otherwise the less advanced species would be destroyed or assimilated even unintentionally. The evil aliens are okay with that happening, but the good aliens want a primitive species completely unlike them to maintain their uniqueness.

This premise basically subverts the entire theme of Three Worlds Collide with the notion that coexistence between species is possible and preferable. It'd be like if the humans came across the baby-eaters before they'd invented interstellar travel and decided to both accept them and encourage their independent development. I was confused as to how to justify that, but your idea of novel creativity does that exactly how I wanted it to.
