Keep in mind even the terms "good" and "evil" only loosely correspond to the aliens interests.

The "evil" aliens might think they are genuinely helping us (this also justifies why the story doesn't end in relativistic kill vehicles wiping out planets). For example, conquest and enslavement was a common part of many ancient human cultures, and xenophobia and tribalism still are. They might genuinely think a state of perpetual warfare and struggle would best actualize the coherent extrapolated volition of humanity, even if we don't realize it now. Or for another example.... humans restrict sex and gender to precise roles. This limits are happiness and pleasure. We might object in the short term, but in the long-term we will thank them for changing us all to bisexual and gender-fluid with just one small retrovirus.

The "good" aliens might include a variety of races with biological characteristics we might find horrific (Babyeaters), customs that we find cruel or bizarre (I think it was on [[/r/hfy]], an idea about a rat-like race that had dimorphic sexes with larger male-eating females, that developed civilization as the more intelligent and sapient males learned to band together to trap and rape the vicious and feral but still sapient females in order to reproduce), or just be completely alien to us (a race that reproduces asexually with no genders might find all of our sexual customs bizarre, or a hiveminded race like the Formics in Ender's game that have trouble with the idea of individual lifeforms being sapient). We only call the "good" aliens good because they are more or less trying to live and let live, even if they find aspects of our biology or culture horrifying and we do to them likewise.

For the singularity, you could go with the common criticism of EY's claims as to why it is limited. "Intelligence" is a mix of cognitive features, there is no single algorithm that results in general intelligence that can be enhanced. Improving memory and processing speed in general improve intelligence, but even these things hit bottlenecks and limitations in the space of cognitive architectures. The post singularity races are smart enough that their interactions with primitives are fundamentally unequal (how do you have a conversation as equals with beings that you can almost perfectly predict the responses of. For most things, you could say exactly what is necessary get the results you want from the more primitive race, is it really a meaningful conversation?) but not so smart as to make the plot go away or the value of interaction with other species to go away. (Think of the Entities in Worm for an extreme example, [[#s][Worm spoilers]])
