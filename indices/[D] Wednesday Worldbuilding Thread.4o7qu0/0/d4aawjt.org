I have an idea for a rational take on the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause?from=Main.PrimeDirective][Prime Directive]] where aliens avoid contact with pre-singularity civilizations because it would cause an Outside Context Problem. If they uplifted a species, then the uplifts would just become an extension of the alien civilization instead of its own, and the aliens think diversity among the stars is better for everyone.

It could probably work as some combination of The Culture and Lensman, where the aliens covertly share the truth with a select few humans to protect Earth from invasion. The only problem is, does this plan really do more good than harm? Can it be argued that humans would be better off if aliens didn't share their science and technology with us until we achieved a singularity?
