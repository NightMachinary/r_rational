"Human blind spots" would probably be blind spots of our civilisation as a whole. Things like the resources we waste on rent-seeking behaviours, the proxy tribal warfare that muddles important questions like "how fast is global warming happening", our frequent inability to plan beyond the next election let alone beyond a human lifespan, etc. As individuals we're aware of these problems, but that doesn't mean we can fix them.

I'm more worried that it would become a soapbox for the author's politics. Even my list above was already quite political, and that's a single paragraph instead of an entire book.
