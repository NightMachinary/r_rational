Conversely, all the Alien races might have went through various coordination failures as they developed their civilizations, its not so much that humans especially bad, its just that our own failure are weird compared to theirs and/or theirs are weird compared to ours.

Like races with individual sapient members may have tribalism, but our tribalism has a bunch of weird features. Like the way tribalism can apply to small personal groups, sports teams, religions, states, and nations all at the same time in the same person is possibly weird.

Our governments' limited investment in science and technology even though we are so good at imagining its potential via science fiction might also be super weird. Like some races may have had less imagination than us as they were developing technologies for the first time, but at least those races were smart enough to focus their society on developing the technologies they did imagine.
