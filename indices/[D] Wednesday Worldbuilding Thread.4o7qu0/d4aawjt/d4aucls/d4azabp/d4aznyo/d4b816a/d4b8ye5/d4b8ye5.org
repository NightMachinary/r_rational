Now that you've pitched it, I kind of want to take a shot at it. I haven't done any big writing projects before, just snippets, but this has got me motivated enough to at least do a few one-shots... I don't actually have a good idea for a concise plot though. I can think of plenty of alien races, but doing the human responses to them and avoiding "talking-heads" is a challenge... Maybe I could manage a few prolonged conversation:

- secret first contact information package scaring human government people with its implications that every alien society has a few features we are likely to find immoral

- human ambassadors meeting the aliens representatives and being disturbed even more

- humans getting over themselves and brainstorming solutions with the alien representatives

- shock as the humans realize the hyper intelligent alien races each have weird cognitive blind-spots and/or strategies they overlook because of weird ethical hangups

- eureka moment of an idea, making that idea workable (the aliens are all smart enough to grasp an idea even if they can't necessarily think of it themselves)

- a brief scene implementing the solution and resolving the story

- 1st epilogue each alien race takes turns making their pitch at small samples of technology they might offer humans that would turn them to their way of thinking (not prime directive breaking, but using the aftermath of the crisis to skirt the line)

- 2nd epilogue scene, the human governments all vow to keep everything a secret and wait a few centuries for the human's singularity to render everything moot anyway.

Actually, do you want to try a collaborative project? I could write alien perspectives and snippets and dialogue if you could manage to keep the human characters moving their side of the plot along?
