I didn't quite explain my reasoning there. Deconstruct what you mean by creativity. I think creativity is a huge grab bag of different cognitive processes, cultural constructs, and life experience that lets humans come up with novel solutions to problems. The Alien races each have their own "creativity" which can also generate novel solutions to problems, but if human "creativity" is different enough it might be able to generate ideas unique enough to be valuable even if the aliens will have thought of most of them one way or another. It will require good writing and serious brainstorming and empathizing with how alien mindset might think to pull this off will enough to satisfy the [[/r/rational]] crowd though.
