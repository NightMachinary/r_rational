This is the first thing longer than a snippet that I've written, so I am writing it pretty slowly, basically only a few paragraphs at a time, but I have a full outline and I keep working at it and I can bounce ideas off of trekie140 so I should get it done eventually. I was planning on finishing it all and then posting each chapter a few days apart.

  This is the best thing I've read in a very, very long time, despite the jarringly unexpected 'choose your own adventure' portion near its end.
#+end_quote

I thought about that ending... As a small teaser... I think you may find my ending an interesting twist on the ending of Three Worlds Collide...
