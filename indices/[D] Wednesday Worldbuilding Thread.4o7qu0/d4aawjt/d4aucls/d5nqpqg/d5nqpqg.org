This is the best thing I've read in a very, very long time, despite the CYOA which was slightly jarring since I didn't expect it. This is the sort of thing I was hoping to read about the Descolada, whose chemical communications with each other include chemical attacks, when the original Ender's Game series abruptly halted.

I'm thankful that [[/u/trekie140][u/trekie140]] referenced this thread yesterday and that you had mentioned Yudokowsky's novella.
