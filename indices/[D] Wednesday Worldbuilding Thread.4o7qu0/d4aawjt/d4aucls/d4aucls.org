I think you could pull this off, if you managed to really sell the readers on the fact that the aliens think drastically different than us. Like Baby-eaters/Super-Happies level of difference (check out that story, Three Worlds Collide, by Eliezer Yudokowsky if you haven't already). The aliens really would be helping us by not intervening, because if they did, their morals values and psychological values would completely screw up ours. In addition, the aliens can't really agree on a common moral code. (Maybe one race in the alliance of aliens thinks we should be modified to remove the sensation of pain as part of our uplift, maybe another race thinks we shouldn't regard toddlers as people because they are nonsapient, maybe a third thinks we should give fetuses the full rights of grown adults, a fourth race thinks painful death games should be encouraged if we have mind uploads). The Prime Directive also acts as the best compromise on the fact that every alien race has different values and ethics, so letting them decided for themselves is the only consistently fair way of doing things. If you can play up the cognitive differences of them as well, you could also work the idea that our creativity could help them (to give the human protagonists relevance).

So... the hostile invading race might kill us, but at least they wouldn't leave us a warped caricature of ourselves. The aliens want to help us, but all their good technology (mind uploads, immortality granting biotech, strong AI, cybernetic intelligence modification, etc.) would warp our values. Just giving us weapons wouldn't be enough, without an upgrade to human rationality or a restructuring of our society, we would end up destroying ourselves (the alien races have AI that is really good at modeling and predicting this sort of thing). Thus the human protagonists need to come up with a set of technology that will minimize the cultural impact on Earth culture while still letting Earth defend itself.
