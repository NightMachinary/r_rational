I assume the objection is that they would compete with one another for the same niche, or that evolution of intelligence is so rare and civilization so fleeting that even two independently evolved species on the same planet would never have overlapping histories? If the argument is /improbability/, I've ever had a real problem with that, so long as it's a worldbuilding conceit and not used to resolve story conflicts.

Personally, I wish that more fantasy blended in scifi stuff like magical uplifting and gene-tinkering for their distinct races, but that doesn't seem like what you're going for.
