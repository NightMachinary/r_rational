If you're looking for a really-well-thought-out scifi with two intelligent species on a planet, check out Mary Doria Russell's /The Sparrow/ and /Children of God/. It's a predator/prey relationship, and a lot of blue/orange morality problems between the residents of the planet and the humans that go visit them. I guess it's not an independent evolution, though, since they're both mammal-analogues.

Parallel evolution is tricky. I think that that pair of books shoots the needle with the premise.

Different sources of those species is likely, though now you might want to do the math behind a magical version of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation][Drake equation]].
