There is a "willing to make contact" element in the case of aliens that voluntarily begin contact.

So you have four populations:

- don't make contact
- involuntarily make contact
- involuntarily make contact but would have made contact voluntarily
- voluntarily make contact

So the probability becomes more complicated, but it's probably still estimable.
