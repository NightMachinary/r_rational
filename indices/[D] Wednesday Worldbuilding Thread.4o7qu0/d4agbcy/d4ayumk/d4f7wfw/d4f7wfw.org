Aren't highly socialized and tool-using elephants limited to a specific sub-species or region? I remember seeing a special on how one researcher spent decades observing a single clan of that species, while at the same time trying to protect them from poachers. I don't recall if they were unique for the advanced expression of their intelligence - which included language and ritual - or unique for having been observed for so long and in such detail.
