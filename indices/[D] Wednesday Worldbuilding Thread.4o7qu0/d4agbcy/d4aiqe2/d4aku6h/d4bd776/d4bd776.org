Sapkowski solved that quite nicely, also solving the problem of the origins of monsters and various seemingly ridiculus lifecycles, and monsters cmoing from different mythologies coexisting.

I also like how he has 2 parallel worlds with different time passage, and the slower world uses the faster world for genetic experiments :)
