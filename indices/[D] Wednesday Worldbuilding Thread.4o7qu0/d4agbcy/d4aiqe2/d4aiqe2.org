I'd say you can definitely have closely related sentient races achieving civilization at the same time as a result of normal evolution. Homo sapiens and Neanderthals lived at the same time, after all, and both were sentient species who possessed basic culture and technology. Neanderthals, of course, eventually died out, but I'm not sure what about the transition from the stone age to the bronze age you could point to as preventing the survival of more than one species in every possible world. It's only one data point, after all- which can suggest a possibility, but not rule out alternatives.
