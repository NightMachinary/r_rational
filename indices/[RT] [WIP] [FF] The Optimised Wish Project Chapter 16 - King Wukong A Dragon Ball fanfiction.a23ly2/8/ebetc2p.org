I was waiting for this. Well played.

Kinda suprised with whole "Puar is evil" arc, I tought he was a bit important for later arcs

I'd love to see the Frieza in this fic in the distant future. Now I am curious about the Red Ribbon Army Saga, but I think you'll go with tournament first. But that tournament will surely feel as a filler.

Can Puatrino reach some planet (event of very low probability) and transform back?
