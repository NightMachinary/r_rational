  Can Puatrino reach some planet (event of very low probability) and transform back?
#+end_quote

Reaching a planet wouldn't help. He's locked in his current form because he expended too much magic, and his regeneration rate is linked to his mass, but there's also a consumption. Basically, if your consumption exceeds your regeneration, and you don't have enough reserves, you're fucked. Like the bedside table fox Oolong mentions.

Puar's problem was that he was overconfident. His regeneration rate and base reserves were so huge, he never really got a sense of when he was hitting his limits. This battle pushed him further than anything he'd ever done before, and as a result he expended more energy than ever (more is also spent to heal damage when going back to a different form, Oolong mentions this too). But even if you take a very big number, multiply it by an even smaller number, such as the mass of the neutrino, and it'll get very small. This balancing between orders of magnitudes so staggeringly different is what screwed Puar, as he had no hard numbers on his limits, no instinctive sense for them (as he never reached that point), and his mind was basically already damaged by the loss of Caroline by that point.

So no, he's screwed, forever and ever.
