Wooo! I'm happy that this updated. Thank you for another chapter.

I'm sad that Goku lost his tail, hope that this doesn't go the way of Z where all the Saiyans remove their tails and pretend to be just better-humans.

Love what you did with Puar, he might just become the first earthling to meet an Alien in person depending on what he encounters though I'm not sure what his plan is on how he's suppose to know when/if he encounters something. And seeing how if he runs out of magical stamina he gets stuck in that form, it seems Bulma's plan worked out anyway.

I wonder if there's going to be a *TOURNAMENT ARC* or if the next saga will be Red Ribbon/ the return of Piccolo Arc.
