Kami/Piccolo got there about 300 years earlier, and apparently met enough people to feel like he needed to become god to fix it all. I assume that, or something similar, is still the backstory of the character in this version. I imagine Simone is avoiding some of the weirder post-series tidbits, like /Pola and Roid/ or the Three-eyed Tribe, but considering the similarities between Earthlings and Saiyans, maybe a less gaggish version of /Pola and Roid/ happened in the OWP universe, too?
