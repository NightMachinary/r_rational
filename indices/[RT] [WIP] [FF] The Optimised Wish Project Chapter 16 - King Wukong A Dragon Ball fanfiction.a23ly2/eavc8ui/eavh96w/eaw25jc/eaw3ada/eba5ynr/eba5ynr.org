Even before Babidi. It's Majin Buu's own symbol, Babidi only adopted it. It was on Bibidi as well, and Majin Buu has it on his belt - and we know his clothes are basically part of his body, so it's not like that could have been put there by his masters (especially if you take the now canonical explanation that Buu was really more /summoned/ than /created/ by Bibidi. No disclosure on the OWP canon about that yet though).
