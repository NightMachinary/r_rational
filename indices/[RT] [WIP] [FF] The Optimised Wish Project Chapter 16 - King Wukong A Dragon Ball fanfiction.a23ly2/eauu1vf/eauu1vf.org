Here's the arc finale! I'll take a slightly longer pause than usual before the next chapter; I hope it can be up before the end of 2018 anyway. This one too took a lot because it is very long (more than 14,000 words, which is double the usual length).

Chapter title reference for anyone who doesn't get it: King Kong, obviously, mixed with Sun Wukong, the Chinese name of the Monkey King, protagonist of Journey to the West and inspiration for the character of Son Goku in the original Dragon Ball
