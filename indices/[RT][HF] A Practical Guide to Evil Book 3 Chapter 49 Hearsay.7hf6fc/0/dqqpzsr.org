Who also thinks Black is going to be like Voldemort now?

Cruel, cold and practical with a central flaw in his thinking. A flaw his enemies will capitalise on?

Malicia's words are evidence that The Black Knight is on his way out. If he had kept his composure, his cold practicality, his distance, he had a good chance of finally flipping the tables of the story. But the Bard and Fate knew exactly where to hit him to knock him off his game.

And the Knight is off his game. Mistakes will be made.

The era of the Calamities is at an end. The Woe that arises from the ashes will devour Creation whole.
