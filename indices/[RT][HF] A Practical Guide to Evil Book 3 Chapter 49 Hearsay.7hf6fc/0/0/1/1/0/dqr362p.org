Could be, its a inherently a Orc name though.

From what i understand, a name is born from a culture, and Cat is Calowan to the bone. It be weird of her to take up a Orcish name. There's also the issue of the mysterious parentage. Its been lampshaded a few times that if you are a hero with unknown parents, you might as well prepare yourself for the crown early. The sticker is of course that Cat ain't no hero. Plus she is "daughter of no one and nothing." a pretty fundamental part of her identity. Also, she's the only living noble of the kingdom of winter. That should probably mean something.

So i don't think she will be the Warlord, i don't think she will be the Black Knight (Nor the Gray knight, if anything, in that case it would just be Knight) but i don't really know what she will become instead.

Honestly, i was already pretty surprised by Hierophant
