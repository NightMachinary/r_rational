after the last few chapters away from Cat's pov, I am starting to wonder if it's possible she could end up as the White Knight. first thing is that Black didn't form a pattern of three - he assumes that this means he will die soon, because White is supposed to be rivals with a different Black Knight. It could also be that White is the one scheduled to be replaced, so that the new White Knight can be his rival. in addition Cat has been strangely, uncharacteristically heroic ever since she accidentally forced that winter fey to monologue. I would not be surprised at all if the heavens were in the process of attempting to force the mantle of hero on her again. next is the narrative power of a student having to face off against her fallen mentor, who is clearly a very important person to her.

also, if she does end up with a hero's name, it would be neat to see her powers get all mangled. radiant icy necromancy is one of the most trippy combinations for powers I've run into in a while.

though in all honesty, I fully expect her to end up as something totally new instead of any sort of Knight or Warlord or Queen. like what happened to Anaxares, and similarly just as much of a surprise to her as to us.
