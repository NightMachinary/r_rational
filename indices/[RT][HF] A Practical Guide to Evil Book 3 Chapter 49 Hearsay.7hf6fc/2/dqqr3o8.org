Calling it now. Book 4 is gonna be the Woe vs Calamities while setting up whatever plan the bard and tyrant have for praes.

Also, does anyone else think Malicia's deterrent isn't Still Water but Diablolist's superweapon? Still Water will trigger a crusade and she seemed to disapprove of it. You need something scary enough that even a Crusade is out of the question. If Still Water could have been that deterrent Malicia would have started work on it herself.
