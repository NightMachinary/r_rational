there was that whole chapter where her new Name was revealed where she talked about becoming better than her ancestors. there were some hints there that what she is planning is similar to the way Black does things - orthogonal to the normal way villains are supposed to act, and possibly also to the methods Black and Malicia favor. I would be most surprised if her weapon ends up just being something that is obviously a weapon.
