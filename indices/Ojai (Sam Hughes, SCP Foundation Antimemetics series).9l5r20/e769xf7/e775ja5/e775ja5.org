The entity that was in Red was SCP 3125, implied in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are][Unforgettable, that's what you are]], described in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/case-colourless-green][CASE COLORLESS GREEN]] and faced in the direct sequel, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-last-first-day][Your Last First Day]].
