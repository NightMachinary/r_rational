  But the reality is, we score higher on tests of intelligence.  If any of you whiners tried to make it in Paragon classes, you'd crash and burn within a week.

I found this bit interesting, sounds pretty familiar to some IQ related arguments I've heard in real-life politics but, the problem is, projectors probably have higher IQ's not just for socio-economic reasons (though that's undoubtedly a contributor) but Praxis vocations that can literally make them think faster, multi-task, improve pattern matching abilities, and who knows what else (they probably have access to better mental health therapies as well). I've always thought it would be interesting to see how these issues might play out if there was actually a significant, innate/genetic, difference between two human demographics.

Thanks for the chapter.
