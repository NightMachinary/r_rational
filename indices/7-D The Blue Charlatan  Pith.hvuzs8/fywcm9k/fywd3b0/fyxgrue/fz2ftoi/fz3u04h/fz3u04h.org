I think this writer does this kind of thing better than Wildbow in a sense. Because Wildbow's dialogue tends to be kinda indirect and roundabout, characters feel like they carefully choose their words even when it doesn't fit what they're trying to say. Here Wes is just coming out and spewing dumb shit like you'd expect an S-Tier dickhead would.
