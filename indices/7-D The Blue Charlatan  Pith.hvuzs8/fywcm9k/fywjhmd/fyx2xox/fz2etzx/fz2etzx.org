It's been kind of funny so far how Wes's riches-to-rags-to-riches plot arc has been working in opposition to his character development. In order to retain his motivation for an Ousting Round Two, he needs retain the feeling that he was wronged and that he deserved his aristocratic position in the first place. But in order to develop into someone we can cheer for, he needs to develop into someone who's moved beyond the ideology of superiority driving him right now. Very nice tension, I feel like we're finally making progress. The author constructed this really nicely.
