I'm kind of skeptical that the gang could still be alive if the terrorists have someone who can listen in on their conversations /that/ easily. I think Tunnel Vision is maybe bluffing on some front. Like, maybe she has a power that lets her detect when someone mentions her name, but she doesn't actually know where Ana's home is.

Otherwise, great chapter. People calling Wes out on his shit is always a pleasure.
