Ya, let me amend that, they probably should have access to better mental health therapies (at the very least, crippling PTSD could be 'cured' with targeted memory wipes). Without even speculating on whisper or praxis vocations we haven't seen yet, I'm kind of surprised some combination of nudging and aversion therapy doesn't exist to combat addiction (targeted memory wipes would likely have some potential here as well, even if it's just to remove the memory of how to counter nudging).
