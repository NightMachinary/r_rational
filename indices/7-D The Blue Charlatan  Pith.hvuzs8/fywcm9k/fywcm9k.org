Be careful what you wish for. Because wow standing over a girl in bed so you can hassle her over having a friend you hate because of a beef she's clueless about while also admitting that you were spying on her is an ass-kicking offence if I ever saw one.

This is what they call in industry parlance /'Cruising for a bruising'/.
