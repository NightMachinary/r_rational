The author must be sick of being compared to/mistaken for Wildbow by now but this is something she's managing to do really well with when it comes to Wes. Something I noticed first in Pact (1st chapter, family argument), and then in Ward and Pale were how the characters I immediately despised seemed... real? Like they weren't stock characters WB had constructed, more like people I could imagine meeting, people I feel like I /could/ have met at some point and left a vague impression on me. Believably evil, not unambiguously evil. Wes is a case where I can understand his entire thought process and where he's coming from and also see why it's so difficult to get him to change, and that's something that's difficult to do.
