I think it's pretty clear that Tunnel Vision /has/ to have that level of information on Queen Sulphur, considering the stunt she pulled with the payphones just to have this conversation. However, I think you can square this with the fact that Ana and company haven't been murdered in their homes yet by saying this is a recent development.

It seems perfectly plausible that to me that the Pyre Witch, one of the most powerful and feared projectors currently alive, could find Ana pretty easily if she wanted to. However, it seems equally plausible to me that she doesn't have the time or inclination to chase down every two-bit thug and mercenary who inconveniences her underlings in some way. She's probably got bigger fish to fry and leaves problems on the level of "the Blue Charlatan" to the dumb muscle she employs. Unfortunately for Ana, that calculation likely changed once she personally saw the Pyre Witch doing Pyre Witchey things. At that point, she had enough information to be worth Tunnel Vision's personal attention, especially since she was in the area anyway so it wasn't really inconveniencing her to look into it.

And yes, Wes getting called on his shit is so incredibly satisfying. Here's hoping it sticks this time.
