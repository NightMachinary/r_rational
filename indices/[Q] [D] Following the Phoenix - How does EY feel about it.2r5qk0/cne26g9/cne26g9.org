honestly, it's been ok. ...but it feels like the entire story could be solved by harry and quirrel having a 10-minute conversation.

I mean, their /core/ goals seem to run parallel, or at least not contradictory. Harry wants to create immortality and, while we can't say for sure what quirrel wants, it's clear it has /something/ to do with changing the way government wants.

from either perspective, achieving eachother's goals in return for their goals being achieved is a good deal- quirrel was probably going to shoot for immortality anyway, or at least the possibility of /someone/ aiming to destroy death during his regime hadn't escaped him and harry knows that whatever gov. is put in place wont last forever.

that is, think of harry's perspective like burning every book of or relating to polisci in exchange for immortality- he'd be pretty surprised if we haven't written better polisci books than we burned in a thousand years or so, so even if quirrel's goals plunge them into the political dark ages, it's worth it.

the only real issue is methods- harry does and should disagree with quirrel's methods for acheiving his goals. but that's the thing- that's negotiable, quirrel doesn't care /how/ he changes the gov, only /that/ he changes the gov, and changing the gov. slightly slower in return for a large amount of assistance is worth (especially if your ally makes you immortal)
