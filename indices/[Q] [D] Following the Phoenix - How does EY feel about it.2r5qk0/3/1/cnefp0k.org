I think Quirrel is just maximizing the chance that he, personally, lives happily forever. Rational Sociopathic Human vs. Rational Human. Harry's goal contradicts with his because getting /everyone/ immortal and happy has a higher risk of destroying the world than just getting Quirrel alone to be immortal and happy...which Quirrel has already pulled off fairly well as long as no one destroys the world.

(Living in the Pioneer floating through nothing does not count as "happily". Quirrel doesn't care about people suffering, but sociopaths are still social animals that require other humans for stimulation, comfort, and happiness.)

I agree though - there is a troubling lack of /negotiations/ here.
