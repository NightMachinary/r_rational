  what would releasing all dementors do to prevent an extinction-level event? eventually lead to superior muggle control to prevent WMDs?
#+end_quote

It would lead to a war where Wizards started controlling muggles - a plan which went foul.

  why not just impiruse the muggle gov, then- it's not like they're guarding against it.
#+end_quote

The Wizards would be.
