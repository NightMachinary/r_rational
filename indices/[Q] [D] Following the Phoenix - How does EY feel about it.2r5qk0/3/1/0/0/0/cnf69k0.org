now that's just blatantly untrue. in official HP, they only assigned an auror (and I repeat: AN auror. that is /one/ auror to protect the /prime minister/ against /voldemort's army/) to the british PM after voldemort rose to power. it's clear that they don't routinely protect muggle heads of state. in FTP, the PM having ministry of magic protection is never mentioned. the queen is given protection, but more as temporary protection suitable for an ambassador than strict, round-the-clock security.
