I disagree with your estimation of quirrel's goals: what would releasing all dementors do to prevent an extinction-level event? eventually lead to superior muggle control to prevent WMDs? why not just impiruse the muggle gov, then- it's not like they're guarding against it. and that action eventually led to a bunch of civilian rioters getting their hands on WMDs- hardly controling them

no, that action was, and most of his actions were, designed to create a political impact. to what point and purpose, I'm not sure yet. but the only thing I know for certain is it involves some form of government restructure- otherwise there was no point to almost everything he did.
