This is one of the better stories I'm following right now and in contention for the second best HP fanfic I've read behind HPMOR. Some of the one-shots are brilliant and just full of feeling.

It feels to the HP world a little like what Game of Champions was to Pokémon, at least tone wise.

It's not marked as rat fic but my guess is that's out of an excess of caution or to prevent sparking off a “is this rat fic?” debate, because it reads much like a rat fic.
