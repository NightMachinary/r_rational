Sure! Royalroad looks like it's for original fic only, though.

I'm currently uploading it to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13715432/1/There-is-Nothing-to-Fear][FFN]]. Does that work or is there another site that would be better?

I could also just stitch together the EPUB, MOBI, and PDF files from each story in the series and post those in the series description.
