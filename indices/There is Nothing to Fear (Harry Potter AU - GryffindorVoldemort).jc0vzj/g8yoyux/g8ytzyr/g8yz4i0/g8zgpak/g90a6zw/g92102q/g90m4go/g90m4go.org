(SPOILERS)

I have just one complaint so far and that is Dumbledore should have entered the duel with riddle knowing the children would be put in danger and willing to strike Riddle down. It is a terrible cost, but it is the only path to victory, to ignore the terrorist's threat and strike true for the safety of future children at the risk of those here now. He had to trust in the capacity of the other instructors to save as many of the children as they could from the basilisk and fight all-in. This is too great a weakness I think in someone running a war with these stakes.

Edit: Failure 2 - knowing he will lose, intending to lose, he brings the elder wand. this is double stupid. If he intended to lose or die he should secure it elsewhere.
