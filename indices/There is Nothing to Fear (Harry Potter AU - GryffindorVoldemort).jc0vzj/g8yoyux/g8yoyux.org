I can wholeheartedly recommend this work. It's something I've enjoyed enough to do a reread of everything out so far, which I very rarely do with how much stuff I have on my "things to read" list. My only points of concern I could bring up would that the shift into a focus on Harry and away from Tom could have issues, there haven't been any pre-teen characters interacting with kids their age yet that dialogue could end up off in those interactions, I don't know yet. And my second point is that posting about your work one week into your two week update schedule got me all hyped that I'd misremembered it and looked for an update only to be disappointed. Dick move.

Anyway, read this work.
