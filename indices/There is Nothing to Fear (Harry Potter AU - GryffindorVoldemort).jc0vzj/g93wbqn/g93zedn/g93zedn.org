To a degree! I have an outline of the upcoming 15-20 chapter story, sketches of story after that, a beginning-middle-end for the next 15-20 chapter story, and then a general sense of what will come thereafter (I know how it ends, but the end will be in 3-5 years at my current "one chapter every other week" update rate---which appears to be sustainable so far---so I'm not going to worry about writing an outline several years in an advance).
