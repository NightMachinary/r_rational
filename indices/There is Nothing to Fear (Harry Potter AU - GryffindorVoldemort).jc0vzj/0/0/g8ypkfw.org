  It's something I've enjoyed enough to do a reread of everything out so far

Thank you!

  My only points of concern I could bring up would that the shift into a focus on Harry and away from Tom could have issues, there haven't been any pre-teen characters interacting with kids their age yet that dialogue could end up off in those interactions

/Very/ possible, and something I'm going to be trying to keep an eye out for (also, a reason that I won't be spending much time on the pre-teen years).

  And my second point is that posting about your work one week into your two week update schedule got me all hyped that I'd misremembered it and looked for an update only to be disappointed. Dick move.

Sorry. :( My usual practice is to post first on SV/SB, then wait a week in case anybody's caught an egregious typo or something else needs to be rewritten, so Ao3 (and consequently my reddit posts) are always a week behind.

Anyway, I gotta make up for that, so check your PMs for what I'm posting on SB/SV next week. :)
