I think your first point is a good one: I'd expect the Hogwarts faculty to be able to take down a blindfolded basilisk, especially with initiative on their side.

But as for your second point, I'm assuming based on his dying thoughts that the Elder Wand is part of Dumbledore's bigger plan. That he's not the true master of the wand and is giving Riddle a defective weapon. Although that's maybe too close to canon to be interesting...
