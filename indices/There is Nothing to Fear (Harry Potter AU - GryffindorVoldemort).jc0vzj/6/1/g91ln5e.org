Don't the last two canon books make it pretty clear that death â‰  defeat, for the purposes of transferring mastery of the Elder wand?

Yes, just like in canon, Dumbledore was going into his final encounter with the intention of dying, but, just like in canon, his death would be according to his own plan, and thus it should not give Riddle (or, in canon, Snape), mastery of the wand.

On the other hand, whatever Riddle seems to have cooked up for /after/ Dumbledore's death might change matters.

As for attempting lethal force against Riddle... I have to agree that that is probably the tactically correct decision. However, I don't think I can blame Dumbledore for being either unwilling or unable to commit to it, "weakness" though it may be. These children have been entrusted to his care, and it would take a certain ruthlessness to weigh lives the way you're suggesting he should. Dumbledore is many things, but I don't think ruthless is one of them.
