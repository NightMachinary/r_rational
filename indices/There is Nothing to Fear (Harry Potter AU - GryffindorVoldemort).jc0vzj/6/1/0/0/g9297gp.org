Draco disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him, then Harry disarmed Draco. Therefore Harry was the owner of the Elder Wand for the entirety of the seventh book. Voldemort failed to kill Harry a second time because the Elder Wand knew Harry had explicitly come to die, and that therefore death was victory. Victory condition satisfied, the Wand remained Harry's.
