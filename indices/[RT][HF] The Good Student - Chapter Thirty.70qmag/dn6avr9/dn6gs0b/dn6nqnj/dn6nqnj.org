Ahhhh. That makes much more sense.

On more a story note, it feels nice to have Nic getting closer with Minister Delcroix. There's a satisfaction to seeing Nic grow in influence and become more of a player of his own, especially when he earns it using his 'good student' powers.

In that vein, getting full access to the Librarium was really cool. With the chapter's last time skip though, it seems like we're already almost back at Ranvar, but (other than make him happy and explain how he spent his days) we really didn't get much use out of it. It could have been a nice time to put in some world-building.

Also, just how is Nic paying for all of his transportation? Earlier in the story, it sounded like Nic had to save for a few weeks for a single round trip to the city, and we haven't seen him come into any new income sources.
