Hey, thank you for the thoughtful reply.

I'm still trying to be more of a wise reader [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1w4llw][(from the sidebar link)]]. I'm enjoying your story and respect the effort it takes you to write something like this. It sounds like you took my comments as constructively as I intended.

As some positive feedback, I think the Dizzy part of this chapter helped "fix" my confusion about their earlier interaction at the base camp.
