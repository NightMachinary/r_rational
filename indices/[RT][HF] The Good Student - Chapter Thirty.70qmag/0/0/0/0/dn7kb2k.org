I'd say the biggest issue writing a web serial is the inability to look at the whole and gauge where it needs tweaking. With a traditional novel, you would write the whole thing and then adjust for pacing and general flow and development. Add some world buildinng here, take it out there, and so on.

With a serial written on the fly, you can't do that, so it's very hard to judge, plus the added constraint of having not much time (and even less when things go awry irl) mean I never really know if I'm rushing or stretching until some time later.

It does help when people mention it, I can stop it going to far down one road, but I can never really fix it to the level I would like. It's very frustrating.

Mostly I write on instinct and mine are good enough to get away with it (mostly), but I am guilty of rambling/being abrupt at times. I'm not sure how I'm ever going to really get on top of the problem, though.

BTW I'm writing this mainly because I have a chapter to write and I need to procrastinate somehow.

P.S. I think he had money saved up for travelling, which he hadn't used up, until now.
