Not a typo, but I felt a little jarred by the sudden use of second person pronoun in the otherwise third person narrative voice.

#+begin_quote

I had to parse this a couple times. I think it means, "Use <Nic's connection> (for deliberately unspecified purposes) <after killing him>." In which case, the Minister seems unguarded enough to talk about killing Nic to his face but guarded enough that he won't specify how they intend to "use" his connection. As a reader, I don't think we know if connections can be used on dead people. If that's the case, the text would still be easier to read if it was something like "Terminate him, use the connection, and be done with it."
