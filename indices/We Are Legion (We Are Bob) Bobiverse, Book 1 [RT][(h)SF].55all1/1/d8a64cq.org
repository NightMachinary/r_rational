Just read this in a sitting, on the recommendation. Very enjoyable, overall good concepts with the initial apocalyptic strawmen, but abates by the end. Has some lesser-quality space maneuvering of SevenEves, battles of A Fire Upon the Deep, and some sequences reminiscent of Dragon's Egg. I look forward to seeing more!
