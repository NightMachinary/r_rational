This book would be my Bible if it weren't for all the cringey nerd references and memes the author fires off every once in a while. Even still, I love it.

The moment in the book where I had the question: why did he experience time faster or slower? Wouldn't he be in control of that? And the book answered, almost immediately. It told me that we were on the same wavelength.

I think this book could do without reactionless thrusters. I don't think any magic tech is really required at all. But again. I'm willing to forgive it there.

Love it. Would love it more without the insecent nerd culture that permeates it. Oh well. I want more.

Mooooooore.

I love this book.

Looking forward to the sequel due for April in Ernest.
