Okay I'll be honest I asked someone here if they were published and didn't announce it when this showed up in my recommended buys on amazon. I'm about 50% through and it is a delight to read something targeted directly at my flair.

The good: Characterization. Humor similar to ready player one (very Trek influenced). Reasonable approaches for being a copy-clan. Passages through the Void concepts being treated with in public media. Uploaded cryonicist is the protagonist.

The not so good: Light on the physics porn, some of the problem solving is treated as drudgery and glossed over, some YMMV cringey straw man treatment of religion and YMMV unlikely dystopian assumptions to set up the scenario.
