Just finished it on Audible. Overall, I liked it, but I'm also unfairly comparing it to Revelation Space. I think the author is setting up a platform for an awesome Bobiverse, but as Empiricist said, it's a bit light on problem solving, which, for Bob the engineer, I'd think would have been a bigger part of the narrative. For the short duration of the book, I think they author tried to cover too much ground, with too many Bobs, and too many story lines that didn't intersect in any interesting way.

But, I will read or listen to Book 2 when it comes out.
