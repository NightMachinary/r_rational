From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Tapirs have brachyodont, or low-crowned teeth, that lack cementum. Their incisors are chisel-shaped, with the third large, conical upper incisor separated by a short gap from the considerably smaller canine. A much longer gap is found between the canines and premolars, the first of which may be absent.

Unexpected indeed.
