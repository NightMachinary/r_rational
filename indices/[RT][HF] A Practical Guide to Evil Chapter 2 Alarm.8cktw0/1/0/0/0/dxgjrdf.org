No, no, you got it backwards: I meant that Thief caried in her satchel a glamour-created copy of Catherine, who can now, similarly to Malicia in Swan Song, talk to Cordelia once a month (for now I'm assuming that's because, like with portal opening, there are arcane reset points for that power, only instead of sunrise it's a coming of a moonless night).

Paladin bullshitted his way through the glamour because otherwise he'd lose. Maybe Cat set it up that way, so her new undead puppet wouldn't be just a straight up bruiser.
