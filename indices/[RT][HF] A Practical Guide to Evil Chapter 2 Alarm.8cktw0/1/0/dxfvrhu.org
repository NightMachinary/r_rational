Note the wording:

  They were the First Prince's primary opposition within Procer, though, so I suspected she would not be shy about spending their lives to damage my position.

This implies that whatever their negotiations were about, the concentration of the rival princes in the host isn't a part of any kind of deal.

By the way, seeing as she isn't using the Observatory for the negotiations, and Thief was needed to deliver the means of communication rather than the message itself, I have an out-there guess. What if the glamoured body double Cat was talking about with Vivienne isn't for her, but for Catherine herself, to negotiate with Cordelia "in person", like the Empress did in Liesse?
