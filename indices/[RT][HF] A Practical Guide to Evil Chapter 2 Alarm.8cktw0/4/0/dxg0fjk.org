Alternatively, if heroes fight it and and one of them gets an Aspect out of that fight, it may well be a silver bullet against Cat. The demon is: 1) an otherworldly entity with a gaggle of other otherworldly entities (bonus points if heroes banish them by abusing their bindings, since magical binding Aspect is one of the means of control over fairies Catherine inherited from Akua); 2) a being of Absense, which is similar to the idea Winter is built around; 3) a demon with a mental background effect on Creation, overcoming which may allow the heroes to also work around the glamour (Catherine's latest and most versatile tool).

Elaborating on the last poiint: the lands of Yan Tei were said to have disappeared from the histories for two centuries because of a demon of Absense, and apparently returned relatively whole and well. That points to it having effects that affect the living more than the Creation itself (like Madness or Apathy), and not just some irreversible effects on the world (like Time and Order). While it probably has the latter too, the former is a good setup for an emergence of an Aspect like Discern.
