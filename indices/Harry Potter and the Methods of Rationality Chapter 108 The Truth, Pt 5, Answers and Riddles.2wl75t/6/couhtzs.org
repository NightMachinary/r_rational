Here's a question:

#+begin_quote
  "Now for the Mirror," said Professor Quirrell, and he drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility from his robes, and floated it to drop before Harry's shoes.
#+end_quote

Is this the real Cloak? If it is, has Quirrellmort figured out it might do more than just make the wearer invisible?

From this chapter's conversation, it seems like it's been established that AK doesn't /have/ a failure state as it did in canon on Harry, so it might be something that just wasn't thought about. It might have anti-death effects as well.

Obviously I'm borrowing a bit from Following the Phoenix, but it could be relevant and that could have been a long term plan that the subfic just got to first.

On a related note, is it not /really weird/ to anyone else that Voldemort doesn't even question that the Stone must have at some point been made by human mages? Admittedly Perinelle's Stone Ritual was a false flag, but the real thing must have been created at some point. He never mentions Atlantis or the obviously overpowered Precursors who created magic or whatever the system is, and he seems to have ignored the descensionist tinge of wizarding history in a way Harry has not.

If Harry escapes this situation and survives without destroying Quirrelmort, I can only assume that some aspect of that concept fits into his final victory:

Voldemort seems content with being the strongest and immortal.

I don't think Harry has an end-point content state.
