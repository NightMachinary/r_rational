  What tools would be most useful for a group of people who often need to operate as a team in dangerous circumstances?
#+end_quote

(Things that seem useful, seem like things you'll already be doing.)

Work on the skills*** you need to use - individually, and as a group.

Work on team work/team effectiveness. (Make sure everyone has what's needed to communicate. I don't know how Search & Rescue operates or how likely it is for the team/individual members to get lost, but sensible ways of operating might prepare for this (communication devices* such as walky-talkies) and prevent it (buddy system + navigator tech &/or skills****).

Other answers mentioned domain specific knowledge.** This might be what you're looking for. You could try research, and talking to people - *do you know anyone who has done this?*

*Only thing I might add here is backup batteries. Also might be a good idea if you won't necessarily be back somewhere you can charge stuff for a time. Generally make sure you have everything you're supposed to have. (Use a checklist?)

**If I were to make this point, I'd say, knowledge wise, the goal isn't re-inventing the wheel - it's getting up to speed. I started this with skills and equipment because those will probably be needed, and are how preparation/planning cashes out - they're what you need to achieve the goal.

***I'm not sure if this is your job (find out), but depending on the circumstances, in addition to /finding/ people, if they're injured/too cold/too hot/starving/thirsty/etc. or some combination thereof, having skills to recognize the problem + stuff to fix it might be useful. Emergency blankets, basic first aid (skills and supplies), etc.

****I don't think you'll end up needing to navigate using only a paper map (perhaps best sealed in a bag, so it's safe from water) and a compass, but I could be wrong.
