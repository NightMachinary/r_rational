  DaystarEld's "problem debriefing" from OoS, in which each team member brings forward the things they did wrong & could improve on, seems perfectly suited to this. Any other suggestions of tactics, or of different topics that a bookish rationalist could usefully teach a group of hardy outdoorspeople?

Also from DaystarEld, but I really like pre-mortems. They could be especially useful to go through en route to the problem area, as a way of preparing for the likely issues you will face once you arrive.
