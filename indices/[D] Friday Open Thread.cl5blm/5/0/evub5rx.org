You would probably want to classify your skills as planning, rather than something specific and obscure as eliminating biases. You don't want to try explaining why some processes could be biased during an emergency situation, that would be insane given how long it could take, you would want to be one of the people who sets up the procedures that are taught to everyone for emergency situations. Although it's an open question as to whether those procedures are currently biased enough that you could meaningfully improve them in a short time.

Honestly it just doesn't seem like all that applicable a skillset. Maybe try doing some cardio at the gym so that even if you aren't skilled in what the group does, you wouldn't be physically left behind.
