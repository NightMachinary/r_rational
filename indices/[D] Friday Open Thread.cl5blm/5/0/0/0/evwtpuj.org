Better start lifting and running with weight for S&R. Where I'm from it means a lot of stretcher carries, running with your pack of gear, lifting people, moving obstacles, and stabilizing spines/breaks in awkward positions.

I'm also a distance runner and it's especially rough because being good at moving your bodyweight means little compared to moving the average person.
