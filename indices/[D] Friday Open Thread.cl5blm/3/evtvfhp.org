Is there something like a chapter synopsis of the Sequences?

I've finally got around to start reading them, but I find myself forgetting some of the earlier chapters I've read, it doesn't help that many chapter titles aren't very indicative of the content, and often it takes a while for Yudkowsky to get to his point. So I was wondering if is there a table somewhere with just a few words to help me remember whenever I forget something so I don't need to scan through several pages to remember. Something similar to that [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-chapter-synopsis.291627/][Worm Chapter Synopsys you can find on SpaceBattles]].
