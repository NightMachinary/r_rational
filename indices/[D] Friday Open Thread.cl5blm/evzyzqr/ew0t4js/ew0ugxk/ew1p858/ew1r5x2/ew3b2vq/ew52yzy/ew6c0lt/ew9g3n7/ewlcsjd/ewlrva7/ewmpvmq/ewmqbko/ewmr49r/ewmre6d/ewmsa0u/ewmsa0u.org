Your argument hinges on an AI simulating us, and extracting us into another simulation where we can continue living.

[[/u/Anakir]] says that there is no need for an AI to wait for you die first, it could simulate you and extract you at any moment.

Why do you think simulation-extraction is possible on a dying entity, but not a living one? If 99 copies of you are going to be extracted in 1 minutes time, shouldn't you expect a 99% chance of being extracted?
