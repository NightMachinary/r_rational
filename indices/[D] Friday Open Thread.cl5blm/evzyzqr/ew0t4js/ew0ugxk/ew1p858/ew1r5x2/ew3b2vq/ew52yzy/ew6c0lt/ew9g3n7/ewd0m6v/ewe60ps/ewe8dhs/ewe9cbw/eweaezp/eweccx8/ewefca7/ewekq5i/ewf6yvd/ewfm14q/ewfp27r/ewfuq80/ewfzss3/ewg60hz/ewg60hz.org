  I'm saying that "universes produce new universes of some description" is strictly simpler than "universes produce new universes comprising the set of all conceivable universes". Nowhere did I say all universes had to be the same.

I thought we'd agreed that adding restrictions on what a model/hypothesis "produces" doesn't make it simpler.

  Of the overall point? Not by a mile, no.

Then I wish I understood your rejection better. So far it doesn't seem very grounded in epistemology.

  "Space is expanding" is different from "space is infinite". The former is completely consistent with finite density and finite mass, and would see a steady decrease in the overall density of the universe, eventually leading to the finite clumps of energy and mass, beyond which is primarily empty space.
#+end_quote

But the former is what involves the speed of light being exceeded. The speed of light limits movement through space, not the expansion of space itself.

Are you now agreeing that finite mass is inconsistent with infinite space and nonzero density?
