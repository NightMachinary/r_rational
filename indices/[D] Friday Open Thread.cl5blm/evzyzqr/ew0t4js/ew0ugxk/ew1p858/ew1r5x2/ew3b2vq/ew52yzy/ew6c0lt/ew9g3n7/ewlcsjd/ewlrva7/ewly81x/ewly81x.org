  Further, Occam's razor is extremely useful, but it is just a heuristic. The simplest explanation that fits your current knowledge is not always actually the true one.

  But it's the one that rationality requires you to employ.

Not really.

You should be aware of your level of certainty of your beliefs, and how each supposition makes the whole thing less likely.

You shouldn't pick a possibility and say "This is the most simple, therefore it's true. Following on from this, the following thing is most likely, therefore it's true..."

If you have three steps of supposition, each of which you think has an 80% chance of being correct, this gives you a 51% chance of being right overall. Clearly this isn't a very good tenet to follow!
