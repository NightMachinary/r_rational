I still have no idea how this connects to the afterlife. I'm guessing you're going for some kind of Quantum Immortality scenario, but this doesn't really map to an afterlife.

Can you give your argument so we're all on the same page? Here's my model of your argument:

- Our reality could be run on a Turing Machine (TM).
- A TM could enumerate every possible reality and run it.
- We're more likely to be on the second TM than the first.
- There is a version of you in multiple realities. ??
- ???
- Afterlife.

Please provide your entire chain of reasoning.
