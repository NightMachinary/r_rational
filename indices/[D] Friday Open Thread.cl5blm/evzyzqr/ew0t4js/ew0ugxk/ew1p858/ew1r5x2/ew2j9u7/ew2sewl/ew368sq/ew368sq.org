  How about "every possible reality that contains us"? Isn't that the basis of probabilistic reasoning?

No? Nothing about probabilistic reasoning implies any kind of splitting, or any support for a many-worlds interpretation of reality. We use probabilistic reasoning simply because we can't take perfect measurements of reality, not because there are multiple realities to be measured. It seems your arguments (?) are predicated on a multiple-worlds interpretation of reality. There's just no real evidence for that.

But without really understanding what point you're trying to make with the whole "universal dovetailer function" thing I can't really elaborate.
