Not really, but I've heard enough similar arguments that I think I can still make the point. You may need to elaborate.

We certainly don't have enough evidence that every possible reality exists to make any sweeping statements about reality, if that's what you're hinting at. If anything the anthropic principle strongly suggests otherwise, boltzmann brains notwithstanding.

That's all esoteric enough that it's not really going to be useful though. We try to stick to the practical.
