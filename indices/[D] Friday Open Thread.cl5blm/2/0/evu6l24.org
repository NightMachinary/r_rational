I think the tokenism you see in current Hollywood blockbusters is more or less how it's going to be going forward. There won't be /all/ asian characters, but there will probably be more of them. Partly I think that Hollywood isn't going to be able to out-China China, if that makes sense, and it really doesn't seem like the current state of affairs is hurting consumer response in China, at least so far as I can tell.

Current trends:

- Token characters who are Chinese and/or big names in China
- Minor Chinese characters who have a larger role in the plot in the Chinese cut
- Awareness/avoidance of Chinese taboos or things that the Chinese government doesn't like (no Taiwan, Tibet, Tienanmen Square)
- More movies that adapt Chinese history and/or mythology
- Elements of Chinese propaganda and/or changes to meet Chinese government approval
- Movies set in China
- Chinese product placement

I think all those are on-track to continue, but I'm skeptical that we're going to see Hollywood succeed at catering to the Chinese audience by being more Chinese in other ways. One high-profile failure was /The Great Wall/, which failed to capture the market share in China that it was hoped to. More attempts will obviously be made, but if you're going to have a full Chinese cast with a very Chinese story, it doesn't make sense (to me) to have it be made in/by Hollywood at all. (And I personally think that Hollywood is better off not having much of China in their films, given how much the Chinese government likes to regulate the appearance of China and Chinese characters in their films, which really constrains the kinds of stories that can be told.)
