How do you think Hollywood movie production will change as China becomes an increasingly large market? They have 5x the population of the US, so if they begin to watch movies as much as the US, Europe, etc. it'll become much profitable to target them as a demographic. Will franchises like the MCU slowly shift over to asian characters do you think?
