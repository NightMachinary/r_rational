Fair enough. Thanks for the discussion.

In the hope of having the record straight for my part:

  Again, I am not the one putting in restrictions here. I am saying that there are many possible forms that a universe-producing cycle could take, the majority of which do not produce every conceivable universe.
#+end_quote

While still accounting for all of our observations? I'd like to see the math on that.

#+begin_quote
  If two bits of matter are far enough apart, then the expansion of space between them is faster than the speed of light. Doesn't that put an upper bound on the size of any such system?
#+end_quote

That doesn't sound right. With density constant, as the distance increases doesn't the force of gravity countering the expansion increase too? And it would make the universe effectively finite after all, given the limit of ways matter can be arranged within a limited volume. But it is something I hadn't considered, and it might be true.

  Low enough to not consider it the /guarantee/ your initial post implies.
#+end_quote

If anything, the stereotypical rationalists are the ones who speak in guarantees. "No matter how small the odds for cryo-preservation, they're /guaranteed/ to be better than for dirt preservation". And they're (stereotypically) the same ones who love to talk about the "Big World" and its supposed implications.
