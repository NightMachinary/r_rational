  I mean, if you know a good briefing/debriefing system, it is something worth sharing, but otherwise, specific domain knowledge beats general rationality almost every time.

  One failure mode of rationalism and other self-help domains is trying too hard to apply a few specific techniques in situations where they don't really bring anything.

Perhaps better to phrase that as "thinking hard is overrated". In this case I agree with you that domain knowledge wins. Because we agree on this, I propose that having / relying on domain knowledge is the rational thing to do - and us deciding whether to rely on domain knowledge, or to question it, is us being rational.
