I wouldn't work for the government. I would be a high end courier who can take your package directly from your door to it's intended recipient in a flash. I would charge enough that I could cover a reasonable standard of living for myself as well as hire competent people at decent wages to deal with the legals, client management, etc.

Perhaps I would do a combination of private couriering door to door as well as m9ve bulk deliveries internationally (maybe transporting produce to far off countries saving on refrigeration or whatever else is involved in transit).

Part of the job of the people I hire would be to ensure I never transport something I find ethically questionable like weapons, I would probably carry a scanner to check on things or require a visual inspection.

I think I would also not necessarily need to make a lot of money if I didn't want to. I could have a tent I pitch up wherever the weather's good, teleport to public toilets wherever they're cleanest, bathe in hot springs, forage food from several countries or eat at temples where food is free. I think at 16 something like this would have been appealing to me. It's also appealing to know you can afford to turn down work cause you'd always be fine anyways.
