Personal opinion here: rationality is overrated.

I mean, if you know a good briefing/debriefing system, it /is/ something worth sharing, but otherwise, specific domain knowledge beats general rationality almost every time.

One failure mode of rationalism and other self-help domains is trying too hard to apply a few specific techniques in situations where they don't really bring anything.

If you wanna go that route, I'd recommend looking into crisis management advice from other emergency workers (eg emergency triage, risk-taking, advice on communication in crisis situations) and look for applicable exercises.
