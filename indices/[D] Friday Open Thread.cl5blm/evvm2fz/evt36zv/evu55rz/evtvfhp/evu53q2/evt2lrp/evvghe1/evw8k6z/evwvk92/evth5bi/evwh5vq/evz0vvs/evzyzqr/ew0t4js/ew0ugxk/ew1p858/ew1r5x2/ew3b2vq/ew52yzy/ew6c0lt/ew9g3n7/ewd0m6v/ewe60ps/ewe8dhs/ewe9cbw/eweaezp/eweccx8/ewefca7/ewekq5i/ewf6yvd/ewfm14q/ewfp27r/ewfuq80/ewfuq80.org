  That is not the simplest form of turtle, though! The simplest form of that assumption would be that the universe in some way reproduces other universes, not that the universe in some way produces every single conceivable kind of universe ad infinitum!

Are you saying that it's simpler to assume that the universe somehow produces only identical copies of itself?

#+begin_quote
  Sure, fine. That's acceptable.

Then I've convinced you?

  How are you spreading a central source of energy across infinite space in finite time at all? The universe does have a speed limit.
#+end_quote

Are you rejecting the Big Bang and cosmic inflation, then?

  To answer your question, though, I would not expect energy to distribute itself evenly, but clump together, leaving more energy in some places and less (maybe even no or negligible quantities) in others.

So we inhabit a finite "clump" of matter and energy, beyond which is infinite empty space without even background radiation? Why assume that our region of the universe is atypical?
