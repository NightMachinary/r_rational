  I'm not convinced that that's a better term; it sounds like "transformations" of a mind into a different mind. (And it's longer.) But I'll switch to it provisionally.
#+end_quote

I /do/ intend for the term "mind-transformation" to refer to the tranformation of one instantaneous mindstate into a (slightly) different instantaneous mindstate. My whole point is that I care about the transformation over time, not just the instantaneous configuration.

#+begin_quote
  Going back to the point, though, does every possible mind-transformation not have a successor somewhere in an infinitely varied meta-reality? What more is necessary for it to count as "you"; and why wouldn't a transformation that met that requirement also exist?
#+end_quote

For an algorithm that runs on a mindstate in order to produce a successor mindstate, it is a requirement that there be a direct causal relationship between the two mindstates. That relationship needs to exist because that's where the algorithm is. Unless something weird happens with the speed of light and physical interactions, spatiotemporal proximity is a requirement for that. If a mind-moment is somewhere out in the infinity of meta-reality, but not /here/, then it is disqualified from being a continuation of the me who is speaking, since it could not have come about by a valid transformation of the mind-moment I am currently operating on. Similarly, being reconfigured by a personality-altering drug is not a valid transformation, and the person who comes out the other side is not me; taking such a drug is death.

  Why would any substantial fraction of the programs that don't care about you extract and reinstantiate you in the first place?
#+end_quote

Most likely, because that's just what they were told to do. You're talking about AI; They "care" insofar as they were programmed to do that, or they extrapolated that action from inadequate training data. There are a lot of ways for /programmers/ to make mistakes in ways that leave the resulting program being radically, self-improvingly optimized for correctly implementing the wrong thing.

It's not about good versus evil, it's about how hard it is to perfectly specify what an AI should do, then, additionally, perfectly impement that specification. Do you think that most intelligently designed programs in the real world always do exactly what their designer would have wanted them to do?

  When faced with a decision that requires distinguishing between hypotheses, rationality requires you to employ your best guess regardless of how weak it is.
#+end_quote

If someone holds a gun to your head and will shoot you if you're wrong, sure. But if there is no immediate threat, I think you will usually get better results in the real world if you admit that your actual best guess is "I don't know."
