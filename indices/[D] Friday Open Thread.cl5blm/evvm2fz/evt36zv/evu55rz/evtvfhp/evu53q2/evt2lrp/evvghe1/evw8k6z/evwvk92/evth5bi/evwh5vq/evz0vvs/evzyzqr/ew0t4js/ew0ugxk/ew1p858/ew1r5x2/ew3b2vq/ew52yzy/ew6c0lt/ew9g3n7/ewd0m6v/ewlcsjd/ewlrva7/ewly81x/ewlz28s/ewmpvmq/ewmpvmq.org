  You are postulating a multiverse where infinitely many successor mindstates of "you" are being kidnapped by every mathematically possible kidnapper, all the time.

Are you disagreeing with the moral connotations of the word "kidnapper", or are you saying that the "kidnapping" won't impact the real you?
