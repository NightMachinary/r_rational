  What did you think was being transformed? My mind is made of your mind-moments in the same way that my body is made of atoms: more than one, and with specific physical relationships between them, but they are a necessary component. Did I not introduce the concept as the derivative of mind-moments over time? If the derivative is undefined, then there is no "me".
#+end_quote

Is time necessarily continuous and infinitely divisible, rather than a series of discrete "ticks" between discrete states?

#+begin_quote
  /I/ wouldn't, because I don't bargain with death
#+end_quote

What does this mean?

#+begin_quote
  minor disruptions to my mind happen all the time...the resulting algorithm is slightly less "me" than the preceding one (or the preceding one is less "me" than the resulting one, depending on which one you ask)
#+end_quote

That's exactly (partly) why I was/am so incredulous that your sense of identity/anticipation is dependent on something so fluid and potentially imperceptible. Are the "rules" even rigorously defined?

#+begin_quote
  To my knowledge, I've never experienced such a significant instantaneous disruption that I would consider death.
#+end_quote

Is "significant, instantaneous" a necessary condition now? You didn't specify the hypothetical drug working instantaneously. What difference does it make, if the end result is the same?

#+begin_quote
  Nearly zero, of course. But of the ones that do instantiate a version of you, most of them are /still/ bugged.
#+end_quote

Most /ways of making mistakes/ result in bugs, yes.

  My answer to literally all of those questions is "[shrug] I dunno. Do what you want. Maybe don't be a dick, though?"
#+end_quote

"Dunnoing" isn't one of the options. Which is the "good" and which the "dick" option is (at least for part of that, and in many more situations) exactly the question.

#+begin_quote
  I do recommend having some half-reasonable deontological safety rails, however you choose to implement them, and most half-reasonable deontological safety rails have a "Don't be a dick" clause. That'll serve you better than hair-splitting utilitarianism that you physically can't calculate.
#+end_quote

The rational[ist] response to an uncalculable problem is to make the best approximation that you can; not to pretend to not care. There's nothing "safe" about trying to outsource your decisions. And eventually, you'll find yourself beyond where the rails can guide you.
