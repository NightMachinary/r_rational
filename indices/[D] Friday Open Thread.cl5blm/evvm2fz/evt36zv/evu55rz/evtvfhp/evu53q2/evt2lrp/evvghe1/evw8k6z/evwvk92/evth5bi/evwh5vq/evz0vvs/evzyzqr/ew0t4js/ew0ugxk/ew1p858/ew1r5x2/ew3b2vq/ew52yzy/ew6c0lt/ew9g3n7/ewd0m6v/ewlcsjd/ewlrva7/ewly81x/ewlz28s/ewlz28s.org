It's possible that there exists an AI running the UDF, which extracts entities upon death.

Why wait? Why not an AI that extracts you now?

Why not an AI that extracts a version of you from every moment of your life?

Why not an AI that does the above and gives you a puppy, a pineapple, a live grenade, a punch in the ear?
