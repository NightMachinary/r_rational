I've been wondering- is there some sort of updated map/link directory to other rationalist communities?

And I don't mean Slate Star Codex or Lesswrong. I mean international communities.

Various political terms, 'famous' people references, references in general, meetup locations and CFAR made me realize- I am an outsider here, in practical terms. It's an American site with (mostly) American people, referring to events and terms local to you. It'll be nice to find a place where a theoretical meetup wouldn't require getting a visa and crossing the ocean.

Other than that, it'll be fascinating to see how does this community connect to others- rationalists are focused on global issues, and it's hard to work on those alone.
