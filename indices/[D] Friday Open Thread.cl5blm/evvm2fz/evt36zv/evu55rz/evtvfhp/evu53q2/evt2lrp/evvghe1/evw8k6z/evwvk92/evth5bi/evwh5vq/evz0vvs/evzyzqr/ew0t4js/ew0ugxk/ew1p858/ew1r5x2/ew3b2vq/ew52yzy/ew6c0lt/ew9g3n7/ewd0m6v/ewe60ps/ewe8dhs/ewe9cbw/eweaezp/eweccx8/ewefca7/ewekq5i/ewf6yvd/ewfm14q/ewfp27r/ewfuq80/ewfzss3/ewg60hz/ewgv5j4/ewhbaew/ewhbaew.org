  The former isn't the one putting in restrictions, the latter is. The former is true across the set of all realities in which universes produce other universes of any description. The latter is only true in the subset of those realities in which universes generate /every conceivable/ universe. The probability space is narrower for the latter than the former, hence the latter is the more restricted.

But if universes produce others, which produce others, and so on ad infinitum, they'll eventually produce all universes possible within whatever variance is allowed.

Also, it sounds like you're now acknowledging multiple realities regardless.

  Ah, okay. Let me make sure I understand what you're suggesting. The idea you have is that the universe starts with infinite energy of infinite density at a singularity.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say "singularity", but essentially. This is where you get infinite energy รท infinite density = ???.

#+begin_quote
  Then, space expands at infinite speed, creating a universe of infinite space, with finite energy at any given point.
#+end_quote

Depends on how you define speed of expansion. Any two actual points are separated by finite distance, and moving away from each other at finite speed proportional to that distance.

  Is that correct? If so, then I'll offer my rebuttal
#+end_quote

Offer it to the mainstream cosmologists; I'm just describing my understanding of the mainstream "infinite universe" model. Do I have it wrong?
