Thanks for answering in [[/u/Revisional_Sin]]'s absence.

  Sure we do, and sure we can. That which /is/, is real. All possible things either do or do not exist as a subset of our own universe, the only one that we can observe and know.
#+end_quote

What "is", and what we can observe and know, are exactly what seems to be in dispute.

#+begin_quote
  This is a perfectly coherent place to draw a line, if you're inclined to use Occam's razor to conclude that the smallest possible number of things are real.
#+end_quote

But that's not what Occam's razor does.

#+begin_quote
  I am not convinced that a universal dovetailer is the simplest possible algorithm that contains our universe. I don't know of any specific alternatives, mind, but I'm not aware of any irrefutable proof that that is as good as it could possibly get. I'm not even convinced that it is necessarily simpler than our universe's theory of everything on its own, which I expect will end up being pretty short.
#+end_quote

The shorter it is, the less it specifies and the more it allows/produces.

#+begin_quote
  Further, Occam's razor is extremely useful, but it is just a heuristic. The simplest explanation that fits your current knowledge is not always actually the true one.
#+end_quote

But it's the one that rationality requires you to employ.

#+begin_quote
  You are using a rather idiosyncratic definition of "experience of consciousness" here. In the majority of philosophical conceptions of identity, this is /not/ sufficient to count as "you".
#+end_quote

If you're not somewhere in an infinite variety of possible mind-moments, where /are/ you?

#+begin_quote
  If you're willing to stomach the infinite processing power that this requires
#+end_quote

"Reality/existence has limited processing power" is a pretty esoteric hypothesis in itself.

#+begin_quote
  most mathematically valid systems that harvest minds are not the sorts of places you would want your mind to end up, I think.
#+end_quote

This comes down to whether you believe that good is stronger than evil.

#+begin_quote
  The vast majority of such systems don't politely wait until your process naturally ends, either.
#+end_quote

How are you calculating that?

#+begin_quote
  You are postulating a multiverse where infinitely many successor mindstates of "you" are being kidnapped by every mathematically possible kidnapper, all the time.
#+end_quote

Is downloading a song theft?

#+begin_quote
  In fact, there is a sense in which "most" possible future mindstates involve you being stolen out of reality /right now/.
#+end_quote

Do "senses" come into it? Is Kolmogorov complexity not the only systematic way of assigning probability/measure so that the sum over all hypotheses/outcomes/realities is 1?

#+begin_quote
  The fact that you've gone a whole lot of Planck times without being kidnapped is evidence that there is no infinite kidnapping going on, or else that you are lucky to be one of the strains of your mind that evolved this far without interference.
#+end_quote

But not evidence that can distinguish between the two.

#+begin_quote
  ...How? We /know/ that, within quantum physics, your current mindstate has at least one physically permitted successor state. If you are sure of anything, you should be sure of that.
#+end_quote

Isn't the "many-worlds interpretation" of quantum physics hotly disputed? Is this that "inverted certainty" that G. K. Chesterton talked about?

#+begin_quote
  Compared to that, how certain are you that there is not a single mis-step in this entire chain of suppositions?
#+end_quote

I was specifically asked to explain the reasoning for the position in as much detail as possible. Are you now asking me to take the length of that explanation as evidence against it?
