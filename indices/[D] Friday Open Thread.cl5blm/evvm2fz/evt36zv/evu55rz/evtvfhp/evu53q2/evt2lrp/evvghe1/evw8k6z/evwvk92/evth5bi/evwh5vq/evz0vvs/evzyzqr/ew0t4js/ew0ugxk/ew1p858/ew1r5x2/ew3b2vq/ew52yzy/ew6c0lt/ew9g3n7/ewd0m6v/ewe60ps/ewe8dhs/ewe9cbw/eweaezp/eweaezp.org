  And that nevertheless could plausibly produce our universe? How?
#+end_quote

Instead of assuming initial conditions that produce a universal dovetailer that produces a turing machine that produces our universe, you could instead assume initial conditions that produce a turing machine that produces our universe. It's a simpler assumption, and also one that doesn't posit infinitely many universes we have no indication exist.

  Even at the quantum level, with virtual particles and the like? Some people say that the universe began with infinite energy at infinite density; is that now known to be wrong?
#+end_quote

/Known/ to be wrong? No, we don't have any ironclad proof of that. We also don't have any ironclad proof that the universe didn't begin as three interlocking serpents, each consuming the tail of another. But given that the universe does not /currently/ appear to contain infinite energy, and given that infinite energy does not reduce to finite energy no matter how many times you subdivide it, there is not a strong case in favor of the claim. (Starting from infinite density is another matter entirely, and is assumed by the Big Bang Theory.)

Edit: sorry, forgot to address the first part of that. Quantum Mechanics /may/, conceivably, allow for breaking continuous time translation symmetry, but again, scientific knowledge hasn't advanced to the point where we can make that claim with any confidence.
