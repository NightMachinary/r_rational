  I thought we'd agreed that adding restrictions on what a model/hypothesis "produces" doesn't make it simpler.
#+end_quote

The former isn't the one putting in restrictions, the latter is. The former is true across the set of all realities in which universes produce other universes of any description. The latter is only true in the subset of those realities in which universes generate /every conceivable/ universe. The probability space is narrower for the latter than the former, hence the latter is the more restricted.

  Then I wish I understood your rejection better. So far it doesn't seem very grounded in epistemology.

Gezundheit.

  But the former is what involves the speed of light being exceeded. The speed of light limits movement through space, not the expansion of space itself.

  Are you now agreeing that finite mass is inconsistent with infinite space and nonzero density?
#+end_quote

Ah, okay. Let me make sure I understand what you're suggesting. The idea you have is that the universe starts with infinite energy of infinite density at a singularity. Then, space expands at infinite speed, creating a universe of infinite space, with finite energy at any given point. Is that correct? If so, then I'll offer my rebuttal, but first I want to make sure that that is in fact what you mean.
