Hey now, them's fighting words. Twig was also excellent, but I enjoyed Pact much more.

Though for recommendations I'd add Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson. It's a fantasy series following the Malazan Empire, with a thoroughly unique magic system. Each book starts out painfully slow, so try to push through it if it doesn't catch you attention immediately. Also, it's 3.4 million words total, or somewhere in there.
