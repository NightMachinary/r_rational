I know this is more suited to the Monday thread, but I've just caught up with the Cradle books and am looking for something else to sink my teeth into.

My main requirement is that its something that can distract me for long periods of time so ideally something long (right now I'd prefer series to standalone books unless the books are really long) but also not so challenging to read that it needs to be read in one chapter chunks. It doesn't have to be rational or rational adjacent, I've just seen a lot of people here share my taste in books.

Things I've enjoyed (list not exhaustive): hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, most of Terry Pratchett's stuff, Neil Gaiman's stuff, The Gods Are Bastards, Worth the Candle, Worm, Sanderson's books, Meiville's book, The Magicians series, Mother of Learning, Ready Player One, Ender's Game series, Dune
