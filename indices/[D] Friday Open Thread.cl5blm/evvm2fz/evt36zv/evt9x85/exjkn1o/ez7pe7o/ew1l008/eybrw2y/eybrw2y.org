Ah geez this is a bump

Um. It's basically radio waves (not literally radio, but an electromagnetic something-or-other that can affect how neurons fire).

I took rationalization in the direction of "explain what /else/ thought-speak can do, then" rather than "explain where this came from/how it works." Thus, /given/ the ability to alter the firing of neurons in someone else's brain at long distance, what else can you do? You can scream, like Garrett, and you can cause humans to have seizures, like Ax, and you can do something that, in his own head, Visser Three refers to as "Compulsion"?
