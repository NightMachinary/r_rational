This my /Animorphs: The Reckoning/ encouragement mini-thread, inspired by a conversation I had at lunch when I recommended the fic to someone.

To [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]]: if you need any help and/or encouragement, here it is! We totally believe in you, and we know that whatever you post, it's going to be awesome! I myself can't wait to read what follows last chapter's cliffhanger.

To everyone else, if you've recently felt the need to post anything related to r!Animorphs or whatever, or if you want to encourage the author yourself, this is the thread.
