The GMTK Game Jam starts in about 35 minutes (2pm UK time). We on the [[/r/rational]] discord have a team of around 7 people aiming to contribute at least a little in various disciplines. If you can do digital art and would like to make it look a little prettier, or you just want to help playtest, or just want to admire the chaos, then the server's thattaway: [[https://discord.gg/cpqPkYx]].

We'll be sure to post our monstrous creation here next week so you can gawk and laugh at it.
