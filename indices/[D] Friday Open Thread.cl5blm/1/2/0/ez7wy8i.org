It hurts me every bit as much as it hurts you guys; I'm only writing this because I want to get to read it. <3 <3

I'm going to wait until I have four in the tank before I start posting again, because I want to /try/ to post regularly to the very end. My guess is you'll want to look for a new chapter round about October 1, but maybe as late as October 15-20.
