I've written Ax and Marco and an interlude and am currently writing Rachel. Once Rachel is finished and I'm at least a third of the way through whoever's next, I'll start publishing. So a little slower than Oct 20 (obvs) but I wouldn't be surprised if it was this week, and I /would/ be surprised if it was /more/ than the end of next week.
