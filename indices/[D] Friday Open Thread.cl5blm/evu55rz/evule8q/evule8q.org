I mean it seems like to a certain extent it's just more of the big budget, large amount of special effects type things, ala the Transformers movies or i dunno the Warcraft movie did pretty well overseas. I've heard that if anything the lowering of the story elements and increasing of the more Action Movie plot made it do better in China although it could just be that over time there are more people watching movies in general. But even from last year the Hollywood movies that sold the best were like Infinity Wars, the Jurassic Park movie, Aquaman, Venom. And from this year it's much the same in terms of big ticket action films with impressive special effects.
