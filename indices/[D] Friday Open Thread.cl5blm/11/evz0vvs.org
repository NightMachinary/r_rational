I've started playing chess, because it's a "smart person" hobby that I was embarrassingly bad at. Not really the best reason, or the best use of my time, but it's fun!

I currently have a rating of 870 for 10 minute games on [[https://chess.com][chess.com]]. This puts me at around the 35th percentile (from the bottom) for this category, still pretty bad.

Does anyone else play?
