I enjoy playing the Fried Liver attack, but don't usualy get to play it. It depends on the opponent making certain moves, including a mistake. The important part is when you fork the queen and rook with the knight, prompting the King to take it. The next usual move is to attack with the Queen, forcing the King into the middle of the board; you now have a lot of attacking opportunities.

Instead of moving the King into the middle, some players will move the King to the back rank (g8) where the Knight starts. This is a TERRIBLE idea, causing an unavoidable checkmate in 5 moves.

If they play the best move (King to the middle of the board) the position is considered theoretically equal, but much easier to play as white. Surprisingly, I've lost the two games I played from this position; I couldn't attack fast enough, allowing them to neutralise the threat.

Before writing this post, I thought the Fried Liver Attack was considered to begin when the King was in the middle, but it's actually when the King accepts the Knight sacrifice. So I have actually won with the Fried Liver Attack!
