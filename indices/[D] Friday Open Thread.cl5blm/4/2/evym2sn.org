- Codex Alera would suit you. It's a six-book series, where each book is a standard long-ish fantasy novel.
- If you haven't read the Belgariad/Mallorean yet, those are fun as well, if a bit tropey (partly due to age, partly just because they're like that, but these are classics for a reason). I'm mostly recommending this because the tone is ever-so-slightly like The Gods Are Bastards (Tellwyrn occasionally seems near-indistinguishable from Belgarath).
- The Long Earth series is quite neat, and is a Terry Pratchett/Stephen Baxter collaboration iirc. It's more sci-fi than fantasy.
- The Powder Mage trilogy is fairly good. I'm most of the way through book 2 at the moment and I'm enjoying it so far.
- [[http://www.ironteethserial.com][The Iron Teeth]], a webserial about a cowardly goblin who falls in with outlaws. It's a great deal of fun, even though the technical parts of the writing can be a bit weak. If you enjoyed Mother of Learning it shouldn't bother you too much though.
- I'm not sure exactly how to best describe it (gritty crossed with idealistic?) but David Gemmell wrote quite a few books that I really loved (my username is drawn from one of his characters). A good starting point is /Legend/ - if you like that, ping me and I can recommend a reading order if you want, or just go through in whatever order catches your fancy. Other than the Waylander and Skilgannon books, I don't think the order in which you read them matters much.

I'm happy to elaborate on any series you're intrigued by and want more info on too.
