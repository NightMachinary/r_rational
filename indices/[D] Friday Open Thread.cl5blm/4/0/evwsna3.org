I've got a bunch of long things to inhale.

- The Symbiote by farmerbob1, guy gets a biocomputer AI in his body, then upgrades himself and earth.

- The Suneater series by Christopher Ruocchio, has 2 books so far. It's like the name of the wind in the universe of Dune. Prose can be a bit purple sometimes but it's high quality.

- The System Apocalypse by Tao Wong. System apocalypse story with some neat ideas for litrpg. Characters are pretty good for the most part. Fun power fantasy.

- The Games We Play by Ryuugi and Forged Destiny by Coeur Al'aran. Both are fanfiction of rwby but might as well be separate stories altogether.

- Twig and pact by wildbow. Twig is better than pact.

- Savage Divinity by Ruffwriter. It's an english wuxia with transmigration. Easy to binge.

- Zombie Knight Saga by George M Frost. Cool powers and they're used very interestingly. Some of my favorite superpowered fights outside of worm.
