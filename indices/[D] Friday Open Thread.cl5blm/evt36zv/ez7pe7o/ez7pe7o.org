[[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]] dude, I have read the entire story up to this point at least twice and my girlfriend makes fun of me because I've been checking for a new chapter every morning since November. It's such an amazing story, and I really wish the canon book series had been this satisfying. Thanks for writing it, I had a jolt of excitement when I read that comment about the next Ax chapter being done and you working on Marco's.

You're kind of a dick for the ending of chapter 32 though.
