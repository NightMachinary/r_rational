  We certainly don't have enough evidence that every possible reality exists to make any sweeping statements about reality, if that's what you're hinting at.

  If anything the anthropic principle strongly suggests otherwise, boltzmann brains notwithstanding.
#+end_quote

How, exactly? Isn't the anthropic principle just "we find ourselves in places where +it's possible for us to+ we exist, no matter how a priori 'improbable' that would be"?

#+begin_quote
  We try to stick to the practical.

Whether to be cryopreserved is a pretty practical question.
