I might as well ask for your "entire chain of reasoning" to the contrary. It's difficult to build a bridge when you can't see the place you're building it to. And it annoys both parties if one ends up giving elaborate "explanations" of things that the other already recognizes as obvious.

To try to address your bulleted points:

- Any observation can be modeled as or in a Turing machine (or the equivalent) in infinitely many ways.
- We have no reason to assume that any one or set of these has some magical quality of "realness" which the others lack. We can't even coherently define what that would mean. By definition, any observation we make only gives us information common to all possible Turing machines containing us and that observation.
- If for some reason we were compelled to believe it, though, we'd apply Occam's razor in determining what kind of machine it was. That would give us the universal dovetailer, which would give us every possible Turing machine anyway.
- This is to say nothing of the possibilities of quantum superpositions, recurrent Earths in a sufficiently large universe, or recurring Big Bangs.
- Between these factors, we can safely say that every mind-moment (edit: or mind-transformation) exists in an infinite variety of realities.
- We can also say that for every mind-moment, at least one successor mind-moment exists. (An infinite variety, in fact.)
- In other words, you can always expect your experience of consciousness to continue. It might dip below the level of self-awareness for periods (as in sleep), or it might become something no longer recognizable as you, but there is no true "oblivion" or "nothingness".
- Pull back to the "the universe" as we usually understand it; a single, unique Turing machine containing/implementing single, unique versions of us perceiving it from the inside. Pick any of the infinite versions of it.
- This machine both exists in itself, and is implemented in infinitely many ways by others.
- Most of these implementations are inconsequential to us.
- However, one class of them is potentially highly consequential.
- A universe's native sapience --- presumably coordinating via, or possibly consisting of, AI --- decides to implement an afterlife.
- The AI computes a randomly chosen Turing machine; or else the universal dovetailer; and monitors it for sentient processes.
- When such a process ends within the computed machine, the AI extracts it and continues it outside the machine.
- Such universes seem likely to be much more probable/have greater measure than any "quantum immortality" or Boltzmann brains, especially in the long run.
