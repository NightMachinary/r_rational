  But if universes produce others, which produce others, and so on ad infinitum, they'll eventually produce all universes possible within whatever variance is allowed.

  Also, it sounds like you're now acknowledging multiple realities regardless.

'Within whatever variance is allowed' would be the key point there. Even the universe that only replicates itself would meet that condition (the amount of variance allowed in that case being zero).

I'm not agreeing that multiple realities are guaranteed to be a thing. The point I was shooting for is that, even under the assumption of multiple realities, the most likely explanation would /still/ not be a universal dovetailer.

  I wouldn't say "singularity", but essentially. This is where you get infinite energy ÷ infinite density = ???.

  Depends on how you define speed of expansion. Any two actual points are separated by finite distance, and moving away from each other at finite speed proportional to that distance.

  Offer it to the mainstream cosmologists; I'm just describing my understanding of the mainstream "infinite universe" model. Do I have it wrong?

...You don't have it wrong, I was mistaken. Current experimental data is indicative of the universe being flat in curvature, which does actually lead to a universe infinite in scope by way of ΛCDM. Which is embarrassing, but I do try to admit when I've got something completely wrong (especially when it's out of my field), so there you go.

Let me try to swing back around to the part of all this that I /actually/ took issue with, which was not the universe being infinite, or even the possibility of a universal dovetailer, but the /guarantee of an afterlife/. The rationale behind the universal dovetailer was that, given that everything must have a cause, something being caused by itself in an infinite regress solves the problem. However, there are many turing machines less complicated than a universal dovetailer that would also produce an infinite regress. Universal quines, for example, or universes that produce other universes in a limited, well-defined set, both of which would not guarantee an afterlife. An infinitely large universe also does not guarantee an afterlife; the number 0.210100100010000100000... is infinite, but it only contains a single two, and will never produce another, and likewise your mindstate has no assurance of being replicated elsewhere. And as for someone artificially constructing a universal dovetailer...how? Even if the universe has infinite energy, our current understanding of physics has us limited to the area in which space expands away from us more slowly than the speed of light, and consequently, the energy actually /available/ to us is finite. We would not be able to run the dovetailer. Is it possible that our understanding of physics will develop to the point that that is no longer a restriction? Sure, it's /possible/, but it is again nowhere near a guarantee.
