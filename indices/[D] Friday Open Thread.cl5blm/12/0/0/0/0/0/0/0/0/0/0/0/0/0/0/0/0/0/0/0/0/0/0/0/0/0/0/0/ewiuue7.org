  But then you're back to adding arbitrary restrictions to avoid what the theory/model would otherwise imply.
#+end_quote

Again, I am not the one putting in restrictions here. I am saying that there are many possible forms that a universe-producing cycle could take, the majority of which do not produce every conceivable universe. You are taking that width of possibility and narrowing it down to a single model. /That/ is the restrictor.

#+begin_quote
  I thought we'd agreed that adding restrictions on what a model/hypothesis "produces" doesn't make it simpler. Especially if it still has to produce something as complex as our observed reality.
#+end_quote

Again, see above.

  But gravity counteracts the pull of expansion. Couldn't regions dense enough to be stable (without collapsing) be arbitrarily large?
#+end_quote

Could it? If two bits of matter are far enough apart, then the expansion of space between them is faster than the speed of light. Doesn't that put an upper bound on the size of any such system?

#+begin_quote
  What total probability would you give to the disjunction of possibilities that would imply our experience being instantiated by a party or process that will later extract us? The stereotypical rationalist would put it at the Russell's-teapot level. I put it high enough to not be interested in being cryopreserved.
#+end_quote

Low enough to not consider it the /guarantee/ your initial post implies. And, to be honest, I'm not going to litigate it further. 48 hours is the cutoff point that I've set on my involvement in any arguments online, for sanity reasons. So if you have further points, then I apologize and concede them to you.
