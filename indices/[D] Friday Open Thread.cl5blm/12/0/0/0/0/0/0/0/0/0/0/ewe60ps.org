  Taking as axiomatic "this universe is running on a turing machine", the leap to "this universe is being generated by a universal dovetailer which is simulating every possible turing machine" still does not seem to be the result given by Occam's Razor. Any explanation for our universe as turing machine which does not also require the existence of every other possible turing machine would have the advantage where Occam's Razor is concerned, given that we have observed the existence of our universe, and have not observed the existence of infinitely many other universes.

How do you add restrictions to what the dovetailer produces without making it more complicated?

  Even if we take many-worlds to be the correct interpretation of quantum physics, that only guarantees the existence of every universe which could follow from our universe's initial state, which is infinitesimally small compared to the existence of every possible turing machine.

How much do we know about the possible universes that could follow from ours' initial state? Is there any reason to think that the right quantum phenomena couldn't make them arbitrarily large, resource-rich and stable?
