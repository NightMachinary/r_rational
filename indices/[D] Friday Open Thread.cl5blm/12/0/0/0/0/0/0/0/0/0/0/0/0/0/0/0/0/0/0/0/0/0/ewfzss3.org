  Are you saying that it's simpler to assume that the universe somehow produces only identical copies of itself?

I'm saying that "universes produce new universes of some description" is strictly simpler than "universes produce new universes comprising the set of all conceivable universes". Nowhere did I say all universes had to be the same.

  Then I've convinced you?

Of the overall point? Not by a mile, no.

  Are you rejecting the Big Bang and cosmic inflation, then?

"Space is expanding" is different from "space is infinite". The former is completely consistent with finite density and finite mass, and would see a steady decrease in the overall density of the universe, eventually leading to the finite clumps of energy and mass, beyond which is primarily empty space.
