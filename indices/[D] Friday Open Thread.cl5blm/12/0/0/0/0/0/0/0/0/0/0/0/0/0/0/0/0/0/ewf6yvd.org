  A universal dovetailer. It's not a hard question.
#+end_quote

Sorry, your hypothesis is that the universal dovetailer is run by another universal dovetailer? That seems to very obviously just push the question back a step. Where did that one come from? Is it turtles all the way down?

#+begin_quote
  "The universe will behave as it has, until some arbitrary future point when it stops" is a strictly more complex hypothesis than "The universe will behave as it has".
#+end_quote

The point is that a dovetailer would require the infinite tape to exist, or else it wouldn't produce every single program. The singular universe is produced equally well with or without it, thus does not require an assumption either way, thus is the less complex hypothesis.

  And yet, many cosmologists will tell you for a fact (or at least a seriously held belief) that the universe is infinite.
#+end_quote

They are certainly welcome to that belief. It doesn't change the fact that taking infinite energy and dividing it across infinite space produces no coherent mathematical result.
