  'Within whatever variance is allowed' would be the key point there. Even the universe that only replicates itself would meet that condition (the amount of variance allowed in that case being zero).

But then you're back to adding arbitrary restrictions to avoid what the theory/model would otherwise imply.

#+begin_quote
  The rationale behind the universal dovetailer was that, given that everything must have a cause, something being caused by itself in an infinite regress solves the problem. However, there are many turing machines less complicated than a universal dovetailer that would also produce an infinite regress. Universal quines, for example, or universes that produce other universes in a limited, well-defined set, both of which would not guarantee an afterlife.
#+end_quote

I thought we'd agreed that adding restrictions on what a model/hypothesis "produces" doesn't make it simpler. Especially if it still has to produce something as complex as our observed reality.

  the number 0.210100100010000100000... is infinite, but it only contains a single two, and will never produce another
#+end_quote

It also displays a clear pattern, whereas the distribution of matter in the universe appears to be random.

#+begin_quote
  And as for someone artificially constructing a universal dovetailer...how? Even if the universe has infinite energy, our current understanding of physics has us limited to the area in which space expands away from us more slowly than the speed of light, and consequently, the energy actually /available/ to us is finite.
#+end_quote

But gravity counteracts the pull of expansion. Couldn't regions dense enough to be stable (without collapsing) be arbitrarily large?

#+begin_quote
  Sure, it's /possible/, but it is again nowhere near a guarantee.
#+end_quote

What total probability would you give to the disjunction of possibilities that would imply our experience being instantiated by a party or process that will later extract us? The stereotypical rationalist would put it at the Russell's-teapot level. I put it high enough to not be interested in being cryopreserved.
