  How do you add restrictions to what the dovetailer produces without making it more complicated?
#+end_quote

By not having a universal dovetailer at all. There are many, /many/ turing machines with functionality less complicated than "produce every possible turing machine". (To say that there is merely many such machines is understating the issue, actually.)

  How much do we know about the possible universes that could follow from ours' initial state? Is there any reason to think that the right quantum phenomena couldn't make them arbitrarily large, resource-rich and stable?
#+end_quote

The law of conservation of energy has been known to hold some strong opinions on the subject of creating arbitrarily large quantities of resources, yes. Is it /conceivable/ that we'll find a way around that? Sure! All it would take (as far as we know) is making it so that physics is not symmetrical over time. But if such a work-around exists, knowledge of it is beyond our current level of scientific understanding, and is absolutely not something on which to base the guarantee of an afterlife.
