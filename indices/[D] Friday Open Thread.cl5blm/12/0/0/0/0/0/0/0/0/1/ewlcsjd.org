  - We have no reason to assume that any one or set of these has some magical quality of "realness" which the others lack. We can't even coherently define what that would mean.
#+end_quote

Sure we do, and sure we can. That which /is/, is real. All possible things either do or do not exist as a subset of our own universe, the only one that we can observe and know. This is a perfectly coherent place to draw a line, if you're inclined to use Occam's razor to conclude that the smallest possible number of things are real.

  - If for some reason we were compelled to believe it, though, we'd apply Occam's razor in determining what kind of machine it was. That would give us the universal dovetailer
#+end_quote

I am not convinced that a universal dovetailer is the simplest possible algorithm that contains our universe. I don't know of any specific alternatives, mind, but I'm not aware of any irrefutable proof that that is as good as it could possibly get. I'm not even convinced that it is necessarily simpler than our universe's theory of everything on its own, which I expect will end up being pretty short. Further, Occam's razor is extremely useful, but it is just a heuristic. The simplest explanation that fits your current knowledge is not always actually the true one.

But then, I'm not sure if this is actually important to your point. I'm willing to postulate a Tegmark IV multiverse containing every mathematically valid structure.

  - We can also say that for every mind-moment, at least one successor mind-moment exists. (An infinite variety, in fact.)
  - In other words, you can always expect your experience of consciousness to continue.
#+end_quote

You are using a rather idiosyncratic definition of "experience of consciousness" here. In the majority of philosophical conceptions of identity, this is /not/ sufficient to count as "you".

#+begin_quote

  - A universe's native sapience --- presumably coordinating via, or possibly consisting of, AI --- decides to implement an afterlife.
  - The AI computes a randomly chosen Turing machine; or else the universal dovetailer; and monitors it for sentient processes.
  - When such a process ends within the computed machine, the AI extracts it and continues it outside the machine.
#+end_quote

If you're willing to stomach the infinite processing power that this requires, then sure, it is inevitable that this will occur in infinitely many parts of the Tegmark IV multiverse. But most mathematically valid systems that harvest minds are not the sorts of places you would want your mind to end up, I think. The vast majority of such systems don't politely wait until your process naturally ends, either. You are postulating a multiverse where infinitely many successor mindstates of "you" are being kidnapped by every mathematically possible kidnapper, all the time. In fact, there is a sense in which "most" possible future mindstates involve you being stolen out of reality /right now./ That's... comforting?

The fact that you've gone a whole lot of Planck times without being kidnapped is evidence that there is no infinite kidnapping going on, or else that you are lucky to be one of the strains of your mind that evolved this far without interference.

  - Such universes seem likely to be much more probable/have greater measure than any "quantum immortality" or Boltzmann brains, especially in the long run.
#+end_quote

...How? We /know/ that, within quantum physics, your current mindstate has at least one physically permitted successor state. If you are sure of anything, you should be sure of that. Compared to that, how certain are you that there is not a single mis-step in this entire chain of suppositions?
