  Hence why I specifically used the term "mind-moments". Are you not one of those across any given moment you exist in?
#+end_quote

No. Just like a single frame is not an animation. Thinking is an action. It requires at minimum two "mind-moments" for any thinking to occur between them, and if I don't "think", then I don't "am". I need more than just that minimum to be /healthy,/ of course. The algorithm-that-is-me expects external sensory input to affect how things develop. But I'm fully capable of existing and going crazy in sensory deprivation.

Another instance of a mind shaped by the same rules would not be the entity-who-is-speaking-now. They'd be another, separate instance. If you killed me, I would not expect my experience to continue through them. But I /would/ consider them to have just as valid a claim as I do to our shared identity, as of the moment of divergence.

I would be one particular unbroken chain of mind-transformations, and they would be a second particular unbroken chain of mind-transformations of the same class. And since the algorithm isn't perfectly deterministic clockwork, both chains have arbitrarily many branches and endpoints, and both would have imperfect knowledge of their own history. Those chains may or may not cross somewhere. I'm not sure why you believe that would be a problem. The entity-who-is-speaking-now is allowed to merge and split. As long as every transformation in between follows the rules, all of my possible divergent selves are me, but they are not each other.

  Surely the more an intelligence has proved itself capable of (e.g. successfully implementing you as you are), the less likely it is that it'll suddenly start making basic mistakes like structuring the implementing software such that a single flipped bit makes it erase the subject and all backups?
#+end_quote

"Mistake"? Knowing what you need doesn't mean it has to care. Since we're talking about a multiverse containing all possible programs, I'm confident that "stuff that both knows and cares about your wellbeing" is a much smaller target than "stuff that knows about your wellbeing".

  I feel unfairly singled out here.
#+end_quote

Sorry. I meant for that to be an obviously farcical toy example; I didn't realize until now that it could be interpretted as an uncharitable strawman of your argument here. But, yeah, now it's obvious how it could be seen that way, so that's on me.

That said, you do seem to have a habit of phrasing things in ways that appear to imply higher confidence than what's appropriate. Most relevantly, with Occam's razor. The simplest explanation should be your best guess, sure. But in the real world, we've discovered previously undetected effects basically every time we've ever looked close at anything. If all you've got is the razor and no direct evidence, your guess shouldn't be so strong that "rationality requires you to employ" it.
