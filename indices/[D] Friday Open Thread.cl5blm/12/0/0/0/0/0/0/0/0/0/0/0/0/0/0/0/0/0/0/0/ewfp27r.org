  If everything that things "come from" has to "come from" something else, then yes, there must necessarily be turtles all the way down. It doesn't make sense to me, but taking it as a premise, Occam's razor favors the simplest possible form of turtle.

That is not the simplest form of turtle, though! The simplest form of that assumption would be that the universe in some way reproduces other universes, not that the universe in some way produces every single conceivable kind of universe ad infinitum!

  The point is that "the tape is infinite" doesn't add complexity. It's the normal state of any model/hypothesis. "The tape will eventually run out" does. The tape is a metaphor, not an actual physical substance.

Sure, fine. That's acceptable.

  How do you take nonzero density and spread it across infinite space without producing infinite energy?
#+end_quote

How are you spreading a central source of energy across infinite space in finite time at all? The universe does have a speed limit. To answer your question, though, I would not expect energy to distribute itself evenly, but clump together, leaving more energy in some places and less (maybe even no or negligible quantities) in others.
