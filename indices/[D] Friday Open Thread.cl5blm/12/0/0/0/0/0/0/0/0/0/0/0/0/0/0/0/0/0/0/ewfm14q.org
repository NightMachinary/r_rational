  Sorry, your hypothesis is that the universal dovetailer is run by another universal dovetailer? That seems to very obviously just push the question back a step. Where did that one come from? Is it turtles all the way down?
#+end_quote

If everything that things "come from" has to "come from" something else, then yes, there must necessarily be turtles all the way down. It doesn't make sense to me, but taking it as a premise, Occam's razor favors the simplest possible form of turtle.

  The point is that a dovetailer would require the infinite tape to exist, or else it wouldn't produce every single program. The singular universe is produced equally well with or without it, thus does not require an assumption either way, thus is the less complex hypothesis.

The point is that "the tape is infinite" doesn't add complexity. It's the normal state of any model/hypothesis. "The tape will eventually run out" does. The tape is a metaphor, not an actual physical substance.

  They are certainly welcome to that belief. It doesn't change the fact that taking infinite energy and dividing it across infinite space produces no coherent mathematical result.

How do you take nonzero density and spread it across infinite space without producing infinite energy?
