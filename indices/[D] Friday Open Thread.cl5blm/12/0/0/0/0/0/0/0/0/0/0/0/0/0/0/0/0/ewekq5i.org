  I haven't the slightest. I assume you don't know what initial conditions produce a universal dovetailer, either. (If I'm wrong on that, feel free to correct me, and then feel free to collect your Nobel.)

A universal dovetailer. It's not a hard question.

#+begin_quote
  For one thing, a universal dovetailer would necessarily require both infinite turing tape and the ability to run infinitely many programs in parallel (or else it would sputter out the first time it found a program that didn't halt).
#+end_quote

Are we talking about the same algorithm? It runs a cycle of program 1, then a cycle each of programs 1 and 2, and so on. It never reaches infinity; and in fact, no Turing machine can.

"Infinite tape" is part of the definition of a Turing machine.

#+begin_quote
  A turing machine running our universe wouldn't necessarily require either of those things--it could instead use, for example, a single very large strip of turing tape, which is nonetheless finite, and we wouldn't notice up until the moment it ran out.

"The universe will behave as it has, until some arbitrary future point when it stops" is a strictly more complex hypothesis than "The universe will behave as it has".

#+begin_quote
  Not in the sense of being irrevocably certain, no. In the layman's sense, it is possible to be very confident about things.
#+end_quote

Most people call that knowledge.

  Trying to do math with infinity gets messy, especially with multiple infinities, because infinity isn't actually a number (unless you're playing with hyperreals). In this particular case, dividing infinity by infinity doesn't give any coherent result. More specifically, depending on how you calculate it, ∞ / ∞ can give any number of results, all of which are mutually contradictory. If the energy involved was growing without bound (toward a limit of infinity), and the division across space was growing without bound (toward a limit of infinity), then we could do some analysis of the rates and get a reasonable calculation of the energy density involved that way. As is, though, the scenario doesn't mathematically parse.

And yet, many cosmologists will tell you for a fact (or at least a seriously held belief) that the universe is infinite.
