  I thought we just agreed to talk about "mind-transformations". What's this talk about states and moments?
#+end_quote

What did you think was being transformed? My mind is made of your mind-moments in the same way that my body is made of atoms: more than one, and with specific physical relationships between them, but they are a necessary component. Did I not introduce the concept as the derivative of mind-moments over time? If the derivative is undefined, then there is no "me".

  So if you were sentenced to a painful death, you'd take the pill so that "you" would escape it?
#+end_quote

/I/ wouldn't, because I don't bargain with death, and because the person who came out the other side of the operation is my heir in virtually all significant ways (inheriting my debts and other paperwork) and I don't torture my heirs. But if I were a sociopath who somehow knew that there was no possible escape, then yes, I would kill myself by breaking continuity with the future tortured person.

My age is measured by whatever is most useful at the time, which usually means the birth of the body I inhabit. In practice, I do not consider my identity to actually be as binary as I've simplified here; minor disruptions to my mind happen all the time and though the resulting algorithm is slightly less "me" than the preceding one (or the preceding one is less "me" than the resulting one, depending on which one you ask), it doesn't especially bother me to have a neuron or two zapped by a cosmic ray and their contribution distorted. To my knowledge, I've never experienced such a significant instantaneous disruption that I would consider death. But if I had, then yes, I would consider it to be meaningful to count "my" age from that event, in some contexts.

(I wouldn't especially care about disambiguating the new me from the old one. They're dead. They're not using our name and identity anymore, and I'm their heir anyway.)

  And how many of those ways still result in successfully implementing you as you are, extracting you and reinstantiating you?
#+end_quote

Nearly zero, of course. But of the ones that do instantiate a version of you, most of them are /still/ bugged.

#+begin_quote
  "I don't know" isn't a guess. Do ye what ye will, or do ye assume that all of your actions are being seen and impartially judged? Have kids, to ensure that part of you outlives your death; or refrain, to avoid your resources being divided for eternity? Sign up for cryonics (and call people who withhold it from their kids insane, lousy parents), or not? Promote lies to fight climate change, or not?
#+end_quote

My answer to literally all of those questions is "[shrug] I dunno. Do what you want. Maybe don't be a dick, though?" I do recommend having some half-reasonable deontological safety rails, however you choose to implement them, and most half-reasonable deontological safety rails have a "Don't be a dick" clause. That'll serve you better than hair-splitting utilitarianism that you physically can't calculate.
