  For an algorithm that runs on a mindstate in order to produce a successor mindstate, it is a requirement that there be a direct causal relationship between the two mindstates. That relationship needs to exist because that's where the algorithm is. Unless something weird happens with the speed of light and physical interactions, spatiotemporal proximity is a requirement for that. If a mind-moment is somewhere out in the infinity of meta-reality, but not /here/, then it is disqualified from being a continuation of the me who is speaking, since it could not have come about by a valid transformation of the mind-moment I am currently operating on.

I thought we just agreed to talk about "mind-transformations". What's this talk about states and moments?

#+begin_quote
  Similarly, being reconfigured by a personality-altering drug is not a valid transformation, and the person who comes out the other side is not me; taking such a drug is death.

So if you were sentenced to a painful death, you'd take the +pill+ drug so that "you" would escape it? Even if it came at a price; like additional pain, or forgoing your "last meal"? If someone took out a loan from you, spent it, then had their personality altered, you'd write the money off rather than holding the "new person" accountable?

How old are you? Is that age counted from a birth event, or a personality shift? Did you change your name to avoid being confused with the deceased?

  Most likely, because that's just what they were told to do. You're talking about AI; They "care" insofar as they were programmed to do that, or they extrapolated that action from inadequate training data. There are a lot of ways for /programmers/ to make mistakes in ways that leave the resulting program being radically, self-improvingly optimized for correctly implementing the wrong thing.
#+end_quote

And how many of those ways still result in successfully implementing you as you are, extracting you and reinstantiating you? I think [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] wrote about the astronomical unlikeliness of a Friendliness failure still permitting anything like conscious life.

  If someone holds a gun to your head and will shoot you if you're wrong, sure. But if there is no immediate threat, I think you will usually get better results in the real world if you admit that your actual best guess is "I don't know."
#+end_quote

"I don't know" isn't a guess. Do ye what ye will, or do ye assume that all of your actions are being seen and impartially judged? Have kids, to ensure that part of you outlives your death; or refrain, to avoid your resources being divided for eternity? Sign up for cryonics (and call people who withhold it from their kids [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/1mc/normal_cryonics/][insane, lousy parents]]), or not? [[/r/TheMotte/comments/csclze/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_19_2019/exf26qm/?context=1][Promote lies to fight climate change]], or not?
