I've joined the Search & Rescue team for my county as a means of volunteering & learning useful skills. Team members are asked to share their skills in training sessions, and while I haven't been tapped yet, I'd like to have something to teach if and when I am.

I'm a novice at most of the outdoor skills that the group practices (technical climbing, river rescues, tracking, etc.) The one thing I think I could bring to the team is tactics for eliminating cognitive biases and fallacies which could get in the way during a crisis situation.

What tools would be most useful for a group of people who often need to operate as a team in dangerous circumstances? DaystarEld's "problem debriefing" from OoS, in which each team member brings forward the things they did wrong & could improve on, seems perfectly suited to this. Any other suggestions of tactics, or of different topics that a bookish rationalist could usefully teach a group of hardy outdoorspeople?
