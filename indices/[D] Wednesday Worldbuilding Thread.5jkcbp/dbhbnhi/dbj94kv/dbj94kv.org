I'm always a big fan of anything that includes whole new concepts for classes (as opposed to "mechanically identical to X, but flavor wise they're a Y"). I'm just going to go through each one and say my ideas, or mention a related thing you might want to get ideas from (most if not all of these might be your source of ideas for the class in the first place, but I'm going to include them anyway just in case they aren't).

- *Tarot card class*\\
  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4zwfrl/the_tarocchi_a_playing_cardbased_magic_class/][The Tarocchi]]
- *Poisoned fighter*\\
  Reminds me a bit of the Delusionist or Diva classes from [[https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/666378-penny-arcade-adventures-episode-three/faqs/64577#section8][Penny Arcade's Rainslick Precipice of Darkness EP3]]. Respectively they are "applies buff at some kind of cost" and "steals MP from allies turning them into mana batteries".
- *Multi-level mage*\\
  Other than the obvious pyramid scheme reference, I feel like this should actually result in powerful NPCs simply because the characters will see it and go "oh it's a scam, obviously" and underestimate them, even though such a scheme could easily work in a fantasy setting.
- *R9K mage*\\
  Glueboy [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5jkcbp/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dbhjflb/][mentioned]] the Staff of One below, but this also makes me think of the aspect of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/644389][Dreams]] from the SBURB Glitch FAQ.
- *Out of body class*\\
  I like this. I'm a little surprised nobody has designed a "become immobile to boost damage" archetype in D&D before (ala Overwatch's [[https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/bastion/][Bastion]] and LoL's [[http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/xerath/][Xerath]]). This one feels more versatile than the *Still fighter* you mentioned. Perhaps this one is a "astral body must remain adjacent to physical body" style, wheras Still fighter could be a grapple lockdown, or debuffer who reduces enemy speed/Dex, or even the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/634465][Rhyme]] aspect (who's core concept is all "stop stop STOP EVERYTHING").
- *Linking class*\\
  The name makes me think this a reference to the [[https://wiki.erfworld.com/Caster_Link][ability]] of Thinkamancers from Erfworld, but even if it is, the [[https://wiki.erfworld.com/List_of_Caster_Links][List of Caster Link-Ups]], and [[https://wiki.erfworld.com/Speculative_Link-ups][List of Theoretical Caster Link-Ups]] should be helpful.
- *Feng shui inspired class*\\
  To account for the random opportunities that would appear and vanish on a changing battlefield, perhaps 2 decks of cards, one with triggers, and one with effects. Each type has a trigger/effect labeled as lvl 1, 2 or 3 (or some combination therof) and you can perform any trigger actions on one to trigger the same level (or lower) of effect on the other. (eg you draw a trigger card with lvl 1 & 2 triggers, and an effect card with lvl 2&3 effects, you will only be able to activate the level 2 effect). Triggers range from simple (move 5 feet to the left (when facing the location of the effect) without triggering Opportunity attacks) at level 1, to the complex (hit with a ranged weapon attack on an enemy weilding a shield, and do at least 5 damage) on level 3. Effects are correspondingly powerful/weak depending on level (shove an enemy 5 ft, ally gains 5 temp HP, to next attack on enemy that hits is a critical if the attack has advantage, enemy is disarmed and falls prone, ally gains HP as though they spent a healing surge). You can discard the pair of cards at end of turn, drawing new ones, and they are automatically replaced if you used an effect at the highest level on that card. Character building adds or removes cards with different keywords to your deck (which, honestly, should be about 15-20 cards), with paths that include effects that [[http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Scry][Scry]] either or both decks, path that focuses on healing, battlefield manipulation, or direct damage.
- *Passion mages*\\
  Nothing special to mention here other than the obvious "Rage Mage" joke.
- *Velocity fighter*\\
  Might work best as a monk path since those get speed boosts already, or as something the local messenger's guild would recruit. References to the Cordwainer class (sooo many shoe puns) from the above mentioned [[https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/666378-penny-arcade-adventures-episode-three/faqs/64577#section8][Penny Arcade RSPOD Episode 3]], and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/608450][Flow Aspect]] (who tend to focus on "And it don't stop, just keep going forever") from the above mentioned Glitch FAQ
- *Revision mage*\\
  Apart from the obvious (and terrifying) reference to [[http://worm.wikia.com/wiki/Gray_Boy][Gray Boy]], this must obviously be referred to as [[https://wiki.erfworld.com/Retconjuration][Retconjuration]].
