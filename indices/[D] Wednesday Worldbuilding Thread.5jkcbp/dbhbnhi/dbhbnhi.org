This is a long-ish dump of ideas for a homebrew fantasy D&D setting, ideally trying to get some feedback on which of these you'd like to encounter as a player, or some neat twists on these concepts that arises naturally from their cores (note that this is D&D and non-rational):

- *Tarot card class*\\
  The tarot mage holds a deck of cards as his focus, which he draws from in order to cast spells. His deck must be randomized in accordance with the strictures of his class, else it will be worthless for casting spells. While the tarot mage has little control over which spell he'll cast, these spells are much more powerful than those cast by a wizard. Creating new cards is an expensive and timely process.
- *Poisoned fighter*\\
  The poisoned fighter consumes a cocktail of poisons at the start of every fight. Due to his unique biology (a product of both magic and intensive training), these poisons are beneficial to him, though they still come with drawbacks. Special features include poisoned blood and the ability to poison weapons with their spit.
- *Multi-level mage*\\
  The mages of the Manifold Pyramid are always out to recruit others. There is a price associated with joining the pyramid, but once you're part of it, you can gain immense power by getting people to join, as well as benefits from anyone who /they/ get to join.
- *R9K mage* The uniqlomancer never casts the same spell twice, nor ever casts a spell that any other uniqlomancer has ever cast before. To do so carries grave penalties. If they abide by their constraint though, they are rewarded with powers that grow as more spells are cast, and their versatility in comparison with other mages makes them dangerous even at the start of their careers.
- *Out of body class*\\
  The astral warror leaves their body behind on the battlefield, using it as a hitching post from which their soul can strike. Their bodies are heavily armored and protected to keep them from being slain; their weapons are made of their own spirits.
- *Linking class*\\
  The linker blends willing participants together into a cohesive unit. The linker's allies share their knowledge, their skills in battle, and become more than the sum of their individuality. The qualitative process is described as invasive and unpleasant, and those with secrets to keep need not apply, for risk of those secrets bleeding out into the world.
- *Feng shui inspired class*\\
  The pathist sees a few of the pathways of probability and makes connections that are impossible for others. A simple step to the left might make a completely unrelated attack miss an ally. A defensive posture might alter the course of the battle for no apparent reason. The actions of the pathist are nonsensical, but their consequences cannot be denied. The most powerful of pathists are able to use minor actions in the present to create huge effects in the future.
- *Passion mages*\\
  The spellcasting equivalent to the barbarian, the passion drinkers allow themselves to be consumed by powerful emotion to funnel their spellcasting. In many cases this results in a fugue state, and the results are not entirely predictable given how inflamed their passions are when they're at their most powerful.
- *Offbeat Elemental mages*\\
  glass mage\\
  iron mage\\
  steam mage\\
  gem mage\\
  gold mage\\
  flesh mage\\
  blood mage\\
  bone mage\\
  wood mage\\
  lava mage\\
  clay mage\\
  smoke mage\\
  ash mage\\
  rust mage\\
  mist mage\\
  flower mage\\
  salt mage\\
  sand mage\\
- *Velocity fighter*\\
  The velocity fighter is all about speed, not simply dexterity, but the ability to move quickly. To this end, he learns a set of powers that increase his movement, his actions per turn, and the quickness with which he can accomplish tasks.
- *Still fighter*\\
  The still fighter can arrest his movement in various ways, allowing him to fall from any height without injury, to prevent knockback, and so on. They have the power of perfect immobility. At the highest levels, they are nearly invincible, because they can stop the movement of their flesh when it would be bludgeoned or pierced.
- *Revision mage*\\
  Revision mages are amazingly powerful, capable of nearly any act of restoration short of undoing death. They can walk into a castle that has been knocked down to its foundation and reverse the tumble of stones to the ground. Their healing is second to none, as they can unbreak bones and cause blood to pump back into the body. In combat they can reverse the motions of their opponents, trapping them in place as though in amber. The revision mages are rare and, to anyone with common sense, terrifying.
