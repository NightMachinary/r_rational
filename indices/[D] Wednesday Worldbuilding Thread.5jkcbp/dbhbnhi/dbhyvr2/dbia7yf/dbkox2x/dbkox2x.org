I just don't know, I see the appeal flavour-wise, but it sounds like the Uniqlomancer has several downsides (failure chance vs. extra preparations, conflicts with other Uniqlomancers), but it's only upside is easier access to niche spells, which isn't a great trade-off.

Ah, I like that better. Sacrificing HP/attributes temporarily for other benefits.

Revision Mages could do some fun things. Reversing their injuries as they happen, erasing recent memories, "pausing" things by constantly reversing them over a tiny time-span, re-use one-use items...
