I'm trying to guesstimate journalistic practices 20 years from now, and am stealing a few concepts from the Reddit "AMAs", in which anyone can propose questions, anyone who wants can upvote or downvote said questions, and the questions which get the best set of votes bubble up to the top of the queue for the interviewee to see most easily. In this case, I'm translating that last bit to 'get asked first'.
