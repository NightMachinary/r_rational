Tarot card class sounds like fun to play, but the level of randomness it introduces could be a bit much for the player. Perhaps if the spells themselves removed the element of chance normally present in DnD, maybe having their numbers set at the card's creation? This'll allow the spells to be used to a greater degree of tactical precision then is normally possible in the game.

Poisoned fighter sounds more like a race then a class. Or just NPC flavour. What is the mechanical difference between a special class who can poison their weapons after drinking poison, and any other class who can poison their blades without drinking poison? Also lots of things in DnD are immune to poison. Maybe it could work as a broader "chemical" fighter using combat stimulants and potions to gain an edge.

Multi-level Mage is hilarious and I can see so many problems with it as a player class, but if you think you can balance it with everyone else it could be a fun and novel charisma-focused spellcaster. Also it will result in the Pyramid Mage attempting diplomacy at every opportunity and building convoluted social skill leveling schemes for their recruits.

R9K I don't really see working well. Or maybe I don't understand it. The best way I can see to do the idea is allowing them to cast any spell in the entire Player's Handbook that they're the appropriate level for, and making sure that the player understands the whole system well enough to pace their spellcasting appropriately for their XP gains. The "other R9K mages count against your spell limits" part seems like an arbitrary limitation that's a bunch of extra work for everyone involved.

Out of Body looks interesting. Lots of ways to implement it. Might want to limit it to short range though, to avoid having to come up with convoluted means of threatening them. Easy to have it be really fragile or basically unstoppable. I'd implement it as a gradient: The greater distance from/time spent/powers used in astral combat, the less control and protection for the main body. Overextend and they risk being cut down, play defensively and they risk seeing the battle turn against them.

Linking class looks like flavour for an NPC. I've seem some psionic powers that did the things this does, but a class that unevenly denies other classes their individuality isn't something I'd recommend implementing. Or just go the whole way and make the players a hive-mind to start with.

Feng Shui class is an interesting idea. It's...basically a subtle spellcaster? I'd suggest looking into the psionics stuff, it has a bunch of more subtle/mental powers that could work with this class.

Passion Mages sound like Wilders, but more fun to play. it also sounds like Wild Magic, which someone else mentioned.

Offbeat Elemental Mages. I like all of these. The Salt Mage should be overpowered as hell and claim a disproportionate amount of the XP. Whenever another player yells at him or cries, he heals 1D10 HP.

Velocity Fighter is something I'd like to play, I love mobility-focused classes and there aren't nearly enough of them.

Still fighter could serve as an interesting puzzle boss too. A PC Still Fighter would clearly be the party meatshield.

Revision Mage. Good concept, interesting powers, Wizard-with-time-speciality is fun. Not sure why they can't reverse death at higher levels though? Everybody else can.
