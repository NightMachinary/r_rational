R9K gets access to arbitrary amounts of spells, sometimes through flavor tweaks and other times through mechanical tweaks. There would be some kind of abstraction layer to determine whether a spell variation has been used before. So /ideally/ you get things like "/fireball/, but it's blue, and becomes a cone at the point of detonation, and curves to the right, and etc." with each modification of the base spell increasing or decreasing the, I don't know, Spellcraft DC or something. (The uniqlomancer of course has a bunch of variations prepared ahead of time, and has some level of coordination with other uniqlomancers to ensure that they're all exploring unique spellspace. Hence conflicts, which I like.)

Poisoned fighter wouldn't be immune to poison. So they'd take their 1d6 DEX damage from terinav root, but they would get some kind of benefit from it, like a 1d6 boost to STR or something. At higher levels they would increase or decrease die sizes; 1d4 DEX hit with a 1d8 STR boost maybe. Most of the benefit comes from these "chemical pathways". (You'd be barred from the class if you were immune to poison.) (Obviously there's an issue with cost, since D&D poisons are really expensive.)

Revision mage can't undo death mostly because I liked the idea of a high-level revision mage coming to a city that had been wracked by storm, unshattering all the windows, uncollapsing all the ruined shops, causing splintered wood to knit back together. All the limp bodies are restored as they go through their motions in reverse, until the people are sitting at their tables uneating food ... and then when the spell ends, they're still dead, so there's a perfect scene that looks as though they all died of natural causes at the same time. (Conceptually, this is because they don't have access to the soul. Probably never a PC class. Hooks include needing to escort a revision mage or attempting to track one that's turned to murders that can be accomplished without leaving evidence.)
