Riffing on the idea of the Tarot Mage:

It could be cool to have a deckbuilding aspect to this. To make it more unique than just RNG over a normal mage's spell slots, you could have the more powerful cards require specific sorts of experiences to attain. E.g. Death could require reaching the brink of death (negative HP or failed saving throws, depending on edition).

Once obtained, these powerful cards could be swapped out with the regular ones at a rate of level/4 per long rest. There may have to be an additional limit on their quantity (like =wisdom mod + level/2=), or you could require them to be balanced with negatives or something.

You could also do stuff with other tarot symbolism, like whether a card is drawn upright or inverted or drawn with the left or right hand. All of that greatly increases the complexity of the class in the design process, but it may help to create a sense of player agency or make for a more awesome opponent in an NPC.

"With his left hand, the mage draws a card from his deck. He shows it to you, smiling; it is a skeletal horseman, Death. The card turns to smoke and flies in a cloud to choke you. Make a constitution saving throw."
