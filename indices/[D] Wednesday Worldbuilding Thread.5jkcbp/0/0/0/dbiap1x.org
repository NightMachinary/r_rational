I was thinking that I'll probably pick up an actual tarot deck and use a tarot mage as a boss, mostly because I love to DM with props. (And the tarot deck would probably become a magic item with remnants of power to be used by the PCs once the tarot mage was defeated.)

The big design problem is that you'd be increasing variability, which is usually a bad thing for a class and has to be compensated for with variability reduction or increased power. That's not really a problem for an NPC, because you can cheat more, but as a PC class ... I'd want to introduce "cheats" like dealing from the bottom of the deck, being able to see the next card, or something like that.

I really like the idea of incorporating all the weird stuff that's used in tarot readings to make the cards themselves more variable.
