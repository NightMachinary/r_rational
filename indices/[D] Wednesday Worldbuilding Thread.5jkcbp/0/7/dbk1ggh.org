Here are brief write-ups of the offbeat elemental mages ("mage" being loosely defined):

- *Glass mages* are half-casters who fight with blades of glass and attack with razor-sharp shards. They also to some extent have mirror powers, scrying through reflections and bouncing across reflective surfaces.
- *Iron mages* are heavily armored mages that monkey-grip enormous swords and shift their armor around them to make up for how utterly impractical this would otherwise be. They're tanks, but faster and more powerful than they would otherwise appear.
- *Steam mages* are all about pressure. They build it up and use it to fight and cast with, throwing giant haymaker punches and make explosive leaps through the air. Some equip themselves with weapons that utilize steam to fire projectiles.
- *Gem mages* have a variety of aspects depending on which of their gems they focus their power through. A gem mage is constantly shifting through their gems, using them in combination. They are always on the lookout for new gems of sufficient clarity, quality, etc.
- *Gold mages* gain power through material wealth. The wealth must be close to their person, and gold is powerful above all else, though they often stud their armor and weapons with jewels as well. It's a precarious class though, because they paint a target on themselves. Probably quite powerful to compensate for the fact that they're so showy. (Probably forced to be showy? It's not just about hoarded wealth, it's conspicuous wealth.)
- *Flesh mages* are healers, using the power of flesh to knit shut wounds. Most of them are bulky, sturdy fighters whose immense power belies calmness and kindness; it is difficult for them to use their flesh magic to harm, because another person's flesh is inviolate and they have an appreciation for the properness of flesh.
- *Blood mages* are the most vicious of the elemental mages, using their blades to open wounds that will never close and extracting the blood from their enemies with a touch. One of their favorite abilities is to pop blood vessels or cause bruises, leaving horrible marks on their victims that are slow to fade.
- *Bone mages* carry around bags of bones with them, which they use to cast spells. Each bone is treated ahead of time with a specific spells, which goes off once the bone is snapped. In a pinch, the bone mage can use their own lifeforce for spellcasting by snapping their own bones, or the bones of a helpless opponent or willing ally. Better spells take bigger bones. (flavorful, but not too mechanically interesting?)
- *Wood mages* fight by “planting” themselves into the ground and growing out appendages of living wood to do their bidding. Using wood, they'll cloak themselves in thick armor to allow them to withstand powerful attacks. Unlike most other elemental mages, the wood mage cannot draw on his elemental plane and must use wood that he's taken into his personal store, which limits the size and shape of his creations.
- *Clay mages* are creators, makers of trinkets and statues that are sculpted on the fly and brought to life with a kiss. These creations get better with more time to make them detailed, though they don't have to be lifelike so long as they're deliberately made with a skilled hand. They also wear armor of clay and can turn some kinds of stone into clay.
- *Smoke mages* take their power from burning various substances, then inhaling and exhaling that smoke. When they breathe in smoke, they can take on the properties of the think they're making smoke from. When they breathe out smoke, they can temporarily imbue whatever they're blowing smoke onto with the smoke property. (Turning things into smoke is supernatural, allowing attuned items to turn to smoke without fire or oxidation.)
- *Rust mages* take their power from oxidation. They work like rust monsters in some respects, in that they can rust away nonmagical swords and armors, but usually they come into battle with stacks of metals strapped to them so that they can fuel their fighting/casting, and they strongly prefer to engineer their battles to take place on metallic terrain.
- *Mist mages* can generate obscuring mists around themselves, from which they coalesce temporary weapons and armor. Their fighting style is to move through the mists at nearly teleportation speeds, which makes them deadly when a fog has descended. They can't see through the fog, but they can blindfight in it through their mist sense.
- *Flower mages* center around the concept of “bloom”. They carefully cultivate flowers, each of which corresponds to a particular spell in their repertoire. Their comparative advantage they have over other mages is that they can “bloom” their spells all at once, which means more spells per day and more spells per action. Their flowers can also leach from magical items, allowing them to wear flower necklaces, flower dresses, flower etc.
- *Salt mages* are closely associated with places; they gather salts from diverse locations and make large salt crystals out of them. Their secondary power is that of stillness and preservation. On the battlefield, so long as they have a salt crystal of the place they're fighting in, they can build protective wards of a variety of sorts.
- *Sand mages* use precise magic that correlates to the number and placement of grains of sand they they either lay down on the ground or spray through the air. A sand caster is meticulous in their designs and tends to plan well in advance so they can create their sand patterns ahead of time. In terms of actual magic, there's a heavy emphasis on the flow of time.
- *Lava mages* utilize the flow. They carry rocks around with them, which they move in circles to heat; once they've made enough rotations and become hot enough, they turn liquid and the lava mage can maintain their circles in the air. They use these like whips and shields, altering the flows to do harm. It takes quite some time for them to spin up and spin down, but once they're ready they're formidable fighters.
- *Ash mages* work with that which is ruined beyond repair. They use ash to evoke the spirit of that which has been burnt. A smear of sword-ash on the palm conjures a ghostly sword into the hand, which a smear of cuirass-ash on the chest conjures ghostly armor. Their true abilities extend beyond that though, since they can ritualistically burn things in order to see a whole version of them again - burning a corpse can allow them to use the ash to create a temporary ghost that can be talked to, or burning a ruined book can allow them to read that which has washed away.
