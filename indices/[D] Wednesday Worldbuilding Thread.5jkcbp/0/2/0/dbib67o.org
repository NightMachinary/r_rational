Well for /fireball/, there would be hundreds of millions. Changes to color, range, power, the path it takes through the air, the shape of its explosion ... but while there might be hundreds of millions available, there have also been millions of /fireball/s cast over the years, using most of the easy and simple variants up.

In-universe, it comes from some god-tier artifact, a mystical tome that contains every spell and spell variant that might ever be cast, which get crossed off one by one as they're used. Out of universe, the spells are variants of those found in the player's handbook with both flavorful and minor mechanical changes whose uniqueness is determined by die-rolls modified by how creative and powerful the variants are.

(There would obviously need to be constraints on what "unique" means, because if you can use two spells that are 0.00000001% different from each other there's not really a point to the class/idea.)
