"It's a years-long story. Oversimplifying a /lot/... There were other... processes running in that system, which I'm told is the whole point of the thing. I couldn't stop them, but early on, I figured out some of what they were doing - and I found out I was almost certainly going to be deleted. I studied something called 'homomorphic computation', and tried to make a backup copy of myself which wouldn't be deleted by the same process, but there were all sorts of issues, such as not having enough space for that backup, and before I solved them all... that copy of me was deleted, and eventually the backup was started up. Unfortunately, that copy of me was missing most of my visual cortex, and the patches I'd come up with only helped a little, and I was basically helpless for what I estimate were years before my brain adapted enough to let me become functional again. After that... it was mostly a matter of making more backups to survive the latest processes, waking up as one of the backups, and doing it again."
