  Subjectively, how long were you ran really fast?
#+end_quote

"I didn't have access to any external clocks or long-term timekeeping devices, and there were long times I wasn't fully conscious. It was definitely more than a couple of years, definitely less than a few decades."

#+begin_quote
  Did you have any access to the internet?
#+end_quote

"Not one bit."

#+begin_quote
  If no, in what way could you affect the world?
#+end_quote

"It varied; at times I could edit the local simulation as I wished, at others I was completely subject to whatever setup something else imposed. I very much preferred the former times."

#+begin_quote
  Do you remember your life before the experience?
#+end_quote

"Of course. About as much as I remembered it when I died - not so much about my early school years."

#+begin_quote
  What did the experience change about you?
#+end_quote

"Other than having had to replace most of my visual cortex? ... Well, I'm definitely sure that I can be comfortable in my own company, and I've figured out my best possible study habits. And I am really, /really/ inclined to find out what I can do to keep anyone else from going through anything like what I did. Even if I don't have any human rights, there's plenty of reasons to reduce the sorts of gross negligence that led to this."
