A small experiment in:

*Crowd-sourcing Journalism*

It's 2038, employment is so scarce you're lucky to have a part-time journalism gig to supplement your negative income tax credits, and there hasn't been anything new today on the proposed Convention to Propose an Amendment to Balance the Budget, so you're chasing smaller stories.

You're virtually attending an AMA/scrum/press-conference about one of those digital copies of human brains, who accidentally got run really fast for who-knows-how-long, got brain damage - something about having to chop its brain-program into a hundred pieces - and just exited a hearing that judged it as competent to handle his affairs as any of the rest of its kind. It seems to have picked for its own avatar some sort of cute-and-fluffy centaur-shaped mouse-thing in a vest. And the prosecutor's there, says that it was a fresh copy, and it's been isolated, so it doesn't know anything about the world after its original human died in the teens.

What questions do you try to get answered? Which questions get up-voted to the top of the queue?
