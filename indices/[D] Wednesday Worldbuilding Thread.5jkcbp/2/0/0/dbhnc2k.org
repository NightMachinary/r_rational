  So, if I want to create a new spell, say to freeze water, should I stand by some freezing water while chanting "Frigidero" and waving my hands?

truthfully I haven't been thinking about the specifics as much as I should have been. Really I've been just thinking generalities. I also may have not been clear. It takes decades for the magic system to be trained in the slightest but once it learns the magic it does not forget.

Really that just applies to making new spells. You can still train your mind to go through certain patterns to access higher level spells. These spells can be recorded in ancient tomes or be taught from master to apprentice.

Some magic, you can't even train for the reason for this lies in the ability of an individual to think certain ways. For example a bloodline might be DNA shaping your unconsious mind to be able to express certain concepts for certain magics more fluidly or at the same time another part of your mind is expressing another concept. This allows for one person to be able to access a certain spell while another person cannot.

In my story magic has been used for around a thousand years and as a result there is a plethora of magic to use.
