  The magic system is very stupid. This also explains the creation of new magic as 'training' the magic system by thinking a certain way many times that is similar to thinking another way.

So, if I want to create a new spell, say to freeze water, should I stand by some freezing water while chanting "/Frigidero/" and waving my hands?

I think that could be really cool. Spells have to be trained on things that are possible without magic, but they can then be coaxed into doing it more powerfully or in different contexts (e.g. freezing a lake in summer).
