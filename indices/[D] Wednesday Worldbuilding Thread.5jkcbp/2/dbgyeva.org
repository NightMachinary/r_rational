I'm trying to write an original fantasy story around a goblin main character which was inspired by a light novel goblin kingdom (a story that I don't recommend). As for worldbuilding I think I have a pretty unique magic system by which I mean I've never seen it before. It revolves around the entire magic system being intelligent but not sentient or aware. For me it explains how words being spoken or neurons firing can translate into a physical force like a fireball appearing out of thin air.

The magic system is very stupid. This also explains the creation of new magic as 'training' the magic system by thinking a certain way many times that is similar to thinking another way. so if you and enough people want the spell to be stronger then over the course of a century it becomes stronger, though it costs more mana to cast.

The residents themselves are unaware of the true nature of the magic system and have not taken advantage of this. There actually is a good reason that the people are unaware of this/live in the dark ages technology-wise.

There is a lot more worldbuilding I have planned but I don't want to spoil the story.
