I like it!

Also, that is not how sleep deprivation works for me at all. I might be tired, but if something important happened, like the phone ringing, or some dick /stealing my hat/ I'd be halfway across the room in seconds before even noticing I was up. Five hours of sleep should allow you to at least function enough for breakfast, no? Do people seriously get like this when they don't have enough sleep?
