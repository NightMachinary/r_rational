Based on entirely fictional evidence (so take it all with a grain of salt), there are two ways that this storyline tends to go; at least so far as I can think of.

(a) The first option is where the Hero sees the doors being opened and the hands outstretched to help him out - and he turns away from all the institutions that rejected him the first time around. "I've seen what lies behind those empty smiles of yours," he says, "and I didn't like it." And then he finds some small out-of-the way institution which he's never interacted with before, and uses them instead.

(b) "I have my chance," says the Hero, "and I will take it. But I remember when I almost lost it." He becomes a venture capitalist on his own, in the fullness of time (using the same institutions that wouldn't take him the first time around). And he takes on the cases that others would reject - he gives the chance he didn't get to other people in the same situation.
