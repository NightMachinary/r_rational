I don't remember every instance.

A couple times were for fights.

Once because I chugged a 2 liter of Coke at a school picnic for attention, couldn't keep it down, and threw up into a garbage can.

Once when my group in Art class was accused of drawing something offensive on the table. We hadn't done it, we supported each other's alibis, but I ended up getting singled out for personal questioning. During questioning I ended up saying something like, "I wanna die." Boom, 2-day suspension.

The school admin in charge of discipline had it in for me and enjoyed making me cry, I think.
