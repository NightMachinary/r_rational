I'm taking this semester off from school to work on another startup and the difference in my experience this time is astounding. I love/hate it, it's total bullshit.

As background, I've bootstrapped and operated kind of outside traditional institutions my entire life. 1st gen immigrant, absent but hard-working parents, didn't speak English on my first day of school, moved around every couple years, suspended 7x in middle school as a straight A student, never learned to rely on The Institution, etc etc.

My first startup was right out of college and it was successful but so, so stifled. I hit 6-fig revenue within the first few months and then the banks hit. Each bank I used thought I was money laundering (I wasn't), because obviously some kid from flyover country could never achieve this legitimately, and closed my commercial /and/ personal accounts, not even allowing me to present evidence otherwise. PayPal put an illegal 3-month freeze on my funds. Shit sucked. Took me months and months to find someone that would listen to me and graciously accept my business.

This time is different though, because now I go to Harvard Law School. All the doors are open and fucking everyone is just throwing opportunities at me because of the institution I'm attached to. VCs want to talk, lawyers are happy to defer their fees indefinitely, everything is fucking great.

I'm grateful, but I hate it. I'm the same person I was back then. It's infuriating that nobody bothered to give me a chance back then.

I like that things are easier for me now, but fuck. I feel like I don't deserve this, y'know? I'm still me. Why couldn't you all see that years ago?

Shit, I'm crying now. I should talk to my therapist about this.
