i'm not that evil!!!

speaking of not being evil, i'm guessing you have no opinion about the subject of the next interlude? if you do please let me know because at the moment it is going to be a light-hearted romp of William yeeting axes about while Red giddily gives him more and more ridiculous challenges.
