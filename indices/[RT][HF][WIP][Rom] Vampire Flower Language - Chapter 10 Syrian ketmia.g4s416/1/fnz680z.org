What to say about this one?

It's not the "nasturtium" I promised last month in case anyone was keeping track, because it turns out that the chapter was like twice to three times the length of a normal chapter so I found a break point and you now have two chapters! Makes my beeminder goal happy :)

The Syrian ketmia (damn, also called the Syrian Mallow) means "persuasion", which is what the theme of this chapter is, more or less.

This is hopefully where we get some rational content, with Red being rightfully worried about whether he is in a state of mind control. Of course, he in the end doesn't ask William to prove anything, but it was really going to break the flow, so if people really want Red to do some experiments we can put it in the interlude

I love Cassius, and I think he makes for a great breath of fresh air in the middle of the chapter. What do you think his game is?

If anyone has requests for the next interlude, we're happy to entertain them: post here or on AO3.

EDIT: oh dang instead of the flower picture Reddit has made a church picture my thumbnail!!! Do they not appreciate the ART of choosing flower names from a vintage dictionary and then locating creative commons images on flickr!??!?! DO THEY NOT?
