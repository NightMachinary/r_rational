Ah~ I see. I hesitate to call "Re: Trailer Trash" a power fantasy mostly due to how few chapters it has at the moment, but it seems to be going in that direction currently.

The MC could still fail in certain objectives in the near future as well. A failure which could have heavy consequences depending on if and how it happens.
