Metaworld have lots of issues, it's one of those guilty pleasures it's not good enough to recommend to anyone but not bad enough to stop reading either, since it does have those fun parts from time to time, its issues kind of grate me a bit too.

what grates me most is probably how the side characters are treated, they don't feel like people they feel like props to make Gwens throne sparkle, metaworld is a mary sue power fantasy pure and true while doing it best not to appear like one.

but those can be nice too sometimes as long as they are well written.
