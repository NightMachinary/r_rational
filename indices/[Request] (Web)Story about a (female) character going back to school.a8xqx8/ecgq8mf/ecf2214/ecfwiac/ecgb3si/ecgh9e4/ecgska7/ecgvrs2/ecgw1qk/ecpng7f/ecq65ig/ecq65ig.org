To be fair to the MC, loosing weight isn't really /hard/ per se. Getting into a routine/habit to lose it is what's hard. Seeing as she had already lived (before) with a fairly healthy diet/lifestyle I don't think it'd be too unbelievable for her to lose weight that fast.

Burning 20 pounds a week may not be absolutely healthy but it is realistically doable.
