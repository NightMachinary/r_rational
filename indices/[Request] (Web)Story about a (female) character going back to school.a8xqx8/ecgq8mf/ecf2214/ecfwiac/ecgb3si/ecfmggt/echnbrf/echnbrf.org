I like /Still, Wait for Me/, but that has a male MC. It's also a translated Chinese webnovel. The main character is in his mid-thirties living with a lot of regrets: failed business, failed relationship, lots of debt, but then gets hit by a car and becomes 17 again and gets to relive his life and treat those around him better.

It has a very wistful and nostalgic tone to it, at least the early parts, where the MC relives the last year of high school and realizes, with his 30-year-old mindset, how good things were and how much of it he took for granted, and how fleeting the teenage worries he had were. He also knows the fate of a lot of his classmates and friends so he subtly tries to help them out when he can. It's a very slice of life series, and later on there's business management as well.

I should warn you that maybe 60-80% of the conflict is relationship drama, as the core conflict is that the MC already has a girl he loves--the one that got away in his past life--but he can't go see her as she's 5 years younger than him and she's about 12-13 at the start of the story. (Hence the title of the series as he has to wait to meet her again). Meanwhile, the MC is the type of guy who lacks the guts to flatly turn down women who show interest in him, leaving all of his relationships with women stuck in a "it's complicated" state. So in a sense this is a harem series, and that seems to be the biggest negative as seen from the reviews on novelupdates.
