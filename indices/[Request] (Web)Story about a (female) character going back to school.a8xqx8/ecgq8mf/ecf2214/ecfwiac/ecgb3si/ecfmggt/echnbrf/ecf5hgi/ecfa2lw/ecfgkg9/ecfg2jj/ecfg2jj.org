  "Metaworld's MC does demonstrate some 'maturity' when dealing with uppity teenagers around her... but not in the sense of being able to compromise, or show humility to avoiding petty ego-fights... just that she can stay calm and composed and then use her mary-sue powers to lay out a one-way smackdown of masturbatory levels."

op didn't ask for someone who comes back and is a saint/paragon of virtue/better person so I'm not sure why the MC being prideful and self centered is an issue? MC is dedicated to uplifting the living situations of people even the modern serf class that that have no magic and trying to make humanity better over-all

  Metaworld's MC constantly laments how her previous adult life and business acumen have no useful impact to her current teenage life as a mage in training"

this is true but the novel starts in her first year of high school, in some of the more recent chapters when MC is in college MC does finally put her MBA powers to work; making a deal with the House of M relating to modernizing the finical institutions of the world.

that being said although i like this story it doesn't have much of an emphasis on the school setting despite the MC being in high school then in college for the whole story so far
