Imo, this aspect of metaworld is really weak. Other isekai MCs use their gaming knowledge and/or life experience to help them in the new world.

Metaworld's MC constantly laments how her previous adult life and business acumen have no useful impact to her current teenage life as a mage in training. Her familial relationships are all different, the city she lives in is different, etc. etc. To the point where I question the point of making it isekai. Perhaps I'm spoiled by WtC, where the past life connection is the entire point of the story.

Metaworld's MC does demonstrate some 'maturity' when dealing with uppity teenagers around her... but not in the sense of being able to compromise, or show humility to avoiding petty ego-fights... just that she can stay calm and composed and then use her mary-sue powers to lay out a one-way smackdown of masturbatory levels.

Which can be fun, don't get me wrong.
