It's interesting to me which web serials are popular and which are not-as-popular. I'm guessing from your selection that Worm, Mother of Learning, and Wandering Inn are the three most popular web serials out there? That's obvious to me with Worm, but I didn't know that Mother of Learning was popular, and I've never heard of Wandering Inn.

How does Worth the Candle compare in popularity? That's the most popular story on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], after Mother of Learning. (And after HPMOR (which has a permanent place of eminence) and Significant Digits, I suppose, but those technically aren't original web serials, I guess)

An [[/r/rational][r/rational]] quizbowl would be interesting, maybe covering Mother of Learning, Worth the Candle, HPMOR, Significant Digits, and other [[/r/rational][r/rational]] standbys. (I admit I'm not so interested in your event, since I've only read Mother of Learning, like I guess some others on [[/r/rational][r/rational]])
