Alexa web traffic ranks are a pretty good way to gauge popularity, but it's hard because web serials hosted on Royal Road or some other third party are not indexed. In this metric, I believe "Practical Guide" is the most popular web serial currently running, but I'd imagine Worm has a much higher total readership.

Patreon supporters can be a good guide for those Royal Road fics. In this metric, Worth the Candle (369 Patrons), Practical Guide (615 Patrons), and Mother of Learning (634 Patrons) are dwarfed by Wandering Inn's 4,136 Patrons. So while I wouldn't say that this is entirely accurate (no way TWI is 10 times more popular than Worth the Candle), but it does tell you something.
