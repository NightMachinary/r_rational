You might like Greg Egan's fiction if you're okay with lots of science-wanking (I like it myself, but I calls 'em like I sees 'em). Incandescence probably being the most munchkiney.

You've read Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson, right? His other stuff is also excellent.

The Discworld books by Terry Pratchett. I predict you'd enjoy starting with one or two of the following: Going Postal, Jingo, the Wee Free Men, Thief of Time. You can worry about going back and reading the longer storylines once hooked :P
