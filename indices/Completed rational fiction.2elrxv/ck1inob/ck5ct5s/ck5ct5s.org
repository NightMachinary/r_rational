With Terry Pratchett you can simply look for the characters. Granny Weatherwax and Tiffany Aching are quite rationalist characters. Moist von Lipwig is a con man with great rational plot twists. Lord Vetinari is also (too?) awesome, but never a main character. Carrot and Rincewind and wizard stories are not rational.
