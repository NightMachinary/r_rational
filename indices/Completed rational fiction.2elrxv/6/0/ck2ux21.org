Inviolate does not require extensive knowledge of the DC universe. I appreciated it thoroughly while never having heard of the Manhunters, the Guardians of Oa, the names and exploits of the various Green Lanterns, et cetera. There's always a hint of exposition for characters that are mentioned incidentally and additional exposition for the important players.
