[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]] - Superman. Lex Luthor is the protagonist. No other knowledge of DC superheroes required.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]] Also Lex Luthor protagonist, many more characters from the DCU (so some googling may be required unless you read a lot of comics). Honestly one of my favorite fanfiction stories I've found to date.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] - Groundhog's Day style time loop in the Naruto verse. More munchkin-y than rationalist. Contains sexual themes.

(also Luminosity is *excellent*, but is already mentioned in another comment).
