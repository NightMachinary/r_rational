Please start on Worm asap, you'll be hooked within the close of the first chapter.

There is also Dune by Frank Herbert a soft sci-fi epic.

If you're in the mood for medieval fiction I highly recommend Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet. While it isn't exactly rational, it definitely has some very smart characters.
