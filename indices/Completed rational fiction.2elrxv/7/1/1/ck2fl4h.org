Yeesh. It shows that you only read the first 3 chapters. There is only 1 villain who is shown as Evil (with capital E and little by the way of justifications, believes or motives) till the end. The character seemed pretty focused and understandable (if not always rational, but what normal human is?). And the part about real harm made me laugh out so loud I almost woke up the people around me.

But seeing how you were already put off by immoral things in the first 3 chapters I wouldn't recommend you to read on. The first 3 chapters are so tame compared to some of the later parts that I can't quite put it into words.
