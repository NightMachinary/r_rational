  And yes, the "whole driver for conflict" thing, but that's a complete f'ing copout. Really? If that's the only way the story you want to write can be justified, you need to back up and try something else, because that is a literary cheat of the highest order. Basically that's saying "all conflict in the story, and the fact that literally everyone except the protagonist is either using their powers non-optimally or outright carrying the idiot ball is because plot."

I had that problem too. Worm was pretty obviously trying to do its deconstruction/reconstruction of the superhero genre, but I think that particular plot point was, if not poorly thought out, then at least not to my tastes. If the promise is that you're going to explain how the world ends up looking like it does in the comics (which I thought was the promise of the work), then what was done was, as you said, a cheat.

I guess I don't see what would have been so bad about having the world actually change in response to people having superpowers. If you've got a guy with lightning powers, you need a really good reason for him to be out fighting crime instead of just working safely in a power plant.
