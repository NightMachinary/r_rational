It obviously wasn't rationalist, and it wasn't even terribly rational. It was fairly munckinly, although the protagonist was the only one who was allowed to munchkin her powers. Doormaker alone should have been able to be hugely more powerful than he was. Don't even get me started on the tinkers, or on Dragon. And, as soobtoob says, there was no reason for most of the villains to be evil -- they could have just [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][marketed their powers legally]], made WAY more money than crime at lower risk, and called it a day.

All that aside, I enjoyed the beginning quite a bit. At some point (/when/ is arguable) it ramped the power level of the villains too high and just became bloody annoying. Fights against demigods are only interesting for so long, at least when the demigods are onstage. IMO you can get away with more when they are the (Wo)man Behind The Curtain, but these were straight up brawls.
