By my count, 297 chapters. None of them are particularly short, and as it goes on they get noticeably longer than in the opening arcs.

I can't remember the wordcount offhand, but I remember it being on the scale of approximately 1 to 1.5 million.

It's pretty long. I'm not a slow reader; I would also probably expect a re-read of HPMoR to take me on the order of a week, but not Worm.
