You need to read the books in the right order. Some series, you want to read them in published order (i.e. read the first, the second, the third...) and some you want to read in in-universe chronological order (e.g. read the third, the fifth, the first...)

The correct order for Dune is: read the first.

If you didn't like the first one, stop.
