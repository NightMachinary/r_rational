I loved the first book. I thought that the second and third books weren't as good. And then the fourth book wasn't as good as the third book, and the fifth book wasn't as good as the fourth. It's not an instant decline in quality, but I felt like reading less-good books down the series sort of soiled my love for the first book, in the way that poor sequels can sometimes taint the well.
