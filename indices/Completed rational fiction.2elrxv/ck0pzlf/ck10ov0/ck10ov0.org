I honestly hated worm. I read the first three chapters, and it really put me off from reading anything beyond. It felt like it was the universe itself that was holding the idiot ball. Most of the villains are villians because they're evil, and little else (rather counter to the claim that it's rational at all), and the main character's personality is completely inconsistent and all over the place. She does these enormously stupid things, but the universe itself caters to her, preventing any real harm. Plus, she (and several other characters) do some of the most immoral things without thinking twice. If I was in her situation, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night over the guilt.
