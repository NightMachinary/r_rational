Yeah, I knew those things but was trying to keep it simple and avoid spoilers.

I knew that about Doormaker but the people he worked for could still have used his powers to make a mint, control huge amounts of political and economic power, eliminated transportation costs for anyone they wanted something from...instead they used him to visit their vacation homes, basically. (They had wealth and power, true, but that seemed to derive from their business, not from use of Doormaker et al.)

And yes, the "whole driver for conflict" thing, but that's a complete f'ing copout. Really? If that's the only way the story you want to write can be justified, you need to back up and try something else, because that is a literary cheat of the highest order. Basically that's saying "all conflict in the story, and the fact that literally everyone except the protagonist is either using their powers non-optimally or outright carrying the idiot ball is because plot."

I also include the Endbringers in the "demigod" category. And no, that's not a spoiler. They get mentioned as "thing that periodically destroys cities" within a chapter or two, and it is instantly obvious that there is, at some point, going to be a fight with them.
