Yeaaaah. I read the whole thing and wasn't sure I could recommend it to people. It's fun in places, but there are problems. I really wasn't a fan of the very squicky and visceral violence that crops up, especially when a certain gang arrives in town. I also think the plot meanders a lot and could stand to be a lot shorter. Even by the later chapters there are some remarkably inconsequential fights that could be excised at absolutely no story cost.
