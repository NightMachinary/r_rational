I wonder how long it will take for people to start trying to defect from the Instruments now that they're seeing what Piccolo's really like. It's something you'd have to be very careful not to get caught doing (because Piccolo will fucking murder you), but there's no indication that Piccolo would be any better at noticing people trying to sneak away than the army's previous leaders. If anything, he might be worse at it, since his overwhelming strength means he doesn't need to be terribly vigilant, and his overwhelming hatred means he's not very in tune with his men.

Speaking of defections, I like that Mai's turned tail here. It makes me curious what's in store for her. I doubt she's actually going to be able to hurt Piccolo in any meaningful way, but her desire to do so might bring her to join Goku's crew. I can see a path for her that's similar to Vegeta, Piccolo Jr, or the Androids in canon, where she goes from bitter foe to begrudging ally and then becomes an actual friend as the years pass. Don't know if that's what's actually in store, but I think it's a definite possibility.
