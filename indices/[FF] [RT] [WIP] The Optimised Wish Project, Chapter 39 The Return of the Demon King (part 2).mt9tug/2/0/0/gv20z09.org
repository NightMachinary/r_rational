Snow is barely in the manga at all, yeah, mostly just pulling Goku out of his planewreck and occasionally getting a reaction scene while Goku is in Muscle Tower, and I think there was one for Piccolo. The anime added a lot to the Piccolo arc, that imo helped show Goku's journey and Piccolo's impact on the world (this being way before Freeza set the standard for filler to destroy the watchability of the anime). They went with Snow as the primary PoV character for experiencing Piccolo's effects on the general public, but let her have #8 around as protection so she didn't immediately get swept up in the chaos.

Yeah, Yajirobe feels like a character who showed up just because. It seems like he was probably an apology to Krillin's voice actor (Goku even comments at one point in the manga that he sounds kinda like Krillin). How he got so strong is never really hinted at. He's clearly not the most honorable person from his village (they kicked him out after all). Does that mean there's a village somewhere run by Samurai stronger than Yajirobe, who never do anything, and could have competed with the Turtle and Crane but never bothered? Yajirobe somehow heard of Piccolo, too... which seems a huge coincidence when the Sen'nin were treated as some of the only remaining memory of him. It raises a ton of questions, none of which are ever addressed, because there's no room / it's not important to the story / Yajirobe is just a replacement character for Goku to have someone to interact with while everyone else is unavailable.

That, and if Yajirobe had been anywhere near a way to hear about Bulma's call for magic / ki users, he probably would have gone for it. He's profit oriented like that. Maybe he showed up among the unmentioned martial artists, and just wasn't interesting enough to get listed?
