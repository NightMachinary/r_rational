You know, I haven't given enough thought to the question to decide whether antimatter /exists/ in this universe. I know and have already stated it's not a relativistic universe. There's no universal speed limit; the speed of light is just another speed (in fact, different frequencies of light don't necessarily move at the same speed). Now normally antimatter emerges as a prediction from a relativistic treatment of quantum mechanics (e.g. Dirac equation and then QFT), but that doesn't mean relativity is strictly speaking /required/ to justify its existence, and you can imagine non-relativistic QFT, so... I guess it should in theory exist, potentially. But probably can't be created from the straightforward photon => particle + antiparticle reaction.

Anyway. I hope you'll forgive my shoddy worldbuilding for not having worked out a fully consistent Theory of Everything in the DBZ universe.

About the dragon not knowing what antimatter does though... if it can create it, it can know what it does. It's a nearly all-powerful, all-knowing, transcendent wish-granting being. Knowing stuff is part of the job requirements.
