Very hpmorish approach, altough there is also a time travel in canon db (but maybe it's working in a slightly different way, it has no consistent time loops)

still, if it were up to me, I'd solve the dragon wish issue without time travel, I'd say that he has simple puffed out of existence the current 100-years(orso) old container and recreated it in brand-new (just after catching Piccolo) version. This would also create some moral issues, like, could we say that Dragon killed Piccolo in this case?
