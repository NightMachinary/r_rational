[[/u/SimoneNonvelodico][u/SimoneNonvelodico]] , this comment made me think, can you explain one thing?

We know that Dragon retrieved Piccolo container in the state as if mere seconds passed from his imprisonment. We also know that this container had to exist for the whole time before the dragon summoning, so the time had to pass for this container before the Wish was granted.

So basically... what exacly has Dragon did? Did he: a) turn back time for the container and left it with only few seconds passed? b) removed the current real life container instance, and brought back the one from the past? c) well, idk?

and let's make the question more interesting.

Let's keep with your story assumptions, but say that Piccolo was able to communicate all the time from his container, by, for example, inducing dreams.

Would he remember it after being summoned by the wish?
