I'll be upfront and say I don't really know what to do with Yajirobe, if anything. He might or might not pop up. He's never been a favourite of mine, and besides his brief role in the early Piccolo arc he's never had a significant role (really, it seems like Toriyama brought him forth as a way to pull Goku out of his pickle, then randomly parked him at Korin Tower for lack of a better role for him). Well, I guess he cut Vegeta's tail too, can't forget that.

So he might come up or not. While I have the story planned out there still might be room for the occasional character to pop up and fill in some role - but he won't be a key player by any stretch of the imagination.

  Snow isn't around to try and fail to assassinate Piccolo like she did in the Anime

By Snow you mean the little girl Goku meets in Jingle Village? I don't remember anything about her trying to assassinate Piccolo, but then again I remember the manga much more clearly than the anime for that part. Was it an anime original scene?
