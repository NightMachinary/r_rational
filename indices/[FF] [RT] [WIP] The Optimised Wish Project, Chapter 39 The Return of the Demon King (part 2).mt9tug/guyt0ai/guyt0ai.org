This and The Reckoning both updating by dawn? About a month late for my birthday, but I'll take it. <3

On one hand, I'm a little sad that Snow isn't around to try and fail to assassinate Piccolo like she did in the Anime. On the other, there's no way the Piccolo depicted here would have not just leveled the 10km^{2} in the general direction in response, so that's probably for the best.

... This is about where Yajirobe showed up in canon, and we've barely been introduced to T'en and Chaozu. This is clearly going a different direction, and I look forward to discovering it.
