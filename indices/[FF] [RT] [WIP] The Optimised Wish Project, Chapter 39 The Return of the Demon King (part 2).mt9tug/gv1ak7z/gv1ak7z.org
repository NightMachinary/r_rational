Great to see the payoff to all the buildup :) On the one hand it's unusual to see a villain in a rational fic be so absurdly and straightforwardly Evil Overlord, but on the other it makes sense given Piccolo's origin and it works for him given how enormously powerful he is compared to everyone else right now. I'm also glad this chapter brought up the inconsistency with the "Maestro"; I thought it strange that the Dragon made Piccolo appear not long after imprisonment, since it makes it impossible for him to have guided Piano meanwhile, and am looking forward to seeing who the hidden mastermind really is.

This fic continues to impress. Looking forward to the next chapter!
