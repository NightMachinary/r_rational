The Dragon compressed time within the container. In real world terms, imagine it as if he just dropped the container temporarily close to a black hole to give it a time dilation factor, so that in practice inside the container only a few instants passed when outside 300 years did. This is "skirting the line" w.r.t. divine time travel rules because it does send information backwards in time (the Dragon triggers a past occurrence) but does NOT create any self consistent loops, as the container was perfectly isolated from the outside world - the effect only applied to Piccolo himself, who was magically trapped within it, not to the actual matter of the container - and it was set to be open only after the wish was granted, so that information was not effectively sent to the past of the world line for all practical purposes.
