First: the whole point of the gods is that they're basically laws of nature personified. See the discussion between Baba and Korin. And what Shenlong fears is retaliation from one specific god (the one whose name sounds like... etc. etc. you may have guesses for who that is if you're up to date with the Dragon Ball franchise). So, sure, anything that feels too much like a smartass trick might still draw punishment.

Second: are you asking if Bulma can precommit to summoning the Dragon again in one year, asking him to speed up the flow of time within the sealed container by a factor of 10^{14,} then see how Piccolo emerges as a husk? No, she can't. Because Piccolo already came out, and the change was already enacted. Doing /that/ would require a straight up timeline split, not a self-consistent loop, which is exactly what is frowned upon by the gods. This by the way isn't something I'm making up, it's DB Super canon. The whole mess with Trunks creating a split timeline by saving Goku is not appreciated by the higher ups. The main story from the Android Saga onward takes place in a "pathological" timeline that was not supposed to exist. Shenlong would not agree to doing that, even if it were within his power.
