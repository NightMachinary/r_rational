  are you asking if Bulma can precommit to summoning the Dragon again in one year, asking him to speed up the flow of time within the sealed container by a factor of 1014, then see how Piccolo emerges as a husk?

what if she was lucky and smart enough to do this wish for the first time when they met dragon? After the May sniping Goku action, somehow? Would that work as a Piccolo killing method? Note that the Dragon wish itself wouldn't do the killing, it would just speed up the time...
