The girl from Jingle Village, who the anime did more with than the manga, but whose only major role in either was to save Goku when his stolen plane crashed near Muscle Tower. She didn't even get named in the manga, iirc. Hangs out with Hatchan / [android/artificial human/cyborg/jinzouningen] #8.

IIRC, they also used Snow in [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uHPdgsaE7qc][Goku's Traffic Safety special]] (because that's a thing that exists). I think Toei was hoping she'd be a bigger character than she turned out to be (Panzie from the first movie is basically Snow with a little bit of Chichi thrown in). I've heard some joke that Chrono from Chronotrigger is what Gohan would look like if Goku married Snow instead of Chichi.
