Finally, after the weeks of awaiting!!

Great chapter as usual, there were some points where it was hard to follow what's happening, but the all other is great.

I really hope for Mai redemption and I also wonder if you're going to jump straight to Goku vs Piccolo fight. It would make more sense to insert some training chapter like they do in anime, the sacred water thing (as I remember, the dead-now Tao Pai also tried the water), etc....

hmm maybe the next part is Turtle Master telling Goku to go Korin Tower...
