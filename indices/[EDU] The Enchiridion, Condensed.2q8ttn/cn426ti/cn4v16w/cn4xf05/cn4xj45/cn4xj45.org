  Just construct a good philosophy based on modern psychological and cognitive science and be done with it. Using contrived interpretations of questionably translated 2000 year old text for this seems ill-advised.

That's probably so, if you're trying to develop a philosophy. I didn't pick up Epictetus for the purpose of internalizing the principles of Stoicism; /Discourses/ just happened to be on my reading list and I managed to come away with some insights that were useful to me in my position. I also like his humor and found his prayers interesting.
