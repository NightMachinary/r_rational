  Some of these are incompatible with my values like this:

  #+begin_quote
    XII. It is better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

This is pretty poor on its own, I agree, and is probably best understood as corrective hyperbole: if someone is distressing themselves about their upkeep, the point is they can drop the distress. They are very probably not actually going to die if they stop stressing, and an extreme statement like this could open their mind to the possibility that one can still be happy in suboptimal conditions.

  And some are just downright silly:

  #+begin_quote
    XXXII. Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I believe this is a cultural difference. I seem to remember that laughing in that era was mostly understood as "laughing /at/".

  EDIT: My interest at this point is mostly academic. I don't think a model of behaviour built on ignoring things outside of one's causal reach is a good one for human beings.

I think it's more about realistic expectations. If you don't have absolute control over a thing, then it is wrong to expect that it will always go the way you want it to. (If it did, then it would be something you had absolute control over.) If you know that things are not always going to go the way you want them to, then you can be emotionally prepared for that eventuality. You don't have to discard emotions --- you can harness them for whatever productive ends they move you to --- but you don't have to let them /debilitate/ you.
