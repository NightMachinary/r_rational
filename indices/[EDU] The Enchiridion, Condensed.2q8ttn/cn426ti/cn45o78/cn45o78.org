  I don't think a model of behaviour built on ignoring things outside of one's causal reach is a good one for human beings.

Not "ignoring", not at all. "Tying emotional state to." When Epictetus says "Concern yourself not with the weather, for it is outside your influence," he means "You can't control the weather, so don't get all upset when there's rain and clouds on your birthday. Just be happy regardless of the weather."

Does that make a little more sense?

  But there are a couple of good ones and the overall theme seems interesting. Is there any good modern analysis of that philosophy you can recommend to me?

/A Guide to the Good Life/, by William B Irving, has been very helpful to me. It's a pretty straightforward interpretation of Stoic philosophy and an application to the modern day. He's written a few articles [[http://boingboing.net/author/william_b_irvine][here]], which I also recommend.

Unfortunately, [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/][quite]] a [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/][few]] purely scholarly analyses seems to focus less on the philosophy and more on the archaic metaphysics taught by the ancient practitioners. As the SEP says, "Stoicism has never been â€˜purely academic'." I'll do some googling and see if I can find anything.
