That does not really answer my criticism.

  If that were to happen, would you cry that you can no longer choose what you wear? No, of course not. Breaking down in tears is hardly ever productive.

There is less motivation to try and change your situation for the better if you trained yourself to stop caring about things seemingly outside of your control. Sure I might decide to fight the totalitarian government as a result of rational deliberation completely unencumbered by feelings (not really, but for the sake of argument let's assume it's possible), but if I really hated not being able to wear my favourite pants, I might start fighting just a bit sooner and fight just a little bit harder and save one more life as a result. Like it or not, emotions play a very big part in human decision making and lowering my dissatisfaction with things that are not right will lead me to take less action to make them right.

And why do you decide that choosing what you wear is outside of your control anyway? Surely dismantling the totalitarian government would allow you this freedom again, right? Where do you draw the line between things you can and cannot affect?

Sounds good in theory and falls flat in practice. Human beings are not really capable of decision making not informed by emotions. Maybe I'm an extra special snowflake myself (seriously doubt that), but I'd rather have more emotions about bad things I have no control over. Then I'd have enough motivation to start doing something to make this world significantly better.
