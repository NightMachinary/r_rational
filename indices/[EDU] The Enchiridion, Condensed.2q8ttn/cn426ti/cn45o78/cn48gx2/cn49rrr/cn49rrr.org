Ahh, now I understand where you're coming from.

The whole point is that the only thing we really have control over is our map. Anything we control in the territory could be taken away. For instance, you might think you have control over what you wear every day, but a totalitarian government could come tomorrow and take that away from you. If that were to happen, would you cry that you can no longer choose what you wear? No, of course not. Breaking down in tears is hardly ever productive.

Keep in mind that when Epictetus says "the world's a stage; play your part," he's speaking as a slave who believed his part was "philosopher" and therefore won his freedom through years of effort. Marcus Aurelius, writer of the great Stoic text /Meditations/, was a Roman Emperor who led great wars of conquest against the Parthian Empire and won the Marcomannic Wars against the Germanic tribes. Being driven to do great things is not at all incompatible with Stoic philosophy.

How's this for a summary: Stoicism says, "Act on your principles, not your moods." Does that make sense?
