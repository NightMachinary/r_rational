Some of these are incompatible with my values like this:

#+begin_quote
  XII. It is better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation.
#+end_quote

And some are just downright silly:

#+begin_quote
  XXXII. Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.
#+end_quote

But there are a couple of good ones and the overall theme seems interesting. Is there any good modern analysis of that philosophy you can recommend to me?

EDIT: My interest at this point is mostly academic. I don't think a model of behaviour built on ignoring things outside of one's causal reach is a good one for human beings.
