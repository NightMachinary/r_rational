If your reinterpret Enchiridion strongly enough to get output like "Do not let bad things upset you so much you are debilitated" and "Do not expect everything to go your way", then it becomes a good philosophy. But why use Enchiridion at all? Just construct a good philosophy based on modern psychological and cognitive science and be done with it. Using contrived interpretations of questionably translated 2000 year old text for this seems ill-advised.

EDIT: If it's not clear from my previous posts, I'm strongly against using any interpretation of philosophical text but the most blindingly obvious one. If philosopher wants to convey his ideas to some public the onus is on him to make the meaning clear and unambiguous. I'm not going to try and reverse engineer the intended meaning behind mangled hyperbole.
