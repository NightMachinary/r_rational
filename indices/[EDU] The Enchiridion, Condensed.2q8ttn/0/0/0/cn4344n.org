There are a lot of things which looked reasonable at the time, but are not so now. I'm not looking forward to reverse engineering philosophical insights of a 2000 year old text and then constructing a rational modern reinterpretation based on them. That is why I asked for a modern analysis. I'm hoping someone did all the work for me.

EDIT: As for twelve, it's a matter of interpretation. After reading the full version:

#+begin_quote
  If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: "If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, he will be bad." For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better your servant should be bad, than you unhappy.
#+end_quote

I don't think Epictetus meant euthanasia when he wrote that. I'm actually not sure what he really wanted to express with this one. It looks like a modern "you're fine just the way you are" meme, but then he prefaces it with "if you want to improve", which seems rather odd. He basically says "If you want to improve, then be happy lazing about starving to death. It's better than doing a bit of work you despise to feed yourself."

EDIT2: I feel that interpreting this as "you should optimise your life for cumulative happiness and not lifespan" is way too charitable to Epictetus. At this point it's no longer his philosophy, but something of our own creation.
