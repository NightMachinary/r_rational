I think I can clarify a bit. Stoicism shares a vary close ancestory with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_%28philosophy%29][Cynicism]], which was a specific form of hedonism. In that school of thought, one is trained to take pleasure in the small things. Epictetus in particular was heavily influenced by Cynical teachings, and greatly admired [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_of_Sinope][Diogenes the Cynic]]. Epictetus viewed cynicism as a perfect form of stoicism, where a person has complete self-control.

Cynicism stems from asking questions like this;

"Will the pleasure gained from having a Ferrari, minus the stress caused by the effort of actually getting one, be more than the pleasure of simply bathing in the sun?"

In Cynicism, one trains them self to take extra pleasure in small things, and takes as little effort as possible to gain as much pleasure as possible. There's more to Cynicism than this, but that's as much as I need to explain.

This isn't exactly what Epictetus is saying, but he's saying something in a similar vain. The stress of worrying about a problem plus the pleasure gained from fixing it is less than the inconvenience of having the problem, if you train yourself to not be worried about it.

The various post-Socratic philosophies were very centered around emotion. They often had a stated goal of completely avoiding one emotion or another, and/or promoting one emotion, usually pleasure, by varying definitions.

Epictetus's account of stoicism puts abnormally heavy emphasis on one's ability to choose, that is, our will. The only thing we have absolute control over is our thoughts, opinions, or decisions. And as such, it is a highest virtue to possess absolute control over these, so that we may make the "right" choice. I'd recommend reading the first few chapters (they're super short) of [[http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.1.one.html][The Discourses]], which gives a clear account of this emphasis. It may help to know that Epictetus was born into slavery, and the idea that, even if one cannot control their body, they can still control their mind, became very important to him. In his mind, anyone who possesses concern for those things for which they do not have absolute control, anything that's external to the mind, lacks virtue. Hence, it is not virtuous in his mind to worry about external problems.

If you're interested in studying stoicism in general, using Epictetus's Handbook (that's what Enchiridion means) will be woefully incomplete. It's specifically intended to be a study guide, a companion to a larger course on stoic ethics. Epictetus's writings (really [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrian][Arrian's]], as Epictetus didn't actually write anything himself) mainly consist of ethics. Most of stoic philosophy is actually concerned with Platonic/Socratic logic, physics, and metaphysics. Epictetus deliberately goes out of his way to downplay the importance of these, even though they were the chief concerns of his contemporaries and predecessors. His views on stoicism were greatly influential, but they were not always canonical.

A good modern account of these ideas is given in the [[http://historyofphilosophy.net/][History of Philosophy without any gaps]]. The Hellenistic subsection in the Later Antiquity category contains an episode dedicated exclusively to Epictetus, as well as other aspects of stoicism and its sibling philosophies.
