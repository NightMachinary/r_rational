Twelve is fine from the perspective of someone thousands of years ago, who probably didn't expect to live very long anyway.

Valuing happiness over some mildly increased lifespan while unhappy is a totally reasonable position. The equivalent is euthanasia today, whee it is completely rational to check out rather than face suffering for a short period of time. There is only negative utility, hell, letting a disease take you out rather than dying while relatively healthy probably even makes resurrection harder if you go the cryonics part.
