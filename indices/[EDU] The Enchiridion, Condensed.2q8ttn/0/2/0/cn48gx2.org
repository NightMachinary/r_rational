  Concern yourself not with the weather, for it is outside your influence.

If something outside your immediate influence does not bother you, you are not likely to try and bring it under your influence. I feel that this is a crucial bug in this model of behaviour. Humans are pretty bad at estimating what does and does not lie in our causal reach. Some things turn out to be within reach only when we are bothered enough to try and affect them. Stoicism may be a good philosophy for enduring hardship, but not for trying to cure death or save the Earth from UFAI.

In general, since our emotions guide our behaviour in ways that are not always obvious, tinkering with out own utility functions like stoicism prescribes seems a bit risky to me. You may end up happy and content as people you could have saved, if you cared to try, continue to die around you. That does not sound like the optimal outcome to me.
