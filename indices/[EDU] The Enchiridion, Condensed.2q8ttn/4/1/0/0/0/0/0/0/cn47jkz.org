  I've never bought cable service, and my primary rage-news source is reddit. I've always generally been anti-consumption, because, well, yeah, what do you do with all that stuff? Most people I know with lots of stuff barely manage to use any of it any significant fraction of the time.

Maybe you're already there. Maybe you don't need Stoicism. As I said in the OP, a rationalist Stoic behaves exactly like a regular rationalist; it seems you just started out as a stronger man than I.

  There's a reason almost every internet account I have makes some kind of Gurren Lagann reference: it's literally the only pop-culture work I've seen in which my "to feel and feel passionately is to live, so fight determinedly for everything!" attitude was ever actually portrayed as a positive -- almost all fiction drops into "emotions are bad" whenever it tries to be "deep" or "have a message".

Well, yes. System 1 and System 2 thinking, you're familiar I presume? Both are important, but sometimes one gives better / more optimal results than the other. Stoicism kinda banks on the idea that System 2 is generally a bit more optimal than System 1. Do you disagree with that?

  LOL guess how many textbooks I've managed to accumulate.
