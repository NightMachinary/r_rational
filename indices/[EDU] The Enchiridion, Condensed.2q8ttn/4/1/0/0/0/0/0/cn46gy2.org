  I've stopped watching the mainstream news, and I've been so much happier. More tranquil. I'm thinking of canceling my cable service. I'm also starting to be a little anti-consumption, which I don't know what to do with, but why would anyone need more stuff?

I've never bought cable service, and my primary rage-news source is reddit. I've always generally been anti-consumption, because, well, yeah, what do you /do/ with all that stuff? Most people I know with lots of stuff barely manage to use any of it any significant fraction of the time.

The weird thing is, I'm the opposite of a Stoic. Like, if Stoics are the Jedi, I'm an outright Sith. The concept of /not/ having intense emotions seems /weird/ and /inhuman/ to me. There's a /reason/ almost every internet account I have makes some kind of /Gurren Lagann/ reference: it's literally the /only/ pop-culture work I've seen in which my "to feel and feel passionately is to live, so fight determinedly for everything!" attitude was /ever/ actually portrayed as a positive -- almost all fiction drops into "emotions are bad" whenever it tries to be "deep" or "have a message".
