  it seems you just started out as a stronger man than I.

This is one of the most laughable statements I've ever read. You would underestimate the amount of sad personal history I don't talk about on the internet. Or in public. Or with anyone who's not a blood relation or marital equivalent.

  Well, yes. System 1 and System 2 thinking, you're familiar I presume? Both are important, but sometimes one gives better / more optimal results than the other. Stoicism kinda banks on the idea that System 2 is generally a bit more optimal than System 1. Do you disagree with that?

It's not that I object to thinking. It's that I don't see it as dichotomous with feeling. At least as my parents taught me to manage my emotions, the important difference is between long-term and short-term: how much /staying power/ does an emotion have to affect your later evaluations, how thoroughly do you share this emotion with your past and future selves? Thought is for serving the passions that past, present, and future "yous" all share.

Which is kinda a really short way of describing something I do by blunt heuristics that probably requires quite a lot of psychological knowledge to describe thoroughly.

  Too many?

More than I actually have time to read. Alas, by the material I /have/ studied, I'm merely almost finished with an MSc in Computer Science and an undergrad-level minor in math. By the time I finish all the materials I've accumulated, I'll probably be at a level of MSc computer science plus undergraduate majors in math and theoretical CS (focusing on logic, probability/statistics, and their intersection /FOR SOME WEIRD REASON/), plus some PhD-student-level knowledge in a few specialized fields.

This might be /somewhere near/ enough, but it's going to be quite tough to accomplish since day-job sorts of stuff always interferes.
