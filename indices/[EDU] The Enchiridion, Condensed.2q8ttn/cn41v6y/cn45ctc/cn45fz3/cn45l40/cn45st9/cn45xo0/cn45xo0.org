Okay, that's alright. I guess it's not for everyone?

It has this great side-effect of reorientation: yknow, letting me focus in on what's important in life. I've stopped watching the mainstream news, and I've been so much happier. More tranquil. I'm thinking of canceling my cable service. I'm also starting to be a little anti-consumption, which I don't know what to do with, but why would anyone need more /stuff/?

I don't know what's been happening to me since I started Stoicism. From that description, it sounds like I've turned into some hippy-dippy New Age vegan, but I've not. Sure, walks through nature, but also lots of science books and I'm learning a lot more now than I ever have before.

And my job has stopped annoying me. Which is very, very welcome.
