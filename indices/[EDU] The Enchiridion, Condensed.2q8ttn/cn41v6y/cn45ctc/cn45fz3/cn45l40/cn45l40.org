Again, differentiating between pop mutilated little-s stoics and philosophically respected big-S Stoics: It's not saying you shouldn't be overemotional, it's just saying that you shouldn't be very overemotional about things you can't control. For instance, bursting into tears whenever it rains because you /hate/ the rain. Or losing sleep every night because you can't stop worrying about the outcome of a controversial court case continents away. Those would be non-Stoic behaviors. Surely you can see the wisdom in that?
