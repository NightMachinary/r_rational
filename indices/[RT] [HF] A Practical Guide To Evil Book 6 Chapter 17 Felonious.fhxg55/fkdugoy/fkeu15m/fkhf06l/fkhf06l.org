Yes, with subsections named things such as 'fluorescent, neither flora nor fauna', and 'travel journal, but metaphorical'. Just the /subsection names/ get my palms and brain itching to pick up one of these books and find out what the inside is like, and there are /stacks/ of these! Stacks, and way more stacks beside of subsections upon subsections that we haven't even heard the fascinating names of! All information judged worthy of storing in the Arsenal, even if just-in-case, collected from all sorts of places! This is, once again, information that there may be /no other copy of in existence at the moment!/ This is not burning silver, because silver is *fungible!* Burn some silver, you can do something of value for a while and get someone to give you some more silver again--the world has plenty of silver! Collect irreplaceable books and then *burn* them and /no one can ever read them!/

Hmm, maybe I can be comfortably horrified by the silver comparison, in that I completely sympathise with the context that forced this to be near-necessary (unless there were some other thing she could have done instead of casually doing this...), but she seems to be showing disregard for why what she's doing (/the sacrifice that's being made) is a terrible thing--like someone forced by circumstance to murder their own several-years-old child to stop a secret's exposure, then commenting on what a shame it was because of the price of the bloodstain-ruined shirt.
