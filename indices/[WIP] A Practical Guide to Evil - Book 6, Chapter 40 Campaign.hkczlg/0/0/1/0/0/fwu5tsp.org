The reason why Cordelia refused to become a hero is because how heroes operate. It's like that Captain America quote from the comics in civil war that goes something like, if the whole world and it's governments decide that something wrong is right and tell you to move, you tell /them/ to move.

Olivier saw a way that he could have prevented all of this death and destruction and all it would have cost was his own selfish desires. Once you get to that thought it isn't a "degree of goodness" anymore, a person can't take the (perfectly reasonable) view that they held no responsibility and still be a hero.

While some stories explore heroes of other varieties, the mainstream and classic (not classical like greek) heroes work this way. It's why Spider-Man holds great responsibility, it's why heroes don't tell their loved ones because continuing to save people is put before their own happiness.
