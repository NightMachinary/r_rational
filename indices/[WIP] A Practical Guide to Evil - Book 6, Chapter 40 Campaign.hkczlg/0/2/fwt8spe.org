Anyone else seeing parallels with how Catherine has brought in Named under the T&T and the mage collective that Rogue built? Similar tension of having power that normal forces can't control leading to tension. Uncomfortable compromises with temporal authority etc.

And potentially ominous foreshadowing with how Rogue's version failed because of members of it who wanted more power, and the inability to restrain them.
