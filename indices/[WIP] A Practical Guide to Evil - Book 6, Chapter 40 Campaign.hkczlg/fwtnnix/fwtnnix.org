I liked the extra chapter, but I'm still sorting my feelings on it. Random thoughts:

- I had mentally been calling Olivier as "Oliver" the whole time. Anyone else?

- The ending seemed rushed to me. Would have liked to have seen Roland's side of things and mental process. Also curious how he learned about Alisanne's plans, and specifically about how they involved Olivier. Who told him or how did he learn of them?

- Wondering why the raiders had live horses ( presumably, since they were drinking from a stream). I wouldn't have expected them to be able to ride, since they seem fairly rudimentary and inattentive. At first I thought it was just Roland and his teacher who had them, but it sounds like they fought before he left to start the raid, so only one would have been needed.

- I expected the name swap at the end, but I had expected Roland to live and become the Wicked Enchanter. Would have set up an interesting arc when Rogue Sorcerer discovered the murdered Damned was his long-lost brother. Oh well...

- That being said, I think Olivier's crafted story was a bit too convoluted. He added a Praesi warlock to take blame off Morgaine and Roland, but then swapped himself for Roland to avoid giving the truth away. Because Roland usesagic and Olivier didn't, right? But making the story that Olivier came into his magic by becoming Chosen to avenge his brother solves the issue without the need for a face-swap. The Heavens bestowed him the Talent; who'd question that? And then there's no chance at ever worrying if he meets someone who knew the brothers, or from someone who can see through illusions.

- Looking forward to seeing what Alisanne has been up to since this backstory!
