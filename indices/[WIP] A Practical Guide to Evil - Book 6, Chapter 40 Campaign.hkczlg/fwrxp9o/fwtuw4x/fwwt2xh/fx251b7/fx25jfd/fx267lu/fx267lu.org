I like him and I wish it was possible for them keep working together closely because I like the White/Black interaction, but the difference between their names means when Cat finds an "innovative" solution like this not only is her name not getting in the way she's actually being true to her nature, but with Hanno I don't think it would be possible for him to ever agree to this under any circumstances. It's like when you play a paladin in a RPG and some dialog options are grayed out or just don't even show up.
