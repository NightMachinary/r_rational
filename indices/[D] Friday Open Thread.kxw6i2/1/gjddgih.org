I'm thinking about attempting to write a “”realistic”” Gamer story. Like The Erogamer without the ero (and meta). I'm trying to decide what the best place and time to have the story start is, relative to the protag gaining the power. Setting it before gives the reader time to get the know the protag as a bit of a baseline, even if it's less than a chapter's worth. Setting it directly as they gain the power is a little closer to the action, but given that I want the protagonist to behave somewhat like a real person, they're almost certainly going to freak out and think they're hallucinating. That might be more annoying than interesting to read. Lastly I could start it a few days afterwards when they've accepted that they might as well treat this as reality, having done some basic tests to ensure it's probably not simple hallucinations or delusions. It's my understanding that people with delusions can still understand people who tell them their delusions aren't real, they just don't believe them. So when people tell the protag “how did you just make that disappear” it's somewhat encouraging. This feels like a bit of a copout and could miss out on important characterization, but also gets right to the action.

A large part of the reason I'm asking is because I'm inexperienced as a writer, so I realize it might be a pretty trivial question.

I was thinking of having it set in 2018-2019 so it's still very close to the present but I'll have a better idea of, say, the state of geopolitics or a global pandemic during the timeframe. Also tempted to make the mystery of where the system came from a non-issue, Erogamer and WTC explore that enough for my taste. I'd either make it known immediately or downplay the importance as it's seen as completely unknowable.

Edit: also, I'll probably post a little about it for worldbuilding Wednesday, but the background reason why the protag got the power is that there's an alternate timeline for each human that's ever been alive, and an alternate timeline for a set number of powers they could have. This is recursive for people born in those alternate timelines, so timelines exist where everyone alive has a supernatural power. So if you want your favorite urban fantasy conceivably exists somewhere in this multiverse!
