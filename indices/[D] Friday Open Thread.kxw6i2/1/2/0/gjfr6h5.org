Re: your first point, I'm hesitant to assume the reader has read Gamer stories before (you have to start somewhere!) but yeah, I'll try to avoid describing all the minutia of the system immediately. I think I'd rather spread it out, I'm picturing it as a slower paced story than some others.

Paranoia is a good point. Keeping it to like two friends and having the protagonist already know some op-sec concepts from the beginning is a good idea. Basic stuff like “turn off your phones and leave them at home, throw out your Alexa”. I think that could be an interesting minor plot element and a fun thing for me to research.

Most likely this won't end up being shared, it'll be about the third thing I've seriously attempted to write. I appreciate the support though!
