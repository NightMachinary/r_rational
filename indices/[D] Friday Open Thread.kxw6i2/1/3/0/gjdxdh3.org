Zero hesitation breaks my suspension of disbelief for a story that's trying to take itself seriously. What circumstances make it feel more real to you?

Besides freaking out, making them at least not assume that the system is real and making some token effort towards investigating would also fulfill that requirement. Thinking about it more, this is kinda what WTC did, just lowkey and as a side element to the action going on, which might be a good cue to follow. Maybe they get the ability in a high-stakes situation so they don't have time to freak out.
