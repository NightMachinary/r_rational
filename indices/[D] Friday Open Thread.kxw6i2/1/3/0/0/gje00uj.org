I mean, /Erogamer/'s MC reaction was believable. She is /that/ bad when it comes to body issues. Overall, characters obsessed with achieving a certain goal might, realistically, act irrationally when presented with an opportunity to reliably achieve said goal.

Again, this might work in one case out of a dozen at best, and probably should be used even more sparingly than that.
