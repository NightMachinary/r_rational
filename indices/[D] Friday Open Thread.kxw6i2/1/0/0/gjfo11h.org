Freaking out is a bit strong word stronger than I meant, but I think it's a reasonable response to be very concerned about your mental state if you're experiencing something that should be impossible. It's also relevant to consider the background of the protagonist - if they're already not 100% mentally well, or even just prone to magical thinking and aware of it, thinking they might have “cracked” may be a real concern.

Testing also doesn't wrap the concerns up nicely, because after you've established that it's something other people can see and acknowledge you're still left with it being impossible. Some personality types might be mostly fine with this, I'd expect a subset to be faced with an existential crisis.

My point is there's all these complications introduced just from having something impossible happen that don't make a fantasy good story, which is annoying. Most likely I'll go with something that minimizes mental impact while still showing distress - they'll immediately ask their friends for guidance and demonstrate their abilities instead of goofing off/freaking out alone in their room.
