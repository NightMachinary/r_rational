  Setting it directly as they gain the power is a little closer to the action, but given that I want the protagonist to behave somewhat like a real person, they're almost certainly going to freak out and think they're hallucinating. That might be more annoying than interesting to read.

Would you panic and run around in circles in their shoes? If no, consider upgrading the characters' intelligence and maturity until they're less far below yourself. If yes, why? Gamer is testable, just like you say. In real life I might initially suspect with high probability I was hallucinating, but if my mind otherwise felt absolutely normal, I'd go test that assumption first thing, because my understanding would be that fully realistic hallucinations usually don't go along with all introspective meters reporting inside the interiors of their remembered ranges.
