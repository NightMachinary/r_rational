Yeah, I'm shying away from Gamer's Mind because it is somewhat of a cop out, but if it was something like “you are going to accept that your reality is now vastly different in this specific instance” as opposed to the default catch-all mental protection I'd like it better. Consequences aren't as extreme from that.
