In real life, /Worm/'s Taylor wouldn't be anybody's idea of sensible time management or life choices. But in the story, we actually watch Taylor /trying to figure things out/, even if that's just "how to beat up these enemies and get away." That makes her rational-crack in a way that Tolkien and Marvel can't be.

Tolkien's heroes endure; Marvel's heroes have emotional epiphanies. Taylor Hebert deduces battle tactics.

The other big r-adjacent element in /Worm/ is that the world is treated as a broken thing that the POV wants to see fixed, not a permanent backdrop to be ignored.

/Worm/ elevates "figure things out" and "power /should/ be for making things better, even if it isn't" in a way most stories don't.

TMCDE? It's kind of a Doylist side effect of those two. If the heroine isn't a failure, and is trying to make things better, then to keep tension we have to keep upping the stakes.
