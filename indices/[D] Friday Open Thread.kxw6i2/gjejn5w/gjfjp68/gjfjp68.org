As one data point, it's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescue#Common_law_system][generally not illegal]] to fail to act when you could to save another.

Now, we're not talking only about legality, but to draw an analogy - many aggressive acts are illegal; the quintessential being assault. In this analogy, failing to act to prevent harm would be closer to negligence, which isn't really "aggressive" by default.

However, the nuance of the situation matters. If someone is a true "innocent bystander" then IMO you can't call it aggressive if they fail to intervene to prevent harm. However, if the person has some reasonable knowledge or responsibility over the situation such that they are knowingly allowing the person to come to harm, then it could be understood as aggressive. This could be analogised to the situations where there /is/ commonly a (legal) duty to rescue (see above link).

As always when there is nuance to understanding something, it's easy to talk past each other since you're using the same words to talk about different things, and coming from a different frame of reference.
