I agree with your definition, but I understand where the other person is coming from. I think they were making aggression overly vague.

We do have cultural norms and expectations for when we think the default response should be helping. Having the "obvious" ability to help (medical training, situation etc), severe accidents, and children/elderly come to mind. I still wouldn't call it aggression, but in those scenarios standing by would make people upset, especially if they think you could've helped.

The other person is likely imagining a scenario where you can definitely help, walk up to the accident, but then just sit and watch it happen without helping.
