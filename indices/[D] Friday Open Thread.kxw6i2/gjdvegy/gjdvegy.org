For some reason, your pre-committed "password" in case you meet yourself from the past/future/another timeline/other universe/etc. is not a phrase but rather a recollection of a specific story from your past with details that only you could possibly know.

So, you meet this person who claims to be you from the future. Without you prompting them, they tell you a recollection of a specific story from your past with details that only you, and you alone, could possibly know. The problem is that it's /not/ the story you've pre-committed to.

How do you react to this? What do you do?
