Naw, stripping requires actually understanding everything, lest you strip something important. Building a standalone UI that calls the full git behind the scenes is so, so much easier.

Full paragraph comparison /is/ more obnoxious than line by line, but I imagine a smart tool would know to split each paragraph into (temporary) lines for easier comparison. That's the sort of thing that the UI would handle without actually changing anything under the hood.
