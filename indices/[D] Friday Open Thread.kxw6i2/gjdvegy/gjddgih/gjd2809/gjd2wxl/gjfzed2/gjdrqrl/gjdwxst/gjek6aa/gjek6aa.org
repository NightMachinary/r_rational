ErraticErrata needs something like this. PGtE is an amazing story, but literally every single chapter has a ton of errors, and usually at least one that actually makes interpreting a sentence difficult. And so many of them are so obvious that pretty much anyone going over the chapter quickly would catch the vast majority of them. I am perennially confused why they have not asked someone from the community to perform this task for them. Forget an actual editor, just a fresh set of eyes will catch most things.

It has by far the strangest ratio of quality story to bad grammer/spelling errors that I have ever seen.
