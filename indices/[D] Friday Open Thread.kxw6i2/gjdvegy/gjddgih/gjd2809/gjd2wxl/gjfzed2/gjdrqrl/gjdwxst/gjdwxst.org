Maybe just SVN instead of git? It's been about a decade, but back in college we got all the artists on game projects to use Tortoise SVN, without too much headache.

With any traditional version control software, you're going to have a headache if you're just editing one giant manuscript with multiple people patching it. Splitting into chapters or whatever would help.

Google Docs is already a GUI and handles people editing the same large manuscript decently enough.
