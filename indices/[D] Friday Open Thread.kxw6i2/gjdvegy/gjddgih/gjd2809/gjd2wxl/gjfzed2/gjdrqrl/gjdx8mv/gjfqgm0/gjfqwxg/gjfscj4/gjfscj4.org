Sounds like it just ends up making a lot of extra work for the author that isn't writing. There's nothing you're describing that you can't already do as an individual. The struggle would be to implement it in a way so that it's worth the time cost somehow. I don't know if asynchronous version control is the best system for that. I guess the overlying UI probably matters more than the backend in the end.
