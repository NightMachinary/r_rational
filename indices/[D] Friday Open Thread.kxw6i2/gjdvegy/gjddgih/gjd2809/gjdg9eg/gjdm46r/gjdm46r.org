My understanding is that Wildbow doesn't consider /Worm/ to be rat!fic, and I agree. Worm cares more about drama (consider how the Protectorate acts more freely when Taylor is a villain but is more hamstrung when she's a hero, because the /actual/ rule that the Protectorate runs on is "What will make things more difficult for Taylor?").
