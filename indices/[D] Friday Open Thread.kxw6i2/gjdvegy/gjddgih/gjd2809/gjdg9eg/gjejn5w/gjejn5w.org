So I recently got into a discussion with someone about what kinds of things qualify as "aggression". They made the claim that failing to act in a situation where you could prevent harm because you don't like the person who is in danger qualifies as aggression. I argued that it wasn't since a pretty core part of the definition of aggression is action, it can't be passive. Failing to act might be morally wrong, but wouldn't be aggressive.

Now, I don't care too much that they had a different definition than I do, I am just about the furthest thing from a lingual prescriptivist there is, but what bothered me is that they claimed that their definition was so obviously correct that I must be trolling them and purposefully misinterpreting. Now, /I/ know that I wasn't doing that, but I also feel like that was a ridiculous thing to claim. I know that, given the internet, I should just assume the person was being kind of a dick, but it left me wondering if I really am just that disconnected from the common usage of the word.

So I figured to I'd ask here. Not whether or not the definition is correct, but whether or not it's so widespread that a claim that it isn't true must be disingenuous. I'd literally never heard someone try and claim that /not/ doing something, no matter the circumstances, could be considered aggression, so I was confused. Maybe I was just wrong!
