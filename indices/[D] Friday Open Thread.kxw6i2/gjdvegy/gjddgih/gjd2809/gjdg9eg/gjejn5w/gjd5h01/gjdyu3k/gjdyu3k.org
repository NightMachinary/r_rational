Identify: causes, triggers/setting, and the "payoffs". Then make changes to reduce or remove those. The payoff is usually self stimulation/distraction.

Personally I find focusing on a replacement behavior to be more effective. Focus on occupying your hands, using off-putting tasting lotion, frequent scheduled nail cutting etc. Don't beat yourself up if you backslide, behavior change is stochastic not linear. Also try to make changes that you would be content to keep forever as opposed to only until your nail biting is "fixed".
