I don't have any specific advice as I'm not an experienced writer, but heres a few points you might want to watch out for:

- The kind of reader that's likely to start reading a Gamer story has probably read other Gamer stories. This means that whatever you end up doing on the object level, you should use the opening to establish as quickly and briefly as possible /what type of story this is/ - and as soon as you've done that, move on to the interesting parts. There's nothing worse than a beginning thats 90% repeated infodumps because the writer couldn't figure out how to move things along.

As an example, I think [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35669/apocalypse-generic-system/chapter/549831/chapter-1-may-cause-drowsiness][the first chapter of Apocalypse: Generic System]] shows this done well. It quickly introduces the main character, simultaneously providing a reasonable justification for his situation, and then makes the type of story immediately clear.

Then, we follow the character figuring out what to do. The thought process is kept brief, but clear, before moving on to describing concrete actions.

  “Hey, can I change the difficulty? I was making those choices in an altered state.”

  No answer.

  /Worth a shot,/ Jeb thought, gaze falling on the crates.

  Bits of forest poked him through his socks as he made his way to the supplies.

  The leftmost crates had weapons of every conceivable kind, with the sole exception of firearms, but if it killed things, and it was powered by muscle, it was on the list.

  He even spotted an African throwing axe and an Atlatl complete with a dozen darts halfway between the size of a javelin and an arrow. Needless to say, there were plenty of spears, swords, bows, crossbows, axes and knives.

  /Is this thing bigger on the inside?/ Jeb wondered, putting his hand into the box and reachign toward the wall of the crate. His hand came into contact with the wall a good foot further out than the side of the crate should've been.

  /Well, that's fuckin' weird an' magical./

  Jeb moved to the next box. It had armor of every description, from police riot gear, to full medieval plate armor, to armored bikinis.

  Upon finding an armored bikini in the box, Jeb raised an eyebrow. Finding this here meant a couple things: Whatever aliens had done this shit to him had been trawling through comics and art to figure out what ‘armor' should look like. It also meant whatever superintelligence had been doing it either wasn't paying attention to human physiology or didn't care that fantasy tit-protectors didn't actually stop arrows.

  Or....

  Given that he was currently in a fantasy world with fantasy rules, there was a slim chance that metal bikinis were actually as protective as full plate.

  /God, I hope so./

  Although, that opened up an entirely different can of worms that begged the question of intent-based physics, or whether everything was an abstract simulation.

  /Let's not overthink it./ Jeb thought, tossing the bikini aside. Better safe than sorry on the armor front.

The exception (to the brevity) is ability choices/attribute description - but here again it's a lot more concise than many other stories like this.

This may be subjective but I really like this story because it makes one thing really clear: it spends its "creativity points" where it matters. Relatively little effort is given to the elements that are only there because they're genre conventions or necessary for the plot - for example, if you finish reading the chapter you'll find literal fairies who give exposition. Things like character names - this is the first sentence of a later chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Tom, Dick and Harry sat around their meager campfire staring at the flames.
#+end_quote

Despite the names and relatively little time spent on these characters, the author manages to make them distinct in ways that matter.

Even though the setting is "generic," the specific details are inventive and the ideas the protagonist uses are genuinely original. And since most of the framework of the story is fairly familiar, the author also manages to make it more coherent than usual (possibly not internally consistent or rational, but the explanations are better than technobabble and are actionable information that the reader can use to predict or theorise about how the characters could solve problems.)

--------------

A few smaller points.

#+begin_quote
  given that I want the protagonist to behave somewhat like a real person, they're almost certainly going to freak out and think they're hallucinating.
#+end_quote

- depends on who they are. Thinking you're hallucinating is about right, but unless there is something about the situation or physiology that causes them to freak out it's entirely reasonable to have a calm reaction. It's like any unexpected emergency situation, some people panic and lose all ability to act rationally while others can even get more calm and focused than usual.

- A problem with real world settings for this kind of thing where the power is the only point of change is the potentially excessive (and draining to the reader) level of paranoia it would realistically take to remain free to act. Like, experimenting with your friends is possibly already enough to set events in motion that would lead to you either captured or a refugee. As soon as someone observes you "levelling up" (getting more powerful in some way), they'll immediately conclude that the best time to capture you was yesterday, and the second best is now, and come in and blindside you with overwhelming force that you couldn't have seen coming.

  The typical powerset does give you some tools to at least not get blindsided, but it doesn't end up helping much since any significant change in behaviour is going to get noticed and get the same result. Do you really want to write, or readers want to read, a story where the protagonist uses externally unobservable powers almost exclusively? Not saying you can't get around these issues, but it at least bears thinking about.

Lastly, if you do end up writing this I'm definitely down to read and give my thoughts :) If you can't tell I've thought about a similar type of story, but concluded it was probably too difficult for a first project.
