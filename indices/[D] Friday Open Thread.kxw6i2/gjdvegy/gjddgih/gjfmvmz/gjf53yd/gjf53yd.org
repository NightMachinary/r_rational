Have you considered the /Magical Girl Madoka/ approach?

That is, before the POV gets The Power, they get invited on a ride-along with one or more other acquaintances who already have The Power. During the ride-along, the acquaintances are arguing about whether to recruit the POV or warn them off the dangerous life that comes with The Power, while the POV is trying to figure out The Secrets they aren't being told yet.

In that way, we get to watch experienced people Do The Thing while getting ready for when the POV gets to Do The Thing for themselves.

It's up to you what happens at the end of the ride-along: peaceful recruitment, sudden disaster, hostile press-gang, etc.
