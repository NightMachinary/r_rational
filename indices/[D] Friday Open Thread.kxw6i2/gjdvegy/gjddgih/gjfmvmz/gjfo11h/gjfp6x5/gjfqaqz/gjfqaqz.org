I've been phrasing it impersonally but I actually think I would think I've lost it, due to my own history of mental illness and tendency to believe in things that aren't real. Being extraordinarily delusional is more likely than magic being real, after all. I'd be happy if it was real, but I also think I'm the type of person who would be distressed to discover not only does the world either run on some form of narrative logic or is otherwise a simulation, but I'm apparently a focus of that simulation. That's a lot of pressure. I think I'd settle down eventually and start enjoying it and doing protagonist things, but it's hard to say how long that would take (and how quickly I could use the ability to solve practical problems in my life).

Since I have little experience writing, I'm planning for the protagonist to be at least heavily inspired by myself. I don't want to lean far into that though, certainly not at the cost of making the story unenjoyable.

That being said if I end up feeling like I won't share it and I'm struggling to write anything, maybe I will go all in on the self-insert.
