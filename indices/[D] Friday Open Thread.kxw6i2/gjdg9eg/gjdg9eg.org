I'm not certain what the name of this trope is, I'm pretty sure it's a variation on, "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything][The Main Character(s) Do Everything]] but more in terms of a story's scale and stakes than just jacks-of-all-trades. Maybe even the narrative scale version of power creep.

One good example, and the example that brought this to mind was Worm.

Without getting too spoiler-y the story starts off at a pretty small scale but as the arcs progress the scale of things becomes increasingly global and the stakes continually rise.

That's not to say that the earlier arcs were boring at all. I personally expected and would've been satisfied if Brockton Bay was the theater for characters and their interactions. I wasn't disappointed by what Wildbow chose to do instead, and I can understand why other people would find it stale if more of the universe wasn't explored.

Worm is usually considered rational-adjacent, if not a good example of rational fiction. Yet TMCDE is usually a form of artistic license, the scale escalating is born out of a need to keep audiences engaged rather than because it's a realistic consequence of rational behavior in a rational setting.

What are your thoughts on it?
