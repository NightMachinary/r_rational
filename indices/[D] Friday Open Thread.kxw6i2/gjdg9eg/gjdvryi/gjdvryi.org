I always thought of it as a sort of selection bias. Who's going to end up at the table when we discuss how to save the world? Pick one of them, how did they get there? We end up with a skewed sample because we're not picking a random workaday do-gooder, we're picking specifically the ones that end up going places to tell stories about.

That's still unrealistic in a different way, since the people with enough power to shape these world-altering events are, well, powerful. And power does not actually come from a lifelong history of being the plucky underdog against increasingly harsh opposition. Power mostly comes from using whatever power you have to pursue the accumulation of yet more power. You should expect that a randomly chosen person at the world-saving coalition is primarily motivated by increasing their own personal power, and got there from luck or inheritance followed by ruthless exploitation of their own advantages. That's pretty damn bleak though, so it's only natural that we insert someone we actually like into the conversation, and tell their story instead.
