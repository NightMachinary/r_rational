You should re-read my post, and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2x8tup/bst_if_wizards_are_normal_why_did_someone_create/coxy11q][this one]], because that's not what this is about at all.

And I don't think that settings with God in them should be excluded from [[/r/rational]] anyway. A universe with the Christian god in it is still coherent, and there are still rational decisions to be made in that universe. We just don't live there.
