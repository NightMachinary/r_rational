the way you explain them. thaums are akin to a soul, semisentient puppeteer parasites, and magic interfaces. maybe some ancient think tank(ha!) discovered thaums have a half life, they decay and maybe the process is accelerating with magic use? anyway they panic. after the panic some begin searching for a way to reverse that but others see the futility. hoping to preserve higher forms of life and sentience from the imminent collapse they begin with project "roundworld" as a corralled off section of the planet to test their replacements. neurons are pretty much one of the first avenues of research as normal humans have them to interpret thaum imput. the project takes years and complete generations of researchers and eventually is forgotten as its purpose is lost or simply left to progress on its own until the barrier collapses on near thaum depletion. instead of a full collapse it becomes instead porous earlier than expected letting some muggles wander off reservation and start communities while letting wizards in sometimes. :D
