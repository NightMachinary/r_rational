  Are intelligence thaums scarce or otherwise limited?
#+end_quote

I wasn't planning on that. As-written, the main evolutionary advantage of humans was brains that were able to get a critical mass of thaums in one place, not a way to gather the exact right ones. Note that thaums only weakly interact with matter, and repel one another, so this is still an evolutionary feat.

I think sufficiently scarce thaums would have even bigger impacts on how evolution turned out than the above. Though I guess the most obvious one is just that wizards eat lots of brains for nutrition, which isn't THAT weird.

  Some wizard realized that the population of magical intelligent beings would be limited by the number of intelligence thaums and decided to create a non-magical form of intelligent life to get around this.

This actually fits a lot of the same evidence that would go with what [[/u/RandomDamage]] suggested. And the similarity of the two theories predict is extremely handy for me.

  Conversely, if magic can get you free energy in the physical universe, why haven't fast breeding magical grey goo (or I guess green goo if it evolved from algae) spread to everything and consumed all other forms of life?

In the real world, green goo DID successfully colonize almost the entire surface of the planet and displace almost all other life. And it did this by "breaking" conservation of energy by getting energy from off-planet via photosynthesis.

I don't see small-scale violations of conservation of energy having a very different impact. However, larger-scale violations could be disastrous, which is, again, extremely handy for me.
