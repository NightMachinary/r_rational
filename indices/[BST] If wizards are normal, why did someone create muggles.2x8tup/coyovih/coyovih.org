Hmmm... An old idea I had - probably won't work in your universe, but maybe it'll help you think of something - was a class of spells that destroyed anything that relied on changing to convey information, in a universe where living things had mild AT-field-like strengths. Rocks could break, and paper could burn, but a genetically-engineered subspecies storing information was priceless.

Even without those metaphysics, you could have Muggles be created as a form of information storage that tries to preserve itself.

If you make mind-reading easy against wizards, Muggles might have been meant to be spies who could securely communicate/ act.

You could literally just make the motivation for science - I've seen people suggest that once we know how to make human-intelligent uplifts, we should uplift as often as possible, just because.
