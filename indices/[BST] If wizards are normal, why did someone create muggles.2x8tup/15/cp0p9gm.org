Magic is finite resource that will run out (maybe thaums half-life is finite). Muggles are preparation for that time. Wizards forgot that magic will run out.

May also explain the secrecy of wizards so that muggles should learn to live without magic (but in the meantime wizards forgot the original reason).

If you don't want magic to run out it might have just been a wrong theory of magic, if made supporters make muggles, and then they learnt it's incorrect, but the muggles were already there.
