Ah, my apologies, I skimmed this topic far too quickly.

In the end though, you're talking about the motivations of an individual or group of people, which can be /anything/. As a result, unless your deity is a player in the story (a la greek gods) I simply find the question rather uninteresting. If your deity is a main or auxiliary character, then the motivations come naturally from character development.

My answer of "I don't like your system" probably isn't terribly helpful to you though, so I'll duck out. Sorry!
