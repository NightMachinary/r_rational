Magic usually violates various conservation laws. Let's pretend that it can violate the laws of computation and information, as well (ie: via prophecy). Wizards made Muggles to have people who couldn't FOOM because they had strictly finite substrate and no self-understanding of how they thought.

Of course, that's presuming that you're willing to allow wizards to be so far up in power level it's not even funny.
