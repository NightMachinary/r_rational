Suppose certain types of matter arrangement repel magic. Atoms in the right orientation push it away, granting something resistance to magic.

A wizard discovers this and tries to weaponize the process. They section off a portion of the planet, build a number of simple lifeforms, and cast a mass death spell over the planet. They accelerated time.

This spell isn't 100% effective. It isn't fast. But if an organism has thaums this spell uses that magic to kill them slowly.

Over time the organisms with the most resistance to magic became dominant. Generations of organisms with atomic arrangements that repelled thaums arose.

Every now and then the mage checked in. At times they tweaked an organism, sometimes they modified something.

Billions of years later, their creation was complete. Sentient, extremely magic resistant organisms, some of them intelligent, ready to be used against an enemy.

The original mage had vanished, the time speeding spell long since faded. And slowly the magic that held apart the worlds was breaking apart...
