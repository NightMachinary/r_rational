I am. Magic is the default.

The universe has two classes of matter - thaums and atoms. Atoms behave as they do in our universe. Thaums are invisible, intangible^{*}, golf ball-sized objects with mental properties. There is such a thing as an anger thaum, or a sadness thaum, and while it would take several different types of intelligence thaums to create a mind we'd recognize, it's not a huge number. Thaums gently push each other away, but can get stuck in atomic matter. They apply small amounts of forces to atomic matter, as strategically as they can (one thaum is not smart), to accomplish whatever they're trying to do. This makes animism right-ish.

Real animals evolved with thaums in them. Real brains are organs that are good at containing thaums, and they contain mostly sensor neurons, which pick up the small amounts of force that thaums can produce and send them to motor neurons in the body. This would show up blatantly on an MRI. Real brains also respond to brain damage differently than ours.

So, at some point, someone (more likely a group of someones) sectioned off a large chunk of the planet and removed most of the thaums there. They built all-neuron brains for the replacement animals and people that would live there. They also went to the trouble of folding space so that the sectioned off part of the planet would look like a spheroid.

But it seems like too specific a group of things to do just for "to see if we can."

^{*} But we don't go down the invisible-dragon-in-my-basement rabbit hole; they're easier to detect than atoms turned out to be.
