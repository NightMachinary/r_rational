Oh, less interesting than that, I'm afraid. I was thinking the world is actually a significantly larger spheroid. The planet ends up sphere-like unless we start throwing out a lot more of the laws of physics than I want to.

The problem with the Harry Potter model is that if you get there by folding real locations, it would be clearly detectable by now, and if you get there by creating pocket dimensions, then why are /wizards/ the ones living in the second-class topological spaces? It's certainly possible to do a larger-scale folding that makes the new surface have the right shape to be consistent with physical laws, and leaves the majority of space for wizards, but that's a very specific thing to do. I needed an explanation for why they'd pick that way (and I have one now).

I've been working with some exotic coordinate systems in my day job lately, so the true laws of topology are probably going to be something quite byzantine, because I can, but I haven't picked a structure yet.
