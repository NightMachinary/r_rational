Tell me how magic came to be. Humans have neurons because natural selection; why is there magic? You'll have to explain animals too. It makes more sense to say that Wizards /without/ neurons are deviations rather than the people /with/ neurons, because the people more closely resemble what you would expect from a species descended from higher primates.

Unless you're saying that all animals are deviations from magical animals, in which case I propose that the person who did this was a scientist who wanted to see if he could devise either life or a computational system that didn't run on magic, so he xeroxed some people and gave them prototype brains of different sorts, entirely different from the positronic stuff that Wizards apparently have. Then he died, and his experiments (unfinished) fulfilled their programming to procreate (programming which he added so that the experiment to propagate and refine itself).

We need more details!
