I always thought of it like there was some kind of genetic divergence and muggle-ness was like the wizard equivalent of something like Downs-syndrome, and either it turned out to be a dominant genetic trait, or the muggles were forced to be better at cooperation, organization and industrialization because they lacked magic and eventually outnumbered wizards and forced them into hiding.

Also "muggle" sounds a bit similar to "muddle" or "meddle" to me, so its possible that the condition was created either by breeding with non-humans or maybe some person or group was cursed to be without magic and the loss of powers was genetically transferred to their offspring.
