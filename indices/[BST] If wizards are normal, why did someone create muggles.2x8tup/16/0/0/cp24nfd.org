Okay so by default everyone is a pureblood. This is pretty tought then , your world is socio-politically completly different from the canon one , there's no such thing of blood purity ; or at least not as hard since i guess people like malfoy would still brag about having a "recognized noble family history".

Ok , so , less complicated the explanation is better it is , isn't it? So let me thow some ideas at you. If they were made it means there was a *purpose* and we have to assume this purpose had something to do with magic.

- Blood rituals : Muggles aren't completly devoid of magic since they were made from magic , the idea to invent them came from old ritualistic societies that wanted a "less cruel" (uhu? i know...) alterative and made a species of humans with the same blood but different mid from magicals. [Obviosly they were ignorant and didn't think that a being with a different substrate for intelligence could be conscious , so it was done with good intention] .

Then you can throw in some isolation , the muggle population booms and old magicals aren't able to contain them. [this is the weak side of this theory]

- [less points for more complexity ] Resource Harvesting , Resource X gives out a radiation that interacts with thaums ( magical kriptonite?? ) but is really good for enchanting once refined , humans were made after the first attempt clamorously failed (goblins! yeah! , ignore if you have another history for them) but after some centuries they rebelled using aganist wizzards the same resource they gathered from them. Population got out of control and bla bla.

- Exploration / colonization , they were used to "test" a particular envoirment if it was suited for wizzard settlement , we can assume where a muggle could live a wizzard can so they were used like we used a canary to test for methane in old mines

- War , wizzards and another race with capabilities (or weapons) able to destabilize thaums were in war with each other , wizzardkin then invented a being that was smart and could fight but was unaffected by enemy weapons.

- --?Sex? Muggles were sex slaves for naughty wizzards/witches [doesn't expain the number difference]

These are my ideas , but i've a question for you. How the hell do you explain evolution in your world? I mean if magical creatures are the norm and all else is a offshot from them then you wouldn't have the three of life and muggle scientis woudl understand that something was pretty wrong. I doubt wizzards went /all the way/ to make fossile records and shit . If only muggles were the exception then it would make sense : wizzards just used monkeys as a template for a neural-working-human being. this line of thinking arises many questions , i wont write more since i don't want to waste your time, but if you could explain a bit it would be apreciated.

Anyway GL with your FF , it intereste me a LOT so gimme gimme the link :) put it here for us when you start! Don't forget us! Even if you will hate me for my useless ideas :( :P good luck again
