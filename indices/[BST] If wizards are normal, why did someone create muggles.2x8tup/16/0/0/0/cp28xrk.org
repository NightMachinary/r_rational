To clarify, I'm not writing a Harry Potter fanfic. We're just doing the "modern muggle enters magical world" trope, which has been done before HP as well, but less popularly. I don't need HP's tropes on blood purity or anything.

Evolutionarily - I'm still checking some details with an evolutionary biologist, but I can guarantee that there's no fossil evidence that anything strange happened ;-).
