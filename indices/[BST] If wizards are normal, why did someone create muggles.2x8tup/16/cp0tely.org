Hmm i think the answer to your question needs the answer to another question to be correctly assessed i think. What is your explanation for squibs and muggleborns?

Do they exist? If yes are squibs a different category altogether? If they are not how do you get people that work with thaums produce people that work with neurons and vice-versa? Could be that the two things co-evolved and in the early stages of the fetus you get a person with thaums or a person with neurons only and only if you have a particular genetical "switch" open/closed? Open = Wizzard [doesn't need neurons / genetic code ignored /] Closed = Muggle/squib.

To explain why squibs can see magic you can explain it by purely envoirmental factors (a squib is the same of a muggle but by being in a witch's womb his/her perception is altered)

The trick here is to explain *why* wizzards are not so common .

Possible explanations : Average child per couple is low , really low (< 2) [and it seems supported by canon , there are not many weasly-like families] .

The reason can be easily because magic creates a good QOL like in first world countries where birthrates lower the more life is confortable. This also explains why purebloods are the minority , since purebloods don't have on average more than 2 childs per couple they steadly lower in numbers upon reaching a stable number when the afflux of old generation-muggleborn becomes pure-blood (it's 3 generations if i'm not wrong? So 8 MB gran-granparents = 1 PB son )

Ok i went a bit out of topic. The real question is What causes squibs and muggleborn? The answer to that question will give you the reason why muggle exist , or at least some way to "bridge" the problem.
