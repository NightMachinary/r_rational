Edited, now that you've explained a bit more about your setting.

What are the drawbacks of magic? The purpose of muggles could be to have beings with an incentive to find the ramifications of the laws of physics and exploit them, resulting in technology that gets around magic's limitations. Wizards then wouldn't be reliant on casting spells for everything. Naturally, wizards would keep the existence of magic a secret; after all, how could muggles figure out the laws of physics if they were regularly being violated? Over time, the wizards could possibly have forgotten their project's original purpose, along with the reason for their tradition of secrecy.
