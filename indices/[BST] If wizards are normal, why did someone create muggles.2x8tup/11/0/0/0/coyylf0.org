The problem is that, as specified, those wizard brains don't really need more neurons than fish brains. Even if the decrease in thaums in their environment was gradual enough to let evolution save them, there wouldn't be any reason to expect humans to wind up with human intelligence, when they have basically the same number of neurons as every other animal.

I could use authorial power to declare that, yes, there were usable-enough neurons sitting there and it didn't take that many mutations. But that's pretty improbable - if I asked you what you thought an organ would be like if its role was to pick up signals from a thinking mechanism and relay them to the body, and I stopped the question there, you would never predict that this organ is structured that similarly to a brain.
