  There isn't an evolutionary path that would lead from human-like intelligence based on trapping exotic matter to human-like intelligence based on masses of neurons.

Why not? You said below:

"Real brains are organs that are good at containing thaums, and they contain mostly sensor neurons, which pick up the small amounts of force that thaums can produce and send them to motor neurons in the body."

I'm assuming that by 'real' brains, you're referring to the brains of your wizards -- right? If so, your wizards have brains that are made out of meat, contain recognizable neurons, and transmit signals through the body. Even though those neurons are 'designed' / optimized for catching thaums, you've got the basic substrate to evolve a regular non-thaumic brain.
