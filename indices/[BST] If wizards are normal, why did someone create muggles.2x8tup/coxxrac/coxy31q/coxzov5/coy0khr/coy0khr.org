Yeah, I went through all the effort making a setting where mental magics make coherent sense, it would be a shame not to use lots of it.

For any given mentally-affecting spell, the muggle-affecting version is a completely different incantation and substantially harder to cast, if it even exists. It does seem like an obliviate equivalent would have to exist, though, just out of practical consideration.
