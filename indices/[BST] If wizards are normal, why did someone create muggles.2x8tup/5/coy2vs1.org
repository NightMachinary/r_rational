The meat-brains are the result of a catastrophic invasion by the necromancer Carl. Meat, unlike Thaumic Intelligence, can be directly reanimated with almost no loss of effectiveness!

Essentially, neuron-based humans are the remains of a global necromantic invasion. The invasion failed, but they breed so damn fast that the meatids are now the dominant life form.

I would expect an enormously extended conflict, followed by eventual tolerance, but with significant remaining species prejudice. I would want to run a game during that global conflict; wizards fighting a desperate battle against the enormous militarized meatid race. But if your plans call for peaceful coexistence, you could just place the setting a few thousand years later, and let the events fade into mythology.
