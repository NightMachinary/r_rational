What are the calorie requirements of magic? If being non-magical is more metabolically efficient, then it would make sense for muggles (or nonmagical variants) to evolve under the right circumstance.

Conversely, if magic can get you free energy in the physical universe, why haven't fast breeding magical grey goo (or I guess green goo if it evolved from algae) spread to everything and consumed all other forms of life?

Are intelligence thaums scarce or otherwise limited? The limit on certain kinds of thaums could have acted as a hard cap on various species' population's ability to grow larger. Thus, the non-thaumic or scarce thaumic variants would have a strong evolutionary advantage for a species that was reaching the limit on rare thaums types. This would also provide intermediate advantages as rare thaums became scarcer.

Edit: Reread main post and realized you are prioritizing explanations with the creation being intentional. The scarcity of higher intelligence thaums might still apply. Some wizard realized that the population of magical intelligent beings would be limited by the number of intelligence thaums and decided to create a non-magical form of intelligent life to get around this.
