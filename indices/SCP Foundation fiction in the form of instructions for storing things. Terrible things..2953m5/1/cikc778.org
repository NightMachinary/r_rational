I find it very entertaining. But more than that, it's a good resource. I'm an aspiring Fantasy writer, and the ways in which organizations and countries deal with supernatural threats is something I give a deal of thought. So I read about SCPs of different kinds and potentials and power levels, and think about they could be munchkin'd/contained/experimented upon, and every now and then I get a useful thought about my Fantasy world.
