I submitted this because of the juxtaposition (and this is where much of the humour stems from, too) of normal human beings using military technology to try to contain objects and creatures of the sort found in horror, science fiction or fantasy. They use their resources intelligently and, being on a budget, provide each item as much as is required to contain it safely, no more. (Sometimes the only thing that can contain an SCP object is /another SCP object/ - so that's what they use.)

That sort of feel - slightly Charles Stross's Laundry but with much more variety - is what I think fits thematically with rational fic. I also find the dry writing style tremendously funny.
