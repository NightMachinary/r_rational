I like the world building and the characters so far.

I had some trouble with the battle scene in Chapter 2; I wasn't able to get a good picture of the layout of the camp, how it was being attacked, how it was being defended, Learn and Celeste's part in the defense, and above all the overall progress in defeating the bandits.

I look forward to reading more of this!
