Huh.... What is this? A politically correct Orc?

He got rather upset at the Dwarf saying "your people" and made a big deal out of it, but the Dwarf was clearly saying he had no experience with orcs, which are /in fact/ Learn's people. He may be timid as far as Orcs are concerned, but for everyone else, he would still appear to have a hair trigger.

Anyway, the combat was well described, at least on the tactical level, but what I really like are that the races seem to be very different in theme and outlook. Normally Orcs are portrayed as grey or green skinned humans with a bit more muscles and some bad hygiene, not hyper-focused warriors who can wield armored foes as improvised weapons (well, except maybe Nobs and such in 40K). The complete absence of fighters amongst these craft-focused Dwarves is an interesting take as well, even moreso that their crafts aren't just metal and stoneworking. Honestly, I rather like this breath of fresh air into what would otherwise be stale fantasy tropes.
