Calculating lens shapes is doable if you know snell's law and have a good way of solving differential equations numerically. But even if you know the perfect shape, you'll often notice that spherical lenses are much easier to produce. Iirc the biggest telescopes don't even use lenses, they use parabolic mirrors to get an image. Something worth considering, I suppose?

Magic crystals are not birefringent, are they?
