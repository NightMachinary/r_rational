This is more of an afterthought, but why do you need the lense in a certain shape if you can just change the refractive index locally instead? Iirc lenses are more about every possible path taking up the same amount of time than being a certain shape. See e.g. figure 36 on page 58 of Feynman's [[https://de.scribd.com/document/358478820/QED-the-Strange-Theory-of-Light-and-Matter-PDF][QED]].

You might also consider so-called zone plate lenses for some applications.

I think you can calculate the shape of a focusing mirror analytically because the relationship between the incoming ray and the outgoing ray is much easier to handle.
