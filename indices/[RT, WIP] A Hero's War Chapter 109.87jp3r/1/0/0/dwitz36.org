At what level of detail would you need to know how coal makes heat? I think you can calculate the energy of carbon and oxygen separately, then calculate the (rest) energy of carbon dioxide (probably in a rather complicated fashion, I can't derive it as of yet) The difference is released as heat. Or do you want to understand the process in more depth? Or do you lack a chemical understanding of how combustion works?
