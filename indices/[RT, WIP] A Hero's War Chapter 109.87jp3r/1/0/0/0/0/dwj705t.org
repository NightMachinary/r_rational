Quick rundown: A chemical reaction between two substances can occur if there is enough energy for it. Imagine walking up a hill. Your current height represents the energy level of the system. Essentially like this: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Activation_energy.svg]]

Before the reaction occurs, you just have some coal (made of carbon atoms) and some oxygen (technically you have air, which contains oxygen, but let's pretend there's only oxygen even if that makes the burning go much faster than it normally would), preferably mixed or touching each other. What you then do is you add some energy called the "activation energy" for the reaction. It's energy needed to have the reaction occur. Imagine it as the effort you need when trying to push a gigantic round boulder up a mountain. If you exhaust your stamina before you reach the top, the boulder just rolls back down again. So you need enough "activation stamina" in a sense, though it's not actually stamina.

But once you're past the top, the boulder keeps going and stops on the other side of the hill. Chemical reactions are kind of like that.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy]]

In all chemical reactions, you need some energy to have it occur. Now, for some chemical reactions, you don't need a lot of energy. Sometimes even the heat energy you have available at room temperature is enough. Sometimes, you only need a lot of energy to activate the reaction, and you get most of it back afterwards.

Now there's two kinds of chemical reactions: Exothermic (they release energy in total) and endothermic (they require energy in total). Generally, in Chemistry all reactions are theoretically reversible, it's mostly just really unlikely to reverse some reactions. Like trying to unburn a piece of wood. It's essentially a matter of entropy. The piece of wood is a special configuration of atoms. It's not random in the way a randomly placed collection of atoms would be, so trying to add heat to a bunch of carbon dioxide and water wont suddenly give you back oxygen and wood. You might also ask: If reactions, at least simple ones, are reversible, how does matter know which state to remain in? It doesn't, and that is actually something you can exploit. So for example, if you heat up a mix of substance A and B that can react to form C, so that 1 A+1B-> 1C which means that 1 particle of A and 1 particle of B react to form 1 "C" particle. Then you will also sometimes see 1 "C" particle go back and split into "A" and "B". But if you keep removing C's as soon as they form, then you can effectively turn all of A and B into C particles, as long as you have enough B particles for every A particle. So in the case of combustion, the carbon inside the coal reacts with oxygen in the air to form a gas called carbondioxide. That gas has a fairly low concentration in the atmosphere and it'll keep getting removed from the burning piece of coal because it'll spread out into the atmosphere.

Khanacademy has an article about exothermic and endothermic reactions, maybe it'll help you. [[https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/chemical-processes/thermochemistry/a/endothermic-vs-exothermic-reactions]]

Btw, if 1A+1B->1C is exothermic, then you automatically know that 1C->1A+1B is an endothermic reaction.

So that's the chemical side of things. Now if you want to actually describe what happens in these reactions mathematically, and if you want to predict whether a reaction will happen, you technically need quantum physics. Why only technically? Well, chemists are smart people, and they knew they wouldn't be able to work if they took 10 years to calculate if a piece of wood would actually burn or not. So what did they do? They tested it a whole bunch of times, and came up with some simplified models that are somewhat true, and predict results correctly in like 95 % of cases. They're not completely true because they found some reactions that shouldn't work according to them, but that's the price you pay for only learning highschool chemistry. At uni you also learn quantum physics in the later semesters iirc.
