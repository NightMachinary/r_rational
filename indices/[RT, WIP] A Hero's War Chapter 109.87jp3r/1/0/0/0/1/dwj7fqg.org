If you just need an image in your head, imagine coal heating up (vibrating faster and faster) and when an oxygen particle smashes into the coal, some of the coal sticks to the oxygen if you hit the coal in just the right moment. If the coal is not hot enough, the oxygen and the coal can't stick together. Like trying stick a knife into a piece of play-dough. If you only press very lightly, it wont stick, but if you press hard it'll sink in a bit and stay stuck.
