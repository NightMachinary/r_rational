I cannot rightly claim credit for the idea of using cooling spells instead of heating spells for heat engines.

That comes from here: [[http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=124435&sid=04785fde612c68d5d110ff5fd85dbbe4]]

Where I asked a question about heat engine design assuming magic in this story as the fuel. Though I was thinking more of the airplane version (which wouldn't have coal, instead running on pure magic since coal has weight and compressed magic does not).

Credit to gmalivuk, Zamfir and Tub for provoking the original idea that a "cold" engine was more efficient than a "hot" engine.
