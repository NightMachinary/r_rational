Lol, yeah. Such a sword could be more useful as a thermodynamics-violating material than as a magic sword itself, as you said. Also violates conservation of energy with that heat-destroying gimmick. Kind of difficult to write about all the possibilities, since you can't exactly demonstrate or test in real life.

Which is why I like stories like these so much. Possibile avenues of research that wouldn't be plausible in the real world becomes "common sense" in a fantasy one, with all the consequences that entails. I like it, please keep it up!
