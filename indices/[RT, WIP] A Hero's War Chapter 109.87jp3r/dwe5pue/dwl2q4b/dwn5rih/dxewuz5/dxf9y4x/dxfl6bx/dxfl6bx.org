Yeah, zombie crystal, if/when they figure out how to make it, can be used as lens material. That is still currently beyond them however.

Yes, there are many different types of magical materials that appear as a crystal. So far, I think I've introduced

Magic crystal - Generated by compressed magic, doesn't seem to do anything; used as power source; high density variant formed in high magic energy and high magic density conditions

Crystal - Behaves like magic disruption when exposed to spells; suspected to be part of the material used to make crysteel; crysteel drains magical energy from spells that contact it

Flare - A red grainy material that is nevertheless crystalline. Sheds heat over time and slowly evapourates back into magic; one of three forms of Fire magical material series (gas/liquid/solid); most efficient heat per magical energy source but also slowest release

Zombie crystal - light manipulation properties? Armour? Stores magic for zombies?

I have not given information beyond what the current knowledge in the story is at. (in particular the fire material series thing is wrong)
