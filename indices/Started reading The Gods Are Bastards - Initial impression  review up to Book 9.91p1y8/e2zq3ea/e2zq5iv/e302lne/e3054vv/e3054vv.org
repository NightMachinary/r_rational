I agree with you here; the plot advancement slows to almost a halt in some books because of the constant switching from group to group. I think this is something the author acknowledged as being a problem, because book 14 has so far focused almost entirely on just the paladins. The plot, in return, seems to be moving ahead at quite a brisk pace. It's pretty refreshing!
