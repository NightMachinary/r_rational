  I can suspend disbelief to an extent (for example, with SW or LOTR), but do you honestly believe people a century + from now will have a collection of Cowboy Bebop that they love enough to upload it as a cultural archive?

I'm not into bebop personally, but I know it's literally one of the most loved anime in recent history... I wouldn't be shocked if it survives longer than it feels like it should

I agree with the rest though, pros /and/ cons.
