The first few volumes are /much/ weaker in my opinion, the author tried to pull off more than he could handle and kind of dropped the ball, Prin's plot, the continuous sexual innuendo, and the fact that he tries to jam like 17 characters down our throats in 10 chapters. After those it just keeps getting better, finally finally catching stride in Sarasio and stays at a pretty good peak from there.
