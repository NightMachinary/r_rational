It's less of an issue in binge reading than it is week-to-week, where rapid switches through four sets of characters mean you only get to see progress on a storyline once a month.

Once you catch up, I'd advise setting aside the story for long periods and reading a batch of chapters all at once. I think TGAB is a story that suffers from from being published in web-serial format. It would be better as a series of books.
