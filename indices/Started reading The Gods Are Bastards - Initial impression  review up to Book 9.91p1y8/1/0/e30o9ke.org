I've been reading the bonus chapters. The Along Came A Spider sections were actually what prompted my comment about Arachne.

  no matter how powerful an individual may be they can't win indefinitely by themselves or on strength alone.

Arachne seems to get by on brute force fairly well so far haha but that is one of her explicit flaws. I loved Mary's criticism of her handling of the Aspen problem:

#+begin_quote
  “This is so you,” Mary mused, pacing in a circle around the frozen form of Aspen. “One cannot contest that it does the job. And all it cost was a staggering expense of power and the complete reordering of a small patch of reality.”
#+end_quote

I don't necessarily see my criticism as things happening "for the plot", just that the twists can be a bit /too/ unpredictable. For example, if it were revealed that Arachne was an alien wearing an elf mask who had been arranging events the whole time, then it were revealed that Avei actually created the aliens to fuck with Elilial, it'd be surprising, but poorly set up and ineffectively foreshadowed.

Regarding plot armor, I had noticed that unlike Wildbow's writing or PGTE, the protagonists tend to always win their main conflicts, and though they do suffer setbacks, they generally overcome them quickly, or turn them into victories.

Regarding the huge cast, yes I agree it can be annoying to start reading about brand new people when you want to find out about the people you know, but once they're integrated into the story, I'm glad to read about them. The cool thing about having a big cast of characters doing different stuff in different locations is that later on, it can be tons of fun when they meet, like seeing a cross-over episode.
