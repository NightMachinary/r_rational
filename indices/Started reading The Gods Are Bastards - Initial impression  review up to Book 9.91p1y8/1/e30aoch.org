Despite this series being somewhat contentious on this sub, I personally think it's a great read and I'm glad you're liking it too! Just some comments (hopefully avoiding any major spoilers) on a few parts of your review:

#+begin_quote
  I'm very interested in hearing more about Elilial's fall from grace and the events surrounding her getting kicked out of the Pantheon.
#+end_quote

Heh, you and everyone else! I think book 14 is finally getting close to explaining it, but unfortunately this overarching mystery is one that's still unsolved currently. Best guesses I've seen so far is that the gods somehow are hamstringing the mortal races for their own benefit, or that the coming "Great Doom" is going to involve a LOT of mass sacrifice/death and the Pantheon gods are OK with that.

#+begin_quote
  I also like the new freshman class a lot
#+end_quote

The new class is another divisive topic, and this is one where I side against the series. Yes, they're interesting characters in their own right... but it was incredibly frustrating to see the "main plot" get sidelined for so long. IMO they'd have been better as bonus chapters or a spin-off series.

#+begin_quote
  and I enjoy the religious politics in Tiraas almost as much as the adventures of the university students.
#+end_quote

Totally agree with you here. DD Webb has built a fantastic world and does a good job at showing how it's all interconnected. The sectarian conflict is one of my favorite parts.

#+begin_quote
  measurable character growth
#+end_quote

Yep, this is a running theme throughout the series. I think it's good that you've picked up on it, because the first few volumes felt like most of the characters had very similar voices (if that makes sense) and there was a lot more of stating what someone is than showing how. "Trissiny is a brilliant battlefield tactician" is just taken for granted early on, but later on we actually see her start to execute strategies that show what she's learned.

#+begin_quote
  Arachne and her past
#+end_quote

Speaking of things we're interested in learning more about... we do learn more about Arachne, but still haven't learned /specifically/ what her deal is/where she comes from. The stories about her past are awesome though. If you haven't read the bonus chapters yet, I recommend doing so (I think they can be read in any order, as they're flashbacks for the most part). Along Came A Spider and Scion are Arachne-focused.

#+begin_quote
  I'm a little bit concerned there may be too many "power-ups" or advantages given to the protagonists... it runs the risk of getting into Mary Sue territory.
#+end_quote

This is definitely a concern. I think what keeps the characters from becoming Mary Sues is that their flaws and weaknesses are also constantly brought up, and that even with their power boosts they still have plenty of opponents whom they cannot overpower: headhunters, Naiya's daughters, the gods themselves, and of course... bureaucracy and politicking. A running theme for the series is that no matter how powerful an individual may be they can't win indefinitely by themselves or on strength alone.

#+begin_quote
  Another danger zone is that some of the plot twists are just a little too unpredictable and run the risk of feeling contrived
#+end_quote

Yep. That's probably one of the main reasons this sub has split views on TGAB, because things happening "for the plot" is really frowned upon. I find the justification for this (which is basically that the gods are tweaking the odds behind the scenes) is less satisfying than other series like APGTE (where narrative effects is entirely woven into the plot) or WTC (where the world is built on tabletop game mechanics, revolves around "the player," and is overseen by a GM).

#+begin_quote
  I sometimes find the front-loaded scenery descriptions to be a slog to read through, especially when I'm impatient to read the resolution of the latest cliff-hanger and the description is of some geography a hundred years in the past.
#+end_quote

Eh, I like the robust descriptions because I think the world building is great and helps each place feel unique. That's key when there are dozens of places to visit. I couldn't tell you much about the cities in APGTE, or even name more than a couple; but I can tell you the difference between Tiraas, Tar'naris, Sarasio, Last Rock, Viridill, Puna Dara, and Veilgrad thanks to their descriptions. But the impatience for the plot to move on is something that I completely agree with you about.

My own criticism of the series would probably be:

- The characters' plot armor makes it difficult to feel like the stakes are actually high. Even when they lose, they don't lose catastrophically. I think only a handful of characters have died throughout the series, none of them higher than B or C listers.
- The story seems to swing between character development and plot development. The plot was established early on, but then character development reigns supreme with only occasional plot hints here and there until the more recent books. It's good to get to know the characters, but it makes progression overall a slooooow affair.
- The last two points combine to an additional problem: the cast of characters is HUGE, and just keeps growing. Even with all the time spent on fleshing them out it gets hard to keep them all straight, especially when you catch up and a character might only show up again several books (and thus months) later.
- The references to modern Earth entertained me at first, but eventually just made me cringe. The narrative justification for them is also REALLY weak. I can't imagine we're anywhere near close to terraforming a planet or obtaining immortality, but even if we were a hundred+ years down the road, there's absolutely no chance that those people would be into World of Warcraft or Cowboy Bebop, and almost a negligible chance that they're into Star Wars or Lord of the Rings (all of these get direct references in the series). Self-inserts can be handled well, but these were not.

Most of the other criticisms I had originally were smoothed out or addressed as the series progressed. Unfortunately I feel like some new readers will get turned off by the early books before they can get into it. It's a shame, because it's a series I keep up with as new updated come out. Glad you like it too, OP!
