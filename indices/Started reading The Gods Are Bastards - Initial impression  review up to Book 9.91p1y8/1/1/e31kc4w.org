  The references to modern Earth entertained me at first, but eventually just made me cringe. The narrative justification for them is also REALLY weak. I can't imagine we're anywhere near close to terraforming a planet or obtaining immortality, but even if we were a hundred+ years down the road, there's absolutely no chance that those people would be into World of Warcraft or Cowboy Bebop, and almost a negligible chance that they're into Star Wars or Lord of the Rings (all of these get direct references in the series). Self-inserts can be handled well, but these were not.

As a counterpoint: lots of people still study and enjoy stories, myths, and plays from ancient Greece, most of which are over 2000 years old.

I don't think the elder gods being into rl-modern pop-culture stuff is all that unbelievable.
