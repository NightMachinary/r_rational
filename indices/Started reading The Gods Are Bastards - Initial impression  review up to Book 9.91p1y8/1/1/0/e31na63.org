I can suspend disbelief to an extent (for example, with SW or LOTR), but do you honestly believe people a century + from now will have a collection of Cowboy Bebop that they love enough to upload it as a cultural archive?

Some modern references are done well. The Drizzt reference in an early book is great. Light sabers (and their moral questions) are really great too. I giggled at references to Azeroth... But that was the point where the wheels fell off. The anime references, especially with the Sifan references that are blatantly Japanese, just made me roll my eyes. I like anime and nerd pop culture references, but to use another pop culture phrase, the last few jumped the shark.
