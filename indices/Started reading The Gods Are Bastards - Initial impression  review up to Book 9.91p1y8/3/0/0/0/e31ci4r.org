So far (halfway through Book 9), there haven't been any immersion breaking inconsistencies or plot holes. To the extent that characters refrain from using their full power, there have been well-supported in-story reasons that fully explain that. Nothing like, say, Harry Potter, where the spells from the later books (that the adults presumably knew) could easily solve all the conflicts of the earlier books or other plot holes like that.
