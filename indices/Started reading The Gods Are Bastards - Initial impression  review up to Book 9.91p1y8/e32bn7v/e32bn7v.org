I recently started reading this as well. I'm currently midway through book 3, however I feel like i'm asking myself why am I reading this. The story so far has given me 0 reason to care about these characters and what they do. The only character i am semi interested in is Gabe. I seem to be skipping chapters and seemingly missing nothing of importance...I feel like dropping it at this point.
