Well, not every story is for everyone. If you're asking if the "main story" will start soon, I think the answer is probably no. To the extent that one exists, it's probably the story of the gods' history and Elilial's current play. We do continue to get hints, but by Book 9 (and even current, I understand) those hints are all we have. Lots of interesting development does happen with Gabe and other characters, but the story itself will continue to stay about on that level for a while yet.

Maybe someone else who has read more will have some better insight. I just ask that they tag any spoilers outside the scope of this thread.
