Well, I don't expect most stories to pass the strictest rational purity test. For instance PGtE isn't super rational, but it's still a quite good story with reasonable semi-rationality in the writing.

What I'm referring to is things that break the consistency of the story and the world. For example, characters who have huge power-ups or abilities that they show once... and then never use again, despite how well those powers would solve the problems they face. A lot of fantasy suffers from this in particular, as the writer often feels free to pen in fantastical solutions to challenges without careful thought as to how those solutions change later plot points or the makeup of the world itself.
