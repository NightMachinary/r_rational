I'm not sure exactly what you mean here, but addressing your second point, I don't think there are any inconsistent world or story issues, aside from the areas I mentioned in my criticism, and those I considered more potential for issues rather than actual issues.

If you're asking would TGAB pass [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s strictest purity test? Probably not, but it's a fun story that makes sense when you read it, and so far at least, it's definitely worth the time investment.
