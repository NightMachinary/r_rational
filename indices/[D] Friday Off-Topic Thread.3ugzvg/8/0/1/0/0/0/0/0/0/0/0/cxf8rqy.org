You say no and act like the case is closed, but genetics is definitely not the end all be all in mental illness. You're forgetting social, environmental, physiological, and epigenetic factors. There really is no way to sort out the mess we have now without considering other factors.

If you want another pool of genetically isolated people consider the Japanese and their several unique mental illnesses. Memes unique to Japanese culture play a HUGE factor.
