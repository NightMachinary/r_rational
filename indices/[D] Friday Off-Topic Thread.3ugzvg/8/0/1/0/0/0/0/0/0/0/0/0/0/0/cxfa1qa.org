It is not a "reductionist" mistake, it is incorrect science. Digitally isolating memetic factors /is/ reductionism. Not that we have a good science of memetics.

If you want an experiment to rule out genetics (though things like diet and environment remain, and those are big factors), look at incidence of MI in Japan compared to incidence of the same in Japanese-descended populations.

There is another mechanism that involves memetics indirectly, more as a form of sociological effect on development, but I'm not sure this is the class of mechanisms you're describing. A population that is convinced that emotionally and physically neglectful environments are a proper way to raise children will certainly have a high incidence of certain mental illnesses. But I'm not sure if that's what you're saying. The meme is not the direct cause, it simply causes increased incidence of neglectful childrearing.
