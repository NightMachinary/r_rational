I'm not /saying/ memetics plays no part in mental illness [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine][(there are already-recognized psychosomatic factors)]], I'm saying that there are already explanations that generalize to the examples you gave to /justify/ saying that memetics transfers mental illness. You have to point to /cases that can not be explained with genetics./ Saying that Japan has different illnesses because they have a different culture is meaningless, you have to /isolate/ the phenomenon you are positing. Otherwise you are not providing evidence.
