I think drugs can accelerate the process or bring the illness to the surface. If you or anyone you know is suffering from what they suspect is shaman's sickness they could speak to me for moral support or just to talk. I'm not a doctor. So my first advice would be to contact a mental health professional.

I saw a documentary called enemy above which tells the story of a man who was forced to take drugs by his village in order to become a shaman and how he later turned to Christianity. I forget the name of his tribe, but he claimed it was not an uncommon practice.
