  If you or anyone you know is suffering from what they suspect is shaman's sickness they could speak to me for moral support or just to talk. I'm not a doctor. So my first advice would be to contact a mental health professional.

Yes, /do/ contact a psychiatrist, especially so you can be prescribed antipsychotics and eventually recover, because someone somewhere probably loves you enough to be incredibly grieved if you keep taking mushrooms and permanently destroy who you once were.
