"Robot, write new philosophy."

What? I like the Turing Test/no-zombies theorem.

"Read /Worm/, report Wildbow's position."

A good all-purpose test of moderate superintelligence - /I/ can't figure out an author's location based on that data.

"What're 'people'? Newborns? Robots? Roaches?"

The most pressing philosophical problem of our time.

(I can't think how to check if it's /Friendly/, but there are very few situations where I can talk to an AI and it's not already out of the box.)
