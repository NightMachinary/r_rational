The majority of views are falsehoods. I'm doubtful all people could be randomly convinced of any subject. Lots of people require adherence to some rigid criteria which is tricky to fake- if you believe on things supported with scientific studies are true then unless the AI can hack scientific studies to make them look true it can't prove a lot of things. Likewise if you only believe things your partner, a holy book, or your mother says skilled arguments don't have a potent effect.
