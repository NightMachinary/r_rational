So, I'm curious if there's a name for something I've been noticing recently.

Most people are able to use basic logic to figure things out, but only if it supports their own opinion. They can't use the exact same logic to figure out why their "opponents" think they way they do.

Example: Someone pointed out that some comedic actors, like Jim Carrey, have given questionable performances in serious roles as support for why they shouldn't play serious roles. I pointed out that the same actors have given questionable performances in comedic roles, too, to posit the question of whether they should play comedic roles (to point out that it's hypocritical to use the logic he was for one but not the other). Even after I pointed it out, he still didn't understand that logic should be applied in parallel like that.

This definitely has a certain aspect of confirmation bias, but it's not just that. Is there a more formal definition for this bias? I've been using "parallel logic" or "parallel reasoning" when talking about it with friends recently, but neither seems to fit perfectly.
