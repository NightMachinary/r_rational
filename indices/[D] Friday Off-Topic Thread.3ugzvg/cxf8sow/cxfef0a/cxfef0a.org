  Are you in a romantic relationship? How's it going? Do you make an effort to be a rationalist even in your love life? What does being a romantic rationalist even entail?
#+end_quote

Yes, surprisingly well these days, no, and I've never tried it because I've never thought of what it /would/ entail.

  I've recently been dating someone and things are starting to get pretty serious. I wouldn't be surprised if we start pursuing something more long-term in the near future. This is honestly rather new to me. I've been in relationships before, but never anything so...real?...(I'm not exactly sure how to put that)

Congratulations! Honestly, you may as well take it seriously. Pop culture seems to put a lot of undue weight on casual relationships, even though the serious impact on personal happiness, feelings of existential security, etc is made by long-term, serious relationships. There are few-enough people you can ever treat as family - as close enough to be relied-upon - that if you've found a case where sex and love coincide well enough to be real romance, you should do yourself a favor and take it.
