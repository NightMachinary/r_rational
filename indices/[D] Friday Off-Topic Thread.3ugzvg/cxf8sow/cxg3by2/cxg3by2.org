I think rationality applies to a lot of topics in life just by recommending you find science-based recommendations.

I read [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3nn/scientific_selfhelp_the_state_of_our_knowledge/][an article on LessWrong]] recommending academic and empirical sources for psychology and self-improvement; I own the book it recommends most, 'Psychology Applied to Modern Life' (preview [[http://www.coursesmart.com/9781111186630/Ch02][here]]). It has three chapters that seem most relevent: one on Friendship and Love, one on Marriage and Intimate Relationships, and one on Interpersonal Communication, and the 2011 edition is [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1111186634/][on Amazon]] for a little over $7 used. I haven't applied any romantic advice (never had a romantic relationship), but it seems to be of similar quality to the advice on friendships and communication, which I've benefitted from.

Muehlhauser also posted "Rational Romantic Relationships", which is more about relationship initiation, and looks to be lower quality. I haven't followed it's advice, either, but it's similar on a similar theme to your request, RE romance and rationality.
