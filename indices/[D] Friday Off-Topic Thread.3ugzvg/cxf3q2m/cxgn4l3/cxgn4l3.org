As a practical matter it's obvious that lots of people are offended by the truth and have a moral issue with it. Many see the truth as a weapon you can wield against others. As such, I do think it would be immoral to push people to tell the truth always, while we still have people that might attack you if you say the wrong thing. It serves as a valuable social lubricant too. People far more easily accept an excuse like "I was stuck in traffic" than "I slept in." at work. The first step to making truth publicly accceptable would be making sure people didn't respond much more negatively to truth.

On Santa Claus, as a general matter likewise I see it as a negative. I don't want a child of mine to go up in front of class and tell everyone they know Santa is real because their father wouldn't lie to them. That could cause a lot of issues later on. The extremely negative reactions others have to telling children about santa are an issue with generally being truthful.

To summarise, I view lying as a much smaller issue than emotional or physical harm, and whilst people willfully offer emotional or physical harm for the wrong truths a general ban on deception isn't a good idea. In my personal life I try to surround myself with people who don't lash out at truth so that lying isn't necessary.

Medical truths are a much bigger issue. If someone believes magical crystals will heal their cancer and so refuses medical treatment. Simply promoting such a truth is actively harmful. I frequently confront such beliefs, social moores be damned, as it's a matter of life or death.

Of course, the fact that I value life over truth means that deceipt is a weapon I am willing to employ in that battle. If a potent authority of the crystal healing community who they would view as an authority recommends you get cancer treatment from a doctor when you have cancer I am fine citing them.
