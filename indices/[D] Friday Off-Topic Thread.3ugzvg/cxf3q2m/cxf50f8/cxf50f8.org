I've observed that if you graph danger versus knowledge, there's a peak in danger right around the middle of the graph. It's not accurate for everything of course, but it's generally true. Going by your situation (speaking as someone who knows nothing about RWBY), you don't want to tell the public because you can't explain the entire truth, because it's just not possible in a short enough period of time, but if you were able to, then everything would be okay and that wouldn't have to be kept in the dark. The real danger comes from that middle ground where they know that the Grimm are out there but they don't know enough to be able to not be fearful and terrified.

I consider it to be okay to lie to someone if I would be unable to bring them straight through the danger zone into the good zone in a short enough period of time, but when possible I try to be entirely truthful.

I don't have kids, but if I did, I wouldn't teach them about Santa (besides the "Other kids believe in this thing called Santa" part). I would give them the same gifts as if it were Santa, but I wouldn't lie to them about something like that, especially since it would be one more thing indoctrinating them into a culture of believing in things that aren't true, especially when half of the people involved /know/ that Santa isn't real.
