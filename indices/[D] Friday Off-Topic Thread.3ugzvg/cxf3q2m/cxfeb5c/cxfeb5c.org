  I'm basically asking if your world view supports the existence of necessary "pleasant" lies, because you feel people's net happiness would be reduced by the full measure of the truth.

No. People are best served by the full truth, as much as they can take, all the time. The only acceptable form of deception is to lie by omission, and even then, what you actually say should be true in spirit and not just in letter.

"You didn't ask" or "I prefer not to answer" are fine, but that's merely because we don't want a world in which everyone knows everyone else's uncomfortable secrets (eg: what kind of porn you watch, that you stole that one time). /Strongly consequential/ lies should be outed.
