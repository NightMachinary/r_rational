Allow me to make a statistical counter argument. If 99% of people (numbers invented for demonstration purposes) are sane enough not to use biological weapons research aggressively and skilled enough not to release it accidentally, then for each additional person with access and relevant skills the chance of something horrible happening increases. Therefore, the total number of people with access to both should be restricted as to do otherwise is to increase the chances of horrible things being created and released.
