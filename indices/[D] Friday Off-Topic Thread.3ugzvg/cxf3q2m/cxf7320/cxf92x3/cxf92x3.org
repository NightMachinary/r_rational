  However there are clearly cases where knowledge leads to a high degree of harm. For example, I think it would be better if nobody had access to biological weapons research.

This strikes me as a flawed argument. Knowledge's application is based on ethics. The same knowledge that weaponized the atom, has made deep space probes and and cheap base-load power. The knowledge to weaponize diseases is the same that is leading to telomere elongation to mitigate aging and GMO crops to assuage hunger.

We use knowledge for weapons first, because sometimes we are still silly primates, then we shut up and multiply and make the world better with it.
