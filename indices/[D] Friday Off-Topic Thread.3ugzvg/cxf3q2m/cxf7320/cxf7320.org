For me this comes down to a consequentialist argument - truth is very valuable (and history demonstrates it has high instrumental value too). However there are clearly cases where knowledge leads to a high degree of harm. For example, I think it would be better if nobody had access to biological weapons research.

So not full availability, but no lies either - just inform those who ask that this information is restricted, and why (unless that's restricted too).

Jargon does a pretty good job of defending people from available info they're not ready for too.
