What are the prime factors of <multiplication of the RSA public key numbers from a bunch of important public keys>

Each key yields two prime factors, ignore any answer that is not a list of integers of length <= two times the number of keys.

Should be safe even if A.I is unfriendly. Answer can be easily verified to be correct and ignored otherwise.

Gives information on the safety of cryptographic systems. Also if you know what hardware the A.I is running on you might be able to get answers for computational complexity questions like P=NP and the viability of quantum computing.

Also gives you a toolbox of valuable private keys, to immediately destroy if you want, or do other things you think would be good.

Not the best information, but the best question I can think of that should be safe.
