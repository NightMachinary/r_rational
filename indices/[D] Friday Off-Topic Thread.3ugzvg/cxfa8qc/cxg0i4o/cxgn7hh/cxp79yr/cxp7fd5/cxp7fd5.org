So the AI can convince you to sway on one side of the other of certain contentious issues, but the methodology issues are well known and many can adapt. If an AI tried to convince me about something sciency I'd probably start by google scholaring the subject. They can't sway online evidence in their favor unless they have an internet connection.

If they have an internet connection things are already pretty bad.
