Scientific studies are easier to hack than you'd think. Mainly because there are often lots of studies on a subject with varying methodologies, and even when that's consistent, a subset will have false statistical significance just by bad luck. And then you get publication bias, which makes everything much worse.

It's really common to have a contentious subject where both sides cite scientific studies in their favor.
