First, imagine an A.I. smart enough that it can pick a subject, randomly pick a side, and then convince you that it's true. You should obviously not believe it, because its side has a 50% chance of being wrong, even though you are convinced. Therefore, you should precommit to not believing them. However, humans aren't good at unlearning anything, so you really need to just not listen to it in the first place, so I ask it nothing.
