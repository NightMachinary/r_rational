I have been getting a bunch of recommendations for Marvel's "Jessica Jones". But after watching the trailers on youtube I couldn't shake the feeling that its just some more badly written(good vs evil anyone?) superhero stuff.

Has anyone here watched it? is it any good? is there a reasonable explanation why the big bad didn't just take over the world? or is this series just a poor attempt to make people feel its deep because its supposed to be a metaphor for abused women\abusive relationships?
