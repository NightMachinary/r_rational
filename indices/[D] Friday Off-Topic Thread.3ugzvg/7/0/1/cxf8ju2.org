I suppose "take over the world" was badly put on my side as i see all responses thusfar mentioned that he doesn't want to specifically.

I mostly meant it in the sense of "win", or "put himself in a situation where no one could realistically threaten him". I presume he loses, or at the very least doesn't win, in the end even though such power would imply he shouldn't.

The argument of SHIELD\avengers\weaknesses\limitations etc. seems problematic for me because most of those would just as much be an issue for killing random people. the power described is the most effective when people aren't expecting you obviously, so solidifying his power in the world first and then doing whatever he wants sounds more likely then doing whatever he wants while ignoring said opposition.

Anyhow I guess my main issue so far, seeing as no one said this isn't the case, is that it sounds like the antagonist is just comically evil, and that doesn't sound like an interesting conflict to watch. Not sure I understand your point about the thematic element though, so maybe I am missing something..
