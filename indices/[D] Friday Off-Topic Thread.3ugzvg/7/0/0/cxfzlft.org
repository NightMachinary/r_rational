This is one of the things I liked about /Steelheart/ by Brandon Sanderson. The main character is trying to kill Supervillains ("Epics"), and his main classification system boils down to "can they be killed by a sniper rifle?".

"Immunity to sniper rifles" is a very valuable component to being a supervillain, and anyone that /isn't/ immune to sniper rifles is at a huge disadvantage.
