The big bad didn't want to take over the world. He already has pretty much carte blanche to live where he wants, kill who he wants, etc. All he really wanted was to live in nice places, eat good meals, torture some people, rape pretty women, etc. and he got all of that.

He also exists in a world with S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers, etc. and is vulnerable to sniper rifles. He /also/ has a number of vulnerabilities and limitations to his powers, though there are ways to get around that.

I'd recommend it, partly because I think it hits it major thematic element (power, who has it, how they use it) really well and doesn't waste too much time.
