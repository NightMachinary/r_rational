Uh...

The massive hole that I'm not sure you're aware of is Entropy destroying the entire atmosphere of the Earth. /This setting ends with everyone on Earth freezing and/or suffocating to death./

With Deception, I don't do anything besides research human cloning. I find genetic donors of people whose bodies I want, grow mindless clones of them, then trade minds with the clones. I work on saving the Earth from the consumption of atmosphere by Entropy, assuming that's /even possible./

Entropy, I'm a constant sink on the atmosphere, which is very very bad. I live in orbit, slowly going insane from sensory deprivation, and assassinate warlords. Perhaps I can communicate to a government authority and get a satellite hooked up that I can live around. Then I won't go insane, and my head-destroying powers can be directed to more intelligent ends. But seriously, people with Entropy who live in atmosphere are sucking down an enormous amount of air.

Time, I develop a reflex of rewinding time whenever I'm surprised. That's pretty much it. I rewind time before I'm killed by Entropy eating the atmosphere. I work on saving the Earth from the consumption of the atmosphere by Entropy, assuming that's /even possible./
