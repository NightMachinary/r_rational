I do think the winning move now is for one of the Times to realize that the Entropies are eating the atmosphere, then try to convert all the other Times to this cause. They need to convert a few Deceptions as well. This is random locations on Earth once per day. But with a lot of loops, they can figure out the identities and locations of all the Entropies with the exception of the first few and get to them with a Time and a Deception to switch, Deception to Entropy, Deception to Time, Deception to former Entropy, to switch all of the Times into all of the Entropies. Then they all live in orbit, and they communicate with wiggles to each other forever staving off existential risks.

Deceptions can stay alive ethically through a series of mindless human clones (and if the Times/Deceptions get to the Entropies before they turn they can sample the Entropy's original genetic material). Deceptions can also keep /others/ alive through mindless human clones, which means the former Entropies in the Times' bodies can be put in their original body, or at least survive until later.

Eventually uploading becomes possible. The Deceptions have to stay in human bodies for their power to work, and they can switch with Entropies and another donor to get an Entropy out of the sphere. The problem with Entropies is that they don't go away. You need an intelligent human in them. and that means they get no tickets to the Singularity. By now there are millions of Entropies. I think the best system here would be to build a pool of people accustomed to being an Entropy, so they don't have to spend their time alone, and they each get one week out of some amount of months being printed into a human body and switched by a Deception into an Entropy.
