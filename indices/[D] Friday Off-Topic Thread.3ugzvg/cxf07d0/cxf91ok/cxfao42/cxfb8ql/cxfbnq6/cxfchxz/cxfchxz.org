What exactly would that accomplish? What resulting knowledge is there to use? You have human brains floating in space, with no way of talking except wiggling back and forth. There's no medium of information storage save the Earth's surface. There's no interface for computation. How would simply living with a group of the ten to forty survivors of Earth, who likely don't even speak the same language, who would all eventually separate from each other and get lost in the trillions of years it would take for the universe to end, who would all go insane and utterly stupid from isolation and boredom, actually do anything? It's not a winning move, it's an eternal loss.
