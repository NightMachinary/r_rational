I love how my setting has a literal hole in it caused by a non-literal hole in my imagining of it. And humans are still trying, with a reasonable amount of success, to come up with workable solutions to survive it. Humanity rocks, [[/r/rational]] forever.

Nevertheless, I'm still working on the patched and expanded, non-atmospheric-absorption-centered setting. :P This solution is excellent, though.
