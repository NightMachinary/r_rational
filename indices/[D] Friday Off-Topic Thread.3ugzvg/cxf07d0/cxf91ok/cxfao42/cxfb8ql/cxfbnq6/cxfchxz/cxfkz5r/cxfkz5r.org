I can see a way forward. They can actually communicate, it would just take a while (a few months, maybe) to get used to speaking like that. In addition, entropies have mass! They can use this mass to collect raw materials using their own gravity (kind of how we propose to drag a black hole into orbit using a huge mass to perturb its orbit) and figure out how to make tools from them. Better yet, they could just move to Mars and start grid mining for materials. They could induce charges in metals by collecting plasmized gas from stars or interstellar space and then running those charges along the metal strips to produce some sort of electrical system, and from there figure out a potential way to prevent the cataclysm from occuring.

This isn't hopeless, we just need to figure out exactly what a sentient black hole is actually capable of.
