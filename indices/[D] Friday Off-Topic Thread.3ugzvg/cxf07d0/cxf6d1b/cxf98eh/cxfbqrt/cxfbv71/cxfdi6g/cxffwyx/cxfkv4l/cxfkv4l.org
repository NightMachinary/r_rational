Times can kill entropies before they gain powers, and in fact with a sufficiently paranoid time that becomes 100% likely. The first time should go around killing everyone who gains entropy before they get it, meaning that there are effectively only deceptions and times in this setting, and very short, mostly only day long loops. Deceptions don't matter, as switching with a time doesn't accomplish anything. I do like the idea of having a deception switch a time into an entropy and having the entropy-times go amuse themselves in orbit, presumably developing a language using movements in the reference frame of those you are speaking to for companionship. A band of entropy - times should be able to roam the universe at will, possibly using their mass and gravity to siphon off raw materials from stars to eventually build vessels with which to travel faster. It would be an entirely inhuman way to build tools, but possibly doable. After all, they have literally infinite time. Once the heat death of the universe happens, the times can loop back around and teach the world how to build the starships they made so they can escape their doomed planet.
