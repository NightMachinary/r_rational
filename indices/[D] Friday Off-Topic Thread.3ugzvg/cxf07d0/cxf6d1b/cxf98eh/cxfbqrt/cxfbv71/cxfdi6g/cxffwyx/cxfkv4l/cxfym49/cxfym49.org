  Times can kill entropies before they gain powers

This only shifts the Entropy to someone else. There will always be one more Entropy per day. One of the earliest Times would be able to figure out who turns into Entropy, though, and convince a Deception and the Times that come after them to put the Times in the Entropies and go hang out in orbit.

As for your Entropies-have-mass idea... They don't. And they aren't black holes. Sorry for telling you this twice, but you told me twice too.
