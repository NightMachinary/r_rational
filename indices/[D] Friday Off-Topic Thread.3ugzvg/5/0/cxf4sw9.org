I know some people who really don't have a happy relationship with the truth. To them, inconvenient facts are attacks against their integrity and always being right is central to their worldview. As a result, trying to convince them of anything is a pointless endeavour which only makes them unhappy and aggressive. So I don't. They say something obviously false, I won't correct them, they come to a conclusion that makes no sense, I'll change the subject, they ask what I think about a thing they like such as energy healing, I'll deflect with humour.

I /was/ all facts all the time, but some people just don't care about the truth, so I don't bother burdening them with it. If it has been repeatedly shown that an action achieves nothing or is counter-productive, why bother continuing with it? I can't explain to these people how to have epistemological standards, and I can't convince them of something even so simple as maybe putting a lock onto a garage filled with thousands of pounds of stock when the garage next door was broken into, so why bother trying to convince them that gluten is fine unless you have celiacs?

Following that realisation, I mostly stopped trying to convince people of things that aren't important in real life. They can have whatever random views they like so long as they are not actively detrimental, and few things are actively detrimental to their own life. Maybe if they're making a life-changing decision, or ask for an honest opinion or they want to go into business in a field with an 80% failure rate I'll speak up but for the most part I'll leave em to it. Who cares if such people think that crystals have healing energy, or that burning sage and ringing a bell will cleanse their chakras (real examples)? So long as they're have a handle of the things they actually have to do to get through life they can be as wrong as they like.

I speak truth to people who care about truth. The rest I enjoy other experiences with, they know where to find me if they ever want to actually understand how things work.
