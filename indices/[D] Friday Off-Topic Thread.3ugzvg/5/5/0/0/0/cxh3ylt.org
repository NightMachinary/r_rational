  Who says the deciding influence is the religion, rather than the individual practitioner's personality?
#+end_quote

There are Christians I've met who would probably be just as nice as agnostics or atheists. My post wasn't directed at them. I'm talking about Christians who've directly used their belief in God as the driving force behind enacting change in their life. Those people who talk about how they were doing activity X and practice Y before being convinced (whether by friends, family, a dream, etc.) to follow the Lord and they used their belief in him to actively improve their lives. It is in those situations, where I would say religion is the deciding influence, as opposed to just personality. (And yes, in theory, they could've found any number of things to act as their psychological support, but, for those who believe in him, having some big, always right, always loving eternal deity may be as strong a psychological anchor as they can get)

  What do you mean by "inherently false"?
#+end_quote

I find many of Christianity's core tenets, specifically the ones that deal with factual things, as opposed to the vaguer, more moralistic teachings, to be false. While many of the stories (such as the great flood, the existence of Jesus) probably have roots in actual fact, the way they are presented is inherently false, as far as I can tell. Do I think there was a Jesus historically? Yes. We have proof of that. Do I think he was the actual son of God implanted into a woman via miracle? Who then returned from the dead? No. Was there a great flood? Sure, I can believe there was. Was there a great flood whereby all of the animals in the world at the time were fit onto a boat no larger than a few football fields, along with a man, his wife, and their 3 sons and wives? And all we have now descends from them alone? No sir. We don't have the genetic diversity for that. Same with Adam and Eve. I don't think any two humans, no matter how varied, can have the necessary gene pool to spawn the diverse world we live in now. And the bible's proposed timespan doesn't leave enough time for evolution to run the necessary course either.
