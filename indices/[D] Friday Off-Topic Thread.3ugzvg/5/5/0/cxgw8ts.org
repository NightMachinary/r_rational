I like your view here. You're generally pro-truth, but not so obsessively pro-truth that you are unable to recognize that there are times when the truth isn't ideal, and times where outright deception and/or misinformation can be useful, from a humanitarian standpoint. Cliche as it may seem to say, some people just can't handle the truth.

An example of a deception I think has a positive impact is religion (Oh, what Kishoto? How can you say that?) Of course, not all religions are so, hell, not even all BRANCHES of a particular religion are good. But I've met people who've had positive impacts in their life due to religion. People who, without religion, seem like they would be worse off, and who've used the concocted falsehoods of Christianity (I'm sure it happens in other places, with other religions, but that's by far the most common one where I come from) to legitimately better their lives. There are tons of people who use religion as a supporting pillar for their stable, happy lives. Of course, there's obviously a flipside to this, as your particular branch's teachings may not be ideal for net human happiness, but I feel as if most people who participate in church (not just for show, but who honestly feel enlightened and "saved"), even those who hold idiotic, misguided beliefs about any number of things, live better as a result. Most branches of Christianity teaches that you should love all those around you, it's not your right to judge, be good, be moral, etc. Any atheist could agree that these are good ways to be, for a net gain on humanity's happiness. And I feel like, without religion, there are many people who would be worse people, both in context of themselves and how they treat others.

I believe Christianity is inherently false. I don't think that God exists, or at least, not in the way Christianity portrays him, as this infinite being of kindness, love, etc. I DO believe, though, that there are tons of people out there who, through following Christianity's teachings, are better people for it, because they honestly believe that they need to be.
