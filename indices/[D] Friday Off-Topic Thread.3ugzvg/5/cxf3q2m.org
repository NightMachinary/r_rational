Truth is an interesting concept. As rationalists (or aspiring rationalists), I think the majority of this sub would agree that they, in context of themselves, prefer the real truth over a happy lie (a la Dr House) You'd want to know that you didn't receive your Hot Wheels racetrack because your family is going through some tight financial times, instead of thinking that your temper tantrum at Thanksgiving put you on Santa's naughty list.

But is this the case for everyone? As a rationalist, do you think everyone (for the sake of argument, let's say everyone above the age of sexual consent) should be give the whole truth all the time (barring things that breach privacy, national security, etc). I'm not saying you inundate people with every little minutiae of data, I'm saying that it's there to be publicly accessed and viewed by anyone, at any time. I'm probably not being explicit enough, but I'm basically asking if your world view supports the existence of necessary "pleasant" lies, because you feel people's net happiness would be reduced by the full measure of the truth.

For a fictitious example, let's take the world of RWBY. These ever present, unending creatures known as the Grimm are attracted by emotions like fear and terror, so mass panic can easily lay waste to entire settlements. Hence, a certain amount of censure is a necessity. The public simply can't handle certain truths, lest they panic and destroy themselves in the process. In this case, censure by higher powers is clearly a good thing.

So. Final, non-rambling question. As a rationalist, when do you consider it ok to lie to someone, with the express purpose of ensuring their happiness/survival. Are you just all facts, all the time and are always going to be that way? Do you like having your kids believe in Santa? Where's your line?
