What or who are they simulacra of? Any special abilities to worry about?

The most obvious flaw I see is that they are both under their creator's direct control, but not psychically. Killing the creator may solve the whole problem, but odds are that's not feasible.

On a slightly different note, they take 12 hours, probably a level 7 spell slot, and a decent amount of money to make, so whoever made them is probably terrifying.
