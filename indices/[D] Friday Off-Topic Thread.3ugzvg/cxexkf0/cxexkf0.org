To [[/r/rational]] D&D players: What is the best way to beat an army of 300 7 HD [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/simulacrum][Simulacra]]?

Our group are somewhat in control of a small city state and are just now level 8 and contains a Wizard, Oracle, Sorcerer and Bard. I'm wondering if [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/contagion][Contagion]] would arguably work 100% on the clones if the first one catches it.
