Every day from now on, three people somewhere in the world are granted a superpower. There is no choice involved; who gets a power is random and who gets what power is random. The three superpowers are as follows:

- Deception: You may, at any time you choose, trade minds with any other human within about ten feet of you; they do not need to agree to this trade. Your power rests with your mind, not your body, so you may live indefinitely by trading down to younger bodies.
- Entropy: Your biological body is replaced with a black sphere, about a foot in diameter. Any matter or energy that comes in contact with this sphere is destroyed. Your brain is preserved in a pocket dimension inside the sphere; in your sphere body you are immortal, both in the unaging and unkillable sense. The sphere body is unaffected by gravity, but you can feel its field and use it to construct a reference frame; you may move in any direction at any velocity up to about sixty miles per hour within your reference frame (this is your only way to deliberately influence the outside world, though you may communicate by, say, using finer control to carve messages on a wall). Sphere bodies bounce off of other sphere bodies. Your power rests with your body, not your mind, so the exploits of those with the power of Deception may leave you powerless. Edited to clarify that you do retain sensory ability spread out across your surface area.
- Time: You may, at any time you choose, reset the universe to the moment when you were first granted the power of Time, eliminating the previous series of events you've experienced from everything except your memory. Your power rests with your mind, not your body, so you are immune to Deception shenanigans. In the end, the final, stable timeline is one where you are either caught off-guard and are killed before you are able to react, or willingly commit suicide.

How would you expect the world to wind up? What would you do with Deception? Entropy? Time?
