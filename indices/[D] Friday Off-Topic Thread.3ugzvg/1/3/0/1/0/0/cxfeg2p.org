I was being metaphorical, not literal. If I were to be fully literal I would say that as soon as Time wielders came into conflict their lives would swiftly devolve into an endlessly repeated iterative hell where resources are identified, made use of and spent to try and destroy the other. The winners would be the type to spend every waking moment since their creation acquiring and utilising assets. Older Time users would have a massive advantage, seeing as they could identify the younger users and use their acquired resources to destroy them at the moment of creation.

It would not be a fun time.
