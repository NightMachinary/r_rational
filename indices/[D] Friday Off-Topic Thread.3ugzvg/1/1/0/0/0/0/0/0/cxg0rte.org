We don't really know what happens if a time resets after getting significant cognitive enhancements though.

What happens if time uses nanotech to enhance his memories and thinking abilities and then resets? We just don't know.

If we assume that the mind is seperate from the body in this setting then one could possibly become god while having a human body.

Though it could just as well be that doing so will kill you the first time you reset, so...
