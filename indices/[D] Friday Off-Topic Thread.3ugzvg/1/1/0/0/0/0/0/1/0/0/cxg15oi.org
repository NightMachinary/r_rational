depending on what happens when:

1. what happens entropy is brain dead or in a comma in regard to his position in space
2. what happens when deception takes the mind of a comatose\brain dead\brain maimed person
3. what happens when a 2nd "Time" resets while a 1st "Time" is alive, does the 1st time keep his memories?

One could build up a plan where time uses deception to put brain dead people in entropy up in orbit every day.

It would require:

1. find enough people which when they become entropy are willing to go up in orbit\stay in a sealed chamber as to get a streak of enough days to perform enough iterative research
2. possibly using a chain of "Time"s, of course selected by killing\brain damaging\etc. incompatible "Time"s, to pass information recursively in a way that won't get them to go crazy(i.e. assuming you have 10 "Time"s the last one resets every day, after the 10th day he asks the 9th time to reset, the 9th does the same 10 times and then asks the 8th, etc.) doing so will subjectively shorten the research time needed from the prespective of each individual time.
3. after reaching the point of being able maintain a timeline for long enough for the figured out technology to build space ships fast enough to use a deception, again selected by finding a susceptible person that will agree to this plan, to every day take an "Entropy", go to space, meanwhile a brain dead person is taken to orbit and when far enough deception switches to him and comes back.

Doing all of these you will eventually be able to sustain indefinitely.
