The first "Time" has the best chance of achieving his or her goals(followed by 2nd "Time" and then 3rd etc). Unless an "entropy" destroys earth in a way that doesn't leave "Time" a chance to reset. Not sure why would "Entropy" do that, or if its even possible.

In theory its possible that if one of the first "Entropy"s destroy earth even in a slow manner then it won't be possible for "Time" to do anything about it because no technology could be built fast enough to counteract the destruction of earth, even with perfect knowledge of that. but i suspect that would depend on the physics of the world.
