I didn't really claim that anything would really change simply by it having mass, just that it doesn't -really- contradict anything..

I agree that the properties of Entropy are odd, which is basically why i think that if the author decided it still had all of those properties but also had mass it wouldn't really be that different.

So it could have mass, and it could even have gravity, anything pulled to it would simply be destroyed. it could in theory have orbiting matter though (It is not specifically said that "Entropy" couldn't generate\expel particles btw so even if we assume graviton's are needed to apply gravity it could still work).

Having said all of that, Halfway through this message i realized that the person who started this whole "mass"\"gravity" thing wasn't the one that started the prompt, as opposed to what I was thinking when i started questioning, so sorry for that.

And [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon/]] already confirmed that they do not have mass previously in this thread so it closes the entire discussion I suppose, sorry for that.
