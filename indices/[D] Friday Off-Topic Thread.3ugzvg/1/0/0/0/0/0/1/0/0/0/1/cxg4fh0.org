Am I missing something or is "entropy" as a physical manifestation not something that actually exists? i.e. it doesn't actually have "default" properties.

If so then all I can see is that he didn't say they -had- mass in the original prompt, but not saying they have mass is not the same as saying they don't.

Or am i maybe missing a physics thing which makes having mass impossible?
