I did consider that issue, but made what I felt was an educated guess that the atmosphere would not be consumed quickly enough to be a short-term problem. How long-term of a problem, I'm not sure. Let me search for some values and run some calculations...

Holy shit, each Entropy consumes 4% of the atmosphere a day. (It asymptotically approaches 0%, obviously, but still.) Someone lied to me a couple of years ago about how much atmosphere we had and I never realized it. If each Entropy is only an inch in diameter instead of a foot, then they "only" consume 0.03% of the atmosphere a day.
