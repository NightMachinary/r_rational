Are you in a romantic relationship? How's it going? Do you make an effort to be a rationalist even in your love life? What does being a romantic rationalist even entail?

I've recently been dating someone and things are starting to get pretty serious. I wouldn't be surprised if we start pursuing something more long-term in the near future. This is honestly rather new to me. I've been in relationships before, but never anything so...real?...(I'm not exactly sure how to put that)

I really value the opinions of the users here, so I was just curious what input there might be. Thanks.
