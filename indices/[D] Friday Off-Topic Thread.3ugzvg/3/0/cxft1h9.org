Yes, it's going really well, and I guess as far as being rational goes I'm trying to genuinely make them happy, which I tend to find involves a lot of watching and listening (which I'm good at) and then acting on those observations (which I'm a lot less good at.). Bonus points for them being happy making you happy.
