I've found an interesting connection between shamanism and Daniel Kahneman's theory of mind. When someone suffers the phenomena known as Shamanic Crisis, what is referred to as system 1 becomes corrupt and the shaman's task is to somehow neutralize the sickness. Unfortunately most aspiring shamans fail to recognize the illness or they incorporate it into their ontological framework. The ones who do overcome the illness become "full shamans" creating tiers within shamanism. More interestingly, it seems as though the structures responsible for system 1 become repurposed to some degree in a manner similar to the way a blind person's visual centers are by other cognitive faculties. Unfortunately, in the course of my study of shamanism I've only encountered a small fraction of self-proclaimed shamans who have "successfully" navigated "initiation."

The more reading I've done regarding shaman's sickness and shamanism in general the more it appears to be a discrete illness, though it seems to be mistaken as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
