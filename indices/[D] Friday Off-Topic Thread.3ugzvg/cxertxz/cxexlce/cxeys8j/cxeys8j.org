Shamanism is a blanket term which describes a widespread spiritual practice among various tribal and aboriginal peoples. A shaman through altered states of consciousness perceives and interacts with the spirit world and channels energies to practice divination and healing. The shaman usually serves as a community leader and intercedes in the spiritual world to offer counseling and cure maladies caused by malevolent spirits or entities.

Shamans are produced by lineage, apprenticeship, or are spontaneously chosen by the spirits. Being chosen by the spirits is referred to as a calling. Shaman's sickness or Crisis refers to the potential shaman being beset by a spiritual sickness which his task is to then cure, or remain permanently insane, or die. This process serves as an initiation. Tiers of shamans simply refer to language used by shamans to describe those who have survived initiation, the most powerful being those chosen by the spirits, followed by lineage and apprenticeship.

Those who haven't overcome initiation haven't successfully purged themselves of the illness and aren't regarded as shamans. Research is difficult because being able to tell who has suffered the illness is difficult, but very specific phenomena are referred to which definitely separate those who have from those who haven't. Furthermore, significant industry has spung up around people claiming to be shamans so that doesn't simplify things either.
