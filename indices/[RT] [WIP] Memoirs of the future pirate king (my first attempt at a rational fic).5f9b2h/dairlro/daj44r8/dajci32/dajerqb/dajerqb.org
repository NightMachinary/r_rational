Getting all those same people on the same boat is either going to be a long trip down the stations of canon or a series of contrived situations. Most of Luffy's crew followed him because he's good natured, stubborn enough to bull through their issues, and too stupid to be duplicitous. Rewriting everyone to fit would be kind of silly. Why not just write an original character and follow his/her journey instead?
