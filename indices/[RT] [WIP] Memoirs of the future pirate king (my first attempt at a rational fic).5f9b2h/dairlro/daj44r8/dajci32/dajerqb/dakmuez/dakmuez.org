That sounds good, really. I mean, there are quite a few characters that wouldn't really need to join the straw hats, without removing much from the whole straw-hat vibe.

While the necessary crewmembers that had some invaluable functions within the crew could stay, the ... /joy-riding/ members, for a lack of better words, could very well make due on their own, really.

I'm really considering this one. Rewriting the canon, but instead allowing Luffy to solve the issues present in a different way seems really overdone. The best thing, really, would be to just write an entirely different route, with a huge divergence at some point.

Thanks for the feedback. That's amazing of you to do.
