Not everyone else needs to be smarter. Notably, in HPMOR most characters didn't. I do agree that it would make more sense for Luffy's intelligence to be justified within the universe's rules. Actually the way his thoughts are written, which makes them seem almost invasive or external made me think something was going on.
