Whatever you do, please keep this in mind- rationality isn't a superpower. It's the practice of a sound mind. Making it into a magical ability largely defeats the point, it's not rationality if not anyone can use the same method.

"Thought compression", as you call it, seems like brilliant alternative. Sort of like a time freeze ability, that freezes everything except his own brain? This allows you to write "figure out the solution in a split second" scenarios, while still using only plausible reasoning skills.

A general intelligence ability dangerous, for the reasons I mentioned, but not all bad, either. If it's framed as a minor, secondary ability of the Fruit, it could justify why such a young person has above-average adult reasoning skills. Any more than that, we slide into superintelligence territory.
