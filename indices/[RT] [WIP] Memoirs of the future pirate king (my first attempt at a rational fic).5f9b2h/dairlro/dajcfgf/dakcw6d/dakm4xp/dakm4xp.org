I guess so. I've hinted in my recent chapter that Luffy does have the think think fruit power, but he hadn't consumed that fruit until much later, after Shanks had already left the windmill village. Somewhere between Shanks' and Luffy's departure.

I agree with you on the aspect that general intelligence would sorta make rationality a really cheap thing, and would remove value from Luffy's achievements. I think I'll go for the time dilation power.
