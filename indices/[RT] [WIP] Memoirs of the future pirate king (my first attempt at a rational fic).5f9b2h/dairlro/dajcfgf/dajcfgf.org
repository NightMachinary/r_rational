Thank you so much for the feedback! I will do some revision right now.

About the Think-think fruit idea, that actually does seem really cool, honestly. Is it too late to actually add it to any subsequent chapters, yet? It wouldn't be as much of a retconn as he isn't confirmed to have eaten a devil fruit (barring the gum gum fruit). He hasn't tried swimming yet, and he also hasn't come in contact with seastone, so I guess it's possible lol.

Yeah, I felt that r!Shanks's course of action was, indeed, dumb, but given that he was rushed in terms of time, and he had to act quick, it kinda justifies his dumbness. Also, Shanks never did carry a sword on him, so he couldn't parry the blow (as indicated in the canon scene), but he COULD have used literally anything else. I'll try and revise that point.

And as for Luffy's motivation, I felt like I glossed over it so thinly during the end of the prologue. I'll definitely revisit it and clean it a little more. I mean, 'To be the freest' is an okay, reason, but the bigger question is 'why', right? I should try and explain his reasoning more, shouldn't I?

Again, thanks for the feedback, man! I appreciate it!!! I'm REALLY thinking of adding the Think-Think fruit. I'm already brainstorming it. Is it a passive buff or an active enhancement (is he always smart, or can he invoke bursts of quick thinking, compressing his thoughts to a fraction of what they were). I'm kinda leaning on both types, though.
