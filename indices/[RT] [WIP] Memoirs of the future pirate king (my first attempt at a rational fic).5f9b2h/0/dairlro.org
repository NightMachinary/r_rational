Horray!

You've got better prose than most, and I think you're doing a good job of nailing the speech patterns in One Piece.

That said - One nit to pick, and two large issues.

Nit: Part of a rational work is that /everyone else/ also get smarter. Why would r!Shanks use his /hand/ to block a sword, when there's a lot around to use, or he could push the blade into a miss?

And two bigger issues: First: Why not have Luffy eat, say, the Think-Think fruit? Work /within/ the universe to give him his rationality "powers".

Second: Motivation. Cannon Luffy wants to be pirate king, for Reasons, and just goes off to do it. r!Luffy would need to have a deeper reason for wanting to become pirate king. He'd also need to have a reason why becoming a pirate is the best way to get those underlying reasons, since his adoptive dad is one of the marine's top admirals. What are r!Luffy's goals, and why does he think this course of action will get him those?
