To make a specific version of that critique, what I'm /worried/ about seeing is the same plot points played out all over again, except Luffy has fancier thoughts. You don't have to go HPMOR or Luminosity levels of off-roading, but it would be fun if e.g. the same exact crew doesn't get forced back together.

Not to mention One Piece is frikkin' long. Ain't nobody got time for that.
