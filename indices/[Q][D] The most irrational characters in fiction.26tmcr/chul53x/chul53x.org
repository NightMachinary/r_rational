The more I think about it, the more I think that the award has to go to the Christian God, if you take all the stories of the Bible literally. He's got literally infinite power over everything. He's all-seeing. He's all-knowing. And then look at how he uses his powers. A large part of the problem is that the Bible was written by a bunch of people from different cultures and with different viewpoints, but God when seen as a character in a work of fiction is just ... so incredibly irrational.

(The non-literalist camp doesn't have these problems, and I don't mean for this to be taken as an attack on Christianity in general.)
