No, no, it's better because Jewish God is outright stated to be racist (chosen people), petty (jealous god, disproportionate retribution, making a man KILL HIS KID JUST TO SEE IF HE WOULD DO IT), and vengeful (perfectly willing to kill people's innocent families for something THEY did). He's basically evil, though anti-villainous. So, he makes sense as a character. Which makes it so fucking weird when he suddenly saves 'I love everyone', kills himself, and then doesn't act substantially different afterwards.
