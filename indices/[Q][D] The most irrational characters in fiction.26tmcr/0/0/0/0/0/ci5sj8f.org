Yeah, it seems to me that this is how most "intelligent bad guys" in fiction are written. One of the things that frustrated me to no end about Battlestar Galactica was the way the Cylons were constantly portrayed as being super intelligent and one step ahead of the humans throughout the show, outright stating that they have some big master plan... then having it become clear that when the writers had to actually reveal what this plan was, there was nothing.

Similarly, Young Justice is a pretty amazing show, but it got a bit tiring in the first season to have The Light constantly mention at the end of each episode that every supposed "setback" just furthered their plans. Maybe they were just super cocky and putting up a front for the others though.
