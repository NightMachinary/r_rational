I mostly agree with that, but there are a couple ways that a writer can get around not being as smart as the character they're writing;

1. *Think about things more than the character can*. Part of "smart" is arriving at the correct solution quickly. A stupid person can to some extent simulate this by spending hours generating possibilities and figuring out why they will or will not work, then having the character do the same in the span of minutes. A stupid writer can think up a believable lie that doesn't have any contradictory information, he just has to spend a lot longer on it than his character, who can do it on the fly.

2. *Bring in outside help*. Your character is limited to their own viewpoint most of the time, but if you're a stupid writer you can have a nearly unlimited number of people looking over your shoulder to troubleshoot for you. You should do this when writing anyway, wherever possible. The end result will be a character that's smarter than either the writer or the people who gave feedback.

3. *Research*. This crosses over into knowledge a bit, but part of being smart is knowing a lot, and a writer who doesn't have much knowledge can supplement their knowledge from the internet or things that they've read. If the stupid writer can recognize a smart argument, they can crib from it to supplement whatever they've thought up.

4. *Cheat*. Debatably terrible writing depending on how it's done, but since the author knows with certainty everything that's going to happen, they can have give the smart character the ability to be correct. The only problem is when the audience thinks to themselves "bullshit", which can be avoided with the above three points.
