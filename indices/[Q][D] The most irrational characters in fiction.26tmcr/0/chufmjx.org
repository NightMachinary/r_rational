There's this one particular comic issue that I hate with a passion where Lex Luthor finds out that Clark Kent is Superman, courtesy of some enormously powerful computer program he's developed in order to draw conclusions. And what does Lex do? He says something to the effect of "No, that couldn't possibly be true", junks the computer program, and refuses to believe the evidence that the program has created. It's the exact opposite of rationality from a character that's usually portrayed as being somewhere between peak human intellect and /smarter than the entirety of 31st century Earth combined/.

It still pisses me off just thinking about.
