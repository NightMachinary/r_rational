Extremely magically powerful entities in fiction tend to act very irrationally, usually because the author doesn't think through everything (or because the author did think through everything and decided to just do what was cool and fun instead of what made the most sense). Dumbledore isn't actually all that bad, since he's shown to be doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.

Voldemort ... well, he's sort of a mess as a character, owing in part to a lack of moral complexity, and I think as a character his values are really, really poorly defined (aside from not liking muggles and not wanting to die, but that can't possibly be a comprehensive overview of his values).
