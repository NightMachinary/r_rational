  This crosses over into knowledge a bit, but part of being smart is knowing a lot, and a writer who doesn't have much knowledge can supplement their knowledge from the internet or things that they've read. If the stupid writer can recognize a smart argument, they can crib from it to supplement whatever they've thought up.

This often backfires though when a writer users a "smart" argument that they clearly don't quite understand.
