Not inherently a bad thing, so long as you write yourself as a compelling character.

Have you ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][Sleeping with the girls]]? It's an excellent deconstruction of the standard SI fic. The protagnist spontaneously begins to port between his favorite anime, winding up in bed with a heroine from the story every time he falls asleep.

Every. time.

And they rarely take well to someone porting into their bed in the middle of the night.

I recommend it. It's a great read.

Now I just need to find the author and poke him with my cattle prod until he tells me why he stopped writing. I don't even care if he just got bored. I'm annoyed at the no-contact approach to questions.
