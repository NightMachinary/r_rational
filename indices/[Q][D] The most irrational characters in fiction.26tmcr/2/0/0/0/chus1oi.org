For the record, I'm not endorsing this, simply explaining.

It comes with the territory. If you have a magic system that is vaguely defined, there's really too many opportunities for it to just solve every problem. This is reasonable, but doesn't make for very compelling fiction. Authors get around this by having the one wielding the magic be completely ineffective, useless to the heroes, or the magic itself be unreliable. The rules of good storytelling trump rationality.

Sanderson's First Law of Magics: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.

For the record, Sanderson treats his magic as a science, with hard rules and the characters experimenting to find those rules out. I wouldn't go so far as to call his fantasy stories truly rational, but they're certainly a step above Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.

I just realized I went way off topic. Oh, well.
