I'd argue that Gandalf is exceptionally good at his job, actually. However, the actual nature of his job is not what it appears to be.

What he accomplishes is collecting remaining artifacts of the Age, putting them together in a last great battle, and having what doesn't fall leave. He is cleaning up the world and ending the Age in a last great battle, giving thematic closure and giving a clean ending to the Third Age.

If you see the world as a reflection of the music that created it, this is the crescendo that ends the Third Age and gives way to the Fourth. The dissonant refrain made by Melkor is brought to a conclusion as his last servant Sauron gathers his forces for the last time and is utterly destroyed. The Rings that he forged are destroyed or moved out of the world, the Elves that opposed him leave the world, the last of the Balors that once served Melkor is dragged out of hiding and destroyed...
