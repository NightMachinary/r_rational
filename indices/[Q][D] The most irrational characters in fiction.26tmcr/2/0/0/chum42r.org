Unless Dumbledore was secretly following along in his invisibility cloak the whole time, Harry definitely should have died in books 1,2,4,5, and 7, and he probably should have died in books 3 and 6. Well, I suppose his relationship with Voldemort would have kept him alive but not in a useful way.

Voldemort loses to /Harry/. He /keeps casting/ Avada Kedavra. His Legilimency fails because he can't comprehend True Love. /He lets his snake roam around/.

Oh, Gandalf. Gandalf is not very good at his job. Yep, don't rely on old powerful wizards in fantasy stories. They are dumb.
