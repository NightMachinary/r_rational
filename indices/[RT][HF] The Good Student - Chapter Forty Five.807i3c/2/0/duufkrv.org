Yeah, it's fairly confusing. I think the problem is that the demons have a hundred years of planning behind them and so everything the main characters do has been accounted for. Even Nic had that thought - it's like a maze, and every choice they make ultimately leads to the same outcome. Like with Dizzy; she throws the knife and it doesn't matter if it kills the Librarian or Nic, either way works out for their plan.

The thing is, we don't know what their end goal is, so it all seems random. I think once it's revealed what they want it will make a lot more sense because we'll be able to piece together how all the steps came together.
