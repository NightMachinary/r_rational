Lol. I just read this in its entirety. Its all fresh in my mind but I am still lost. I kind of understand that this may be intentional but it seems as if something should have been explained by now.

Unless the story of the green demon rejecting the questions after too many is supposed to a warning to readers or something?

Also shouldnt Nics demon have known about some of the stories about the green demon? since they were supposedly written down in the mythology book. she said she only heard about a bear that was green and a lover. she couldnt think of any other "green demons."
