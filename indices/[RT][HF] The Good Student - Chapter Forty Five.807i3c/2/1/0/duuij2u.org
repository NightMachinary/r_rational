I think you make a fair point. I wasn't very clear in that section about the Green Demon. The idea is that the story in the book is very different to the one Nic tells, but the Librarian recognises the similarity and brings his attention to it by referring to it as the Green Demon, even though it isn't called that in the book, so he knows she heard his version. My mistake for not being clearer (or clear at all), I really need to give myself more time to work out small errors like that which I could easily avoid with an extra pass. I blame the fog of war.
