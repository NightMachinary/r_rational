I'm thinking that the Librarian and Winnum Roke are working together somehow. Maybe they were in a similar partnership as Nic and his demon?

I'm wondering what their deal is because it doesn't seem like they want to invade at all. What would be the purpose of sending Nic over? They might have a different agenda but I can't really imagine what that would be.

Some other interesting tid-bits: the Librarian could hear Nic's story but not its conclusion, which leads me to believe that the demon already decided to trust him by that point. So far Nic doesn't seem to have any godly powers and I wonder how much of it is down to his cautiousness. Also, Simole is back! Best girl has finally returned.
