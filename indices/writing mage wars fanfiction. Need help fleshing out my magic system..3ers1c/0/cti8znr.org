First off, why do the elemental panes exist? Why are they implied to exist only of the four classical elements? Where does voltari get the energy to do all this?

On the more practical end of things, how to mages get their initial colonies of mana? Could a larger colony open larger portals to the various planes? Would say, a portal with an area of 2 contribute more, less or the same amount of chaos as two portal with an area of 1? What can mages even do besides dumping the elements on their foes?

(for reference, I know nothing about mage wars)
