Huh... even with SAO, I can see the analysis video/documentary/report as a good framing device.

In fact, that's probably how I am going to tackle the problem of actually /writing/ anything set in that world. Be it raider parties trying to cheesee bosses or just an enterprising crafter that found a duplication glitch, it let's me chew on a single idea without having to craft a whole world before that. So thank you for this idea!

Also fair point about MMOs. That is honestly the biggest problem with my idea in itself, though SAO makes the speed aspect of it actually meaningful, since time is dead players.
