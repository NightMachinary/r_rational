I have to say: I love speedrunning. Outside of esports and really in-depth analysis videos, those guys are some of the highest experts in the games they play (well, a sizable aspect of it).

It's an odd combination of mastering the game to the point where you can kill incredibly hard bosses in literal seconds, as well as finding out and exploiting glitches that let you skip half of the game while traversing at the speed of sound.

And I guess I wonder: how can one make a story containing those elements?

One of the bigger ideas I had is essentially a Sword Arts Online fanfic, except the protagonist is actually part of a speedrunner/explorer guild. Instead of optimizing their build or going on raids, they focus solely on learning and exploiting game mechanics in order to skip this deadly game.\\
Imagine stuff like:\\
* Utilizing a weird combination of skills and equipment (stamina enchancers + a hilariously long range charge ability) in order to achieve flight, which allows to go out of bounds of the game. * Building off of this, remember the fuckhuge flying castle that SAO is set in? How about climbing on the side of it, in order to skip the floors and go to the top? * Trying all crafting combinations and seeing if there are any duplication glitches, in order to destroy grind-based economy. * Finding out if you can cheese bosses, e.g. by entering the arena but then getting into an inaccessible spot, then peppering the monsters with whatever long-range abilities you have available.

Now, while it seems to side-step the danger of the setting itself, it introduces a whole new set of challenges. After all, if you break your way to the highest floor, you'll be facing the highest boss without necessary stats or equipment. That's ignoring the fact that... there is no manual for this, every glitch and skip is a discovery. On top of that, those who worked with computers in general know- the damned thing can break for no reason at all.\\
In this way, it becomes something of a rigorous scientific endeavor, and something of randomness and wonder of magic.

This story has a second aspect of it: the homicidal developer himself. While mostly focused on being a normal player, I imagine he makes sure his game runs smoothly (since he's kinda the only guy left with admin privileges).\\
What would be his reaction to finding out his game is mastered, yet also broken, in such way? Would it be a ingenious solution to a puzzle he left, or a bunch of sore losers cheating their way out? How would he even find out, outside of truly game-breaking glitches?

And, in the end... I kind of don't know where I could take this concept further? I mean, there are ton of themes/topics to pick up (relation of those speedrunners to other players or Kaiba himself, wonder of discovery and the grudging work of scientific method), but... I feel like there are whole levels worth of unexplored ideas here.
