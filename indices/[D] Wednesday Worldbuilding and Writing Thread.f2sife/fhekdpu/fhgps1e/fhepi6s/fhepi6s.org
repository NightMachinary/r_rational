D&D clerics have always been a bit weird, since they're modeled after Christian priests, but are dedicated to individual gods out of a polytheistic pantheon. Usually one of those gods is the holy light / help the poor / heal the sick one that the Cleric was written with in mind, but we're expected to use the same basic chassis for war gods and death gods and fire gods. And it's also weird that people are dedicated to specific gods in a polytheistic world, instead of praying to the situationally appropriate ones and maybe having a personal favorite for general purposes.

If the gods care about your behavior over a longer period of time, you get a situation where adherents look more like they're following modern religions, trying to uphold the code of right code of conduct for a Buddhist / Christian / Muslim / fire god worshiper. And those don't always agree, especially that last one, so you can't always use multiple sets of religion magic. On the other hand, if they're more like the ancient Greek gods, they don't care much about long term actions (so long as you haven't done anything to personally spite them), and they'll do their thing as long as you properly perform the ritual and sacrifice a goat. Which is barely different from a D&D Wizard, unless some of the gods hate each other, and then the overlap between who approves of who, especially if you have both code-of-conduct and sacrifice-a-goat gods, gets very interesting.

People will try to AB test down the correct rituals and codes of conduct, but this sort of thing is something humans are terrible at. We tried it in a world without gods, and we ended up with religion, instead of nothing. So until the setting's equivalent of a Scientific Revolution, I'd expect every faith to be full of extraneous behaviors beyond what their gods actually care about, and wide variance in individual effectiveness based on personal habits that nobody identified as spiritually significant. After such, I'd expect the code of conduct style to still be poorly understood, since we're just not that good at composing that sort of test, and the ritual style to suddenly become vastly more powerful. This might be a problem if your religion magic already had a usable power level before the scientific revolution, and now it's suddenly more, unless the gods are rationing out fixed total amounts of power. If they are, the scientific revolution just makes religions harder to follow as the standards get more rigid, and any gods that get forgotten because they're too fiddly and hard to scientifically pin down suddenly start giving out way more power to the handful of people who put up with them.
