What would be interesting is a cleric of a Harmony-like deity: practically omnipotent, but almost never intervenes because everyone's going to the same afterlife anyway and the previous gods supremely fucked up the world for thousands of years until he took their mantles and unfucked it. Harmony wouldn't provide his clerics with much power. Any power they had would likely be something innate to them due to the laws of physics on their world. But he would occasionally nudge chance to make things easier on them, and he pushes his followers to prevent powerful, malevolent people from fucking up the world again.

I don't know what a cleric of Harmony would look like in a DnD setting. They would pray for a maximum of 15 minutes a day, occasionally recieving whispered suggestions which sound like their own ideas. They'd be difficult to kill in combat, and their teammates would be similarly protected as long as they were improving the world around them. They wouldn't have explicit healing powers (unless they had goldminds), but Harmony could definitely push them to be excellent field medics with just a little anachronistic knowledge. They'd look more like paladins really, except paladins usually serve less forgiving gods. Harmony would never abandon you in a time of great need, even if you had strayed a little.
