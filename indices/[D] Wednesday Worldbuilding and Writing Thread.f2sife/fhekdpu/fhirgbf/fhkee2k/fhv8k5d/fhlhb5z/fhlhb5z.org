I don't think you'll have any problems expanding on the concept or finding interesting ideas and themes to explore. The problem with stories involving speedrunning is that a big part of it is grinding, which in itself wouldn't be a problem, after all LitRPG is fairly successful genre despite its nicheness, but the grind involved in speedrunning isn't the sort where you can constantly watch numbers go up (or in this case, down), it's a skill that involves repeating the same specific set of actions over and over again and that isn't something that translates well to other forms of entertainment and media.

Watching 200 or 300 hours of someone playing Ocarina of Time until they're good enough to hit world record pace is a very different experience than it would be to read about it.

So, if you want to write something entertaining with speedrunning at the core, you'll likely want to approach it in a similar manner to what AGDQ/SGDQ and SummoningSalt do: presenting it as if it were a sport or competition where people are only exposed to the end result of the grinding.

Your idea of the SAO fanfic is interesting, but it's also something that was already addressed in its story (more so in the Light Novels than the actual show itself), with beta testers like Kirito or Argo having an edge over the rest of the players, essentially playing a similar role to that of a speedrunner except without taking away any of the actual stakes involved (since they didn't get farther than the first 8 floors). Also, glitches were essentially patched out live through many of the AIs that the game had monitoring the players, with Yui being the only exception (and IIRC the game itself had entire systems dedicated to keeping the game's economy safe). Also, since Kayaba was a player himself (and a very important one at that) any glitches or exploits that reached his ears would likely have been patched out the next day.

I think if you want to introduce the idea of speedrunning to SAO you would have to change things around so a healthy speedrunning community could form before the story's start. Maybe an AU where the game didn't trap its players until it's international release 6 or 7 months after the initial Japanese-only release. Also, maybe something along the lines of a 'hacker's guild' was part of Kayaba's plan or at least something he would tolerate and look the other way for, so long as it didn't disrupt or get in the way of his 'dream' (so no killing the final boss after only 2 weeks in). You could have a faction that directly opposes this Hacker's Guild and instead reports any glitches found to the GMs with a bounty system in place (so the bigger the glitch, the bigger the reward). And if you want something like that to be a bit more exclusive (after all, why wouldn't everyone just join the Hacker's Guild if it's such a convenient place?), have it so you can't be in more than one of those guilds/factions at a time (which I think the game already does?) and the requirements for joining are very steep (someone in the speedrunning community has to vouch for you, or you have to contribute a glitch of your own). The involvement of the AIs is something that could be written away, maybe for each floor cleared less of them are active in order to save resources, or maybe the thing with Yui happens earlier than it does in canon and her elimination leaves the game open for glitches. It could also be an AU where Kirito defeats Kayaba in the 75th floor but they still aren't able to leave until they finish the game, and without admin supervision (and the AIs being almost entirely deactivated) they are able to start running wild with any exploits they find. Maybe some of the players that made it that far don't want the game to end and start planning or looking for a way to use an exploit to keep everyone inside.

So yeah, there are lots of directions you could take this in, even make it so it's a sort of cat and mouse kind of story between the factions and the GMs, with the endless cycle of: patch a exploit > players find a way to circumvent it > patch that too, as the main focus of the story, escalating until things reach the level of ridiculousness that speedrunning is known for. E.g. Players find a way to equip a few weapons with high requirements by leaving their menu open, materializing a stack of some rare monster drop, equipping and unequipping some rings given only in the tutorial city, all while looking up at the ceiling and at a specific time, like 3:18 a.m, etc. You could write a little arc about some players using those ridiculous methods to do some Arbitrary Code Execution (pretty much what Kirito does to save Yui) and using that to fuck with the game's code or even turning Kayaba and any of the other GMs (if there are any) into actual players. Maybe one of the players that does that is actually able to leave the game.

As far as actually writing anything like this or any idea that you come up with (and tying back to what I wrote at the beginning), I believe it would probably be best if the protagonist was someone who is familiar with games, or pretty much a gamer, but not with speedrunning in specific. So maybe they luck out and find a glitch that allows them to join the Speedrunner/Hacker's guild, but they're pretty much a newbie at any of it, and a big time spent in the guild is about unlearning gaming habits and starting to think outside of the box, trying to outsmart and game the system (and other players), and trying out anything that comes to mind and would help. I think following the journey of someone like that would be more interesting than reading about some pro SAO speedrunner that turns any of the game's stakes into a joke as soon as they log in. Not that that wouldn't be an interesting thing to read in itself, but it probably would be better served as a secondary character POV that you only get once every few chapters, or maybe make it so the story's interludes are from the admins and speedrunners' POV. My point is that classic speedrunning wouldn't be the most engaging thing to read about, and an outsider's perspective (basically a fish out of water story) would be more interesting than following a perfect unkillable MC that is able to do everything right at the first try. So basically, avoid the biggest mistake that SAO made: a Gary Stu MC.

Edit: I think a good take on this would be something along the lines of Empires of EVE. A book that narrates some of the most important events in EVE's history (online MMO if you aren't familiar with it) through the point of view of many different characters, following their stories in and out of the game and presenting everything in a way that is easy to follow, even to those that aren't familiar or haven't ever played EVE in their lives. I think EVE is the closest thing to SAO we have IRL for now, as far as the game's scope and real life stakes go (no, players haven't died irl because they died in the game, but there have been wars inside the game that costed millions in real life dollaridoos, so they got that going).
