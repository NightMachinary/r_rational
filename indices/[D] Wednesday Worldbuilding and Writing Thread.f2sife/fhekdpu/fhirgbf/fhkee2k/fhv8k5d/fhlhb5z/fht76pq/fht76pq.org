Thank you for the thorough reply. This is exactly what I hoped for, posting here.

I completely agree with making the speedrun closer to a sport, yet I think it's possible to just... make the grind part of background routine. "Today I woke up, ate breakfast, ran through Emerald Forest 10 times as usual, then..."

I admit to not having /read/ the novel itself, and I see that I have to either do that or write about an SAO inspired game. And yeah- AU is really the way to go, /especially/ with bugfixing AIs, though I can't imagine those bots beating a proper programmer (like natural regeneration vs. a surgeon operating).

I literally haven't considered anyone actually /opposing/ them, so that's a whole new dimension of challenge to consider. And I can see that happening too- both from Kayaba's perspective (outsorcing work to the masses) and actual snitches (combination of greed, hopelessness and not wanting to piss of the big GM).

Having a noob start the show is probably for the best, though I'll take your idea of multiple PoVs, since I want to show/see variety of ways the game can be broken- a crafter/explorer will have a different experience from a raid tank, after all.

Though I disagree with a speedrunner being overpowered. While there are games that can be made into a joke by a pro, a death-game MMO is different enough that they could become... something like a mage- squishy overall (since they don't optimize for normal gameplay), but holding some amazing abilities in right circumstances.

And IRL MMO cash money being the stakes of the game... I gotta tell you- played Entropia Universe (irl = digital money there as well) in way back when, and I can already /see/ an alternative fic with speedrunners already, so thanks for the inspiration!
