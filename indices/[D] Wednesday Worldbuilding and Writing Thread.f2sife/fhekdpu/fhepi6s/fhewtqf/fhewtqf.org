I think this would also work well within the context of a Discworld-esque pantheon where a God's individual power is directly drawn from their believers. Perhaps the rituals/codes of conduct do not just prove your own personal devotion to the faith but actually help to empower your diety.

Which could in turn cause some interesting interactions with a Scientific Revolution kind of setting. After all, if Gods are not just forces of nature or ritual vending machines that only respond to certain inputs, then there is room for their own decision making. If AB testing allows their followers to perfect the codes of conduct that empower them, then most Gods will get a massive power boost. They, in turn, could utilize that power in unexpected ways. And as a consequence, maybe the required rituals/conducts change as well. It's a lot harder to pin down the laws of natures when those laws might get impacted by the mood/actions of a third-party diety.
