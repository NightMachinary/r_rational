Considering that you'd have a polytheistic setting, as long as there's no exclusivity rules, I would expect that the optimal strategy for clerics would probably be to select a primary deity, possibly one or more compatible secondary deities, and then adopt a handful of practices from other tertiary deities that could provide some modicum of power with relatively minimal cost. Essentially, each person assembles their own mini-pantheon from the full set of gods.

While individualized pantheons would reflect the things that people are comfortable with doing (or not doing), they would also probably be constructed at least in part to optimize the amount of power you get. Most people would probably accept some rather significant restrictions or requirements in their lives if they could get magical powers or substantial divine boons for doing so.

With that in mind, if you want to ensure that you don't have a situation where pretty much everyone follows the same cookie-cutter paths-of-least-resistance, you'd need to ensure that the restrictions (or requirements) are generally substantial, and the comparatively meager benefits are only worthwhile to a small group of people, quite possibly people who coincidentally can't/won't do the restricted activity anyway.
