I've always found clerics to be one of the more interesting of the stereotypical D&D classes, in part because so little is usually done with them. When people play or write clerics, they're usually not done with an accurate model of religion or the religious, and the whole question of faith is pretty moot when you have literal gods that produce miracles on demand.

What I'm trying instead is a cleric who instead doesn't rely on faith or thought whatsoever, but instead is bound by actions, in a "by their fruits you will know them" kind of way. In other words, it doesn't matter what you believe, so long as you follow the path of your chosen god. Granted, this is easier when believe in your god, but it's entirely possible to be a cleric operating within the teachings of your god as set down in his holy book, while still thinking of this as merely a means to an end.

From a making-this-into-rules perspective, each god has a set, defined model for how someone should act. The more in line you are with this model, the more power you have as a cleric, probably with some lag time and averaging of trailing behavior so that you don't become a megacleric for five minutes when you accidentally act in perfect accordance with the model. The gods don't care about intents or mens rea, just works and actions. Various actions have negative or positive weights, so e.g. killing someone is worse than stealing, and donating a loaf of bread is better than saying bless you when someone sneezes. Clerical powers are arranged in either tiers or gradients, with higher levels being accorded to those who act more in line with the model.

From the perspective of the clerics though, all they have is a holy book, filled with fables, parables, histories, and fluff, and interpretations aren't always straightforward. You can look to other clerics for guidance, but /they/ don't always know, and a lot of what you emulate might just be matters of personal preferences, superstition, or something else. If there are two big ideological camps within a clerical order devoted to the same god, and they're of equal power, what can you conclude? That both are half-right, or that whatever they're split over is irrelevant, or something else? Being a cleric comes down to collecting a bunch of evidence and then making judgment calls about what that evidence actually says, possibly with some A/B testing between clerics, if you can get past the noise involved.

I'm pretty sure this concept works best with Blue/Orange Morality gods, ones whose paths are tough to follow, or whose ethos might initially seem nonsensical.

(I've been pretty terribly sick the last few days, so have been focusing my attention on writing some trashy fantasy that doesn't require too much thinking on my part.)
