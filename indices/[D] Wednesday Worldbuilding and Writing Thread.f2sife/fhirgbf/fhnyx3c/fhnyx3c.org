You might want to take a look at [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]]. It approaches the Isekai genre from exactly this angle, though the writing quality is mediocre and I ended up dropping it after it didn't get better. Still, it might have some things to offer for you, in terms of do's or dont's, if you know what you're looking for.
