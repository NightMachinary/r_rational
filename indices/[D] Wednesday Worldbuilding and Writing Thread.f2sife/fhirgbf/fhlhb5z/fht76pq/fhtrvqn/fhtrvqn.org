  make the grind part of background routine

Yeah, I considered that too while writing my reply, the whole comparison with LitRPGs was with that in mind. Developing a skill isn't as easy to portrait as just the numbers going up, and if you shove too much into the background you kind of run the risk of breaking your readers' suspension of disbelief, where they can't believe that is 'just' something the MC can do now, or the progression of power doesn't scale well with the perceived amount of training, and thus making it feel a bit asspull-ish. I think one example of that would be Worth The Candle, with the protagonist receiving sudden power spikes that instantly take away any kind of perceived stakes, compared to Mother of Learning where you can see the protag's power grow naturally and you're never quite sure if what he has available will be enough. It's a tricky thing, so yeah, you'd be writing as if it were a sport or some martial arts of sorts, rather than a videogame. You can do both of course, but rarely are stats relevant for speedrunning, and when they are it's very sporadically compared to what other stories involving videogames use.

  I literally haven't considered anyone actually opposing them, so that's a whole new dimension of challenge to consider. And I can see that happening too- both from Kayaba's perspective (outsorcing work to the masses) and actual snitches (combination of greed, hopelessness and not wanting to piss of the big GM).

Another fun angle could be the players finding a way to fix the bug themselves, or putting up some kind of community effort in order to 'patch' an exploit that could fuck over everyone, at least until a GM is notified, that is if your story has a more hands-off approach than SAO does.

  though I can't imagine those bots beating a proper programmer
#+end_quote

I'm preeety sure Yui would be easily able to pass the turing test, the show (and the novel, to some extent) kind of glosses over it, but the implication is that in order for the Cardinal system to run properly (and independent of an actual group of programmers, thus letting Kayaba do his thing alone, as the sole programmer/GM) it has a bunch of AIs working as bots and taking care of any anomalies that take place. Mind you, as I said, it's kind of glossed over so we don't get many details, but this is the rational sub and that's what would make the most sense given what Kayaba wanted to accomplish (and only by himself).

  Though I disagree with a speedrunner being overpowered. While there are games that can be made into a joke by a pro, a death-game MMO is different enough that they could become... something like a mage- squishy overall (since they don't optimize for normal gameplay), but holding some amazing abilities in right circumstances.

I don't have much experience with MMOs, so I don't know how the idea of a 'speedrunner' translates into that, but I can see them becoming leaders whenever they have to take down bosses and taking on tactician/strategist roles as an alternative for those that wouldn't want to risk their lives by being on the front lines. Being trapped in a game that you speedrun and know like the back of your hand is gonna make you way more confident than a casual or even a normal-hardcore player, but being confident doesn't make you immune to fear of death ;) specially if the game is constantly evolving or the GMs straight up change or add/remove levels and other things, etc.

Still, my point was more about how enjoyable that POV would be for a protagonist. The pro and confident speedrunner who knows the game inside out is fun and interesting, but maybe it's something that could work best if done sporadically. I can't think of many examples, but one that comes to mind is the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Jack Sparrow is a very fun character that makes any scene he's in better, but he works best when he isn't the hero-protagonist. Anyways, you could still make it work, provided your writing is good or consistent, it ultimately depends on what you're aiming for, if you're just writing for yourself then it doesn't matter much, but if you're writing so others can enjoy it too then you have to keep these kind of things in mind.

  And IRL MMO cash money being the stakes of the game... I gotta tell you- played Entropia Universe (irl = digital money there as well) in way back when, and I can already see an alternative fic with speedrunners already, so thanks for the inspiration!

Never heard of it, but that's on me, and am glad to be of help! I think anything MMO-related is still very unique, as far as writing goes, so there are many directions you can take this in while remaining wholly-original. Don't be afraid of ditching the SAO or Entropia Universe settings if they feel too cramped or limiting! Making your own world is fun too, but also don't lose yourself in the worldbuilding, that's an easy trap to fall into~
