I think the way I would approach a work about/featuring speedrunning in a work of prose fiction would probably be taking one of those in-depth analysis videos (e.g. tomatoanus) and making it really more about the interesting mini-stories.

Actual speedrunners don't focus all that much on the game, because most things are automatic, and the things that aren't tend to be frame-perfect tricks or mechanically precise executions of glitches. There's a bunch of grind to speedrunning, and if you watch speedrunners on Twitch (or AGDQ), most of them aren't talking about the game, they're just chatting about other stuff, reading chat when they know they don't need to be looking at the screen, etc. Most of the drama comes from being on a hot run with multiple gold segments, or trying to nab a record using a newly discovered exploit, and it seems hard to do a prose version of that.

A speedrunning fic borrowing from an analysis video would instead be a series of mini-stories, describing some funky mechanic that's got broken wide open more and more, paying some attention to the speedrunning history of the game, to how these exploits were found, etc. Watching someone do an accelerated back hop is ... well, fine, I guess, but less so the third or fourth, or eighteenth time. But what gets /me/ is hearing the trick described and being told how some set of sensible instructions that were programmed into the game resulted in this weird and exploitable glitch, which is where a lot of the fun is.

Per SAO, speedrunning an MMO is ... well, I'm not going to say that it's never done, because back when I was deep into WoW I would participate in "first to 60" races when a new server would open, and obviously there's stuff like twinking alts or running newbies through a dungeon, or soloing team content, which has some of the same flavor. But it's really different, because an MMO is living in a way that most speedrun games are not, and getting through content as fast as possible doesn't hold much of the same appeal, especially since the endgame is way different.
