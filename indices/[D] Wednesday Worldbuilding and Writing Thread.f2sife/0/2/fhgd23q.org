  The gods don't care about intents or mens rea, just works and actions
#+end_quote

I feel like you're leaving something interesting on the table here. If intent matters, it opens up interesting conundrums, for example the UNSONG paradox how does one commit evil acts to get into hell if doing so would be for the greater good and therefore not counted as evil?

And in any case, even if intent doesn't matter ... how do people know that? Just as they can't know for sure what actions the gods like, they couldn't be sure intent doesn't matter (/especially/ since it would be impossible to A/B for, by its nature, although you could do observational studies). So I imagine there would be lots of people going around believing that intent matters, and lots of people going around believing that it doesn't.
