  If there are two big ideological camps within a clerical order devoted to the same god, and they're of equal power, what can you conclude?
#+end_quote

Possibility: The god likes it when his clerics vigorously debate with someone who disagrees with them, and thus /both/ sides of the split are benefiting from the mere presence of the split.

--------------

Possibility: If there are two gods whose paths are largely compatible (example: one who doesn't care too much about what you do as long as you help the poor, and another who only cares that you don't accumulate material goods; if you're spending all your money helping the poor then they're both happy) then you can have a cleric gaining extra power from fulfilling more than one path simultaneously. Of course, this means he's a lot more restricted in his actions than a single-path Cleric.

--------------

Possibility: Some gods might have, as part of their Path, things that you can't easily change. So, for example, there might be a god who only accepts elves as clerics - sorry, humans and dwarves, you'll have no luck. Or one who only accepts firstborn children - sorry, everyone with older siblings. Figuring out those conditions might be particularly tough.

--------------

There might be virtually forgotten Blue/Orange morality type gods, whose names are only known to the most well-read scholars and whose holy books are completely lost to time. Every now and then, by complete coincidence, someone manages to stumble along their Path... he has /no/ idea what he's doing that's right or wrong, but /somehow/ he has clerical abilities. If it's a particularly unexpected Path (he might be gaining points from keeping his hair combed and losing points from sneezing on a Tuesday) he might /never/ quite figure it out...

Merge this last point with the two-god Cleric above, and you might have what appears to be a particularly powerful cleric of Bob who is /actually/ a middling-average cleric of Bob and at the same time an accidental cleric of Fred the Forgotten. Any testing to try to figure out Bob's Path that involves this guy is going to work out badly.
