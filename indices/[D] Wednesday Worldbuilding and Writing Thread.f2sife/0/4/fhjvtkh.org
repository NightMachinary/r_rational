I assume you're aware of the difference between [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Orthodoxy][orthodoxy]] and [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Orthopraxy][orthopraxy]], but in case you aren't, this is actually in line with many older religions: the gods don't care what you believe, so long as you carry out the rituals correctly.

I'm very much in favor of clerics who work like this.
