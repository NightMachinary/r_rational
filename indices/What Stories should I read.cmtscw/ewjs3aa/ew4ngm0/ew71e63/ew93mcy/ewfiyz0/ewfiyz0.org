/Worm/ tackles many different issues. One of them is at least rational-adjacent: how do you create a universe with standard superhero conventions -- which were originally developed for children -- and make them work for an older audience? After all, secret identities, masks and costumes, non-lethal confrontations, "deranged supervillains", mad scientists and other elements common in classic superhero comics are not something that you would expect to arise even if some humans suddenly obtained superpowers in real life. /Worm/ goes out of its way to create a universe where comics conventions sort of make sense.
