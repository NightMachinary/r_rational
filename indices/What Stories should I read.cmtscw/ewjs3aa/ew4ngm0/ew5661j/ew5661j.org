Recommendations:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]] is a gamer-fic done well. The game layer is actually explored as the protagonist progresses, and it actually shows character growth when it's linked to an improving intelligence stat.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] is a look at an almost-perfectly programmed A.I. and the resulting singularity, with added ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/91933/friendship-is-optimal-always-say-no][Friendship is Optimal: Always Say No]] follows someone who has refused to upload when most of the world already has. The A.I. always wins in Optimalverse stories, but they're about the journey more than the destination.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Friendship Is Optimal: Caelum Est Conterrens]] another Optimalverse story, this one endorsed by Yudkowsky himself. The title translates to “Heaven is Terrifying,” and that really says it all, doesn't it?

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal][Mortal]] is a more traditionally “rational” story. When you have a way to defeat death, /why not/? Contains ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]] is basically [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1][HPMOR]] but ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/368986/message-in-a-bottle][Message in a Bottle]] is a sci-fi story where a probe from Earth hits an alien ring world which is also a superintelligence. But with ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/260906/a-white-mare][A White Mare]] is something that seems almost made for this subreddit. An alicorn from another world with the talent of ruling a nation pulls out all the stops to return home, and also keep the friend she made on Earth while deprived of her powers. Contains ponies and memetic doomsday weapons.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/429190/the-longest-day][The Longest Day]] is literally HPMOR but with ponies. It's a crossover, and a well-written one. The author is also something of an artist, and made a comic strip to supplement the story.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/232796/binary-suns][Binary Suns]] is only one chapter in length, but it rationally explores what happens when an immortal ruler wakes up to find there are two of her.
