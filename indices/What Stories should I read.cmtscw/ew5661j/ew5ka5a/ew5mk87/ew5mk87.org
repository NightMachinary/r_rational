I've been on a bit of a binge lately. When looking for fan fiction, I'll go from one fandom to another, consuming everything in sight before heading to the next. My last few fandoms were Starcraft, HTTYD, Worm, RWBY, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and now ponies. There seems to be a significant overlap of people who write rational stories and those who write pony stories, so they've earned a few spots on my favorites list.
