It's hard to summarize how Unsong is incredible, because typing it out just makes it sound a bit boring. I've typed and retyped this comment five times now trying to find a way to describe it that doesn't sell it short. You'd be best off just starting with the prologue.

It's a perfect intro to the setting, which defines most of the story.
