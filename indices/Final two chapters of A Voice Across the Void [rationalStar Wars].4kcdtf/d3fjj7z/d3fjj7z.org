I think this is one of the best rational Star Wars fanfics out there not counting expanded universe... but it's a bit of a faint praise. The writing is so-so, the characters go from good to pretty flat, and it does this fix-fic thing where the main character seems to be the first person to ever consider solving problems that have been widely known for ages.

The last two chapters in particular are a bit weak. I'm not sure how Noval goes from "Murdering a bunch of power-hungry dictators" to "Take over the universe, slaughter jedis and sith, and crush anyone who opposes me" in less than a month, which is always the problem in "Sith corrupts Jedi to the dark side" stories. I also think that, while most of the story has Noval decently distrustful of the holocron, the last two chapters seems to jump away from that, with Noval just accepting whatever the holocron says (because how could she be a sith? She told him she wasn't one!) unquestioningly.

Anyway, as for the good points: Noval is well-written, his motives are clear and you can clearly see why he'd accept the influence of the holocron. The sith character is pretty compelling too; she's charismatic, subtle, and makes some pretty good points about the whole "Committing war crimes for the greater good" thing. The politics and logistics of the story are mostly believable, and most of the characters are acting intelligently given the options available too them. Which, I guess is the primary goal when making rational fic, so kudos for that :)
