I had this story bookmarked and everyday I would open it just in case it was updated. Now it is, but it's over. Ho boy.

Okay I am loving the Holocron motivation and goal reasoning, especially since its fits with all the evidence.

However there are other hypotheses that can explain the situation, and it would go a great deal in character rational empowerment if Noval did even a cursory questioning of all the data and at least try not to go along with everything the Holocron is saying. I get the Dark Side is powerful in mental manipulation aspect, but it robs the characters of their own characterization.

Please post the sequel here when it starts. And fell free to add at least some minor info on whose point of view we are seeing when you make it change in chapter, shit gets confusing yo.
