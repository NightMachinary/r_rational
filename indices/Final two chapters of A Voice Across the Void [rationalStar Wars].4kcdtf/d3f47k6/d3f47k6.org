Finished. Didn't like it.

The continuous shift between perspectives, coupled with the very little focus on the actual details of the events, makes the whole story confusionary and at time schizophrenic in its development.

In addition, while treating the training he underwent to become so much stronger as a black box allows you much more flexibility, it also makes it much harder to relate with the character.

Overall a very interesting experiment, but I hope the sequel will be more detailed and more focused on a single character's voyage, rather than another kaleidoscope that attempts to show everyone's perspective at the same time.
