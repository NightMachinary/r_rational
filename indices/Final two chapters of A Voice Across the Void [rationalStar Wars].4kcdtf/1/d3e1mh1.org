I liked it, but I probably won't have a proper view of the whole thing until I reread it all in one go, as I've forgotten some of the events of the earlier chapters. The quality of writing was overall very good, but in a few places I was unsure of how much time had passed (e.g. in chapter 10, how long did Noval take to get used to relying only on his force senses?) and the constantly switching points of view without always immediately saying who's perspective we're looking from was a bit weird in a few cases. Still, those are just a few minor things, and especially the perspective thing felt more like a stylistic choice than a mistake.
