I took the opportunity to read through all of it, since before I stopped at chapter...three, I think. Overall I enjoyed it, with two little bugbears:

- What is Noval going to do with his Force-only vision, once the Force is destroyed?

- Reena being pained by lifting the ship up from the desert. I know the EU if kinda iffy on this, but I interpreted Yoda from ESB as saying that if you can let go of your belief in weight and strength, you will be able to lift anything without effort - you either achieve that mindset and lift, or don't. There isn't an intermediary "Lift but it really hurts".

But apart from that...yes, I still enjoyed it. Those things were right at the end so they didn't impact anything, and it was interesting to see the Jedi through a different point of view as well as the classic needs-of-the-many argument taken further, but not so far as to make the issue one-sided. Best of luck with the sequel!
