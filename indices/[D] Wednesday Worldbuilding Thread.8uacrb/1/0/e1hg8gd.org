I'm picturing something a little His Dark Materials-esque. For the results of the whole animal thing, I suppose look there. The other aspect is then just the capacity to see straight away exactly how good a person is, along with all the ramifications of such a thing being determinable from birth. Politics, business, parenting, law, relationships of all kinds really now are sorta dominated by those with the pure souls who people trust.

I suppose eventually you'd end up with whole circles of people who are just all evil who can only really find any sort of business or community with their evil brethren. This, naturally, is fundamentally unstable. Presumably, eventually, these would be isolated from the goody-goods, because no one really wants these people in society.
