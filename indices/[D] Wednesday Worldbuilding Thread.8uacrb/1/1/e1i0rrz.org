I think the setting is inherently flawed because the 'Good' and 'Evil',cannot be defined for the whole of humanity. If you select a certain moral framework, that might be something that many people ascribe to but not everyone. Different societies and cultures have different moral frameworks even more so in different time periods and different circumstances. Murder is seen as morally evil, but killing in war?, death penalty?, self defence?. What about lying, lying for a good cause, lying for fun or playing a joke?

And an important factor that you're not considering is that 99% of people are not morally evil. They do something evil due to circumstances. Everyone is not 'Evil' 24/7, even if they are evil a lot, they can't be evil always. What if someone changes? What if someone you believe is evil, doesn't think what they're doing is evil?

Good and Evil is the most irrational thing ever.
