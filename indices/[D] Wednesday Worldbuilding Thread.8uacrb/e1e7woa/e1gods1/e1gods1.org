People start being born with their 'souls' outside their bodies. They manifest as animals, mostly mammalian or avian, and their appearance dictates how moral you are. If you're capital-g Good, your 'soul' is blue or white, and tends to be an animal more associated with Goodness (dogs, birds of prey, stags, etc). If you're capital-e Evil, your 'soul' is black or red, and has some obvious physical corruption, like fissures in their skin, or cancerous growths. Assume the moral system is just 'whatever's commonly agreed upon,' the basic societal standards.

What are the world-level ramifications of this? I've already considered some- politicians with Good 'souls' win out over Evil 'souls' almost every time, and jurors in court cases have to be blindfolded to enforce impartiality. Your thoughts?
