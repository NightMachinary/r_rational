There are a couple serious conceptual problems with absolute morality being embedded in a world like that, but most important is the question what process decides what it means to be capital-g Good? Is it a kind of average of what everyone on earth believes or is it some kind of fundamental set of ethics independent of what anyone believes?

In the former case, you run into problems with people that are ahead their times with regards to various ethical issues. In the latter case you have to think about what happens if societies view on ethics clashes with the morality that is embedded in nature.

Also, the same thing applies here that applies to HPMOR phoenixes, there are a lot of people with a vested interest in having nobody believe that soul-animal colour coincides with actual goodness, so (depending on how successful those people are) it might not be considered something you should even take into account when judging someone.
