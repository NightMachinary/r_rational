That's true, if the compulsions are permanent and free to maintain. Suppose instead that a compulsion wears off as a function of how unnatural it is to the person being compelled. Further suppose that inflicting a compulsion isn't free--it costs willpower, say, or maybe just mana.

The king's challenge is finding and keeping minions that are aligned to his goals with the minimum expenditure of will, and using half of his subjects to keep the other half in line. A king that is better liked--that is, whose goals align better with his minions--will be able to make his willpower go further. That doesn't mean the King won't enslave everyone. In that case, resistances can form of people pretending to be compelled (when in actuality their compulsions have worn off) and a group of rebels can stage a 'duel coup' to wear down the king.

Also, one can imagine a parliament where any individual member seeking too much power can be slapped down by the others. If your will isn't enough to overwhelm everyone else in the parliament, maybe it could be stable.
