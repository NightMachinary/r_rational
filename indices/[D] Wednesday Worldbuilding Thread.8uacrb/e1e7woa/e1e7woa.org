What are some political systems that are /only/ possible in the realm of speculative fiction? Some examples:

- Rule by a supreme diety
- Rule by a hivemind
- Rule by a representative who exists as the coherent extrapolated volition of the citizens
- Rule of the living by the dead
- Rule through chained geas
- Rule of the past by the future

Ultimately, some of these will devolve down to simple autocracy, democracy, or some other real-world system with some extra steps, I'm just thinking in terms of getting weird with how a society is governed.
