"Only possible" in a physical sense? There are probably also many ideas one could come up with that are unrealistic due to e.g. human nature. I guess Communism or some idealized bastardization of it or something would be an example, though we can come up with more far-fetched ideas. Rule by cultural mythical figures ("we all know what Robin Hood would do in this situation.")?

e: Maybe it would be useful to categorize these ideas into groups that are approximately isomorphic within each group?
