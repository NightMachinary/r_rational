Damn it, I keep thinking about different political systems you could write around magic rules, and then I go "No, wait, he already wrote a story about that."

In general, I'd go for exotic means of communications between citizens:

- Some people have mind-reading powers.

- People can communicate telepathically when they sleep.

- The government can rewrite people's memories, but not their beliefs.

More exotic ideas:

- Having political power makes you more charismatic and convincing (though not necessarily well-liked). Large kingdoms have a tendency to collapse because extremely powerful monarch are so convincing that their advisors are literally unable to disagree with them even when they have terrible ideas.

- The people are lead by a democracy, but in dire circumstances, they turn to dictatorship. The dictator wears the hat equivalent of the Heavenly Sword: a crown that gives them mind-related power (telepathy, telekinesis, enhanced learning), but they can't take it off and it kills them after a while.

- The people worship separate deities with conflicting ideologies, with a priest caste making most earthly decisions. The deities are well-meaning, but shortsighted and impulsive. The wisest of them are the ones who learned how to find competent, trustworthy high priests to compensate for their own shortcomings. The job of a high priest is to curb your god's excesses and counter-productive impulses (eg "I know You were gravely slighted, but we /really/ shouldn't go to war with this other country right now") while still convincing them that you're trying to serve them and advance their ideology.
