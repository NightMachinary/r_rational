In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Clover][Black Clover]] almost every human has magical abilities. The supreme ruler is the 'Wizard King', the person with the most magical might. He commands squads of knights, which are magicians of greater-than-average magical power. Who actually gets to be Wizard King would probably depend on politics more than pure skill. Also, the knights are mostly royal families with tryouts to occasionally recruit the worthy from the common folk. (Warning: the anime isn't about politics.)

What about a system where disagreements are settled by non-fatal duels, where the loser faces a magical compulsion? (I'm thinking something similar to the spellcard system in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project][Touhou]]) That would be a kind of chained geas, I suppose. The basic idea is just that if you want something, you fight--and if you want it badly enough to win many contests of will, people will help you obtain it after losing to you. The most willful becomes the ruler.
