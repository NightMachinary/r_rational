Having some weird form of fate might make any form of political decisions meaningless.

People just wait and see what's coming, going with the flow of history. Leaders are unnecessary as any conflict already has a predefined winner, and any civilizational development will happen regardless of what the humans plan for.

I guess this is similar to having a supreme deity, but more obscure.
