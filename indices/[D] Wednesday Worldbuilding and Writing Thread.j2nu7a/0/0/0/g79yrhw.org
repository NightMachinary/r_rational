I want to have a company that amongst its full dive VRMMORPG products offer an "immersive" subscription, where you play the game and also get the experience of (sort of) actually living in a fantasy world.

A certain type of people will join those servers and try to ruin the immersion of other players for their own amusement. It's like a natural law of humanity.

I want to find a way to make it plausible that such incidents are rare enough that they need not come up in the story.

I was thinking that if you get removed from the server for egregrious immersion breaking, and lose a valuable buff for casual immersion breaking, there could emerge a server wide culture that adheres to the immersion rules.

You can always go out of the game and hang out in any number of virtual environments if you want to talk sports or real world politics.
