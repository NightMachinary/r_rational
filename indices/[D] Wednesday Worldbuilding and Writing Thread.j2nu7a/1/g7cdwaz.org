WARNING: long ramble on time travel mechanics

Is there any conceivable justification for the existence of cool laboratories for your characters to explore in a setting where information can be created via closed time loops*? Assume the people/organizations funding said labs have full access to whatever time travel technology exists in this world and can send information and possibly objects and even people into the past.

It seems like the logical consequence of access to such technology would be that at long as the people/organizations were fully committed to (and financially/physically/politically/etc. capable of) funding the research, they could simply send the results back to themselves before they actually expended any of their resources to build and staff the labs.

One idea I've been considering is that the labs primarily exist to analyze data and objects received from the past, but there's no good reason not to just send the results of this analysis back into the past as well.

One possibility is that sending things through time is an inherently lossy process. Objects come out looking like they spent a decade+ exposed to the elements, information gets completely garbled. These labs act like reverse archaeologists, attempting to decipher the ruins of the future.

The problem: I need my setting to allow for at least some small number of time travelers and I don't want them to end up as mangled corpses the first time they attempt to go through time.

This means some humans need to be able to violate these time travel rules.

This means employing these humans as inter-temporal couriers would circumvent a big chunk of the limitations I just imposed.

Maybe not enough to be fatal to the concept though. They can only carry as much data as they can memorize, so unless they have a perfect photographic memory, they can't recreate an entire physics paper they observed from the future. Lets assume that only a small subset of humans can become time travelers (the rest get treated like any other information and come out a pile of mangled meat and bones), so you can't just send your best scientist to share their insights with their past self**.

Primarily, they would serve as guides, informing researchers of what paths ended up being fruitful and which appeared to be dead ends.

Maybe you'll get one or two brilliant scientists who are /also/ time-travel compatible that will go on to completely dominate their fields, but in most cases you'll need to rely on third parties. I guess couriers could specialize in different subjects though, so you could at least get a time-traveler with a PHDs in astrophysics to convey the crucial parts of your paper on black holes.

*or alternatively, information sent from alternative future branches, although I'm leaning away from branching timelines since dealing with multiple time-travelers whose paths cross multiple times in such a world is a major pain.

**Which brings us to some of the thornier metaphysical questions concerning time loops. I've been discussing the necessarily prerequisites for closed time loops as if it there were some sort of "prior" state in which the loop did not yet exist, but from the POV of any characters in such a world, the time loops would have always been there. Either your future self sends you their research (and you in turn send it back to your past self after arriving at the same point in the future) and the loop exists or they didn't and nothing you can do will create such a loop.

I guess your options here mostly boil down to:

1) A viewpoint character /can/ create a loop by interacting with their past self in a novel way, after which...

1-A) They vanish, often from the physical universe in which your story takes place, but sometimes simply as the focus of the narrative (in cases where the old timeline continues to "exist" in some sense but is no longer relevant to the main story) .

I'll also include "all their memories are overwritten, effectively making them a different person" in this category. This is the fate of most non-viewpoint characters in any time travel story in which the past can be changed. In the context of a closed time loop, this means that the version of yourself who initially triggered the loop no longer exists. This a clean solution, but while its easy enough to switch perspectives to the version of the character for whom the loop always existed, your readers are now left with a gap where this version's personal history diverged from that of the original. You could say that everything else played out in exactly the same way, which may be a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryWeasel][necessary weasel]] in many stories, but it still tends to strain my suspension of disbelief.

1-B) Their memories are updated to reflect the changes they made while also keeping their old memories intact. Often this memory retention is only partial and requires some emotional/mental catalyst to access.

This one is fine if the interactions with their past self are fairly minor (ex: highlighting a certain passage in a book), but it gets hard to wrap your mind around once self interactions become more complex. Say you have a character decide to sit down and have a conversation with their past self in a world with a single, changeable timeline. Do they suddenly remember being ~20 years younger, sitting across the table, and hearing every word they now speak the moment the word leaves their mouth? Even if the older version's memories only update after they choose to say something, certainly this younger version will now approach the conversation differently, when they find themselves in the opposite chair. Basically, its nearly impossible to depict /unstable/ time loops in fiction. It's a case of endless recursion. Stable loops work okay, but having characters arbitrarily take certain actions or say certain things for the sake of creating/maintaining a stable loop gets old quickly. Probably best to keep characters away from their past/future selves as much as possible.

1-C) They persist completely unchanged, either because they simply created a new branch in the timeline or because their memory is somehow unaffected (in which case, the world around them may still have changed).

Only really makes sense in the context of a branching timeline despite being extremely common in works of fiction featuring single timelines.

2) A viewpoint character cannot create a novel closed time loop, only complete ones that have already been (partially) observed.

It's probably simpler to just forbid time loops that violate past observations, but this requires some sort of enforcement mechanism which will often feel contrived. It's not like the observation part should actually matter. If a tree fell in a forest a decade ago, the fact that no one heard it fall shouldn't have any effect on whether it's possible to go back in time and prevent it from falling. If you can't go back and kill Hitler, you shouldn't be able to go back and kill Hitler just because you were raised in a bunker in which you were never exposed to any information about WWII.
