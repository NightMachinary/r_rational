It would depend on how you defined time travel in your universe.

Since time travel is impossible in the world as we understand it. You can kinda just pick whatever set if rules as you like them.

Theoretically you only need to make one time machine as you couls have it in place it could be in all positions in space time at once.

So if you assume time travel works by moving throught a fifth dimention which contains our three dimentions in a way we can't understand then that works.
