Hmmm. I think that it goes a little further than that; how much this type of time travel helps, depends on the problem that you're solving.

Consider for example, the following question:

I''ve multiplied two five-digit primes to get the product 625916291. What are the two primes?

Now, in order to figure this out, you're going to need to try dividing this number by various five-digit primes and seeing when you get an exact divisor. It will take... /quite/ a while, probably, because there are a lot of 5-digit primes. But, if you can use the time machine to tell yourself that one of the primes is 41041, then you can verify that (and find the other prime) a /whole/ lot more quickly and with a /whole/ lot less trouble - even though it would have taken you ages to find that without the message to yourself from the future.

So that's an example of a problem that's /easier/ to solve under this theory of time travel than without the time travel.

--------------

Now, let's consider your three groups. The first group don't even open the test books and just send back random information - they /get/ random information.

The second group attempts to validate answers and then - sends the information through whether validated or not? Then they're also going to get random information. (If they only send back the information that they have validated, then they will get mostly correct information - that doesn't mean that their information is correct, that just means that it /passed validation/, so if they make an error in the validation, then some incorrect information will slip through. It's at this point that they find prime-factorisation problems very straightforward to solve).

The third group attempts to improve the answer? Then... they'll receive information that is the best answer that /they/ can provide. That doesn't mean that what they get is the optimal solution. It just means that what they get is good enough that /they/ can think of nothing better (someone who makes the mistake of transposing a digit when verifying their long division might still send back the wrong information). But it does mean that, in an hour, they get the advantage of an answer that they might have given after /several/ hour's contemplation.

  Any character with access to time travel would never really need to come up with any solutions themselves because they would have already come up with the optimal solution over the course of countless previous iterations. If we only observe stable time loops, we only observe optimal solutions. If we choose to observe the actual work being done, we're observing time loops that have not yet stabilized and will therefore be immediately overwritten (or branch into irrelevance).

A stable time loop does not mean an optimal solution. It means that you have a solution that is good enough that, /at the end of the loop/, the time traveller /thinks/ it is optimal. A time traveller who is an idiot could easily end up with a massively suboptimal solution. A time traveller who fails to notice an important detail which is about to come back and bite them (but only /after/ they sent the info back) will also accept a suboptimal solution. And a time traveller who relies too much on notes from his future self (to the point where he's stopped questioning them) is /going/ to get burned by essentially random plans.

  I'm trying to develop a semi-coherent time travel system for a game, which means I need to take player freedom of action into account.

Ah. /This/ will make things difficult. (I thought perhaps you were thinking in terms of a book). Having players capable of pulling this sort of thing will cause you to run into problems. (Inevitably, but with a good system you can at least have fun going there...)

Hmmm. For a game, I'd suggest leaving the time-travel influences in two major categories: firstly, a player may precommit to a plan that involves (at some point) travel to the past. In this case, at the point at which the player may travel /to/, his future self can turn up. And the second category, is for purposes of foreshadowing; something along the lines of a badly injured future self appears, delivers a dire (but slightly cryptic) warning ("Don't trust... the third pikeman...") and dies in his past self's arms - that sort of thing. Someone who makes it clear that he's warning them away from a future that they do /not/ want to get to, causing the players to try to dodge it... (and /then/ once they resolve that, they have to also resolve the question of how to send a copy of this message back in time without dying in the past - perhaps using clones, or really good acting skills to fake their own death). Either way... the first option is entirely up to the players. And the second option should not be overused.
