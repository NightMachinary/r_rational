Simple solution.

You need to actually /check/ the data from the time traveller before you send it to the past. If you don't check it, but simply send it to the past exactly as you received it, then the data you get is essentially random.

So, you don't need as /large/ a lab as you would need without time travel - you only need to /verify/ the experimental results, not generate them yourself - but you would still need a lab capable of doing the verification. (And you also need to actually send back the results, so that they /can/ be verified; if you don't eventually send them back, then history will change such that you never received them in the first place).
