  Which brings us to some of the thornier metaphysical questions concerning time loops. I've been discussing the necessarily prerequisites for closed time loops as if it there were some sort of "prior" state in which the loop did not yet exist, but from the POV of any characters in such a world, the time loops would have always been there. Either your future self sends you their research (and you in turn send it back to your past self after arriving at the same point in the future) and the loop exists or they didn't and nothing you can do will create such a loop.

See the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle][Novikov self-consistency principle]]. From the perspective of all observers, anyone traveling backwards in time will not do so to change the past but because they were always going to do so, and have already done so.

Suppose you go back in time to prevent Dahlman's mother from meeting his father as a child. Now Dahlman doesn't exist and current-you has no reason to go back in time, so you don't go back, Dahlman rises to power again, and you again decide to go back. It turns into an almost infinite cycle, but it's still an unstable cycle. However, any small random variation between each iteration could eventually stabilize the cycle and create a consistent outcome. For example, maybe you decide to write your younger self a letter saying what Dahlman does if he's allowed to live and rise to power, and how you can and must prevent that from happening. From the outside of the time loop, after you've gone back in time, the only observed outcome will be the result of the stable and self-consistent time loop where Dahlman doesn't exist and you reliably prevent him from coming into existence each time you go back.
