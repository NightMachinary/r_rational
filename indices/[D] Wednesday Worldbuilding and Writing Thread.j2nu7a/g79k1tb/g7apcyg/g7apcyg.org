Overlord is a vrmmo turned Isekai, but still handles the topic of the difference between the game world and meat world interestingly in the brief mentions of the past. The meat world is a corporate dystopian hellscape with barely breathable air that everyone hates and doesn't want to be in, much less interrupt their recreation time with discussions about it. Throw in long standing cultural pressure to make a clear divide between the two worlds and all you have to do is make a vague allusion to things and let your reader's cultural osmosis of everything from Robocop to Mad Max fill in the blanks.
