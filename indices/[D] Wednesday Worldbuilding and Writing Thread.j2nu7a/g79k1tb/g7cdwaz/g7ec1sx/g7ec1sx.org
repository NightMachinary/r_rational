There's a much easier solution: You can send back research from the future with perfect fidelity as much as you want, but you still HAVE to actually do that research at some point in the future, including building labs and running experiments. Either something physically prevents you from not building or running the lab, or the moment you change your mind about building the lab the information that was sent back and anything that relies on it stops working/is destroyed.

For how time travel works in general; my favorite by far is that there can never be two timelines interacting, they all seem like they internally consistent only closed loops allowed model, you cannot change the future. But the way the universe does this is equivalent to the algorithm where you list every potential timeline, as a sequence of snapshots of possible configurations in a random order, then you remove the ones that are inconsistent or break the laws of physics or are inconsistent from the list, and those were never real. So you're enforcing ALL laws of physics in the culling stage, checking if a data structure is a valid solution to the question, and there is no chronological element or any special rules for laws related to time travel.
