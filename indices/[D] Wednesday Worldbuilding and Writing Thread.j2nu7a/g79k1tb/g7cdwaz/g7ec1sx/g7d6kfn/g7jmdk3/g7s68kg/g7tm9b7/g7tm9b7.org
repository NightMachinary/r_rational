So, basically you can still get credit on answers you got from the back of the book as long as you're capable of showing the work necessary to reach them?

Suppose you set up an experiment in which you have thousands of people tasked with completing standardized tests and sending whatever answers they get back in time to themselves. If we assume that it's guaranteed that they'll be able to send the information back (ex: only people who have already sent the answers back are selected to move on the the actual experiment), all of them should be presented with the answers their future self got as soon as they start the test.

Now you designate one group to simply sit there for an hour and then sends the same information back, another to attempt to validate the answers for an hour and then send the exact same information back, and finally, one to send an improved version of the answers back (not only should they have more time to devote to the harder problems, they should also be able to catch many of the mistakes their future self made).

If the model you are proposing holds for this world, the first group should end up with answers that are essentially random (I find this outcome kind of unintuitive, it feels like it would make more sense to just not send anything back). The second should end up with results comparable to what they would be able to accomplish in normal circumstances (making these loops practically useless), and (assuming iterative loops are permitted) the third's results should be comparable to what they could accomplish if they had virtually unlimited time (and no issues with fatigue, since each iteration is passing the baton after an hour).

If iterative loops are permitted by the universe, utilizing them should be the norm in just about every field (with the resources necessary to create them). All creative/intellectual output should be optimal given the initial parameters.

This is kind of hard to write though. Any character with access to time travel would never really need to come up with any solutions themselves because they would have already come up with the optimal solution over the course of countless previous iterations. If we only observe stable time loops, we only observe optimal solutions. If we choose to observe the actual work being done, we're observing time loops that have not yet stabilized and will therefore be immediately overwritten (or branch into irrelevance).

set of instructions handed to them.

My main issue is one of perspective. I'm trying to develop a semi-coherent time travel system for a game, which means I need to take player freedom of action into account. I want to allow the player to jump back in time and make different decisions (AKA: save states), but this definitely isn't compatible with a single unchanging timeline since it has alternative timelines influencing the past. Branching timelines would be the easy answer, but

Every loop I introduce and force the player to complete is going to take away their autonomy. There are a limited number of ways by which a player can set up their own loops (such as summoning a future version of themselves to help them by making a strong precommitment and then immedatley going back in time to become this future version).
