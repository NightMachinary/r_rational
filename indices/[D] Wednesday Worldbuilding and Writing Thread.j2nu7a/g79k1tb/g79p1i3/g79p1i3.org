It seems like you're trying to go for the carrot over the stick, but this ends up being the stick anyway. Losing a 20% all-around buff that takes three weeks to get back is severe. Players wouldn't see it as a bonus, but a standard thing to have that can be taken away if they screw up. And players are going to screw up, you can't expect perfect role-play from anyone. Groups having to cancel raid night because your healer accidently talked to their friend about a new movie sounds awful. More importantly, living in constant fear of screwing up and calling down the wrath of the AI doesn't sound fun, even with a community that signed up for hardcore immersion.

That's not quite a deal breaker if the server and the community in it are extremely serious about immersion. But I think there's a way to do it that would ruffle less feathers. I would have breaking character put some kind of nasty debuff on you that only lasts for a very short time, maybe a minute (severity of the debuff and duration can increase or decrease based on severity). If you do it again relatively close to the first infraction, the debuff duration and severity grows exponentially for every infraction until the AI just kicks you.

If you do it that way, minor infractions can just be a slap on the wrist and a reminder that players need to take immersion seriously. Players can mess up and break character, take their lumps and move on. A player who constantly triggers that reaction but ducks the threshold for a perma-ban gets a reputation for it and would find themselves having a hard time getting into serious parties.
