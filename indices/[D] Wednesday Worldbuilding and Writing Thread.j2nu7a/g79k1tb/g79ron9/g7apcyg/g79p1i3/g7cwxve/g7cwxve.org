If you break character for X seconds, you're mute and inactive for the next X seconds. (Your avatar looks confused/dizzy.)

Simple, inconvenient, and proportional. That's how you want a penalty to be.

You can multiply the freeze time for people who break character repeatedly. But as long as the AI can spot OOC on the fly, the "freeze" will be enough to stop any ongoing conversation that's OOC.

People who want OOC will find even a mild penalty enough to go to a non-immersive server.

What matters isn't the size of the penalty, but its speed and consistency in application. If your AI is good enough for real-time intervention you shouldn't need more than a nuisance penalty to push OOC players to another server.
