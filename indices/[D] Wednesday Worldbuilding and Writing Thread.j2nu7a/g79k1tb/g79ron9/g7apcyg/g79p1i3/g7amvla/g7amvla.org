Adding to this, I'd make the debuf be something like Stark Raving mad, causing the character to move randomly, do humiliating things, and babble nonsense syllables.

I'd also set up some combination of prediction and variable delay, couple with the debuf having an ambiguous startup period, in order to be able to have the AI cut to it a few seconds or so /before/ the actual offense, and decide in a sneaky retroactive way if it was an actual offense or not, in a plausibly deniable way.

Finally, I'd give players an option they can flip between at will, that delays their speech further, and lets the AI do slight rewordings and replace isolated non-immersive terms. With this switch on you have to worry a lot less about accidental slip ups, but obviously the delay on communications is not acceptable in fast paced combat situations, and some would have highly specific ideas for how their character talks or issues with free speech/will, so it'd need to be an option.
