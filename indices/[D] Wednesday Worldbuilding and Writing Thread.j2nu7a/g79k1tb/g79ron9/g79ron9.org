Having an accepted social convention for switching into out of character works in real life. Like MMO RP servers with a /ooc command, or covering your name tag when LARPing. It's a combination of having a social pressure to demonstrate that you fit in, with an actual release valve for doing the thing you want to do (because people do want to talk out of character sometimes).

Not sure what your actual goal is, but you might be able to achieve it with special effects on the /ooc command. Like you only ever talk out of character inside a Cone Of Silence spell.
