In a fantasy VRMMO how do you motivate players to stay in character? Not necessarily play a specific role but at least not do blatantly non-fantasy things like discussing the latest action movie or arguing about sports teams.

- The goal is to sell subscription to an "immersive" game mode, where the target audience wants to experience life in a decently realistic fantasy world while they beat dungeons and farm monsters for epic loot.\\
- There are weak AI systems available that can understand human speech almost as good as a human.
- Players can earn money playing the game, potentially even make a living.

My idea is that every day you "stay in character" as determined by a weak AI watcher you get a 1% bonus to all your actions, applied after all other modifications. Damage, quality of crafted items, movement speed, almost everything. This bonus caps at +20%.

Going "out of character" resets your bonus to 0% and you have to stay in character for 20 days to reach +20% again.

This makes having full bonus necessary to compete in almost any area.

Obviously malicious or repeated offenses results in your character being permanently transferred to a non-immersion PvP server, and you are permanently banned from immersive servers.

Would this be enough?
