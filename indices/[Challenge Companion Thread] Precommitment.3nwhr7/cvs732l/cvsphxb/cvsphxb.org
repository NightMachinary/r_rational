Precommitment doesn't unfavorably limit your options, it unfavorably limits the /outcomes/ to your options.

Here's the payoff matrix for a game of chicken:

|          | Swerve | Straight |
|----------+--------+----------|
| Swerve   | 0,0    | -1,+1    |
| Straight | +1,-1  | -10,-10  |

Here's what it looks like if only one driver has removed his ability to swerve:

|          | Straight |
|----------+----------|
| Swerve   | -1,+1    |
| Straight | -10,-10  |

The player's only rational course of action is to swerve, but his /options/ have not actually been limited (and in fact those options remain exactly the same).

I should also point out that in many cases, precommitment is just about credibility. The game of chicken is all about credibility, as is nuclear brinksmanship, as is making a New Year's resolution.

If you say "I vow that I will defect if you precommit" then I don't find your vow to be particularly credible, so I'll throw my steering wheel out the window, which means that you are faced with the choice of either crashing into my car and dying, or suffering from a reputational hit from losing and suffering whatever the consequences might be from breaking your vow. Given that choice, I believe you'll break your vow, because I don't think your vow will credibly stop you in the face of certain death. Your vow doesn't seem much stronger than simply saying "I'm totes not going to swerve", which is exactly what you'd say if you were going to swerve.

What you /really/ need to do is something like hiring an assassin who will murder you and your family if you ever don't defect against someone who has used a precommitment strategy. So long as I find /that/ credible, I might believe that you would defect even in the face of changed incentives from /my/ precommitment, because the payoff for you would be:

|          | Straight |
|----------+----------|
| Swerve   | -51,+1   |
| Straight | -10,-10  |

Because if you swerve, you not only take the reputational hit and the loss of credibility for future coordination problems, but also you (and your family) still die.
