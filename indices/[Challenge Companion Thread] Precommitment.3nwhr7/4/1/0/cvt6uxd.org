  Precommitment doesn't unfavorably limit your options, it unfavorably limits the outcomes to your options.

Sure. And holding a gun to your head doesn't force you to do anything, the person is just asking you to choose between doing what they ask vs taking a bullet to the skull. ;)

  Your vow doesn't seem much stronger than simply saying "I'm totes not going to swerve", which is exactly what you'd say if you were going to swerve.

Ahh, but that is the magic! I have used this sort of vow many times, with 100% success rate, and to much benefit. By breaking this vow at any time, I lose the ability to use it as a precommitment device in the future, forfeiting all future utility gained by its use, which I estimate to be quite substantial.

Granted, the disutility of death is quite a bit more than that. So no, it would not work in the "throw out steering wheel" case. But it would work for many lesser forms!
