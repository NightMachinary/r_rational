Precommitting is often a good strategy where privacy is involved. If you will always respond the same way regardless of how your privacy is being trespassed, nobody can infer from your protectiveness whether or not there actually is something there this time. China is thought to do this- they keep lots of places undisclosed so would-be spies have a harder time telling which ones actually hide secrets. I am not okay with people looking through my drawers, looking on any devices I own, or generally invading my privacy without my explicit consent, even if 99% of the time I have nothing to hide there.
