Does anyone else feel that the rational/lesswrong community use exactly the opposite meaning for precommitment?

With Parfit's Hitchiker, Schelling would precommit to payment by, say, having Ekman tie him up, in order to force him to pay when they get there.

A lesswrongian would just say "I precommit to paying you."

Alternatively a LWian might have said this just before they passed out, just in case a selfish mindreader chances on them before they die.
