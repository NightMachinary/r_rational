How could this be made into horror? I'm thinking about some kind of story where making precommitments actually tweaks your utility function to prioritize that precommitment. Someone accidentally precommits recursively, and as they fulfill their precommitments, the situations and states of mind they find themselves in make them more likely to make further precommitments - until their entire life is devoted to fulfilling them.

No one notices.
