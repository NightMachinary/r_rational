Chicken is not a game anyone rational wants to play in the first place. The standard analysis relies heavily on symmetry, non-repetition, both players knowing the exact payoff matrix in advance, knowing the other player knows, and knowing neither of them can change the game.

The rational response is usually something like "Dude, let's just flip a coin and then go have burgers."

I always thought the "throw away the steering wheel" ploy was funny, because what would really happen is that guy would crash regardless--because he's now in a high speed car that he can no longer steer 8-)
