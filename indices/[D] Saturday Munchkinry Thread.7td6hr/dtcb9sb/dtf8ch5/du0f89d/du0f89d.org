This response only just got into my inbox even though it's like two weeks old, but I just love the image of this 1500 year old vampire flying a plane.

Unfortunately, it's kind of a non-starter IMO: the vampire in question did not really have the time or inclination to learn how to pilot a plane before this, and a hospital ship is going to be less of a target.

I'll think about it though. You've made me realise that the vampire is probably going to /want/ to learn how to fly a plane after this since he's realised it would be a very useful skill.
