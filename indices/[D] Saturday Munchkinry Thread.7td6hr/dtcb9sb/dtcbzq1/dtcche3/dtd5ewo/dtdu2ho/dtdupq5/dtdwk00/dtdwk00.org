For that to work as an explanation it requires that any such "magicsphere" extend all the way to the moon, [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Earth-Moon.png?r=2][which would seem a bit excessive]]. Plus it obviously assumes that travelling just marginally farther through that field (depending on the configuration) is going to negate the harmful effects of the sun.

Much simpler would be to assume that the moon has its own intrinsic magic properties which cancel out those of the sun in the light that hits it. After all such a magic field must exist anyway given werewolves exist in this setting.
