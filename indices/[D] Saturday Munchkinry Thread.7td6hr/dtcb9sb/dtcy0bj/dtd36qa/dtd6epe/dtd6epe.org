UFAI?

I'm failing to see what bandages are supposed to do that a box or a coffin(for thematics) within a box wouldn't do. If people board your ship they can easily remove bandages. If your box is hit with a torpedo, chances are the bandages will tear.

I hold my position that you would want to be able to leave the box at night. With enhanced senses, strength and speed you are the sole defence against torpedos.

Also, if the ship sinks one backup plan could be to simply drag the box by night underwater and hide in it by day. Or you could just ditch the box and dig deep enough into the ground for protection from the sun.

Edit:

I just saw that the boat trip was only supposed to take 10+ hours. Why not just travel at night and use your superhuman strength to push the boat faster.
