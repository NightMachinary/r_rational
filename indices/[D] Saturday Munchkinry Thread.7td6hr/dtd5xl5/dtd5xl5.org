You have been offered Power by the muse of genre TV. You can pick any power-set that would be narratively coherent for the main character of a genre show. You cant pick an existing one - you have to make one up, but it needs to be something someone would actually make 6 seasons and a movie for.

Limits:

a: "Cost of SFX": If your powerset would be expensive to film, you cant use it very much. Minutes a week.

b: "Too OP, nerf": If your powers dissolve plots you will find they mysteriously malfunction every other week.

Plot: No matter what you do, you will get in trouble every tuesday. This is not the muse creating trouble, she is merely steering you into trouble that already exists. - If there is a human trafficking ring within 300 miles of you, /you will/ get kidnapped by them sooner rather than later. Pick a vacation spot, you will by coincidence happen upon a nefarious plot to launder cartel money.

Random boons :

"I can totally afford this loft on a PI salary". Economics can go take a hike - you cant throw money at plot to make it go away, but on the other hand, your bank account mysteriously always has enough cash in it for a nice place, a fast car and eating out every evening.

"Everyone on TV is attractive". What is says on the tin. You gain fitness without ever working out, your hair is always stylish, or roguishly messy in a way other people have to pay 200 dollars at the barber for.

What powers do you pick to survive this? And no, you cant say no. That just gets you plot without powers.
