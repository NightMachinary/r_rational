Unfriendly AI. If that doesn't make you nod and go "of course", you have some fun reading ahead of you:

  If your box is hit with a torpedo, chances are the bandages will tear.
#+end_quote

I don't think layers and layers of bandages will tear; a box is rigid and can break easily, bandages not so much. Imagine a genie levitates the ship high up in the sky and then drops it on a hard surface; the ship would be matchsticks, the box would be broken to kindling, but the bandages would probably be intact (they're a foot thick). I think a box alone isn't prudent enough and bandages are easy to come by.

  I hold my position that you would want to be able to leave the box at night. With enhanced senses, strength and speed you are the sole defence against torpedos.

Absolutely; you'd redo the process each evening and rip yourself out of the bandages / box each sunset.

  I just saw that the boat trip was only supposed to take 10+ hours. Why not just travel at night and use your superhuman strength to push the boat faster.

True; I just looked up the hours of night at the time of year in question and we're talking just under 11 hours which is not too shabby. The problem is that in the particular story I'm writing, the vampire and his entourage arrive at the port with only a few hours until sunrise, and the port (Civitavecchia) doesn't have the best amenities for vampires because it had previously been the target of heavy bombardment (no longer, so it is safe to be there for the time being). But then I get down into the specifics of my universe and it stops being a "you're a vampire: how do you protect yourself when you need to travel during daytime" and more of a "what would you do in this specific situation that you don't have all the details of and that the OP is going to constantly rules lawyer you about", which is no fun.
