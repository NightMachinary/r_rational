Much like UFAI, the first step is always "take over the world, then nothing else can stop you". I love it.

Good point on the box opening from the inside. I might rewrite the passage so the vampire doesn't get wrapped in bandages; but I feel like the threat of the box being breached outweighs the thought of the box being locked from the inside. (My plan was always for him to get out of the box by breaking out of it with super strength, though, so simply closing it with a padlock and then throwing away the key would be good enough).
