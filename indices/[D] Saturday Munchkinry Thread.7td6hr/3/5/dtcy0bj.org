There's a few solutions that comes to mind which depends on the specifics of my powers and on the circumstances surrounding this whole thing.

Stealth w/ humans: You and the two humans find some small ship to travel with. You stay on ship during nighttime since your superspeed and strength are your only defence against incomming torpedos. At night you go to sleep in a reinforced box that is only intended to be opened from the inside.

Less stealthy v.1: In addition to the above you dominate the crews on a number of lesser ships to tag along and act as shields for torpedoes.

Less stealthy v.2: You find the biggest, baddest warship and dominate the captain to direct their course past whichever island you wanted to go to, and proceed to jump ship when you're close.

Less stealthy v.3: Not satisfied with the a mere battleship you decide to undertake a mission to dominate all of the worldleaders. Now you are sure nobody will torpedo you. And you get a fresh supply of blood as a bonus.
