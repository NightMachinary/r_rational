Based on responses to other posts, flying at night above the flight ceilings of other aircraft seems a good bet. Not many planes from WWII had pressurized cabins, and human pilots don't stay awake (hypoxia) above 39,000 ft otherwise, but that shouldn't be a problem for a vampire who can cross moving water and doesn't need to breath. I think the other two can be sleeping and put on oxygen. My brief research using the usual lazy scholarship suspects tells me you should look up the Westland Welkin for performance specs like altitude, range, and speed. I imagine the vampire connections can make that rare plane available, but the basic concepts remain regardless - you could sub in a prototype of something similar. The dicey part would be the welcome received on the descent. Enemy aircraft? AA guns? Cover of night should help, but the trio might keep a paratrooper mindset as a backup approach.
