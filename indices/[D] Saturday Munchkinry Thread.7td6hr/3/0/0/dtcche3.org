It's a scene from my romance novel, but I didn't want to bog down peoples' responses by requiring them to assume the ten thousand things that my urban fantasy universe requires, I was more interested in peoples' general takes on the question since I found the idea of wrapping a vampire in bandages to go on a boat trip kinda funny :)

The following clarifications to the scenario can be ignored to people who just want to respond to the OP; or people can make their own clarifications.

#+begin_quote
  can you survive the light of the Moon
#+end_quote

Yes, you can; not sure how the physics works to make diffuse sunlight unsurvivable but moonlight not, but let's not get into that.

#+begin_quote
  a hospital ship ... seems expensive. Do you have a lot of money
#+end_quote

You have plenty of money, but the ship was obtained through vampire connections and /should/ have gone to the war effort but didn't

#+begin_quote
  Are you trying to avoid being torpedoed?
#+end_quote

Yes, you're travelling with humans, and they don't tend to do too well with torpedoes.

#+begin_quote
  why do you need to get the humans across the Mediterranean
#+end_quote

One human is the MacGuffin; the other human is a highly-effective gun-toting bit of muscle who is coming along for bodyguard purposes, though the MacGuffin has military training

#+begin_quote
  So clearly you need to go with them. Why?
#+end_quote

The MacGuffin is flighty and unpredictable and trusts you, so you need to be around them.

#+begin_quote
  In addition in the worst case scenario of your plan the humans die which constitutes a fail of the objective and has unknown consequences I don't think you should take it so lightly
#+end_quote

Agreed; the MacGuffin is a benefit to you, but losing the MacGuffin puts you more or less back where you started. So losing the MacGuffin means you failed your mission but with no additional negative consequences.
