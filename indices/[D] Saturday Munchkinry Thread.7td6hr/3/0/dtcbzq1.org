1:Given you have explicitly stated that reflected sunlight will kill you and that given instant seems pretty absolute, can you survive the light of the Moon? 2: How many resources do you have? I mean, a hospital ship in WW11 when most ships go to the war effort seems expensive. Do you have a lot of money? Are you trying to avoid being torpedoed? 3: why do you need to get the humans across the Mediterranean? Are you running from someone? In which case you might want to consider hiding and commandeering a hospital ship in the middle of WW11 is probably not stealthy. Are only the humans running? You could just send them on alone in that case and they would be harder to find. So clearly you need to go with them. Why? Are you searching for a magical artifact that vampires can't touch but that you know the location of. Details please. In addition in the worst case scenario of your plan the humans die which constitutes a fail of the objective and has unknown consequences I don't think you should take it so lightly
