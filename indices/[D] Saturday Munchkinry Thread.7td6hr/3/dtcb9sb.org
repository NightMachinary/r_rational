You are a vampire: you are vulnerable to sunlight (it kills you instantly) and are completely unconscious when the sun is up. This includes reflected and diffuse sunlight. You have super strength, speed, etc. You don't need to breathe. Your other vulnerabilities include silver and fire.

You have to travel across the mediterranean, and you need to take two ordinary humans with you. How do you do it?

Oh, and it's WW2 so you don't have access to modern technology and there's a small risk any boat you take will be torpedoed.

I worked out that a boat trip is going to take 10 hours+, so I figured use a fake hospital ship. My first idea was you have some humans wrap you in thick layers of bandages, wrap the Vampire-Burrito in a thick sheet of fabric, put you in a box, cover the box in fabric, and keep the box in a dark hold of the ship with an armed guard. Worst case scenario and the boat sinks (without you dying instantly: this plan is vulnerable to that), you sink to the bottom of the ocean, and you'll wake up when the sun sets and be able to break out of your coffin/burrito and get back to the surface.
