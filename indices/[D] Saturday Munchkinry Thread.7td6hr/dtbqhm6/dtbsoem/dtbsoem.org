Wish for the same thing three times, the reversed one cancels one of the normal ones (if you've designed them properly) and one of the normal ones survive. You now get one normal wish (with some restrictions):

1. Come up with one single wish that is designed to be

a) finite and stackable, something like "1 trillion dollars" or "+1,000,000 years to your or every human's standard lifespan", or "the probability of cancer occurring to each cell is multiplied by 0.000000001%" Avoid absolutes like "cancer never occurs" I don't know what would happen when you reverse that, and the math in step 2 won't necessarily work out. But if you use some ridiculously large or tiny numbers using mathematical notation you can make things effectively infinite or zero, which should be just as good.

b) Incorruptible. Use standard genie defense techniques, word everything carefully, depending on how literal this genie is. Maybe instead of wishing for money, which might hyper-inflate the economy, ask for some sort of goods that can be sold and add value to the economy.

2 . Wish for the same thing three times. So long as the reversing stacks mathematically and does cancel one of the others, you now have a normal wish that successfully got through.
