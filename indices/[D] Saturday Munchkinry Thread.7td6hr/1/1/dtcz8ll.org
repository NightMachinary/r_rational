You have two main objectives.

One, you need people to recognize your true prophet from false ones. Presumably when you say 'void' this includes space, so you would simply move the stars to spell their name. Depending what you can do with souls, then it might be in your interest to boost your prophet in whichever way you can, of course with the threat of taking their power away if they misbehave.

If that doesn't work you feed your prophet a bunch of information he couldn't possibly have, such as historical knowledge that can be verified. If THAT doesn't work you'll have to start a new religion, starting by having your prophet recruit from vulnerable people, such as people who recently lost a loved one or who are having an existential crisis.

Two, you want to increase the number of prophets. Through your now recognized prophet you change your religion, such that it has 'that certain mindset' and 'seeking guidance from the divine' as the foremost virtues. Further you establish a weekly school session in which your prophet +indoctrinates+ teaches the younger crowd how to exhibit those two virtues.

Once you have found the right way of cultivating that particular mindset everything afterwards will be childs play. You want at least three prophets per generation. If anyone are threatening your religion you can just destroy them with the most recent technology, which you prophets know because you know.

If you're having trouble communicating specific technical things to your prophets you send them off to grad school with the money they earn from the lottery/stocks/who wants to be a bilionnaire.
