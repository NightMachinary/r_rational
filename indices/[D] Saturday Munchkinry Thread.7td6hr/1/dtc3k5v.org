You are a god. Your power is unchallengeable, your might undefeatable. Well it was. You are a god of the void. Before you created the world, you were omnipotent, but now ... well there is much you are incapable of without destroying the universe. In fact you possess power mostly over the soul within your creation as it bears the touch of the void to permit creativity. You are still all knowing about basic details about the universe but free will prevents you from knowing everything. Through you have a pretty good guess. Your powers permit you to link you anyone who requests help from a outside entity, especially you. This link lets you grant inner strength and guilt their conscience. However you cannot pass on knowledge as the link is too imprecise. Someone could potentially have you guide their hand and then apply statistical analysis to the results but that's not really very practical. As a extension of this, You can freely talk to designated prophets who require a strong desire to receive guidance and a certain mindset. they come along every few generations and while you may not talk to them, you can't just randomly choose anyone. This is merely talking to the prophet and you cannot control them. You may instruct them to write you a holy book but for instance you cannot tell them to write down the equations for a theory of everything as it would require to many mathematical symbols and even writing that down would be beyond a lay persons grasp. Unless they are a physicist. Specifically to a prophet you may pass any information that would be understandable by the prophet. You can also decide where soul go after death. Now under these constraints how would you become worshiped by people worldwide and help people thrive. Note: This was conceived of by considering the solution to the problem of evil that God is not omnipotent. The thing is it's possible to have a being worthy of being a god who is far from omnipotent . Further Note: Human beings make things up. Other religions do exist, but have no basis in truth. You may answer prayers from followers of other religions but it will make it hard to get worshiped. Further Further Note: Your holy book can be corrupted and you can do nothing except tell a prophet to fix it.

Edit Simplified version with no story details

You are God

You created the universe

You wish to be worshiped by and help the people of the universe

You possess the following basic powers:

1: You possess knowledge of all the facts of creation but free will can still trip you up ie If someone plots a murder, you know but whether they will go through with it is only a guess.

2: You may answer prayers of any religion by granting inner strength or guiding the hand of the individual praying to you. This cannot pass knowledge on, except maybe by statistical analysis.

3: A prophet comes along every few generations and you may freely talk to them. You may pass any information you wish onto them, but if it's beyond their understanding, it will not mean anything. For instance, to write down the theory of everything it beyond the average person as its written in the language of very complicated maths.

Other religions exist but are made up by humans with no basis in fact

Your holy book can be corrupted. The only thing you can do about this is send a prophet to correct it.

Does that fix your complain. I have never used paragraphs particularly well
