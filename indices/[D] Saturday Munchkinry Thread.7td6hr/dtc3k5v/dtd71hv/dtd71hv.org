How does "free will " exatly work? Like to what extent knowing how the brain of a person works allows you to more or less know what they will do.

Like I'm not sure if there is a coherent way to do free will that's not people randomly doing things sometimes, or having a true rng in their brain that doesnt normally affect things munch but make things a bit unpredictable(but household still be able to predict most of someone's actions ,or otherwise people and society would work really differently.

But anyway you should tell your profets what you can do and what you want from humanity, no need to be deceitful or ambiguous about it, and encourage studying math and science,and to teach this kind of thing to everyone, and give them some ay of recognizing new profets(there are multiple ways to do this like giving them an encrypted message that can be decripted by a public key, and a lot of posible verification methods, you just need to find one that people can easily verify ), also there are lots of ways of protecting your messages to becoming corrupted .

You will start teaching profets progressively more complex math and science , and If you can comunicate it directly you can just send them as signals of certain concepts that are decoded as the message in some code, I'm not sure how the can't send things they won't understand rule actually works . Also you can use the code thing to send messages to people that pray to you , by sending them feedback in intervals when they pray, in a way you said to your prophet.

You can shape the beliefs of your people by encouraging the ones you approve of during prayer . Also give people an easy and short method of prayer that is easily done multiple times to maximize bandwidth . Instructions on how to get to the frame of mind to become a prophet and how to recognize one will be in all your messages. Prophets should be able to get a lot of money and Influence thanks to you which should help the cause , and of their ability of convincing people. Once people have enough tech and math you can instruct them to create better systems of transmission and verification of messages from you , especially with the help of computers.
