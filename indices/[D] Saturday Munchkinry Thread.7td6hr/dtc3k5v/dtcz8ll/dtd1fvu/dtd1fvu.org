Correction to a point you seem to have misunderstood.

The Void is specifically the void outside universes. It is in no way related to the void of space. That was merely a poetic reason that you could create a entire universe but cannot lift a pebble. Souls are in this case linked to the void due to the chaos free will brings. The void was based off earlier ideas I had where outside all universes is void. The void could have been anything, wanted to be everything and was thus nothing. The principle is that any conceivable system of laws require statistical tendency. In fact, that is all laws are. The void was before this and was thus capable of anything but required direction. The universes are pockets of statistical tendency. They tend to be based off the rubble of previous universes, inheriting laws, and so on. Magic, which isn't present in this universe, is basically the Gods attempting to kick-start evolution of universes by creating systems of laws that are based off differing principles and more fuzzy This has lead to things such as cannibal universes that eat the laws of physics of other universes to survive. But in any case you can manipulate the void so you may make anything you wish but once it is set you can't interfere except though cheats like souls. And now that I think of it maybe quantum mechanics. Secondly you can only grant them powers that count as granting inner strength or guiding their hand. This would include things that are basically a stronger version of the placebo effect. If that can't do it at least a little, you can't do it at all. i.e encourage study, help them get over cold, be more confidence, believe in their own abilities, things like that. Basically, your power abuses the chaos that free will brings to guide things in the direction you wish, but due to free will they have to reach out to you and you can only influence things that free will can influence.

I hope this clears things up
