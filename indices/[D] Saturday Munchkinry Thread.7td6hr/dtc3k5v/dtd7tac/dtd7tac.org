This question contradicts itself in some confusing ways ("you may not talk to them" / "you may freely talk to them"), makes statements that don't seem sensible ("you cannot pass on knowledge as the link is too imprecise") and leaves some things unexplained (how smart and how parallel is God). This makes it answer.

I would be surprised if the answer doesn't just amount to "bootstrap AGI and tile the universe".
