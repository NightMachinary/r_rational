My first thought is to go for the ability to see twenty-four hours into the future, but in such a way that the vision can be changed - that is, the ability shows me what would have happened had I not used the ability. Dead easy SFX cost, and I get forewarning about disaster(s).

The second power I'd ask for is the ability to see what people are thinking - in effect, read-only psychic powers, which only work either when I want them two or when Plot needs them to work. Again, easy on the SFX, and tends to lead to more Plot rather than less.

Between them, these powers will tend to give me useful information about what's going on - so I can make informed decisions about how to handle my Tuesday Troubles.

I also intend to keep the local police on speed-dial, and make sure that there is at least one person who will call for a rescue for me if I don't check in every two or three hours on a Tuesday. This won't dissolve plots /entirely/, but it will help me avoid certain uncomfortable situations.
