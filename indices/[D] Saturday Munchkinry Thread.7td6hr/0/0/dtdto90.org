The easy answer here would seem to be to pick a power that wouldn't be OP for a character on genre TV to have because they would use it in a really stupid way or have moral compunctions about fully utilizing it.

The most obvious example of this then would be high end psychic powers, since they are absurdly versatile and their full mind control abilities basically never get used by heroes with them. So since the muse only steers you into /preexisting/ conflicts, you can "win" by just taking control of the world and creating a utopia. Plus even if the powers "OP rating" is based on how you use them /rather/ than how most protagonists would use them. You can still win by taking control of the world (and rewriting people's minds so they are loyal even without direct mind control) within a week.

Another obvious exploit would be something like AGI, absurdly advanced nanotech or genetics tech. All of those could easily gain cement control of the world within a week. Of course Veedrac already mentioned FAI but I would obviously point out that there's nothing in the actual original comment to indicate that would fail, you need to make a lot of assumptions beyond what in that comment to get the kinds of results talked about in the rest of that comment chain.

I would also point out preemptively that creating FAI is not really beyond the realm of a genre TV character (friendly human level AI is super common therein) all you need to do from there is get the FAI to use it's super fast genius mind to do recursive self improvement.
