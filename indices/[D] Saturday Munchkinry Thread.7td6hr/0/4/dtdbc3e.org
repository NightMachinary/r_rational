the power to grant powers to others. The amount of powers to give is only limited by the amount of drawbacks also given. The person who receives the powers has to consider the drawback to be at least half as bad for themselves as they like the power. They cannot change their mindset so they dont care about the drawbacks or the power s without loosing the powers.

now I grant people I trust powers that will keep me and others alive and well. powers like healing, rejuvenation, resurrection,clairvoyance. And occasionally give other people powers that I would consider useful. Occasionally people with powers would turn on me or others, and maybe become long time opponents I have to face for an entire year. And my allies could ensure that there is no collateral damage I would have to feel guilty for.
