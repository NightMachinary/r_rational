Sometimes the problem with a serial installment is fitting in everything you need to have happen before the next good stopping point--this one is /long/. Some old references from Fall; readers might have a bit of apprehension about Speedtest, and we get to see how bad Flicker's morning wake up routine used to be. I may write a pulp style story about Luce Cannon and Belle Tinker sometime, the characters are too good to just leave as history. Belle Tinker's inventions are best visualized as being drawn by Jack Kirby.
