Indeed. Without getting too spoilery, I'll note that the most consistent way to read the current serialized version of what Flicker tells Doc in Call is 'Story told to parent that is consistent with the facts he knows'. On the other hand, 'Princess' is /not/ a romance in the genre sense, it's a Bildungsroman with a touch of mirrors for princes. This is important for reader expectations.
