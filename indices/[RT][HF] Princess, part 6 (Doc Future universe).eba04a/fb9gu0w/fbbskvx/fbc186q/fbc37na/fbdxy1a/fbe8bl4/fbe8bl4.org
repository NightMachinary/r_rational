There is more to come, and I already plan to edit Call for the book version. Unfortunately, progressive changes in the Tumblr editor make it very risky for me to make changes in individual chapters that are more than a few years old (and reposting the whole chapter has a problem with breaking the links from the previous and next chapters, which would also have to be edited...)
