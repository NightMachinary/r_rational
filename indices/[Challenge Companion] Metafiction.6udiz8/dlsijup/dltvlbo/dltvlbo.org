I actually do have a rational metafiction in my drafts folder. A conflict between a character and an author works as well as any story with defined stakes and objectives. The most important part is to establish "fic physics" that the reader can rely on to prevent the story from becoming unintelligible. In that world, Language Composition is as big and powerful as the petroleum industry of ours, and Hollywood is like a military industrial complex.

And even without free will you can still beat omnipotent/omnisciencent opponents if you can get things like truly random number generators or subconscious patterns in the prose.
