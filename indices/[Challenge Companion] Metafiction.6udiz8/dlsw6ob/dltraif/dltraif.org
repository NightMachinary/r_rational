  Westworld has inspired me to look at this idea from a different angle. I'm picturing a world where people pay for a virtual reality experience curated as they play. It'd be kind of like hiring Dungeon Masters to build the setting and story for the players to escape into. Everyone knows it's fiction, but roleplay because it's escapist fun and are willing to pay for it.

I think that's an interesting idea, but you then have to weave some kind of meta-narrative into it. The player knows that things are fake and created by the DM, so you have to have an A-story (which is the actual plot of the game) and the B-story (which is a level up and about the player and (possibly) the DM).

Also, my entry for the Sherlock Holmes challenge, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8726119][A Holmes Away From Home]] is right in that wheelhouse.
