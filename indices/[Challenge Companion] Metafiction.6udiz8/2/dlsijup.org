Regarding your question, I think Stephen King's The Dark Tower might be an interesting example. [[#s][General discussion of the Dark Tower, no specific plot spoilers]]

To me, the most interesting part of a /rational/ metafiction, in particular, is the question of how the metafictional aspects of the setting are discovered. Of course, there's the simple answer that if reality is observed to follow trope logic instead of whatever system was assumed to be true, the metafictional explanation is more reasonable. Still, I can't seem to write that in a way that convinces myself. In my three submissions, I've glossed over the discovery in one, not mentioned it in another, and implemented it magically in the third. I'm currently trying to write a fourth one with a more serious approach to that process of discovery, but everything I try seems like irrationalfiction. (I'd be interested in reading recommendations in which that problem is solved in a satisfactory manner, especially short ones.)

With that problem solved, other questions become relevant. If you know that you are in a story, what do you accomplish with that fact? As soon as you identify a trope, the author, who has access to your stream of thought, will most likely have written that thought into the story. Therefore, he might now subvert it, and you can't actually make any reliable predictions anymore. While a battle between the character and the author might be an interesting concept, even assuming free will, the character is massively outclassed. He would have to twist every situation in such a way that the only narratively satisfying outcome is one in which he wins. An attempted justification of such a scenario is what I tried with "Applied Cultural Topology", but of course, I as the author was cooperating in that story.

Completely separate from that is the problem of xenofiction. Even if you are in a story, the story's author is not necessarily a human. All the conventions you know of might be insufficient to describe the twists and turns your story will take. Even if you assume a human author, the culture within a story is less intricate and many-facetted than the culture outside the story, because worldbuilding resources are limited. Most likely, the author will see tropes in a different view than you, because he has a broader cultural context.

Just some doubts I have, I guess. I like metafiction, but rational metafiction seems particularly hard to write.
