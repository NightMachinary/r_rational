Westworld has inspired me to look at this idea from a different angle. I'm picturing a world where people pay for a virtual reality experience curated as they play. It'd be kind of like hiring Dungeon Masters to build the setting and story for the players to escape into. Everyone knows it's fiction, but roleplay because it's escapist fun and are willing to pay for it.

Another odd idea I have is to combine Let's Plays with Pro-Wrestling. The pro-gamers create fictional personas for their streams and use their commentary to add a narrative to their gameplay. Pro-gamers will meet in multiplayer and perform together to entertain their audience. It's all obviously fake, of course, but people like the vicarious fantasy.

I like to imagine that both of these exist in a transhumanist future setting like Eclipse Phase where people can easily upload themselves into simulations and record full-sensory experiences. I can see them as the logical next step from theme parks and reality tv, people just want to step into fictional worlds to help them deal with the real world. I can see interesting metafiction coming out of these concepts.
