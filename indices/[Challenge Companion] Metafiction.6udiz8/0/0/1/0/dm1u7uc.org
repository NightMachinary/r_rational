The Holmes one? That's sort of unavoidable, given that I either spoil the conceit or risk having people wander in without having seen the thing it references. The story is also tagged in such a way as to spoil it. It's one of the reasons that I'm not terribly happy with it, but I don't really see the way around it.

Edit: If you maybe meant /Worth the Candle/, I don't think it's a spoiler to say that there's an A-plot and B-plot, the first of which is interacting with the world as it presents itself and the second, up a level, in trying to figure out the mystery of that reality. I'd hope that's obvious by the end of the second chapter, if maybe not the first. (Plus also a background C-plot of Juniper's past, told in a disjointed style, which starts showing up at the start of chapter 4 or maybe a bit before.)
