One example of strong meta fiction that is done really well from comic world is of course Deadpool. Character is fully aware he is in graphical novel. He often talks about it to other characters, who are not aware they are in the comic and creates a lot of comical situations or times where others think he is just crazy.

Deadpool is so aware of the comic reality that he even knows what fonts and ways [[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__p6Clhn9WDI/TRLTnhIjtiI/AAAAAAAAILY/wlfrjqCkySM/s1600/AgentX2.jpg][his thoughts are represented]]. He speaks to others as if they should also be aware of the reality. I can't find a link right now but for instance Deadpool meets Wolverine and says something like "Logan I haven't seen you since 'X-man issue 62' how have you been?"

On the lesser spectrum there is Spiderman who often has a monologue addressed to the viewer. He is aware of viewer existence but is not aware of whole extend of comic reality. For instance he will refer to yesterday as "yesterday" not as "previews issue of the comic" and he is doesn't know how his thoughts and speech are represented (or at least never suggested otherwise) to the viewer he just know viewer is there.

Then in tv series we have little injections of metafiction. For example in series Supernatural there is good episode where main character stumble into Supernatural fanfic convention. In story one of angels records progress of Sam and Dean and publishes those as books as a "New New Testament". Based on those books whole culture of fan fiction was created in the show itself that is exactly the same as fan fiction of actual movies in real world. It's nice gesture towards the fans I think and good way to introduce meta fiction element to the series without characters being brutally aware that someone is watching them.

Other cool example of metafiction in move is [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107362/][Last Action Hero]] where Arnold Schwarzenegger plays character who travels from "move" to "real world". He then tries to act like he does in a movies and is shocked to discover things don't work that way. For instance he tries to take out bad guy by punching through closed window and dragging him out of a car and instead glass cuts his whole hand and he starts bleeding quite badly.

Usual problem with meta fiction is that it's very easy to overdo it and just came out forced. If you go that route you need to ride it all the way like Deadpool does and just embrace it.
