Hmm, Jiraiya was a pretty easy decision: The concept is that this is a rational rewrite of Naruto, and leaving Naruto an orphan was one of the dumbest things in the series both A) on the part of the Hokage and B) hugely irresponsible on the part of Jiraiya (or even Kakashi for that matter). Someone had to take care of him and Jiraiya was the obvious choice.

Besides, Jiraiya is awesome, and more of him is always better.
