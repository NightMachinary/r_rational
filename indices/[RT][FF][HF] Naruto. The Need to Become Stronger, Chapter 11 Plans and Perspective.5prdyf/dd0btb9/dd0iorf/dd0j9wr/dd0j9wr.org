I just binge read everything that you had written so far and enjoyed it. It's a little of both, I prefer for updates to be regular just so I'm not checking back all the time or worrying that I missed one but more is certainly better. Real life certainly gets in the way some times though and I doubt anyone will fault you for any inconsistency there. I'm liking the series and I'm curious to see where it goes from here. What made you decide to have Jiraya be involved with the story early on?
