I don't know yet. I have a lot of background, cool scenes, and storystuff that deserve a coherent plot of some sort. But it's very easy to get into Kudzu Plot territory, and Sparring Match started as a brief side story to The Maker's Ark, which I want to get back to sometime soon.

I was also restricted by the fact that I write in 3rd person limited, and the only viewpoint character in Sparring Match is Yiskah. Adding a new viewpoint character requires careful work to do right--and I still have to decide on the proper internal 'voice' for Breakpoint.

I have a lot of what I'd call 'narrated background vignettes', but I'm reluctant to put any more into Maker's Ark, because they tend to bring the main plot to a halt (like Journeyman's origin story in chapters 12-14). Depending on how the main novel is going I may post a few more of those as side stories. One of them is hinted at in Sparring Match--the trouble Journeyman got into at Ending/Beginning Falls. I also have two Flicker short stories that want to be written ("Earthquake. Japan" is the start of one).

Flexibility in what I work on helps me avoid writer's block, so I often don't know what's going to come out next 8-)
