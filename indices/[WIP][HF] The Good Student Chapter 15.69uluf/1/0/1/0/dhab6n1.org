I'll take a stab at some of these questions.

First off, I'm willing to bet it's not easy to detect the Imperius. Simole could do it, but she commonly does magic things that other people can't. The detectors can do it, but those are strong enough to also detect the government's invisible spies or whatever, and their detector was stolen from the gardening class so they weren't actually supposed to have one.

Without detecting the actual enchantment, Nic's personality change would probably be interpreted as him hiding things or losing some of his scholastic drive, rather than him being magically controlled.

I'll admit I'm not sure what the spell was intended to accomplish. Right now, my thought is that Nic is unusually attentive, and could thereby be inconvenient for the Old Mother's ability to get things done without drawing attention. If that's the case, then the spell's purpose would be to remove him from campus by making him give up and flunk out. That's pure speculation, though; we'll have to wait and see what the actual answer is.

I'm pretty sure Professor Veristotle is just a disguise. No point revealing your true form when you're supposed to be dead, even if you plan to Imperius your audience afterward. In which case, Tenner wrecked their opsec by calling her the Old Mother.

Minister Delcroix seems to have a vested interest in Nic's development. In particular, in chapter 2 he implies that he wants to "guide and mould" Nic, should he end up going into the Royal College. Under that assumption, the gift of the pen is an investment for potential future return.
