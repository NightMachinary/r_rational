I knew who the demon was and I knew how he got the pen.

My confusion is the whys for almost all of that. Why put someone under Imperius-y curse when it's apparently easy to detect and is going to make him act so strange. Did he already do what they wanted him for offscreen or something? Why give him the pen? Honestly if it isn't just plot magic I'm sort of wondering about some more Imperius-y curses being involved. Why does old mother = Professor Veristotle? What is Tenner trying to get?
