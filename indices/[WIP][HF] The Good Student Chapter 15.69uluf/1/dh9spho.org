I'm really confused. I'm not sure how much of that was intentional and how much was on accident.

Questions. What were they trying to do with him? Making him into a follower or something? Some kind of agent? He seemed to primarily want to become closer to Liz? (I'm terrible with names) so was the demon still interested in recruiting her? I'm assuming it was actually her despite what the he thought, but maybe that's wrong. I feel like he'd make a pretty poor agent. If he shines on magic sense like a beacon people might notice.

Also I have to say the pen's mighty convenient to the plot here. I'm still not clear on why it was given.
