You're right about that but I don't think "show don't tell" is a set-in-stone kind of rule but more of a general guideline. I think we should have been given a bit of a buffer between finding out what the pen does and using it or we should have found out in a more organic way.

The way it's done now kills immersion because you can directly see the story structure.
