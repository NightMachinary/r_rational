From Minister Delcroix's musings about Nic he intends for Nic to go into Royal college - and sees great potential in him to become mage - an asset, that will be his thrall. I think he gave him the pen hoping to eventually nudge his interest towards arcanum by him discovering its use (he's a curious boy) and experimenting with it even. Something rare like this would be invaluable when studying arcanum too. I guess that the pen was also given to protect his asset from a premature end from arcane means, an insurance. Calling it a plot convenient feels a little harsh, when it has been foreshadowed from earlier on. I agree though that the trance had been lifted a little too early. And I wish the use of the pen had been a deliberate thing somehow, not an accidental brush of hand.
