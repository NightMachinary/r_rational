My impression is that it was a test. The mage succeeded a test earlier by not going topsy-turvy. Nic failed the test by accepting all the demon's suggestions. At which point he is found to be useless and just told to go home and forget everything that happened. The demon dissapproved and therefore does not get drafted to do whatever Tenner had in mind.

The pen seems to be some kind of standard magical protection thing (for sufficiently powerful people). So much so that we learned recently that the minister was going to be buying several of them soon. That means that, though unusual, they are not especially rare. The minister knew that Nic would be spending the schoolyear with Simole and if he worried about that, giving up the pen is a small sacrifice that would serve Nic very well. Especially if the minister thought Nic would become close to his daughter and that he might serve as a body guard? At the very least it's an expensive pen that will guilt Nic into taking the minister's job offer, even when a lot of other offers start coming in (gotta groom them when they're young).
