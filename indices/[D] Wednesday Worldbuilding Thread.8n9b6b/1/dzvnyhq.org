so, this is just an idea if anyone is familiar with the material maybe it would be fun to discuss here.

I am going to run a game of mage the ascension in a few weeks (we are making characters on sunday hopefully) where my plan for the main plot of the game (I encourage players to setup side plots both in the game and during character creation) will be a technocracy version of star trek. The original idea was to run a post "false technocratic victory" and "post ascension war" game but the players were mostly running technocrats and based on some of their character ideas and listening to "the greatest generation" podcast I thought this could be a fun game idea.

My thoughts on the mechanics would be much more hub based than star trek giving them points to set up a base and ship to start out, making some drama at home for them to need to go back to reality every game or two to keep them grounded while they explore the umbra.
