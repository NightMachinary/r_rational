Often, I don't actually /have/ documents. I keep things mostly in my head, and plan out plotlines based on the personalities and abilities of the characters involved; the geography and history are merely /what they need to be to make the story work/, whatever the story is at the time, and are subject to change any time that the story needs something else (and the original idea hasn't had any major impact on the plot yet).

(The one time I did actually draw up a document, it was because the story involved time travel, and the antagonist was experiencing the events of the story in a different order to the protagonists - keeping that straight did require a document).

There will often be hidden things in my stories - forces that move at a layer beyond the most obvious. But, unless it actually turns out to be important to the plot in some way, I couldn't tell you where the nearest ocean is to my protagonists, or when their country was last at war (or with whom).
