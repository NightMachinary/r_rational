This is a somewhat meta:

How do you organize your worldbuilding documents?

For me, the biggest things tend to be Geography (what's where), History (what happened), Magic and Technology (what people can do), and Movers and Shakers (who's who). Everything else is subordinate to that; climate, crops, and trade all go under geography, religion, corporations, organizations all go under Movers and Shakers, etc. There's a lot of cross-filing though, since there's obviously a ton of overlap.

One solution might be to have a wiki, but in my experience that's a little bit heavy-weight, and you end up with a lot of stubs, and it can spread things out too much to actually be satisfying as a picture of an imagined place.

(I'm generally happy with my organizational method, but would be curious to know what practices other people use.)

Edit: I tend to share these often, but here are four examples of how my docs look, in various states of done: [[http://maguseuropa.wikidot.com/][Magus Europa]] (done on wiki), [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13O76ht9K_WfkL__kmGG0meklYffpYcDsJqlFBNADxmc/edit?usp=sharing][Altered Chorus]], [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LcIpahJPMl5xKgd3Fz_fghCANHI-e8y8F9FmyWh4Y6g/edit?usp=sharing][Red Stairs/Blue Stairs]] + [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_8Jl1IVj-kObdCAd_CGTYxfddsFusgiQ70aAALsYajY/edit?usp=sharing][timeline]], [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEEMqsW05SEGhp42JLmHOTVy_elHOXIXGJfpKbvqH-U/edit?usp=sharing][Island Critters]]
