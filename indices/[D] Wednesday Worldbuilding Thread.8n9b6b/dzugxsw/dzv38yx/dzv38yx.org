With both game-mastering and writing, I tend to work bottom up rather than top down: What will matter to the characters and how will that be revealed to the players or the readers in a way that keeps them intrigued?

So my world-building is usually organized by major character, branching out like a tree (backwards and forwards, roots and leaves) into the corners of the world that made them and the ones they'll interact with later: Who and what they know, who and what will get in their way, how these forces tie together.

Minor characters that become major can peel out into files of their own, sometimes pulling information that directly relates to them from several previous files, where it becomes references to that character instead so that I keep my cast as manageable as possible. What was once history, bureaucracy, or background color becomes personified... and this figure becomes the go-to source for exposition on whatever.

All of this also tends to hamper scope expansion. Individual characters rarely wind up changing the world because everything's defined by its local relevance and connection rather than its fundamental traits and over-arching purpose. That's what I tell myself, anyway... players left to their own devices still want to kidnap the president.
