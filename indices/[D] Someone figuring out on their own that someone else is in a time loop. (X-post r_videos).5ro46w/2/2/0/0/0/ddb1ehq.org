Seconding this. The only experience I had with Naruto before reading this story was watching some of the first few eps years prior, and I still really enjoyed it. Just be aware that a "jutsu" is essentially a magic spell. Google any terms you don't recognize (genjutsu = illusion spells, taijutsu = mundane fighting techniques, etc.), and you're good to go.

I will warn that there's some sexual scenes that might put some people off. It's not the main focus, but it's there.
