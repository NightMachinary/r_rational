Endless eight, I should think, is rather specifically non-rational. Whereas the series in general is indeed sensible, EE appears to be an exercise in doing the least useful things possible.

In all loops, characters have a good idea of what would end the cycle, but not how to achieve it. They also have access to an individual with persistent memory across resets, perfect recall in general, the ability to edit reality as code, and no particular inhibition to use these powers when specifically requested. Yet, no serious attempt whatsoever is made to utilise any of these resources, for the duration of the arc.
