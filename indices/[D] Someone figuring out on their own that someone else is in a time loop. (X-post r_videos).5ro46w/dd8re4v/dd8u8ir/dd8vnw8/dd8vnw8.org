  I wouldn't really call it very rational, though.

Not by /any/ means.

From a conversation with my girlfriend, when I binged the series:

#+begin_quote
  in the latest display of "making up the rules as we go along, even if they ignore previously established rules," we find out, two episodes before the finale, that "battle magic" is really hard to do, and unless you've meditated daily for ten years you can only do it in extreme situations

  even though, 1) battle magic seems to consist just of telekinetic blasts, and there's a whole fraternity of telekinetics, *whose members include several of the main characters*, and 2) two of the characters previously used battle magic in an earlier episode and nobody saw fit to even *mention* "wow this was crazy you normally can't do it, must have been extreme for you"
