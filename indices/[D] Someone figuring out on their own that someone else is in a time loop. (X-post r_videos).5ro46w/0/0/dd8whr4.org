Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Endless Eight.

Eight episodes of the same shit happening, and the main character /eventually/ realizing that he's a bystander in a timeloop. Although to be fair, he does have the advantage of being able to feel that /something/ off is going on.

Edit: Also... Melancholy isn't exactly rational, although I think I can fairly say that the main character is at least /sensible,/ even if he's probably not explicitly /rational./
