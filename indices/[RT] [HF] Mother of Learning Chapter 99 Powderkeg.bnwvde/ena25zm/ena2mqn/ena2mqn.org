Wow this chapter was awesome. I loved the interaction between Zorian and Damien. It was great to read him going into self reflection. It really demonstrates how much he's grown.

I really enjoy these rare chapters checking in on all of his relationships. It shows the big payoffs for his maturity and change as a human being.
