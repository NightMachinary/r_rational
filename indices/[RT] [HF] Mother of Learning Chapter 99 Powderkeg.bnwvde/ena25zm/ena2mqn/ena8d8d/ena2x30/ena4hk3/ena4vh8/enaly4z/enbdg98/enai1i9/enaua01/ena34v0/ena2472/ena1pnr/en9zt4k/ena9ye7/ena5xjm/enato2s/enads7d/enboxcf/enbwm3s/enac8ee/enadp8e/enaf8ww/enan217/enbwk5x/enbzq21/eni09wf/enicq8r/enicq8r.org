We first met Neolu because Zach was hanging around with her and some other unnamed girl in the very first iteration of the loop that Zorian remembers, before Quatach Ichl partially melded his soul with Zach's. The reason for this was later revealed to be because she is apparently easy to convince about the truth of the time loop, so Zach would occasionally spend a restart hanging around her to decompress and have someone to talk to. Zorian later realized that without Zach's presence, Neolu was incapable of reaching the same results in grades and magical abilities as she did in his first restart, and that she was decidedly fairly average as a mage.

The next time she was relevant was in one of the restarts before Zach woke up from his soul damage-induced coma. Zorian's previous restart had ended with him being stabbed in the chest after telling his language teacher about the Ibasans, and so he was understandably reticent to openly warn people about the invasion again. As such, he asked Benisek for advice about how to send a message secretly. As a result, Benisek then promptly spread a rumor all over the city about how Zorian was in love and wanted to send a secret message to his beloved, much to Zorian's annoyance. After a class, Neolu then casually walked by him, and dropped a note with multiple book titles about the subject written on it, as well as many hand-drawn small hearts around the edges. Zorian resisted his urge to burn the paper, and he actually took the time to go through Neolu's suggested list of books, and found to his surprise that they were very good recommendations. He used his newfound knowledge to send many anonymous messages about the invasion to authorities in the police force, the Church and the mage guild, but was disappointed that nothing really happened as a result, and that the city was just as unprepared for when the invasion actually happened. But at least Zorian wasn't stabbed in the chest a second time.

After that, Neolu only became relevant again when Zorian was attempting to learn the dialect of the people residing on the islands and towns between Eldemar and Koth, to help him reach Daimen in good time, before Z&Z & Silent Doorway Adepts found Bakora Gates on that continent. Neolu came from a noble clan in the area, and was sent away to the Academy as a way of protecting herself while her family tried to resolve some conflicts. She thus helped Zorian at translating a few common words and phrases, to help his simulacrum negotiate for teleports from the locals.

And the next time she became relevant was for the airship ride, when Z&Z wanted her to help them with her connections in order to get an Ikosian-to-Sulrothum translator, in order to get the surrounding devil wasps' colonies help to launch an attack against the Ziggurat of the Sun. During this airship ride, Zorian thought that Neolu was being strangely credulous to Z&Z's claims. He concluded that it was possible that her third eye tattoo and bloodline were related somehow, and that she has a way to tell if someone is speaking truthfully. This was also the first time that the author mentioned that she has facial tattoos.

Well, as far as I remember, this is accurate. I can't really recall any other moment where she was particularly important.
