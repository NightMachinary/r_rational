Thanks for the chapter. I just re read the serie and I have a few questions.

- In earlier chapter you said that pocket dimensions have the same weight

#+begin_quote
  the weight of the object inside did not disappear, so a chest with several tons of rock inside would still weight several tons, no matter how small it looked. chapter 78
#+end_quote

So how they could create that orb with Silverlake, Damien, and Xvim in the last restart ?

- What happened to that orb they made, did they try to bring it with them to escape or not since it require a constant mana ?

- Do Zach use golem for his simulacrum or it's only Zorian ?

- Can a familiar increase your mana regeneration by somehow ?

- How strong is Xvim ? I mean in term of natural mana reserve.

- Can the dagger control any Hydra or only the princess ?
