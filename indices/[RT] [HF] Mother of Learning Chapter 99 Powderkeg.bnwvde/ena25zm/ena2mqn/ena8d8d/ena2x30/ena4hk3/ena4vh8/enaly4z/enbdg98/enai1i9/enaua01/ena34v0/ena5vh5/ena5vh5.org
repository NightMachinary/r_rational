My personal pet theory re: mental simulations is that he knows Zach is expecting an attempt to subvert the contract this way. So he intends to have two levels of simulation, one at a normal human mind mage level (hence the remark during the Tinami session) which he allows Zach to see through, and the other at or above the level of clarity we saw before.

When Zach drops into the second simulation, he believes he's beaten Zorian's trick and is compelled by the contract to kill everyone who knew about the time loop. End chapter on cliffhanger, next chapter is the reveal that Zorian keikaku'd everywhere and everyone is fine except for mental trauma on Zach's part because that was really an exceedingly realistic sim and why are you so good at simulating blood spatter, Zorian?
