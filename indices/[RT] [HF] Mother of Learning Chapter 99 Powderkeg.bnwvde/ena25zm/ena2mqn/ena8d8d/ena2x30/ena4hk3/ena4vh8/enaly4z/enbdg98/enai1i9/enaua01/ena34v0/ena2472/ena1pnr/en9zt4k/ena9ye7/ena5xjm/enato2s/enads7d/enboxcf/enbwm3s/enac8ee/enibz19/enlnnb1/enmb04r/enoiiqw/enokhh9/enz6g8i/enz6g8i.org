That's interesting - I remember the knock-off imperial orb they made was powered by a tiny dimensional gate leading to the depth of the local dungeon, so I assumed they wouldn't be able to bring it with them to the real world, since once the portal to the real world was closed it would probably sever the link created by that dimensional gate as well. Or even if not, then at least when the iteration of the loop ended it should destroy the end of the dimensional gate that leads back to the copy-world.

So the knockoff orb can last for a little while after being cut off from its source of power? In retrospect, there were a few passages coming from the story that suggests a spell formula could keep circulating a certain store of mana even without a battery explicitly being built into it. That exposition about about some wards being able to last months after being cut off from its power source, for one.
