What's good about Tavien is that she's blunt, sincere and caring while being highly motivated to reach her goal of becoming a battle mage, she don't care much for social prestige so she wont bother Zorian to go to parties even if she'd bother him as a diviner, something he's probably okey with.

Tinami is best girl however, she's horrible dating material but she's cute, helpful, honest, driven and will do ANYTHING to reach her goal, she's great, but Zorian would Loathe the clan politics she brings, but having her as a friend should be okey :)
