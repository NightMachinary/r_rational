Woo, Raynie! I ship her with Zorian. I always ship her. I know the author will think up something to bring her up again. Woo, Raynie!

Anyway, there's no way to mince it other than Zorian forced to end the shaky truce if he's to save Raynie's brother. Any attempt to get him out of Cult's grasp, be it with mundane method, low, or high skill magic, will be traced back to him. I'm up for fun times as prelude to invasion day.

Back to shipping again: Woo, Raynie!
