  I think the sea of suns could be Zorian's hive mind - like the great web connections. It could also be the Bakora Gate network fully deployed.

I think honestly the author has shied away from romance from the most part, I don't think Tinami is leading up to that anyway. She's also repeatedly described as shy, so I'd doubt that angle.

Re angels and sulrothum - that IS weird. These guys have an intense relationship going on, although informing the church might not be ideal because it may leak out, whereas who will talk to devil wasps a continent away?
