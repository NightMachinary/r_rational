how long ago was that tho, in-universe? there is a chance it happened precisely during that. either contact is slow/infrequent and Raynie only just found out now and/or Raynie only got around to seeking help now (though from her expression, seems like she found out recently). I would have to double check but I feel like I'm probably wrong because it's been a lil too long for "slow communication"
