I always imagined Zorian to be a pragmatic sort. Getting what he want trump pride every time. In locating Imperial Orb, he swallowed his pride and asked his brother Daimen help, didn't he? Moreover, undervalued is not equal to non-valuable. What marred Raynie's perfection is she's no longer involved in tribe's politic (a plus point in Zorian's book), she is still most desirable girl in her whole class.

Same with other girl, I'm not saying Raynie will just throw herself to Zorian. Courting is an endeavor. But in success in courting Raynie, Zorian get all the bonus and none the minus.
