yea i know that, he's not very interested period at the moment he likes building stuff too much to concern himself with romance, but shipping is fun even if it's kind of out of character.

but also he've had not much experience with romance or social stuff anyway, so he's still pretty inexperienced in that area in general, so the gap of such knowledge between himself and girls his age is lower then what you might expect from one his age, talking to huge spiders don't make you much of a people person.
