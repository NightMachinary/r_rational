Zorian is at the level of competence where he doesn't need help of that kind from the gods or their agents. He's far more likely to eventually figure out the mechanics behind the stablization frame increasing a person's mana, and create one for himself. And, this way, he doesn't need to sign one of the nasty angelic contracts.
