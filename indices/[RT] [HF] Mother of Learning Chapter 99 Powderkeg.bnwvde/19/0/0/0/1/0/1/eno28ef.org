Well, that makes somewhat more sense, but it doesn't really matter what QI was like when young. The point is that he is now thousands of years old, and still hasn't duplicated his crown despite studying it in depth. To suggest that Zorian might succeed in a mere handful of years makes you appear short sighted, thus the down votes. (Just speculating here - I personally didn't vote.)
