“Being Open implies being empathic, but they are not the same thing. Empathy is just one of the powers available to you, and a bit of a low-hanging fruit at that -- that's why you can use it, despite being completely untrained in the psychic arts. Openness often manifests itself as a low, uncontrolled empathy in the beginning, coupled with a gift for divinations and an occasional prophetic dream.” ~Chapter 17, Sympathy for the Spider

Has Zorian had any Prophetic Dreams? I mean, it would be a bit unnecessary to him as he was in a time loop, so info was hardly a rarity, but I can't recall if he had any. Maybe when he woke up when an assassin tried to kill him when he first met Alanic counts, but I believe his Danger Sense is different, unless the word "Prophetic Dream" does not mean a literal dream.
