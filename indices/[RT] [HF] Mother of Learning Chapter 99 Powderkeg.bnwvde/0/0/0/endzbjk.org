I'm not sure mind-wiping Zach would do the trick, since the angelic contract may just draw from what he previously sensed and previously remembered.

On the other hand, if Zorian could bypass Zach's mind blank and override his senses to show him Zorian dying in the fighting, well, what is there for Zach to believe except that Zorian's dead? Zach was under mind blank, after all, so he can surely trust what he sees with his own two eyes.
