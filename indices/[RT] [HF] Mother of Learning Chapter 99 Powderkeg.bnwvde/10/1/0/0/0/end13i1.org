I agree, they specifically said they can't change the terms of the contract. And yes, the primordial being released definitely will trigger the 'bad stuff', but everything else is all tied to Zach's perceptions, Zach's judgement, etc. Doesn't rule out the Angel's just removing the Divine Framework, or nulling the contract in some other way.

Consider the other oddities around the contract:

- The fact that it just ends at the end of the month.
- It's comprehensive and detailed, but doesn't stop a obvious way to get information out of the loop (research notes)
- It doesn't stop Zach from communicating about the time loop in the loop (surely this would be an easy way to block information)
- Nor does it prevent him from creating Temporary Loopers (again another easy to block thing).
- There's no block on what Zorian did, or any method of physically removing stuff from the loop. Admittedly this is weak, since it would be reasonable to assume that the Guardian would prevent this kind of thing.

These discrepancies all make some sense if you consider the time loop as a crucible specifically for Zach, he has to have the opportunity to make mistakes, and deal with the consequences. According to the Angels, if Zach had ever stopped the invasion perfectly then all the information would have been granted, but that doesn't mean that the angel's considered the task doable. If the angel's considered the task itself as impossible without allies then the strange restrictions make sense.

I just wonder if all these little discrepancies around the Angel's actions, and the contract add up to something else. Again, big assumption, the Angel's choosing Zach was the best way to stop the primordial. Doesn't add up now that we have a view of the kinds of people who have shown they are willing to help with said Primordial. But again, if there's more than one goal here, then it may make sense.

I think we'll revisit the question of "Why Zach" at some point, and hope the answer is more satisfying than "because".
