  Finally, Raynie's back! Jornak seems to have looked outward for shifter children for the primordial summoning ritual. It sucks for Raynie, but I'm confident that Zorian can save her brother and get into Raynie's good graces. I'm personally rooting for Zorian to get to know Raynie better in the real world considering how they got along earlier when he interacted with her.
