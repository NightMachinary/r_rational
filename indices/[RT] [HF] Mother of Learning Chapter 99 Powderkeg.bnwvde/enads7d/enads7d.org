It's extremely likely that the invaders are behind the kidnapping of Raynie's brother to get to Zorian & Zach. There is no way either of them would let this pass once they hear about it. This is the perfect trap, just a day or so before the festival to boot!

On another note, I hope the sulrothum can throw Silverlake's plans off as she doesn't know about them yet, however unlikely that is.

On yet another note, I find it a little amusing that the High Priest is scolding Zach on his lack of faith in angels when it's Zorian whose religious faith is lacking & Zach who was chosen by the angels.
