What was the deal with the weird reaction from Tinami at the end?

Also - yay for more Raynie. I'm very pleased to see her brought back into the story. She was by far my favorite Zorian ship back in the days when Zorian was semi-dating. I can't believe I didn't see this coming with her brother though. Of course RR would go after the wolf tribe after Zorian took steps to protect the shifters in Cyoria.
