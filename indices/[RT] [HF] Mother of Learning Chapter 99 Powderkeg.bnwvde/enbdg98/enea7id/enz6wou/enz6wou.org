From this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Zorian was quite surprised at this, as this wasn't something Rea typically did. Did she somehow catch wind of his own involvement in all this?
#+end_quote

This was talking about Rea's sudden invitation to Zorian. The second passage implies that while Zorian gave the order, he wasn't the one personally trying to convince her, I would say.
