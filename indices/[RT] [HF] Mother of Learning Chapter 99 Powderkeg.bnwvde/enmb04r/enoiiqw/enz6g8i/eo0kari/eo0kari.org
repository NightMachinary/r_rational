Yes, spell formula usually do have a form of mana storage, and large ward schemes often have massive ones. This is because when a ward fails do to a lack of mana, it's permanently gone - even if you supplied it with mana later on, it would not bring back the spells used to make it. Those have to be cast all over again. Obviously, this is something that makers and buyers try to avoid as much as possible.

It's not that mana cannot be stores, it's that it cannot keep its attunement when it's done so, making such storages useless for a mage's personal needs. But for spell formula, this isn't important.
