*The weight limitation is only valid for the basic pocket dimensions shown in that chapter. The chapter even notes that it isn't a total restriction (in that Silverlake claimed the palace orb could be reproduced through purely mortal magic). Chapter 85 features a mention of Zach and Zorian being able to build the most advanced type of pocket dimensions. ("These objects were not containers with expanded interior at all. They were self-contained pocket worlds anchored to an object.") I though I mentioned there that these ones don't have weight limitations, but apparently not.

*They did try to bring it with them, but since the only thing to pass through the escape passage was Zorian's soul, it was naturally lost along all its contents.

*Only Zorian.

*No.

*His natural mana reserves are bigger than Zorian's but not particularly large. Magnitude 14 to 16, as opposed to Zorian's 8/10. Still considered fairly average, but on the higher end of that category.

*Just Princess.
