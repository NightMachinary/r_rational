Rea is sharp. I mean, how would she connect a gifted student (that his professor deign to visit from time to time) to someone who's in-the-know about shifter kidnapping? I'm sure it's not Zorian himself who tried to convince her to leave the city, otherwise Zorian would not be surprised by her invitation in the first place. She must be a capable scout among her old criminally-inclined friendos to draw such conclusion.
