I would love to see something like Worm / Ward where Worm ends with an apocalyptic event, and Ward picks up later with people trying to continue living despite everything that happened .

The TV show The Leftovers did this very well IMO, showing how cataclysmic the disappearance of ""only"" 2% of the population can be for the people that have to live with the consequences.

But I'm an absolute sucker for this type of thing. I just hope the ending isn't a 100% happyending
