I doubt Zorian can take on dragons. He mught be able to use his mental powers against them /if/ he manages to break into their mind (not easy since they have incredible mana resources).

Tbh I think Zorian may summon the angel to get rid of the dragons, because I don't really see any way they could beat them. Or Z&Z will defeat Oganj and the dragons will retreat.
