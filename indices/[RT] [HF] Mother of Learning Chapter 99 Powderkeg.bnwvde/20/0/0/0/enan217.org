Zorian danced with her during the party at Zach's estate. She gave him a rundown of ongoings within the noble houses, before Zorian met up with Zach again, after Zorian's return to Cyoria. She's part of house Aope, an old family of witches who gained nobility status as a condition of turning against the Necromancers in the war that led to their exile on Ulqaan Ubasa. Tinami herself requested a partner to practice mind magic from Ilsa. Zorian practiced it with her in 2 previous restarts. The first one was when Zorian was Ilsa's succeeding disciple, and the second one was in the same restart as the first time Zorian approached Raynie. That time, during their meeting where they practiced mind magic, Kiana showed up and told Zorian that Raynie agreed to a meeting, leading Tinami to assume that Zorian had learned a secret of Raynie's through telepathy and spreading a rumor that he was dating her.

Forgot to mention, but Tinami also constantly wears a ring with a spell formula inscribed on it. The spell is harmless, but causes tremendous pain on whoever is hit by it. She used it during the party at Zach's place, against invaders and monsters. Also, on top of being interested in spiders, she's very interested in lineage and family trees. Probably part of Tinami's witch heritage. She was very interested to learn that Zorian's grandmother was a witch, in the restart where she told him about the noble families. (Chapters 49 & 50, iirc.)
