Two other details. It's possible that her facial tattoos were mentioned when she met Zorian in the library and helped him with his translations, rather than during the airship ride. I think I might have slightly confused the timeline. And the second thing, is that during their airship pitstop at some ruins, Neolu showed that she loves stories that involve romance, and that she finds lizards cute.

And NOW that's all I recall about her.
