What Raynie offered is convenience. She's unwanted by her tribe. Matching Zorian's ambition of living a quiet but prosperous life. Her being gorgeous is a bonus. Being not exactly close to Zorian is too a bonus, so there's a payoff if he try know her better.

Akoja can offer the same convenience of quiet life, but her personality doesn't match Zorian's.

Tinami is the contrary to quiet life. Husband to a noble house's heir implies additional responsibility and fame. Two things that may only serve as distraction from his dream of revolutionizing magic.

Neolu's naivette is endearing to Zorian but only in small dose. Abundance of it will not mesh his taste well.

Taiven... now Taiven, I wanna hear what's so good about Taiven. A past crush that Zorian admit had moved on from.
