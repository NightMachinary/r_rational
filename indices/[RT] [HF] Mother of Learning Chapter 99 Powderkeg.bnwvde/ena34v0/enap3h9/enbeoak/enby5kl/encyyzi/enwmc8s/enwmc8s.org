My guess on Zorian's future position after the month is as the mages guild Guildmaster, he is probably the best mind human mind mage alive /now/ and his skill with simulacra and making magic items (I honestly can't remember what Its called) make him a capable of furthering his research and running the guild, hopefully with corruption from malicious cultists. Not to mention the huge political boon that knowing Zach is, if they both survive the month.
