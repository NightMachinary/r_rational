The comment by the sulrothum high priest is by far the part that stuck out for me.

It's a unexamined assumption that what the contract says is what the Angel's want to happen. The angel interaction with the sulrothum speaks to there being more going on on the Angel side than we know about.

What if the point of the contract is to put Zach into a life or death moral decision where he has to choose between the lives of his allies or his own life? Perhaps with the added twist of finding out if he's strong enough to resist the compulsion of the contract?

There's no doubt in my mind the Angels could release him from the contract with a wave of a weird, tree tentacle thing.

Let's remember the last known use of the time loop created the Emperor that unified the world. Perhaps the reason Zorian wouldn't have been a candidate has more to do with bloodline than temperament.

If this is right, then we'll see all of Zorian's beautiful plans get ripped down at the last second, perhaps by the Angels or Sulthorum. Keep in mind, Zorian may be the book's protagonist, but Zach is supposed to be the hero of the story.

It also bother's me that Zach's been offscreen the last few chapters. What's he been up to?
