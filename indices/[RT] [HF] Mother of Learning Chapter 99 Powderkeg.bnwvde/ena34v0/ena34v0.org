I'm writing this as more of a stream of consciousness:

I'm assuming Zorian's work with mental illusions in chapter 97 with Spear of Resolve is foreshadowing a scenario where Zorian will subvert Zach's mind blank during the final battle and show a scene where everyone that knows about the time loop dies, leaving Zach thinking that that portion of his contract is fulfilled. Even still, Zorian is refusing to tell Daimen where his notebooks came from as a precaution. Zorian really is super paranoid.

Zorian's vision from chapter 75 came true! The sea of suns represents his mental network that he has established throughout Cyoria!

Did the angels talk to the sulthorum again in the real world? In the time loop the sulthorum were told that a powerful mage would come for the ring. Now they are willing to uproot and fight in Cyoria. It's good that he has more allies.

I think Tinami might be looking at Zorian in a more romantic light. With the comments Daimen has made about Zorian being more confident and Zorian doing the mental lessons with Tinami in the real world, Tinami has a much better impression of Zorian.

Finally, Raynie's back! Jornak seems to have looked outward for shifter children for the primordial summoning ritual. It sucks for Raynie, but I'm confident that Zorian can save her brother and get into Raynie's good graces. I'm personally rooting for Zorian to get to know Raynie better in the real world considering how they got along earlier when he interacted with her.
