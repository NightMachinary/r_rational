So with the sigil network that literally no one but Zorian is aware of allowing him full coverage of the city with his mind whammy, and the mention of him needing to know soon how capable a normal human mind mage is, I guess the only question left is: do we expect a bluff, double bluff, or a side-by-side bluff?

Is he only going to take over Zach's mind and show him everyone who knows about the time loop dying, or will he take over Zach's mind and show him a convincing human-level attempt to take over Zach's mind and allow the simulated takeover attempt to be shredded by contract magic then let the higher level sim allow Zach to kill everyone who knows about the time loop? And will he be simultaneously (side-by-side) showing the invaders a simulation of their victory?

I'd really like to see the meta-level scene in this instance with Zorian sitting there, hand on the wall and holding a drooling, feebly kicking Zach while his allies quietly round up the streetsful of sleeping invaders.
