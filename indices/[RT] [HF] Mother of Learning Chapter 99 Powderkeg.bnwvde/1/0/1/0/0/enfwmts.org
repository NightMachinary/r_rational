To be fair, the situation is different this time. Zorian isn't presenting abilities that would be impossible for him to acquire, he's presenting information about a highly implausible plot with rock-solid proof that Damien had participated in events that he doesn't remember. Memory manipulation (through mind magic or some other means) seems like it would be much easier for an accomplished mage to accept than the literally impossible feat of Zorian instantaneously becoming much more powerful.
