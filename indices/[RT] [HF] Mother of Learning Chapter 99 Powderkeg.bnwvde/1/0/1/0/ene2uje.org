Oh, but the first time Daimen contacted by Zorian, there's sky-high apprehension and wariness. He started by mocking his impossible ability to open gate and cast simulacrum, but when presented by proof, he became speechless. He walked around Cyoria in silence and never once utter a word to his little brother until Zorian himself nudge him to talk. That level of shock is what I expected when you're dumped something so outrageous.
