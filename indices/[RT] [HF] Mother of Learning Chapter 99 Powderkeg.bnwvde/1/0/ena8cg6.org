I also love the part of stories that deal with it too. They bring our attention that every characters has their own problem, has their own skill set that may not be enough to solve their problem themselves, and give main character push and pull so he can develop. They're in correct dose too! I mean, this novel is still about Zorian, all these relationship subplot is always low key. But in the end, it has great effect: It brings characters alive!

That said, I have dissatisfaction with Daimen's reaction in this chapter. We know he's having bad days. He's expedition not working smoothly, stressfulness from the arrival of his parents, and I'm sure the pressure from the Taramatula, especially his fiancee Orissa, must be mounting. Dropping a big problem he's not ready with should made him speechless, disbelieving, before transitioning into outrage and finally acceptance. There might be pressure to keep word count low, or maybe the pay-off from doing that part perfectly weren't big enough (the readers already know all of this anyway), but I still hope it was done well.

Edit: On reread I identified the speechless part. Actually, the interaction is pretty good on slow read. Incredulity -> Dismissal -> (Show the orb) Surprise -> Speechlessness -> Confusion -> Frustration -> Anger -> Tentative Acceptance. I wonder, why the shock was barely noticeable on first read. It's unlike memorable Haslush reaction on Mr Kesir's (/ordering stronger alcohol, repeating "this is insane"/), or from further past, Zorian reaction on Merenptah's (/want to claim that he's furiously thinking, but the shock is too great he's left dazzled/).
