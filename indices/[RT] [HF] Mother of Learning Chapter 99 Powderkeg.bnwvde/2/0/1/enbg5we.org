Becoming a lich doesn't seem worth it, for one thing its seriously illegal everywhere except for the one country he is at war with, the gods also dont seem to like it, and needlesly pissing the gods of when he knows there to be an afterlife is stupid. Its much safer for him to recreate Silverlakes potions, and considering how good he and Kael are at alchemy its also not even that unlikely.
