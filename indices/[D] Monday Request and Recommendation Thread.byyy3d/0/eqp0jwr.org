I've watched [[https://rifters.com/real/progress.htm][/Vampire Domestication: Taming Yesterday's Nightmares for a Better Tomorrow/]], and I'm in love with FizerPharm from it. An unethical mad science organization that wears its lack of ethics on its sleeve, and seems to be /proud/ of it. An organization which decides to resurrect superintelligent super-predators after boatloads of human experimentation, plainly tells that to people, and makes it sound like a good idea. And these beautiful taglines!

Are there any pieces of media with something similar? Aperture Science from /Portal/ sort-of fits.

Preferably with the protagonist firmly on the organization's side.
