If you're up for a weird one, there's an it-shouldn't-be-this-good My Little Pony / Lovecraft story called “[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/93572/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dark-lord-sassaflash][The Rise And Fall Of The Dark Lord Sassaflash]]”. In a world of colorful, magical ponies, one four-hooved rationalist fulfills her utility function by becoming a necromancer and facing The Thing Which Must Not Be Named.

The climax feels inspired by HPMOR in its granular logical minutiae, and this story gave me a deep appreciation of the Cosmic Horror genre. E-book can be generated by the site on demand; the doc was finished a while back.
