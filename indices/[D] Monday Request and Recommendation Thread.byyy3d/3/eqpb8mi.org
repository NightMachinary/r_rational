Looking to expand my reading of cosmic horror past HP Lovecraft. I like his stories well enough and appreciate what he did for the horror genre, but holy hell his racism is next level. Any other cosmic horror authors worth checking out? I know cosmic horror is usually explicitly irrational, but I trust the recs I get from these threads.

I'm also looking for more good horror to read in general, if you know something good that isn't necessarily cosmic horror.
