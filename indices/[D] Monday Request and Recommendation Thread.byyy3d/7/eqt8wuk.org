Following [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bq4y0i/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eo2v0kq/][my comment in the worldbuilding thread last month]], what magical youth stories do you enjoy? I watched /Star Driver/ because of the mech design, and I keep up with /PMMM: To The Stars/, but what slice-of-life-y magical-youth stories (manga or literature) are there that I can draw from for inspiration for the thing I'm working on?
