  Why do they have a col[o]r... and what are the advantage[s] of that way of separating people compared to our societal structure? Is it just a fun idea the author had or is there solid underlying logic beneath? Does seeing specific col[o]r correspond with particular personality traits or intelligence or something?

In-story, the characters justify following the sometimes-confusing Word of Munsell by holding order as a virtue in itself: a Rule that at first glance seems counterproductive still should be followed, because failing to follow it probably will cause disorder further down the line. Also, the Collective produces "synthetic color" by mining the ruins of the Previous for color-bearing items, and people who can see color are necessary for telling which items are worth scavenging.

It's revealed by a semi-Riffraff late in the book that the Collective actually is just a giant experiment.

  As for conflicts I was actually more interested in say red vs[.] green. Typically when you divide people the ingroup-outgroup mentality gradually increases and it seems intuitive to me that a society that specifically uses that mechanism would need goo[d] conflict negotiation mechanics to stay coherent.

The constant threat of demerits seems to be the only conflict-resolution mechanic, but it works fairly well. The Prefects (at least 70% color perception) delegate their authority to Senior Monitors (50%), who in turn delegate to Junior Monitors; all of these people can take away merits if they see an infraction of the Rules. As mentioned previously, decisions of a Prefect can be appealed to the Prefects of the next town over, and presumably decisions of a Monitor can be appealed to that Monitor's superior.
