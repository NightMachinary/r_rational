I'm gonna have to partially counter-recommend that. I thought the beginning was great, and OP should read some of it at least, but IIRC somewhere around the first third it starts taking itself too seriously and the writing takes a dive. I recommend stopping when that happens instead of doing like me and continuing to read an unenjoyable work for like 100k more words.
