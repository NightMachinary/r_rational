Sounds like you would really enjoy "Better Off Ted"

[[https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1235547/]]

The main character is Ted, a middle manager at an evil/crazy science corporation. He has a cold and ruthless corporate boss and is in charge of two genius but naive scientists. A lot of the humor centers around the scientists inventing things just because they can then trying to figure out what to do with it, or dealing with evil requests from higher.

I haven't watched it in a while but it used to be on Netflix.
