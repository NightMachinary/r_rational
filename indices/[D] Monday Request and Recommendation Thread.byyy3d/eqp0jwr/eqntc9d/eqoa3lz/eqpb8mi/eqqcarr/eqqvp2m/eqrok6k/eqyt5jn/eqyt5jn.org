Thanks for the recommendation of deeper-darker! It's got a kind of follow along the geniuses feel to it that reminds me of Enders Game with a much faster pace. This does detract from any real stakes for me though, they are all such geniuses in their own ways I never felt any real threat throughout. Ubik's skills do strain belief for me though.
