SCP has tons of horror, varying from Cosmic, to memetic, to fridge horror, to just plain horror. Each story is written by a different author so quality may vary.

Necroscope is a good vampire/supernatural horror series.

Infected by Scott Sigler is a great psychological thriller about a mentally ill man dealing with the first stages of a silent alien invasion.

The Descent by Scott Lang, and it's sequel, start off as regular thrillers and both end on existential horror.

I found Semiosis by Sue Burke to fit well into a scifi horror category but others may argue against that. For me it is clearly fridge horror but that doesnt always qualify as horror to others.
