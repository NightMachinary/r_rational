I'm actually talking within the part of the society that works. Why do they have a colour (I don't know why you are correcting my spelling but I'm assuming it's because you're only familiar with US English) and what are the advantage of that way of separating people compared to our societal structure? Is it just a fun idea the author had or is there solid underlying logic beneath? Does seeing specific colour correspond with particular personality traits or intelligence or something?

As for conflicts I was actually more interested in say red- vs green. Typically when you divide people the ingroup-outgroup mentality gradually increases and it seems intuitive to me that a society that specifically uses that mechanism would need goo conflict negotiation mechanics to stay coherent.
