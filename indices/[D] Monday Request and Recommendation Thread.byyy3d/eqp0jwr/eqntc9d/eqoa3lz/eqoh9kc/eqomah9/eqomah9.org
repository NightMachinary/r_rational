  Does it explore the advantages of the col[o]r distinction and how conflicts between the two factions are handled?

If you're talking about Grey vs. everyone else, that's part of the plot, late in the book. Any person whose best color perception is at least 70% can be appointed Red, Blue, or Yellow Prefect of his town; in a town, these three Prefects act as a panel of judicial and executive authority. (Judgments can be audited by the next village over.) Obviously, then, there can be no Grey representation.

If you're talking about people who aren't part of the Collective and don't have the same color-based physical and mental limitations, those "Riffraff" are mentioned in passing but not actually meaningfully encountered.
