I recently had the pleasure of reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2113260][/Shades of Grey/]] (Fforde, not James) for the second time.

The premise is that, five hundred years after the Previous were wiped out by the Something That Happened, the utopian Collective is a society organized, according to the Rules revealed in the Epiphany of Munsell, by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system][color]]. At the age of twenty, each of the Collective's inhabitants is classified according to his color-vision capability (red, blue, and yellow categories) into Ultraviolet, Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, or---if he scores below ten percent in every category---Grey*. Fraternizing between people of complementary (opposite) colors (e. g., Red and Green) is both officially forbidden and unofficially considered deviant and taboo. All inhabitants of the Collective have very limited color vision (and no night vision), and have physical and mental reactions to certain colors. Doctors (such as the protagonist's father) use swatches of color (taken from the exhaustive Long Swatch in a major office or a Short Swatch light enough for house calls) to induce reactions in their patients, and for this reason are called swatchmen. Certain shades of green are addictive (though Greens are totally immune to them).

Each inhabitant carries a merit book, in which is recorded his merit tally (showing how well he's abided by Munsell's Rules) and his color-vision scores. In addition to a Spot of the proper color, he also may be made to wear badges of pride or of ignominy on his lapel. In addition to the official count in the merit book, merits are traded between Collective members in a semiofficial fashion; a person may have low book merits but high cash merits. Full residency, which includes (/inter alia/) the right to marry, requires 1000 merits; anybody with negative merits gets sent to reÃ«ducation at Reboot, via the Night Train.

Et cetera, et cetera. It's an extremely funny book, and two sequels are planned.

*The localization is a bit inconsistent. "Gr*e*y" and "col*o*r" exist side by side...
