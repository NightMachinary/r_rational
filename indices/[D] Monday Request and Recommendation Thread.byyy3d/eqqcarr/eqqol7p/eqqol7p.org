Thinking about it, HPMOR is exactly this for the first half.

Harry Potter and the Natural 20 has the same flamboyant feeling, but not so much a mystery.

Twig probably has some of this as well, but I haven't read enough to definitively say. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/#post-54733534][Aspects]] has Sylvester act in this way.

I agree that this combination of traits is very enjoyable.
