If you haven't read China Mieville's works, they might be of interest to you. Perdido Street Station, Kraken, and Embassytown are suffused with cosmic horror, though Mieville leans more on slow-burning surreal strangeness than on climactic violin stabs. Also, his fiction is -1000% as racist as Lovecraft's.

House of Leaves is also an easy recommendation if you like strange/thinky/spooky and aren't married to cosmic.

None of the above is rational fic, though certain of Mieville's characters, like Kraken's PoV character, are more rational than average.
