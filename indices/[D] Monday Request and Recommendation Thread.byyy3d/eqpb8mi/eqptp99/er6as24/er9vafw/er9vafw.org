It really is a product of its time, but even knowing that context, Call of Cthulu was pretty... ignorant. Like, I'm just not as scared as 19th century readers must have been by the strange religion of the "savages". It just seems hokey he cared so much about that type of thing. Story holds up if you ignore it, though.
