Alex is such a good writer, though, that I have to believe that he has something planned in this. Mary might be subverted (went unconscious for a moment, then was a bit OOC). Finch, I feel, might be connected further with Harold. Harold is also an idea, but he's stuck in a phylactery. What if he was supposed to be an avatar, like Finch is. Could the ritual Finch fucked with be the one to summon Harold? Could Harold subvert Finch? Could Finch be Harold in disguise?

I'm very skeptical that the point really is passivity. With the whole DM thing, it's kinda like we're the DMs. It has to be satisfying narratively, to us. And it's not. The situation is narratively solved; there must be some sort of climax, even if it's not Uther-style and is still a subversion. It doesn't feel right to just be /nothing/. It feels much more that the characters are rationalizing their own passive experiences with narrative logic, wanting to believe it's over. I feel like it has to get worse; the party's been through some real shit, and it's been a bit of time since something last happened personally to one of them. I'm betting on Mary being subverted or messed with mentally, by Harold, at least. There has to be a reason why she was shown by herself, why the chapter was so odd.

Having done a /whole/ rewrite on that last chapter, it has to be intentional. (Sidenote: the chapters before it definitely made more sense and were more cohesive, in comparison to that last strange one.)
