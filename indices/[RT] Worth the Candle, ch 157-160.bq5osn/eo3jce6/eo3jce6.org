Some of my random thoughts on these chapters:

When Joon is "making the rounds," I specifically got flashbacks to playing Dragon Age when you are at camp and you check in with all your party characters to see what they have to say. Really enjoyed the nostalgia from that.

Val mentions she was useless for most of this arc, but I thought her social reads on Finch were helpful. Also, later on it was nice to see she was wrong about the woman who was working with Harold. I had a bad premonition when she told Joon to kill her immediately and he ignored her. I wasn't sure if that was kind of a reminder to readers that Val wasn't foolproof.

I really enjoy the reactions of strangers to Juniper's party. Finch's reaction to Raven was very entertaining.

I kind of enjoyed the anti-climactic ending. It makes sense in the context that Juniper kind of stumbled into this OP combination with 100 Still. And I think it also makes sense that he gets to stomp a fight after getting this level up like he mentioned in the flashback before the environment actually scales to his ability.

This seems like a good point to really ramp his skills with Soul Scaphism. I assume he will run into some limits so it doesn't actually get 100 in everything, but I don't see how he can get to the level of Fel Seed by some other method.
