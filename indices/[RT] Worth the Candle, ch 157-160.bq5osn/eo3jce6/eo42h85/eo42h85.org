  When Joon is "making the rounds," I specifically got flashbacks to playing Dragon Age when you are at camp and you check in with all your party characters to see what they have to say. Really enjoyed the nostalgia from that.

The whole Loyalty system reads to me like a send-off of older bioware-ish RPG's. You know, the ones where if you sucked up to a character enough, you'd get a special quest or a perk or something? Seeing Joon trying to reconcile what seems to be people with an actual number is amusing. And also an existential nightmare.

Valencia gently calling Joon out for "doing the rounds" just adds to the meta chaos of this serial. I mean it's a common enough narrative beat, even in normal books.

But I got the same sense of nostalgia of wandering around the camp/ship and talking to everyone in private, just as you did.
