- Long Stairs reference is fine, it's Tiff (former newbie) describing something to Maddie (current newbie), probably picked up in the course of hearing people talk about an old campaign.

- Virtues don't show up on the character sheet (or rather, they do for Juniper, but they're not listed for the reader). Same goes for the Conscientious virtue in ch 38, which is still providing a +5 bonus to Romance and Flattery to this very day. Like Ruthless, Mercy can be rescinded, and like some other stat changes, doesn't lower or raise the caps, just alters the behind-the-scenes rolls. Stats get reduced to 0 by Afflictions in ch 10 but don't lower the caps or afflict additional afflictions for being overcapped; same applies to virtues.

- Changed the line in 106 to:

  #+begin_quote
    We had no idea what Tree Magic, Library Magic, or Spirit actually did, which was part of the logic for why I had included them in the build, but it made unlocking them difficult if not impossible until they presented themselves to us in some way.
  #+end_quote

- Groglir and the unnamed variant that Grak primarily speaks are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility][mutually intelligible]] and you basically can't learn one without learning the other. ch 106 is just being somewhat imprecise; a more precise version would be "Groglir and its variants", but I'm not going to change it, because people say "Groglir" meaning everything under the broad umbrella of mutually intelligible languages, and the "common tongue" which is standardized for enhanced mutual intelligibility. There's this line from ch 134, from Grak's POV, which speaks to that:

  #+begin_quote
    “No,” said Grak, shifting uncomfortably at the suggestion. “General information. Things that people might talk about up there.” He was self-conscious about his dialect, a cadet branch of the many-pronged Groglir family tree.
  #+end_quote

- The character sheet gives "flat" stats, but his Essentialism virtue allows him to shift two points around at will. For him to have Library Magic higher than 25 just requires him to be shifting one of his stats over. I /think/ it's consistent with that.

- On Aerb, they're called changelings, but Juniper uses the more D&D standard doppelganger. The only place this was contradicted was in ch 74, when it was used by Fenn (maybe fine because she picked it up from him), but I changed it to changeling for the sake of consistency. Raven knows all about changelings, and in fact, one of Uther's other Knights, Forty-Two, was one (ch 29 and ch 113), she just doesn't know them by the name that Juniper uses.

- Fixed the spelling. It's one of those that probably transposed itself in my head at some point, because if you'd asked me, I would have said "Caeldwich" for sure.

- Bone Magic is special, and gets different kinds of bonuses that are structured as spells rather than virtues. Gem Magic has been missing a virtue for a long, long time, and I still need to retcon one in, but I'll put that off for another day. It was originally going to be something kind of garbage at lvl 10 related to assessing the characteristics of gems after sufficient use.
