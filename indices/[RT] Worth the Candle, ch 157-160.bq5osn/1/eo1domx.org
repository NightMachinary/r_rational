Hey there, I've been rereading the story recently and wrote down a couple of possible mistakes that I've found. I apologize if they're things you've already been told about or that aren't actually mistakes:

- During one of the flashbacks, Reimer mentions Tiff wasn't there for the Long Stairs campaign which she finds regrettable (ch35). We are also told that said campaign was ran twice, once before and once after Arthur's death (ch105). However, at another flashback, with Arthur still alive, we have Tiff referencing the Long Stairs campaign to Maddie, as if she'd been a part of it (ch139).
- At the final fight against Larkspur, Joon got a Virtue called Mercy, that supposedly gave him CHA +1. However, not only did he not get that point on his stats, but said virtue was never mentioned again (ch 50).
- On chapter 106, Juniper says "We had no idea what Tree Magic, Library Magic, or Spirit actually did, which was part of the logic for why I had taken them (besides Spirit, which I had started with)", implying he didn't start with Library Magic, which he did.
- When Juniper first asks about dwarven language, Grak says Groglir is the common tongue of dwarves and that the language of his clan wouldn't suit Juniper (ch 50). Perhaps I misunderstood, but my interpretation was that these were two distinct things (Groglir and his clan's language). Yet later, when relating Grak's early life it's said that "Groglir was the only language he ever heard spoken" (ch 106).
- Juniper says Library Magic has KNO as primary and INS as secondary (ch 129), but at chapter 138 he appears to have it at level 30 even though his INS is 5.
- At one point, Juniper mentions Uther had destroyed the secret to creating doppelgängers (ch 72). Later on, when Juniper uses the word, Raven asks what's a doppelgänger, which seems strange for someone who supposedly knew about all of Uther's adventures (ch 144).
- On chapters 144 and 151, the capital city of Anglecynn is called Caeldwich, on every other instance it is called Caledwich.
- Reimer says skills give a virtue at either level 10 or 20 (ch 144), but neither Gem or Bone Magic have any virtues listed, despite having been above 20 for a while.
