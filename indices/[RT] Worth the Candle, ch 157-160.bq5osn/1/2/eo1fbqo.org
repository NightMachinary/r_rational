Bone magic got a level 30 virtue that lets him use unicorn magic by burning their bones, but you're right about it not getting a level 10 virtue.

Also, I think the virtue give effective skill, not actual attributes. So Mercy can give him the charisma of someone one point higher than his current level, but that doesn't alter the ability caps. Griefstricken gave him some serious negatives, but his skills didn't decay because they were suddenly over their caps.
