My impression is that he's basically a lich with a memetic phylactery. As long as the idea of him exists, he can't die, but otherwise he's basically a normal dude. It's possible that the memetic component has some weirder properties to it, but evidently they're not weird enough to fundamentally change the way that he behaves given that Val read him just fine.
