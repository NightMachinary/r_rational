I really didn't like how he ignored Val's repeated warnings to kill or gag the woman. He just ignored Val, despite her obvious expertise and serious concern. Considering the explosion word was likely to kill all present but him and Finch, its really hard to see this as a good decision, not a lucky break. In general talking is good, particularly when you actually have a quite strong counter argument to their main motivation, but surely you can give the woman a pencil or something. I don't blame Joon much for Ello, since I assume he was angling for a safe chance to touch him.

I also felt Amaryllis should have easily managed to activate the immobility plate within 6 seconds. And isn't the point of the time chamber that very little time takes place externally? I seem to remember a month running in 45min, which would mean the 6 hours would take ~22.5 sec. Even if they spent more time speeding up and down surely she spent much longer descending and evacuating. Maybe I'm mis-remembering or the activation time is really long?

I'm curious what Joon would be able to do with soul and spirit while touching Harold. Maybe a bad idea to be fair. Harold seems like he might be connected to, or a creation of Fel Seed. The jar of flesh bit just sounds on theme, and there's the World Lord connection. I'd note that the description given of the World Lords doesn't necessarily indicate annihilation of Aerb, just its end. Any group that includes Fel Seed is likely to indicate a wee bit of horrific torture.
