It's interesting that everyone telling him not to talk to people is reason enough to talk to people. Not that I disagree with you, just that it's ironic. Sometimes I find the story can get a bit bogged down by tedious meta-narrative talk, but other times it raises interesting questions.

I agree. I like June's idealism and the way he indulges himself a little bit, whether it be by going blade-bound instead of whatever mage is optimal or by choosing to let the villain monologue.
