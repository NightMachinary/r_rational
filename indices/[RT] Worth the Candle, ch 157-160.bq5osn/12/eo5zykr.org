Bit late, but here's [[https://imgur.com/HAQ8LOz][some art that captures the eldritchy, World-Lordy feel of Mome Rath]].

Valencia too? :( Being a companion to an Uther-like figure is a lot like being a friend to a depressive... It's more functional rather than emotional here, but still the same ol' feelings of uselessness. At least it's not for a lack of trying from either side.

On the bright side, Grak had his moment to shine (and Val with Darri)! Hopefully he didn't suffer a TBI/lobotomy and gets some affirmative love from Joon so he can appreciate his contributions and worth without dwelling on past shortcomings.
