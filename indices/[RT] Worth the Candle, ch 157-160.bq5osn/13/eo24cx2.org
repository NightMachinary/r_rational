benevolent world exploders do seem a lot more appealing when there's a literal, demonstrable hell and one's grown pessimistic across centuries of failing to destroy it (where one repeatedly hits an insurmountable wall in the form of godly exclusions, rather than a surmountable wall in the form of mortal counter-agents / demons or no wall at all in the form of ignorance). I can see an argument for ending the populations that feed it, even if the hell itself can never end, since the immense suffering of even a small fraction from the source population could quickly outweigh all the happy lives that end in oblivion. Have wanted to read a story with a principled neg-U antagonist for a while now, we'll see if that's where this one goes! (haven't finished all the new chapters yet)

edit: finished the latest chapters, I guess Harold was defeated? But maybe the cult is still around, and Harold was just one of their pawns? Guess we'll see!
