Fucking reddit sometimes, I swear to Christ this website needs to get its shit together. The problem was caused by a difference in how new reddit and old reddit handle the Markdown; in old reddit (and on reddit is fun) it looked fine, but new reddit interprets the Markdown differently, for some asinine reason. Because fuck backwards compatibility, I guess.
