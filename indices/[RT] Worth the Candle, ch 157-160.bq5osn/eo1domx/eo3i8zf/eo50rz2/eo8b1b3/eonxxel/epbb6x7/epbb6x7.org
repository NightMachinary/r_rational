Does mutual intelligibility require that you /immediately/ understand the language, rather than just that “understanding the /language/” (e.g. the grammar, vocabulary, etc.) is a trivial problem once you manage to parse out how the language is being used?

There are /accents/ that make people nearly impossible to understand, but they're certainly still speaking the same language, not even in a different dialect, and you would usually consider such people to be “mutually intelligible” to people without their accent. It just takes time to adapt your ears (or your eyes, in terms of written “accents” like Traditional Chinese, Braille, or Tolkien's Elvish) to the variant /presentation/ the language is taking, but once you do, it's the same words in the same structure, with nothing new to figure out.
