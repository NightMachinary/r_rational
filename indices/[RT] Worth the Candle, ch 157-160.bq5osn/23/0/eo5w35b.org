That makes me wonder, what is the criteria for being a World Lord?

I don't think it's just immense power because that would mean there are potentially many of them, and if that's the case, why should having 3 of them appear at the same time cause the end? That doesn't mesh. It sounds like 3 appearing would cause the end because of the way they interact with each other, so there'd only be 3, but what Finch said also made it sound like there's more than that.

So yeah, dunno.
