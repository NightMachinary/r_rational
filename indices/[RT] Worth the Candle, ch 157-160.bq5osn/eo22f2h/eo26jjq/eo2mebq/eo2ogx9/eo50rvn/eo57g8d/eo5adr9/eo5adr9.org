In theory, sure. This isn't an unsolvable problem, I was more just pointing out that it isn't yet a solved problem.

I say this as someone who will gladly replace my manual driving car with a self driving car as soon as it's economically feasible for me to do so; in the meantime, I mostly walk/bus/train, and only use my car when I have to transport large things or my dog, or if I'm going somewhere that is far off from the transit system, since all of those options are fairly similar to self-driving, from my own perspective.
