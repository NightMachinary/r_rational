Okay, yeah, I'm a little over-anxious about cars.

That said:

- You're counting the chance of dying when driving. The site puts the lifetime odds of dying in a car accident, period, as 1 in 103, which is still pretty bad. (though a selfish rational actor would care more about the odds of dying than the odds of killing a random pedestrian)

- Glancing at that wikipedia page, and from prior exposure to the subject, my hunch is that robot cars are already as safe or safer than human-driven cars. Realistically, legalizing them on a wide scale would be extremely unlikely to cause accident spikes, and would probably decrease accidents pretty fast, especially with network effects (autonomous cars can coordinate with each other to avoid accidents), the fact that any accidents involving autonomous car are still extremely likely to be due to the human factor (eg, a robot car might hit a human-driven car because the robot didn't anticipate the human being reckless, but a robot car will basically never hit another robot car, so robot cars would get safer the more robot cars there is), and the fact that large amounts of field driving data would help refine driving algorithms much faster.

I think the biggest block is that people are visualizing human-error accident as a known quantity where blame can be assigned, whereas self-driving cars feel like a new danger where /anything/ could happen. That said, I think Emmanuel Macron recently mentioned the urgency of getting safe self-driving cars on the road, so maybe we'll see things moving here.

But yeah, fine, I guess humans aren't that terrible at avoiding obviously horrifying things.
