The existence of the Hells and other stuff in Aerb is really strong evidence for Intelligent Design in setting. It is also extremely strong evidence that the Designer is a sadistic evil monster. Any method of ending the world is necessarily untested. You have no guarantee that your method of triggering the apocalypse will actually end the world, will destroy the hells, will not result with the Designer resetting things or will not result in the Designer creating worse horrors.
