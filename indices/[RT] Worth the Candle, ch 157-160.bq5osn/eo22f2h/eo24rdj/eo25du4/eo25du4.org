Yeah but that's because we're reading about Joon and know he's the next Uther, we know he'll fix all these problems, but from Ellio's perspective, there is no solution and there never has been. If he had known that there was a hero coming to fix everything, he wouldn't have decided to destroy everything. From what information everyone else in the world has, the correct choice should be destroy it all.
