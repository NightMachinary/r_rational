Thanks for writing! A long wait, but definitely worth it. I loved that the narrative played an important role again, especially in the last chapter. It's one of my favorite things in WtC.

June will probably have to use soul magic on Grak to fix his brain, since conventional healing magic isn't able to do that. Interesting, since he just altered someone else's soul for his own purposes for the first time...
