  Not a typo as such, but it seems odd for Finch, a gnome, to use "a human advisor" as shorthand for "a more intelligent advisor" in 157.

Not a "more intelligent" advisor. Harold's problem wasn't that he lacked intelligence as such, or even planning ability. Rather, I took it that he was overly focused on plans that contained some clear and specific mechanism for destroying the world, as opposed to increasing the likelihood of world-destruction in general, nonspecific ways. The benefit of a human advisor wouldn't be intelligence in general, but rather simply lacking those particular blind spots.

Further, Juniper was summarizing Finch's information, not quoting him outright.
