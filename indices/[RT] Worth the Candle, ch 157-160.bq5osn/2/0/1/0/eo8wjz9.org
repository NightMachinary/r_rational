You know, I was wondering whether anyone was going to be cynical enough to say "oh, well of course they 'banned it', this is just like greenwashing, /obviously/ there are still zombie-made goods, they're just funneled through shell companies and have different branding, it's same shit, different day, and the ban is mostly in place to let the politicians look like they've done something and the allow the people to feel morally superior while still getting their cheap goods, do you think certification boards aren't subject to regulatory capture" and so on.
