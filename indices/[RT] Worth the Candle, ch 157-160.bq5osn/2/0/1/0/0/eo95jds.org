It's funny, I had the opposite reaction, "Of course the guy was going to bankrupt, he put a big fat target on his own back and has a supply chain that is extremely easy to disrupt (just put a wall around his exclusion zone and, if you're feeling ruthless, burn his crops down)".

Also, I'd expect the good Captain to react to the boycott by eventually promising to give his zombies their free will and pay them for their labor. They would likely accept fairly low wages, given that they probably don't need to eat or sleep and their expenditures would be on status and entertainment consumption, and he could probably argue that people in his domain would rather get some extra years after death even if their elongated lifetime came at the cost of unskilled labor.

It would be less of a black-and-white problem, because people would still have cause to worry that zombies are being exploited and their "consent" is an illusion given that Captain Blue still has a metaphorical gun to their head 24/7, but everyone in the supply chain would have cause to downplay these concerns and minimize the effectiveness of regulatory oversight over Blue-in-the-Bottle Industries.
