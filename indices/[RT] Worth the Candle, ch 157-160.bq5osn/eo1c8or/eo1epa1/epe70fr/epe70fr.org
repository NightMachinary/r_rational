Switched it to mortal, which sounds a /little/ off, but that's partly because we don't have an equivalent to "sentient species with human-like intelligence". It's /probably/ the word that he would use though, because yes, saying "human" is privileging that species in a way that a gnome usually wouldn't.

Fixed the others.
