It's pretty clear that Mary was given a solo quest (that she couldn't see the notification for) to take down the temple.

But, in combination with the fact that she was the point-of-view character for those chapters, this makes me wonder: can the game, temporarily, consider more than Joon to be â€˜players' in the sense of them being the focal point of the DM changing things around to make for a nice narrative?

For the periods that Mary is the POV character, will she get sidekicks? Love interests sacrificing themselves for her? Etc.

And, if so, is it literally the active point-of-view of a given chapter/section of the story we're reading, /Worth the Candle/, that determines who is under this effect? Could the protagonists find an entad to detect who the story is following, and take advantage of that?
