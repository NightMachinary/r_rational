I thought these last couple of chapters were pretty high quality.

I feel like we got an /extremely/ respectable amount of worldbuilding done, like seriously.

The other highlights for me were Darri/Ellio's monologues, Raven/Pallida, zombies (!), and the teleportation spear.

Looking forwards to more chapters.
