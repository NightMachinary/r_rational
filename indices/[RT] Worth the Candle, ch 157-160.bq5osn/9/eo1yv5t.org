The writing is as always, great in this set of chapters. The author really knows how to use pace changes successfully, and I love the way the emotional progression is written in this story. Characters grow into a healthier place (except Fenn), and their feelings are realistic even as they grow. WTC is one of my favorite stories online or in print.
