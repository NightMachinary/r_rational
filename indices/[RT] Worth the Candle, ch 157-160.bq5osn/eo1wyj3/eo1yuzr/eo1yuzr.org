On the fact letting enemies talk it could also play into the DnD angle as simply going for the fight would talk away one aspect of the role-playing and could thusly be punished by the Dungeon Master. Just killing people is not the best angle of attack as information would be lost then. There is also the fact everyone is telling him not to talk to people seem slike a big clue to having to talk to them. Its also a good sign for June that he is treating the people as people and keeping that in mind such immediate violence can become a slippery moral slope, as such action become normalized. That's not to say that he hasn't attacked people such as the prince after mary early on in the story. The act of nonchalantly defeating an enemy ala Indian Jones may seem cool but realistically very disturbing behaviour in a person. Part of Junes charm is his streak of idealism in this world.
