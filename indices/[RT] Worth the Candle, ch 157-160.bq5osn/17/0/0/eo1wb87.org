Yeah but if it's that it's kinda unexciting. Like one of the most boring possible ways being an idea can work. Would be neater if people believing he grew an extra arm caused him to appear as having an extra arm. Or people sufficiently aware that he's an idea being able to ignore his attacks.

If he's a normal dude except he can't be killed if people know about him, the most interesting questions that remain are: “where does he poof back from after death - a nearby broom closet?” And “what bad things can he do if he and Juniper turn against each other and Juniper can't manage to imprison him?”
