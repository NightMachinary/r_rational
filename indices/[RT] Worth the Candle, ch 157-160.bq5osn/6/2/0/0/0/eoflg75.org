I'm struggling to interpret this comment. The argument was meant to convince Juniper + co., and it's worth noting that Juniper is one of those â€˜life is worth hanging on to even when horrible' people. Since they were making a decision about other peoples' (including future peoples') lives, the beliefs of those affected are relevant.
