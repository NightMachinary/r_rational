  The eternal suffering of a trillion stacked against the lives of billions. It's a no brainer to me that the moral decision is to just end it all and save all those being tortured there.

Eeeehhhhhhh

I mean sure if those were the only two options, then maybe that would make sense.

But this is the problem with fanatics - they tend to turn the world into a black and white dichotomy, where you need to choose between the One True Action and the Wrong Action, and it's perfectly clear which is which.

On Aerb, it's entirely possible to conceive of a future where all those souls in the hells are saved, even without Joon's PC shenanigans - I imagine some combination of high powered revision magic and soul magic would be able to wipe out the millennia of torture that they've experienced, and unwind their experiences back to the point just before they died.

It's just going to take time and effort. And it needs for the world to not end first.

Which means that saying "eh fuck it, this world is objectively irrecoverable, time to burn it all down" is not necessarily the right thing to do.
