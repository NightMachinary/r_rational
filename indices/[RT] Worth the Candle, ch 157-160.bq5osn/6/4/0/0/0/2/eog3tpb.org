> But I don't see how that argument applies to the Hells.

Even if it doesn't (and the other posters provided good examples of why it does). Once we start noticing intelligent design across many different aspects, one has to begin assuming it applies everywhere. Even if it was just Entads, Magic, Souls, and Exclusions which implied intelligent design, it would then seem likely that such an entity would also be responsible for designing the concept of the Hells.
