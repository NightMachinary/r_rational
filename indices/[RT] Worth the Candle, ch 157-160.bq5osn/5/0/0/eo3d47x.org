I was thinking the same. Obviously Joon is meant to become broken in terms of power or else he won't be able to do the things he destined to do. I was actually thinking while reading these chapters that I imagine from what we know of the DM that he really does allow the world and people develop naturally and he's not just going to revise history or an event to fit his goals instead he will go ground level and fix things. So for the most part the beings of his world have free will but when one of them unintentionally figures out a broken mechanic of his system and it would seriously affect his plot to an extreme degree and he can't figure out a natural way to rebalance the system he excludes them. Honestly I'm surprised Joon thinks of the exclusionary principle as a natural phenomenon that might happen to him when it definitely comes off as a tool the DM uses when he realizes one of his characters is about to takeover/destroy/unify and bring peace to the world prior to Joon arriving. So yeah he definitely should worry about the threats ramping up but exclusion not so much unless it really is some natural mechanic that the DM set up and doesn't directly control.
