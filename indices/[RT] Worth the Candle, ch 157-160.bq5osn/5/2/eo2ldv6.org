  I'll be honest, I was 100% expecting Amaryllis to either die or get Harolded, which I was not looking forward to. Mind-control is always a special kind of creepy and uncomfortable to me, so I'm glad we didn't get a repeat of the soul mage episode like I was worried about.

I'm not convinced she wasn't. Remember, she blacked out briefly, flying through the air. Harold could have done something to her during that time. To me, at least, she felt a bit odd later in the chapter. Either Alex's writing quality dropped, or something bad happened, and I'm pretty damn confident about his writing quality.
