I'll be honest, I was 100% expecting Amaryllis to either die or get Harolded, which I was not looking forward to. Mind-control is always a special kind of creepy and uncomfortable to me, so I'm glad we didn't get a repeat of the soul mage episode like I was worried about.

On a completely unrelated note, these chapters (and the last one especially) really brought home just how broken June is now, and I'm not really sure what things will be like going forward. He's just leapfrogged so far ahead in power that everyone else is more liability than asset in most circumstances, and the few things that can legitimately threaten him have to be both really strong and really weird.

The obvious route to solving that problem is just for him to get excluded, but that would strike me as really unsatisfying. I mean, it'd be one thing if he sacrificed his power for some purpose or lost it in some fight, but the nature of exclusions is so arbitrary that it feels like the fun police showing up to take your toys away. It would also cast a bit of a shadow on every future increase in power, knowing that if June get's /too/ strong he'll get punished for it.

The other possible route forward I can think of is that this is the start of the end game. This is the part where June starts doing the truly impossible shit, like ending the hells and killing Fell Seed, and it won't be long until we get another conversation with the DM. I'm sort of hoping that this is the case, because it would mean that we start getting some answers to a lot of the questions that have been lurking in the background.
