Him being force unconscious seems like not a big deal if he ever gets a few days of time afterwards to prepare (most of the time can be in the time chamber). Have Kenner's Eye, boost still magic again, boost soul magic, substitute around for skills you want (probably fewer of the combat skills and more magics), and scrape a bunch of backup souls for stats to get everything to level 100, including woodworking. Most of this (other than getting Kenner's eye) can be done in the time chamber.
