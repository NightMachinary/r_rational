When I saw this line I briefly entertained the idea that Finch might be the DMPC. Perhaps indirectly, which would explain the anomaly Valencia saw while reading him.

But now that he's given Juniper an answer... maybe he is in multiple places at once, and he was learning more at the exact moment Valencia was inspecting him.

I imagine Juniper used Spirit against Ellio to ensure no connection to Harold. Would Spirit be sufficient to ensure he was forthcoming also? (Not that the moral consideration Amaryllis has is any different; it's still crossing that moral boundary.)

If the source of Harold is an entad, they /really/ should not take it inside Bethel. I am not even sure what the consequences are. Do they fight for control? Does Bethel get still more terrifying powers?
