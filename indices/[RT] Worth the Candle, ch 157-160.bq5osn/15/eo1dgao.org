I feel like these chapters, while having some individual good elements (like Raven/Padilla), didnt work too well for me, and its hard to pin down. It is always challenging to write a "deliberate" anti-climax in an interesting way, but i think it can be done, while here the elements dont jive too well.

I think the big issue is that Mary's separation from the group turned out to be pointless. She accomplished little, didnt send knowledge of the temple to joon and co, and just sortof hung around. Which, since the final "message" was in a way /for/ her, makes her complete passivity in the arc unsatisying. And her separation means she gets no buildup to that conclusion till the last chapter. I understand the "point" is passivity, but i mean it in a narrative sense - she doesnt get screentime.

Same with other revelations i think - Finch's "Idea" revelation happens on a backtrop of nonthreatening enemies with little consequences to the arc, and gets only a few sentences of explication and doesnt seem relevant thematically. The threads dont come together too well (need more skill ranks in Spirit Magic!)

Still a fun chapter of course, we appreciate the struggle for our collective enjoyment!
