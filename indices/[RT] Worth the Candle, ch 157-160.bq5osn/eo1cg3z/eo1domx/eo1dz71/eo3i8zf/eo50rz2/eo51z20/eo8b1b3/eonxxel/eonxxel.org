  Norwegian and Danish are two different languages despite being more or less mutually intelligible.

Utter fucking bullshit. Danish is completely impossible to understand by anyone who has not actively learned to speak it. Source: am Dutch, speak some Swedish and Norwegian, but not even a sliver of Danish. It's pretty doable to read, but absolutely impossible to understand in spoken language.
