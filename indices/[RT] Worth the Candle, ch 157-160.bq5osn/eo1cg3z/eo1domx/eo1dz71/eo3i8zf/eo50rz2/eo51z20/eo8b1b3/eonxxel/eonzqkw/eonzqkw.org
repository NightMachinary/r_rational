And I speak pretty good french but there are a lot of French accents that are completely unintelligible to me, but a native speaker would be able to parse if they slow down. Similarly Danish and norwegian are almost identical grammatically, it's just that their pronunciations have diverged quite a bit. Native speakers can understand each other by going slowly and/or just getting used to the heavy accents. They are as similar as many dialects are.
