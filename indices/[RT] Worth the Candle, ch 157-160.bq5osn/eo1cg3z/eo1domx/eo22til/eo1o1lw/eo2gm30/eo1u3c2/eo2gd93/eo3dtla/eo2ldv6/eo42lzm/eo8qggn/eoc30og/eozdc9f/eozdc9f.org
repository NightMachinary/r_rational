What he's got now is a result of getting still magic to 80, which he can repeat at the expense of trained skills, and allows him to stack buffs. To repeat, he would have to retrain his sacrifice skills, then sacrifice them again, with the optional additional step of getting hit with Prince's Invulnerability again. In his current state, he stacks normally time-limited buffs indefinitely, so I'm sure we're about to find out that Prince's Invulnerability prevents mitosis and is rapidly becoming dangerous to his health, because otherwise this is an absurd leap in power.
