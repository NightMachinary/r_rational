I agree that it seems weird for them to be working together, the claim that if three World Lords are on Aerb at once the world ends seems like a fairly strong implication of connection. Maybe there's some other mechanism that will cause the world end if three of a set of otherwise independent monsters are out at the same time, but that doesn't seem like the most parsimonious explanation.
