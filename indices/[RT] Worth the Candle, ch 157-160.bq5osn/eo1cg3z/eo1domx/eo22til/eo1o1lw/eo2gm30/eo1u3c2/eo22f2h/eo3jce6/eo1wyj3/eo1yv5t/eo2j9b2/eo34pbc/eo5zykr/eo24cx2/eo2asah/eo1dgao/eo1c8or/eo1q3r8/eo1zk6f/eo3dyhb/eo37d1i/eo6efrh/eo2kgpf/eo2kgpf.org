I'm not really satisfied with that last chapter. It doesn't really feel like they faced a challenge and got changed because of it, like everything else that's happened. Sure, Jun discovered this OP thing, and some other stuff, but their discussion at the end of the chapter feels very flimsy. Like rationalizing what the DM is planning.

Harold doesn't seem like he'd accept just dying in a jar like that. It feels like he'd be able to fly away to +fight+ end the world another day.

I'm really worried about Amaryllis. She blacked out briefly in the sky, enough that Harold could have affected her. Her brief thoughts about destroying everything seem a bit out of character. Not completely unrealistic, with the whole call of void thing, but still strange. Her entire thing has been building up society, not thoughts about breaking it. It could be that those thoughts were the catalyst for doing so, but it's just strange. Especially with the black out.

I expected Amaryllis to either need to be rescued from Harold, at first, or later that she'd defeat Harold by herself. It would have been super cool to have her ultimately solve the problem, with her reaching the temple first. Instead, it was just a bit disappointing. It was super weird for Jun and Finch to just appear at the temple so fast. I thought Amaryllis would have cool responsibility and what not, but everything was solved by Jun, easy peazy. The "peace" at the moment feels really uncomfortable and fake. I'm on edge.

157-159 were amazing and great. But 160 just felt off. Alex is such a good author though, that it /must/ be on purpose. There /has/ to be something crazy coming soon. (A thinker style reveal/change vs a brute style reveal/change, like Jun's hack.)

--------------

Narratively, it would make perfect sense if Finch's powers come from Harold. What if people tried to summon Harold originally, as this idea of destruction avatar thing? But Finch fucked it up and "killed" himself. Now, his body is now the idea of Finch, instead of the idea of Destruction/Oblivion. Harold, now, is just that thought-form, stuck in a phylactery, instead of the original planned body. This would also be amazing mirroring in the narrative, too. You could also have Finch either betray our cast, or be subverted by Harold. It really does seem like there's a connection there.

The "you can't kill idea" thing is kinda obvious. I also kinda expected Jun (or maybe Mary) to figure out a way /to/ kill an idea, and end up killing both Harold and Finch.

They're connected. I guarantee it. Something is fishy. Shit is about to go down, even further. This is my prediction.
