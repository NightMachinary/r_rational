Yeah, I'm not sure if the characters meant it was weak because they had privileged information (Valencia) or weak in general.

But yeah, if the world really was that apathetic to the existence of provable hells, I would probably join a doomsday cult too. I would totally be onboard with the Second Empire as well if they had anything that looked like a plan to end hells.

(although I think the story is exaggerating how apathetic people can be to truly horrifying things; like, yes, people drive cars and that's insane, and they don't always wear seatbelts, and they drive around with their /kids/ instead of always using the train, and we have working automated driving technology and we've barely started using it even the though opportunity cost in human lives is huge, and what was I arguing for again?)
