You are confusing human conceptual distinctions in the map with the territory. There is no special distinction built into the universe between kidneys and non-kidneys. There is no special point at which a bunch of growing cells suddenly becomes a kidney and behaves differently. The territory remains the territory regardless of how you divide things in the map. Universal phenomena do not care for conceptual distinctions.

Kidneys are quite reductionist.

Nobody decides what certain conditions are necessary for something to get a kidney or how kidneys in particular behave. Kidney is just a human categorization for a certain group of cells with some particular characteristics. Cell is just a human categorization for a certain group of chemicals with some particular characteristics. Chemical is just a human categorization... and so on. All of it obeys the same physics as everything else.

Death is also a conceptual distinction that is not built into the universe. Kidneys don't have some magic time limit. Their cells decay individually according to simple laws of physics.
