One note about the robot car argument for network effects - this is definitely a purely theoretical benefit at this point in time, and I would be somewhat skeptical of that being realized very soon, as people tend to be very possessive of their cars, so you would need to provide a more active benefit than just safety in order to get people to opt in to giving away all of their geolocation data to a private company.
