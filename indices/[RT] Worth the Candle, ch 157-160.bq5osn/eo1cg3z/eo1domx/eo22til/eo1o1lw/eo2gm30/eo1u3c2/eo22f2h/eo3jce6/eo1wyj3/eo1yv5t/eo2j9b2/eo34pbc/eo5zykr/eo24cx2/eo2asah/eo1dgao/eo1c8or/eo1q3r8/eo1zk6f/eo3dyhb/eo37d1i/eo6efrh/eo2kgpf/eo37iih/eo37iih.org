  The "you can't kill idea" thing is kinda obvious. I also kinda expected Jun (or maybe Mary) to figure out a way to kill an idea, and end up killing both Harold and Finch.

Though it's far from the first work of fiction to talk about the ability (or lack thereof) for ideas to be killed, given the clear influence that SCP has had on this story it seems possible that was inspired by this quote from the antimemetics division series:

"Ideas can be killed," she says, stepping into the airlock.

"How?"

"With better ideas."
