My read on the woman working with Harold was that she knew the word that would kill everybody. So yeah, Valencia was right to be very worried, they could have all died, depending on Joon's reaction time and luck sense, as I don't Valencia could read her accurately and shoot her fast enough, not with the switch time between devils and demonds. Luckily, the risk paid off.
