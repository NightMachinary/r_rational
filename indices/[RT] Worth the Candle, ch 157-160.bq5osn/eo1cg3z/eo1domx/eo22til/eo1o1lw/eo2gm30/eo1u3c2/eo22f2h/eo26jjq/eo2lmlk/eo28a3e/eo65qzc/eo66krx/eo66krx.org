It's true that in a setting as fantastical as this, magic is very plausibly a solution to the hells but given that Uther himself nor the world at large for the last 500 years managed to do this, the plausibility is low. Without privileged information, you'd rightly assume the task to be nigh impossible or something that won't be discovered for hundreds or thousands of additional years.

And as for undoing their pain. That's just missing the point. If I stab you in the hand, the pain you experience is real to you in the moment and no argument of I'll make you forget this ever happened after will lessen that pain or console you during the fact.
