  Harold doesn't seem like he'd accept just dying in a jar like that. It feels like he'd be able to fly away to end the world another day.

I don't know. Harold was apparently bad enough at destroying the world, he was never recorded succeeding at it in the Infinite Library. It could be that he's always so subtle that even when he ends the world, the librarians attribute it to some other cause, but there's no reason the Uniquities wouldn't write at least a few "the Entropy Kraken is about destroy the world, we think it might be Harold" reports for the library to intercept.
