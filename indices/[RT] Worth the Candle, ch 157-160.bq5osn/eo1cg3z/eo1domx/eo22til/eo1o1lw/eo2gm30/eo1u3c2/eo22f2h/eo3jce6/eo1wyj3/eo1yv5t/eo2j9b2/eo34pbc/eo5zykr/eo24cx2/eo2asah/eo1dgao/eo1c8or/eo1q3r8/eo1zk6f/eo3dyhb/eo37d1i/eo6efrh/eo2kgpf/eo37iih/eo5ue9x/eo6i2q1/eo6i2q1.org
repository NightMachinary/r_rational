I mean, it makes more sense in the original context of the story. Can't be more specific without major spoilers regarding the antimemetics division. Bear in mind though that the idea in question here was more than your typical memetic hazard, it was a complex conceptual entity. Making everyone forget about it would at best slow it down, but it's an idea that has anomalous effects even without anyone knowing about it (including an antimemetic effect to /prevent/ people from knowing about it).

Finch is probably a similar case, in that while he IS an idea, his existence and influence aren't dependent on people knowing about him.
