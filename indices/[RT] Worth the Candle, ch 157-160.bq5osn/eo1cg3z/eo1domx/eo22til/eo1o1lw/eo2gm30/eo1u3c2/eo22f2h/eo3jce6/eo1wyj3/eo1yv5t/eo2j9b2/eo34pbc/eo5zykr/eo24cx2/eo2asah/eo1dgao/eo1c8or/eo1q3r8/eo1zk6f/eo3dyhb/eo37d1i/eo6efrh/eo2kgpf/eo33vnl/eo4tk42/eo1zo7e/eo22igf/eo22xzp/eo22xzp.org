Ellio's teenage epiphany:

#+begin_quote
  “I realized it all when I was a teenager,” said Ellio, seeming grateful that he would get to talk. “I realized how cold and cruel it all was, how people would delude themselves into thinking that it wasn't. I was afraid of dying then, afraid of the hells after I saw what was there, and when I looked around me, other people weren't, they didn't act like they should have if eternity were on the line. They did stupid, risky things like leaving their house without a bottle and a spike hanging from their hip. They slept without someone watching over them, or worse, alone. They didn't act like eternal torture was on the line. They acted like it would sort itself out.

does remind me a lot of HPEV's similar one when he first realised he couldn't trust adults after his mother told him "not to think about" how something that happened in the newspaper could happen to him. Though I can't find that paragraph in HPMOR right now.
