  Aerb is a world where souls exist and go to the Hells when their owners die. There are many layers of Hell and the beings there thrive off of suffering.

  Yeah this is complex I guess, but not in the same way as an item that says you can only use me 3 times a day under certain conditions.

It is complex in the same way.

​

What decides what conditions are necessary for something get a soul? Personhood and intelligence are fuzzy non-natural artificial divisions.

What decides what souls are? Why are they a copy of consciousness / a person's neural network ?

​

What decides what conditions are necessary for someone to be considered dead for their soul to be released? What happens to the soul if you cut someone in half vertically and then heal each half so there are two of them?

​

What decides on the time limit for souls and why are they are teleported to the hells?

​

What decides what particular states of consciousness / network network state are useful for devils? What created the devils?

​

What decided on the criteria used to determine which hell a soul goes to?
