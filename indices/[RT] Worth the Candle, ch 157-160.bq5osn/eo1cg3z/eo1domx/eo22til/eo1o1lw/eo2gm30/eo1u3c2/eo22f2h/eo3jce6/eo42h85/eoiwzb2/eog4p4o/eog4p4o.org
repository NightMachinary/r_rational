> I had a bad premonition when she told Joon to kill her immediately and he ignored her. I wasn't sure if that was kind of a reminder to readers that Val wasn't foolproof.

I took that differently (I may be thinking of a different scene). But reading a person committed to a path that involves killing trillions is always going to trip a "this person will do anything" kind of sense; like looking at a gun without the safety on. I think that's more of an interpretation problem on Val's part (her not having an understanding of psychology deep enough to reflect on what she is interpreting), a lack of mental skills to understand what the social skills are telling her.

But I guess in a way that is pointing out how she as a whole isn't foolproof.
