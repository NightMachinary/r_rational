I wonder what people's thoughts are on June's propensity to allow his cornered enemies to talk with their fingers on the nuclear button (or an imagined one). It might just be a happy conceit to want to believe that rational, sentient agents rarely have actual ideological disagreements, diametrically opposed. That line of thought would run that these disagreements are ones founded in ignorance and that more context would sway the listener one side or another.

My instinct runs towards agreement with June in letting these people talk to and at him. It may not be the strictly speaking rational or optimal move, but to see his antagonists as agents of their own might - emotionally? - require giving them a say. There's a worry that killing them simply because they might be able to strike at you from some unimaginable vector dehumanizes them and you both. Earlier in the narrative, June has expressed concerns about his views on the game-world sliding into solipsism already.

Although, there is that last wrinkle that perhaps you are not talking to a human agent at all but a flesh puppet whose soul has been hollowed out and replaced by Harold (although I know that isn't the actual mechanic by which he subverts these people, as a description it's close enough for Uniquities work).
