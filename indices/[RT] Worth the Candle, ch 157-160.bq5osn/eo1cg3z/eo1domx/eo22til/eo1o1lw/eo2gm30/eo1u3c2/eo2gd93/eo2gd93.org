Personally, I think exclusions are done - there won't be another one while Joon is on Aerb. They happened by DM fiat to keep Aerb functioning for Joon's campaign to start, but his goal is to become all powerful and save the world. As such he is the "new exclusionary principle", it's up to him to fix these issues.
