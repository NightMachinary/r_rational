He doesn't need to get excluded himself, a whole magic discipline could get excluded (possibly still magic, in this case). However, he's supposed to be able to become a god, and I'm not sure that's possible without game-breaking magic combinations.

It feels like some of the conflict right now will be in the character's relationships, as the companions become more and more useless to missions (or rather, their utility becomes niche). I'm actually excited for that, since it's something AW does well IMO.
