Entads I know because of all the rules and systems that govern their usage. But I don't see how that argument applies to the Hells.

Aerb is a world where souls exist and go to the Hells when their owners die. There are many layers of Hell and the beings there thrive off of suffering.

Yeah this is complex I guess, but not in the same way as an item that says you can only use me 3 times a day under certain conditions.
