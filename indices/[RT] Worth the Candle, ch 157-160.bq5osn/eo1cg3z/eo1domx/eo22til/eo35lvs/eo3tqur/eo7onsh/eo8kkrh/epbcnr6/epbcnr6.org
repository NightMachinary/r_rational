I wouldn't quite say un-PC, because it's not like “zombie” in Aerb was originally a categorical word everyone on Aerb used to describe all undead, the way that e.g. “retard” used to be the categorical word everyone used to describe people with learning or communication disorders. For something to be un-PC, it has to start out being “the term” for something, and then later some group has to come along and, through politicking, make the word feel unacceptable to use.

Instead, “zombie” seems to have been a specific /branding/ of undead-used-as-slave-labour. Undead existed (at least as a concept, but I would expect in the form of the Risen Lands as well) separate from Captain Blue's undead labourers. And, in fact, the labourers probably weren't really ever called “zombies” themselves (by anyone other than Blue); that being instead an association he created with a sort of fictional character.

Picture an American sweatshop that employs Mexican immigrant labourers, having the logo of a cartoon Mexican immigrant labourer named something cutesy like... “Juanette.” Picture the sweatshop owner referring to his labourers as “his Juanettes.”

Now picture anyone else, after that sweatshop becomes infamous for its awful treatment of those labourers, attempting to refer to a random Mexican as “a Juanette.”

It rubs the wrong way, but mostly because it's a mischaracterization---not all Mexicans (or even most Mexicans) are immigrant labourers for a sweatshop; let alone that /one/ sweatshop that branded them such. It's also rude because it implicitly attempts to confer the social class of a sweatshop-labourer on the target. Essentially, it's equivalent to referring to an African American person as a “cotton-picker.”

It's /also/ rude because nobody should be using a word coined by an asshole to describe people he was abusing. You don't words coined by the Nazis to describe e.g. Jewish people, even if it's neutral, clinical language. Because that word is tainted by the mental associations it brings up in people who know the etymology.
