Juniper at least thinks like a petulant adult, rather than the petulant teenager he's supposed to be, which is pleasant even if it's wrong.

(For the same reason, making HPMoR!Harry a more accurate representation of a child-prodigy scientist+skeptic+atheist would have made him far /more/ annoying, since he'd still be just as arrogant---but most of time for unfounded reasons, due to things he only /thinks/ he understands.)

Children (and teenagers) are kind of awful human beings when judged by the standards of adult emotional intelligence.
