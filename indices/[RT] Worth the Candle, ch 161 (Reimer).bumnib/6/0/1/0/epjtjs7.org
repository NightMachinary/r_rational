Uther has had a couple magic systems go extint.

Uther directly killed/successfully repressed spirit magic into non existence (I dont have a chapter quote, but I am pretty sure this is correct)

Ice magic somehow got excluded near Uthers era (this is my imperfect memory, because I dont have the quote)
