Ah, you're right

  My germ of a theory was that Uther had been the cause of most of the exclusions. Because the historical record of exclusions lined up with the numbering of exclusions as written on my soul, it was easy enough to make some guesses in that direction. Ice Magic was “Deprecated, Exclusion #16”, and that meant that it must have chronologically happened after the so-called ‘Invasion of the Ice Wizards', which had concluded by 4 FE. I wasn't entirely sure that Uther had been responsible for that, but his historians had written about him climbing the Glacial Minaret to face down the ruling council of wizards, and after he'd defeated them, Ice Magic had become a lost art. Maybe he wasn't responsible, but he was certainly implicated.

There goes that theory.

Or maybe he created the exclusion himself somehow?
