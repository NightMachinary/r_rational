Yeah, but I'm specifically talking about the exclusion principle. Especially with Juniper worried about being all Prince's Invulnerability right now.

I'm betting it will come to a head sooner than later. Prince's itself being excluded would be fairly low impact and if it doesn't happen, Juniper's all but immortal for the rest of the series.
