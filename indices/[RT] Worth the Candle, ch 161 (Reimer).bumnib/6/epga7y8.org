I wonder how many of us are just waiting for the woodworking arc, wherein the following things should be fashionable: resurrection chamber, robot army, death star, voidbeast eater, stars etc. A godawful number of problems can be solved with "anything", all that matters is wood supply and time.

Honestly from chapter one I've been rooting for this little skill, and was utterly horrified when June didn't try to carve some figurines for the tabletop game with his new friends.
