I do not know if this was easier or harder to write than a normal Joon-centric chapter, but I enjoyed it quite a bit as an interlude and would be happy to read these sorts of chapters in the future.

The fake-out in the introduction was fun too, "Wait, this is Aerb!DnD?"

Didn't Earth!Joon run The Long Stairs campaign too? So when Earth!Joon says "...the Aerb Juniper's stuff doesn't show up on Aerb," is he lying or is he using Reimer's DnD records to determine that certain content like the Long Stairs does not exist in Aerb?
