There was originally a longer thing in there, but it was cut for pacing. The brain does a lot of funny stuff to maintain illusions of perception. Notably, there's a blind spot right in the center of your field of vision, where your optic nerve is, because it ends right in the field of the retina, blocking out ability to see there. Your brain either uses the fact that you have two eyes to figure out what's missing there, or it makes a guess based on the surroundings, if that's not possible. Unlike with the bridge of your nose, you can't choose to notice that this blind spot exists and is being filled in by your brain.

I've been thinking about this a fair amount since getting glasses, because my brain has been getting better and better at filtering them out.
