I just caught a very sneaky bit of foreshadowing in chapter 108:

#+begin_quote
  This continued on for longer than it seemed like it should have. I understood that it was probably calibration, but I didn't really need thirty names and places from Aerb in a row. At first they were blue or green across the board, but the last ten had a few yellow and gray, presumably because they were more obscure. Whatever Mome Rath was, I had apparently forgotten it.
#+end_quote

This is very clever, and makes me want to read the story again to catch other bits of reference to later reveals / worldbuilding.

Also, this suggests that:

- The last ~10 items on Uther's dream-skewered list are antimemetics.

- Uther had some way to remember antimemetics, because of course he did.
