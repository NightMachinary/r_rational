Man that first section took me a while to realize which Reimer we were dealing with and whether he was speaking about the context of a campaign or not. I also feel like the 3rd person viewpoint feeds into my perception that Reimer's pretty shallow and I'm not sure that's warranted.

...

Having finished the chapter now, I'm struck by how minimally people in Aerb react to what I would think would be massively traumatic events. Reimer admits he doesn't have the skills or mindset to do this kind of thing regularly, but seems to think the breakpoint is whether or not one enjoys doing it, not whether one can go through it without mind-breaking stress making them non-functional for hours-years afterward.
