It's really interesting to see the sheer distance Joon and Co have come from another perspective. Like Lisi is this hyper competent, cool-under-pressure Rambo type. Nothing phases her and she never panics when reacting to even crazy shit happening to her, she just gets to work, tries to save people and problem solve.

But then there's Mary. Where Lisi preps a go bag, Mary preps an entire nation in her pocket she can mobilize in an instant. It's an entirely different scale.
