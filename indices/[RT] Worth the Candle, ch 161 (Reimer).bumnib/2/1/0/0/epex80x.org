I'm glad to hear it.

I would think twice about traditional publishing, though. From reading a lot of author's blogs and podcasts I think the general opinion on traditional publishing nowadays is that it's a pretty bad deal for all but the top 1% of authors, and in the process of getting worse. They give you a pittance of a percentage(+10% is only for the most special of darlings), they barely promote you(or not at all, in many cases) while expecting and demanding that you do it yourself via social media, and on top of all that they've begun to force their authors to relinquish all the more lucrative rights(like audiobook and overseas), which require no work on their part, whether to negotiate or to implement.

Here's a professional author's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/amdgz6/my_best_advice_to_authors_has_completely_changed/][advice to new authors]], with facts and figures provided, and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6f1v96/why_del_rey_and_i_will_be_parting_ways/][another one]] where he explains in detail why left Del Rey over audiobook rights. He has several other posts like that one, and a lot of comments elaborating.
