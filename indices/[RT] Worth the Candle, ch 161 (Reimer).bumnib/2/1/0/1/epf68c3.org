Honestly, as-is the story is better edited than novels I've paid actual money for on Kindle. IMO you'd be totally justified in chopping the thing into book-sized chunks and publishing e-books.

And hey maybe you'll get enough sales to hire a professional editor, and then the problem will solve itself.
