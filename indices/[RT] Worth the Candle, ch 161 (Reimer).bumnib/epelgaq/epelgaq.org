I'm growing to like Lisi quite a bit the more I see of her. She and Amaryllis seem to be cut from the same cloth and competent, ruthless-when-necessary people (usually women but men too, when written well) get my motor running in a non-sexual way.

Current prediction: Lisi will end up with Joon as a political marriage to bring him into the Lost King's Court. It will turn out that Amaryllis was the the matchmaker behind the scenes since it allows her to do the politically expedient thing without having to deal with the ick that's supposed to come with marriage (I love ace representation since it took web fiction for me to realize there was a word for how I felt about sex). Reimer will be understandably PISSED.
