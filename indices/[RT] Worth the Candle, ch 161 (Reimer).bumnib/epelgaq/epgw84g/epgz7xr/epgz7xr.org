I have participated in sex before, and I still feel ick about it even during the act. I'm not sure how much more aroused I could be than "actively having sex with someone I romantically love".

I just don't like sex. I don't masturbate either, but with sex I'm usually willing to put aside my feelings about it when I'm in a relationship with someone I love. But I would say it's similar to, for instance, the willingness of a parent to put their hands in vomit because of their love for a child- not something you would do alone, and your feelings of disgust don't go away, but the rules become different when someone else is in the mix.
