I view it as a world built for only one person. Ice magic had to be retired because how lame would it be to repeat the same campaign you just finished, decisively? The DM is a hack fraud, but he's not that bad at his job.

I view it more as a /A Mind Forever Voyaging/ type deal, where the entire point is what would the player do when given power over other people. An NPC isn't allowed to break or even significantly change the game world, but PC's are perfectly free to do so.

Another bout of 100 Still Magic + Prince's, gets you a terrifying world full of people with nets and spider webs everywhere.
