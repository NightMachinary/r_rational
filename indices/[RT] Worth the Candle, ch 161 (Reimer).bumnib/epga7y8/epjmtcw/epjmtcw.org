I doubt Woodworking 100 will let Joon carve a square circle. If it made it into the system as per original specs then it's a brokenly powerful perk to be sure, but there's plenty of room for it to be limited even without overt DM action.

(Eg: Wooden Death Star? Cool, go get a zettagram of raw materials and we'll get right on it!)
