"unless" is not compatible with having the counterpart conversation /and/ missing the reference.

"Maybe we had the same conversation, or I had it with your counterpart, but I have no idea [...]" is another way to put it, but I'm not sure it's as colloquial or otherwise fits how our author intends.

The current wording is probably fine.

Alternatively, something in the vein of

"If we had the same conversation, or I had it with [...], I'm not remembering it" could work.

("recalling it"? "placing it"? shrug.) Closer to the original, but structured using the condition as a way to refer to a conversation that he's not sure happened.
