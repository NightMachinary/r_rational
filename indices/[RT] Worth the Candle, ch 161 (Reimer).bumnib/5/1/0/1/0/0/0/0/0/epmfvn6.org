I mean, certainly. I've read the entire Worm, that's a lot of reading. I wouldn't have done that if he wasn't a good writer. And I've read more than half of Twig and less than half of Pact.

The thing is you can be the greatest writer in the world, there will always be people who don't enjoy your style.
