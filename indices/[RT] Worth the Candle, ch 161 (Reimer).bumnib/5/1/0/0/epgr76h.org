As someone who has enjoyed Xianxia in the past, even /MTLed/ Xianxia, it is certainly an acquired taste, and one I haven't had an appetite for in awhile, the only Xianxia that I read nowadays is Forge of Destiny or more accurately the sequel. I tried Savage Divinity and liked the world and magic system, but a ways in I just couldn't stand the MC, he is just so self pitying, his constant stream of self derogatory thoughts is just annoying, especially when they are usually completely inaccurate and entirely his self deception.
