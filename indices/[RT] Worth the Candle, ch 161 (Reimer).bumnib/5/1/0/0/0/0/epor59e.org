Yeah, they are really a fantastic example of the series, the author just seems to understand the genre /really/ well and is building on the tropes with great characters and worldbuilding, instead of just ignoring them and trying to remake the wheel. The genre has a lot going for it and is especially suited for the serialized webnovel format (as it was basically created in concert with the format), the continuous escalation and action magic that can always be new and interesting.
