  Just realized that I never answered this, sorry.

  The upshot is that RR asks/demands way more than they need to just host the content, and this is scummy, and I don't like it ... but it's a lot of exposure, which potentially means more money, and they don't seem to actively be screwing anyone at the moment, so it's balancing uncertain future liability against almost guaranteed current income. Plus more people will probably read the story this way, which I generally consider a plus, if I think they'll like it.

  I think the thing that tipped it for me was that AO3 doesn't allow Patreon links, but RoyalRoad has those (and PayPal donate buttons) baked in. I'd be perfectly happy putting this story out without any income whatsoever ... but in another year or two I'm going to have to decide whether I can justify writing fulltime or whether I need to go back to having "real" job, and I think I would regret it if I didn't try as much as I could to make the money side of things work.
