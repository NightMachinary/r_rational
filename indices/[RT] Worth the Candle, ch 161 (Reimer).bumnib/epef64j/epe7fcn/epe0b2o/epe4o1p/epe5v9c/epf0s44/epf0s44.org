I wouldn't say he has an "overall-negative view of Juniper", we're just getting the unvarnished truth by peeking into his mind.

I think that's how you think of long time friends, people who you know very intimately, warts and all, and whom you take for granted are still going to be around in 10 or 20 years. Whereas with a new friend you might make allowances if they become belligerent and get into a fight or whatever, with this kind of friend you know them so well --or think you do-- that you dissect their actions dispassionately in your mind(e.g. "Paul's always a petty little bitch when he's high on top of being drunk").
