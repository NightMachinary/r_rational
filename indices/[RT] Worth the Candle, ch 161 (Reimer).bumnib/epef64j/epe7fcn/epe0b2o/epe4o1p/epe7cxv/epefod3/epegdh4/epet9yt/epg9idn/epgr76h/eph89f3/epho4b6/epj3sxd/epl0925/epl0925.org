I tried that one and didn't like it much.

Of the Top Web Fiction I follow The Guide, The Wandering Inn, Worth the Candle and Mother of learning.

I've read Worm and half of Twig, The Gods are Bastards, Good Student, How to avoid Death and a bit of Iron teeth.

Wildbow is too tense and grim for my tastes, Iron Teeth is badly written, mooderino starts well but gets bored with his own stories and veers into weird surrealistic stuff.

The Gods Are Bastards started as a copy of MU, only better, but with time it introduced too many POVs and characters, so it lost my interest. Otherwise it's written alright.
