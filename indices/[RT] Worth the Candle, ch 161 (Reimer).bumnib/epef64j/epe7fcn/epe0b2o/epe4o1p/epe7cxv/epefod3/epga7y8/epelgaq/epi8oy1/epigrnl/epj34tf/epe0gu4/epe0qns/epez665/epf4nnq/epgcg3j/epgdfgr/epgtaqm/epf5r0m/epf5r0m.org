I have to say that a part of me kind of dislikes these alternate POV chapters, because (from a certain perspective) they provide irrefutable proof that this whole thing /isn't/ some weird solipsistic dream of Juniper's - he's definitely not the PC in a world of well-scripted NPCs.

On the other hand I really enjoy seeing Juniper from another perspective, so it's fine.
