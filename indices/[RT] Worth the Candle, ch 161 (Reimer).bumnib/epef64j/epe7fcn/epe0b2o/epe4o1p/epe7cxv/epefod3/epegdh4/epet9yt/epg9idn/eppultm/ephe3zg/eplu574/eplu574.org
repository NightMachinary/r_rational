I think hating a genre, with the exception of a good example of that genre that is completely divorced from the rest, is kinda dumb.

Xianxia as a genre is an interesting concept, especially when considering its origin and environment. Most Chinese Xianxia are basically the same as our webnovels, posted on a site that is subscription based, and authors are paid per word for their work, and are expected to release new chapters /daily/ in order to stay Relevant aka paid. This formula is what lead to the extraneous and problematic series we see today.

The constant need for immediate updates meaning that authors get very little time for planning and editing and need to write as quickly as possible. Meaning they rely on tropes and cliches to pad their work while they try to insert as much of their own vision into it as they can.

This leads to some really bad stories, but some of them could have been great if divorced from that medium, so ignoring them based on that is a goddamn shame. Their are good Xianxia out their, and the success of western Xianxia like because of those inspiring western authors to try the genre divorced from its common medium, leading to even better stories.

So don't just hate it.
