I really liked this chapter, too, thanks to the author! Does somebody know if there's an official stance on revealing guesses about what could happen, or what would be good courses for the kharass? Specifically, it's unlikely that I guess everything correctly, and not all that likely to guess anything correctly, but if a correct guess demotivates cthulhuraejepsen, I wouldn't want to reveal my guesses..
