Exclusion mostly seems like a way to preserve a nightmarish threat that would otherwise wipe out all life on the planet, or a way to retire a campaign's threat to give something new a chance to take its place.

I'd expect maximum narrative escalation. Or at least for the wood to be haunted by vengeful tree spirits that taint his wishes.
