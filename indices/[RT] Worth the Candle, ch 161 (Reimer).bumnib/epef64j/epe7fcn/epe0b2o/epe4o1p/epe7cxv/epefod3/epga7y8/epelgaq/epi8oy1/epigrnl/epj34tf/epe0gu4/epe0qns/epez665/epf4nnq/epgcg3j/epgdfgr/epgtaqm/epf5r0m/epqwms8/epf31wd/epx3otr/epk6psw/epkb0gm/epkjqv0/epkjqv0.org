Ten cultures per species is an intentional lowball on my part, predicated on what "culture" would mean to someone on Aerb, especially someone from the agrarian ass-end of Anglecynn where most of their knowledge comes from radio plays or imported books. So to Juniper, "a culture" probably means distinctly different language, substantially different food, customs with little overlap, etc. A similar rubric applied to Earth would probably see (for example) all the Nordic countries mushes together, all the Pacific Islanders mushed together, etc. On Aerb, that would still leave you with (as a ballpark) 2,000 cultures.

Of course, talking about how many cultures there are is kind of a folly, since two different towns can have their own culture, even if they belong to the same ur-culture, so it all kind of comes down to how you define things.
