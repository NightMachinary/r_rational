That's interesting, but it doesn't really change anything. If 99% of a genre is dismissable garbage I think it's okay to say that genre is bad, and subsequently "hate" it. Hate is a strong word, but I think you get what I mean. I've yet to read a single eastern Xianxia that even qualifies as decent (which isn't a very hard goal to meet, I can find enjoyment in some pretty mediocre writing).
