Sure, maybe that applies to human monocultures, but I find it hard to imagine that wouldn't be something to go during that new multiculturalism smorgasbord.

Also is it unhygienic, more than sex already is?

  From cramps, to being too sensitive during it, to hygiene, to not liking blood (or for example getting it on bed sheets).

These are more likely to just be said up front, though of course as a blood mage you solve a lot of them. Even in our world saying I'm on your period is pretty meaningless when it comes to having sex so you'd think in this world they'd be more efficient and she'd say "I was too sensitive/cramping/etc'. In their world there will be tons of different periods with tons of different consequences. I'm surprised Lisi isn't on menstrual suppressing birth control, neither she or Amaryllis seem like the type of people who'd want to needlessly suffer hormonal swings each month.
