And he knocks it out of the park, once again. Kudos, Mr. Wales, I have absolutely no idea how you've managed to make something as consistently high quality as this story for as long as you have, but I hope it continues on, at least for the foreseeable future.

Reimer is a really interesting character. He might be one of the first we've seen to have an explicitly overall-negative view of Juniper (correct me if I'm wrong of course, it's been a while since I've done a re read). For that alone I think he's far more interesting than maybe he's given credit for.

To be honest, my assumption for this arc was that Reimer would find himself lumped with a too-useful-not-to-bring-him-with-us ability, and kind of get forcibly taken along by Joon and Co., perhaps with his condition for consent being that Lisi gets dragged along as well.

This is more true to his character, though, so is probably more satisfying in the long term. On the edge of my seat for whatever follows.
