  Having finished the chapter now, I'm struck by how minimally people in Aerb react to what I would think would be massively traumatic events.

I mean, Reimer spends quite a bit of time reminiscing in the lessons from a /disaster preparedness class/, and he is from some rural backwater of a village. Such classes and clubs have to pretty common to the functioning nations of Aerb. The practical people probably did practical things before the ignorant even recognized the danger.

This chapter is from Reimer's perspective. He is a supremely practice person, he noticeds the potential danger way before the regular people around him did, he reacted quickly by going to Lisi, then both of them did their best to escape the city...

... and he probably never had a chance to see regular people freaking out. Regular people probably started to freak out when the claws started to come down, but Reimer acted so fast that he was either in the car or fighting for his life during almost the whole period Mom Rathe was actually visable- if he was focused on efficiently avoiding the danger, would he waste time watching other people freak out?
