Dwarves are a good case study, since every dwarfhold has its own culture, but they share a lot in common, especially in comparison to the cultures of other species:

- They live underground
- One of the primary professions is farmer/miner
- They consume /kear/ and its related products
- They're (mostly) unigendered
- They're parthenogenetic
- They generally speak something in the Groglir family of languages
- They generally share either ancient ancestral backgrounds, or cross-pollination from other dwarfholds, or both

All that contributes toward certain cultural trends that will be near-universally present in dwarves, and from a distance, it might look like there's just a monolithic "dwarf culture", even if there isn't. If you're looking slightly closer, you might divide up "dwarf culture" into broad categories, like "shadow city dwarf culture" or "agkrioglian dwarf culture" or "metropolitan dwarf culture", or divide them by the type of stone they live in (which informs a lot of their housing, city structure, and what the particular nature of their /kear/ is), or divide them by the common ways for structuring their societies, or even by their different ethnicities.

But for the Aerb version of Juniper, it's maybe ten, unless you want to get granular, and no one at the table objects to that characterization.
