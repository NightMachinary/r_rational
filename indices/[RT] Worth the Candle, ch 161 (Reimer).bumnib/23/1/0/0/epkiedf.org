  Also is it unhygienic, more than sex already is?

Blood is pretty unhygienic - on Earth anyway - not just from a disease stand point (which are often sexually transmitted as well, but there are some blood borne only diseases), but from a cleanliness, bacterial, etc. stand point.

I mean they don't have plastics, they may not have cheap condoms...

But I think you are right that it's a weak excuse for a blood mage, and a modern society, that she even has periods like that for example (though I will point out most menstrual suppressing birth controls don't work perfectly for every woman, and many will still have irregular menstruation instead).

My main point was just that not having sex on one's period is a lot more than just a cultural norm.
