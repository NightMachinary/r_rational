  Hard to imagine the cultural norms around not having sex on periods still exist.
#+end_quote

The cultural norms around shaming people on their period are stupid. But there are a lot of reasons to not have sex during one's period, none of which are really "eww periods" cultural norms, that practical. From cramps, to being too sensitive during it, to hygiene, to not liking blood (or for example getting it on bed sheets). Especially not for a first time having sex (though Lisi seems unlikely to care) since people like making good first impressions.
