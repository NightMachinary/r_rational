Awesome! Any plans to self-publish it? Even with a glowing recommendation people are completely unwilling to read on their computers or phones for 80+ hours(985k words divided by average reading speed of 200wpm) when *they would be willing* and even glad to pay 5 bucks to put the first volume of that highly recommended story directly on their kindle.

I had this problem when recommending worm, twig and MoL. I feel like even now they don't get anywhere close to the amount of attention they deserve, despite being recommended often on [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]] and on other subs.
