I agree on almost everything you just said, though I think you should give TGAB another shot, the author is very good at what he does, and that is mainly character writing, the number of characters he has may seem extraneous (bad it certain feels that way early on), but his writing get noticeably better as the series continues.

Edit: and while I agree that wilbow is super grim, his writing quality and capability tend to over shadow that.
