I love having the occasional short chapter where we see the protagonist's growth from someone else's viewpoint. You can't do it more than once or twice, because then it becomes gratuitous “look at how amazing the protagonist is; aren't they the best?”, but there's just something so satisfying about blowing someone's expectations out of the water.

I'm probably not explaining this well.

But in any case I enjoyed this chapter a great deal, and I also thought it important to see the fear and devastation inflicted by Mome Rath from the point of view of someone who is basically a normal civilian. Juniper and Co. are so strong by now that it can be hard to remember, as a reader, just how terrifying it would be to have an antimemetic kaiju descend out of the clouds onto your town.
