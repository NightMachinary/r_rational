I don't care if you make your guesses, my standing policy is to not let anything that people guess change the course of the story, as I think that's one of the most harmful impulses that authors have (whether that's changing the story because you want an ending that people haven't guessed, or whether it's changing the ending to something you liked better on a whim). I also don't find it particularly demotivating, since correct guesses are a sign that I've been building things right.
