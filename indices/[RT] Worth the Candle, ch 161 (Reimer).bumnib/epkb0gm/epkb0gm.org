Great story

10 cultures per species seems low. How many cultures would you say humanity has?

Is your period an issue for a blood mage? Seems like that would be one of the first things you could solve? She also seems like the type of person to have this worlds equivalent of an implant.

Also not sure that she seems like the person to be bothered by her period anyway. Hard to imagine the cultural norms around not having sex on periods still exist.
