Ah, thanks I didn't know that! But, this is easily circumvented, if you have someone make the Philosopher's stone /while using the invisibility cloak/ to trap their soul! Peverell had the cloak and would have realized that. It would also fulfill the prophecy - just replace the elder wand with Resurrection Stone and that makes three.

The main risk would be that you might have to keep the cloak on for the rest of your life once you "die" in it. If the thing with using the Cloak to glue Dementor's-Kissed-souls back into their bodies works, then I think it's safe to put a higher probability that magical deaths with no apparent physical side effect such as "ran out of mana" or "Avada Kedavra" might only /temporarily/ detach your soul and maybe you can use the Cloak to reattach it. Maybe. (Although, with AK and out-of-mana there is no mention of the body continuing to work, so it might be different from the Kiss)

Edit: Oh cool you're the author! It is an honor, love your story.

Edit 2: Ah, skimming the chapter again, I see the Cloak interferes with the spellwork somehow. Hm...that might still be fine, if the re-attachment works. And maybe you get some sort of edge if you don't wish to use the Stone for yourself, like Flamel, or the canonical Harry with the mirror of Erised.
