I assume the stone, similar to the elder wand, works much with intent. You need to intent to summon a specific person for it to work. And if all you know about that person is their name and a bunch of second hand history about them that may not be enough for the stone to discern who you are actually looking for. I'm sure it is not some kind of near AI that compares all souls memories to what fits best with your believes about some historic character and then summons that. And I also don't believe that names become fundamentally bound to the soul or something. What about people who have multiple names? Or none?
