  who probably designed magic

Aside from this, I agree, as we have strong evidence that magic significantly predates Merlin, and was probably created in Atlantis, along with the soul.

We also do not have any evidence that Merlin was ultra-knowledgeable in the grand sense, only that he knew rather more than modern people on some subjects, and less than Harry on at least one other.

That the /Interdict/ exists and may have some positive benefits does not mean that it does not also have negatives, nor that it was the best possible choice even from the perspective of Merlin. It seems to be, by itself, responsible for the descentionist turn of the modern magical world. That seems to be rather a large negative, and the fact that the world survived with magic for at least several thousand years before it was created (If we accept modern datings for Merlin and King Arthur as being in the 800's CE, and Atlantis being at the very least more than 1000 BCE) indicates that the 'wide dissemination of hypermagic' was not, at least, an existential risk, while permanent loss of higher magics /might be/.
