Do we actually have reason to believe that Atlantis had anything to do with anything? As I recall it was a hypothesis that HPMOR-Harry came up with in order to explain the fact that magic had characteristics of intelligent design, but he tagged it "Atlantis" simply because that was a long-lost magical civilization that he'd recently heard of, not because he had evidence in that direction. It could just as easily have been Hyperboria, or Martians, or even Merlin for all we know.
