Except that we don't know if Shia has an upper limit. He can be supernatural/conceptual and still have limitations.

All we know is that Shia can kill hundreds and has killed thousands. Hell, they did try to use it as a terrorist weapon and it still only killed ~hundreds at a time. That's fairly low end.

There's a big difference between 'scales limitlessly' and 'scales enough to massacre a battalion of people'.
