Fel Seed, from Juniper's brief description, seems to be capable of:

- Making arbitrary alterations to any biomatter he touches.

- Creating biomatter /ex nihilo/.

His other abilities are derived from these two. His body is faster/stronger/sturdier than humans' because he designed it himself, using some impressive biological materials. For the same reason he is completely immune to various threats, such as poisons or mind control. He also created hundreds of thousands of obedient biological monstrosities, with much the same abilities. And then because he doesn't have an upper limit on the biomass he is able to control, he went and filled the entire ~65,000-meters-wide sphere he is confined to with himself.

So you'd need to instantly annihilate ~1,200,000 km^{3} of matter to kill him.

Fortunately, Shia Labeof scales to any threat! So Fel Seed dies.

--------------

To put it another way, Fel Seed doesn't have any conceptual immunities: he isn't "impossible" to kill, it's just a bit hard to do so. Shia Labeof's power /is/ conceptual, however, as he develops new powers until he kills his targets, and in the general case conceptual >> not-conceptual, which means Fel Seed would lose.

That's all assuming we know everything relevant about both Shia Labeof and Fel Seed, of course, which is unlikely. In particular, Amaryllis keeps using the word "impossible" when referring to their ability to kill Fel Seed, which makes me think there's something else at play here, given her distaste for overstating threats. And of course it's possible that Shia's power has an upper limit.

Oops, did I say Shia's full name thre
