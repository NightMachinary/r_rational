I dunno. Solace hasn't done much influencing besides politely reminding the group that maybe they need to help her preserve the last existing remnant of an entire culture at some point. If she was always nagging Joon to go after Uther or Fel Seed or the Empire of Common Cause, it could be suspicious, but "non-human druid that needs help saving The Last XXX Of Its Species" feels very much like a sidequest NPC, not a GMPC.
