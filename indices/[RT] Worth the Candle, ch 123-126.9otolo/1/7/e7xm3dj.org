  I'd like to pre-emptively argue against the inevitable 'Amarlyis is a DMPC' theory.

We should broaden this to 'Vervain was a DMPC', and even 'there are DMPC's on Aerb'. I think this is not unlikely that Arthur was simply mistaken, given his obsession with the n-word.

And I don't think the Dice Guy needs something as crude as a DMPC. If DMPCs are mostly a tool to patch a glaring hole in a party composition (i.e. Joon played a cleric when no one wanted), on Aerb that's really not an issue.

Maybe if the end goal of Aerb is to manipulate/rehab Joon, maybe. But... Why? It's crude and risks compromising the goal.
