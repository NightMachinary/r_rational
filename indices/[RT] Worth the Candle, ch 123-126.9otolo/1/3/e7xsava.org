  We also have a chapter narrated from the POV of End Story Juniper based on information given to him by Amarylis (the chapter where her soul is compromised)

I viewed that chapter as narrated from the POV of Juniper after Fallatehr's death, but within that time skip period that followed after.

Taken literally, this is the only line I found as evidence of your theory:

#+begin_quote
  Here, I mean â€˜might not have actually happened' in the sense that this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn't have at the end of the last chapter, and won't have at the end of this one. - WtC Ch. 73
#+end_quote

And I don't think that alone is strong enough to make a case for the narrator being End Story Juniper, which would allow us to extrapolate all sorts of plot information, when it could simply be Juniper after the Fallatehr incident has closure as narrator.
