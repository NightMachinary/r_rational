Personally I think it's unlikely that any of the current party members are DMPC's. Vervain was introduced to Arthur as a DMPC because instead of going off on a wild adventure and honing his abilities with his knack, he went off and acted for a bit until the DM had enough of that and decided to get the ball rolling.

Joon was in danger from the moment he landed on Aerb, and from the start he has been working to improve himself and change the world around him. While the DM may have nudged things here and there to keep the plot going the direction he wants it, the introduction of a DMPC when one isn't needed seems heavy handed.

If a DMPC was introduced, or someone was found out to be a DMPC I'd be rather surprised if it was any of the party members.

Beyond that I think that Arthur and Joon are both occupying very different narratives from each other. Arthur was transported to a world that he had to save from the brink of destruction multiple times. Joon was transported into a craptastic but relatively stable world. Arthur was the set up for Joons story. Arthur had a knack that was probably different from Joon's in some way.

I think a distinction that could be relevant is that Arthur had Knights, where Joon has companions. Uther, as he is portrayed, was the leader of the bunch (You know him well). Whereas with Joon, it's more of a loose, group dynamic.

Beyond that Joon has a much better understanding of the world. It's built from his homebrews, not Arthur's. Uther would have known he was in a game from things he recognized, beyond that I personally don't think that the DM /ever/ interacted directly with Uther. His obsession with drawing (girl) from earth and rape of Bethel show that.
