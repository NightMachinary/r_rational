I see a lot of people speculating on which of Joon's party members could be a DMPC.

But when I read that passage, all I thought was "wow, that is a /mighty/ callous thing to write on someone's grave".

I guess it depends on what evidence Arthur had that Vervain was being directly controlled by the DM, or was railroading him or whatever.

EDIT: Vervain, not Heshnel.
