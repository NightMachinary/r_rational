Valencia is the core pillar holding up the entire operation, so all the infernals have to do is knock out that pillar somehow to win.

I suspect it would involve betrayal by her, considering how young and malleable she is, but it would only take, say, one non-anima being controlled by a particularly competent infernal to stop her in a more conventional way, for example.

The informational side of things is the tricky part, so long as the infernals have some way of knowing that Valencia is their target then there might be all manner of different ways of taking her out. The longer Valencia gets to act in secret the better topside's chances are of winning.
