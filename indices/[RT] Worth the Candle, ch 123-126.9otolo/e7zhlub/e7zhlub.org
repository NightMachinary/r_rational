So, what's the trouble with taking over hell? You can literally assassinate leaders and find all their plans in advance, plus you can get strategy advice (possibly rigged, mind you) of demons with literally thousands of years experience fighting demons. They're already fighting against each other, just keep it focused on scapegoat demons and they'll do half the work for you.

Meanwhile, infernoscopes are cheap and easy to acquire, so you could potentially delegate scouting to do it en masse (you'd have to keep it secret from the demons, but demons don't have many friends - I suspect only cultists and people who've killed people to hide secrets often enough that demons are a preferable alternative somehow), and you could free specific hell-prisoners and (preferably with people about to die of sickness, since you don't have much to hold over people after they're dead) potentially send them instructions for a coordinated human rebellion.

Coordinated rebellion would have to be timed right, since it would encourage demons to unite against the "oh shit, our food source is trying to kill us", but really, any sort of centralised demon army seems like an easy target, and the rebellions mere /existence/ will starve the demons of food.

I mean, it's not "insta-win", sure, but only 25%? How?

Also, ask Raven what tactic let the demons win that 75%, if she knows. It just seems weird. Like, maybe it's a numbers-game, but if they don't have a specific way of getting onto Aerb and taking out Valencia, then sooner or later (with her IIRC exponential maw-growth) she'll just eat them all.

Point is, " let's wipe out all the demons" is the most popular thing ever, and anyone who believes they could die would support it by default (if they know about it). Why such low chances?
