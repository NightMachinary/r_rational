There's another potential issue: the assumption that Fel Seed is singular.

Suppose Fel Seed's current primary flesh-puppet says "Shia Labeof" thrice. Does Shia kill Fel Seed's entire exclusion zone, or /only that individual puppet/? There's nothing stopping Fel Seed from going all Doris Finch, and if each instance of him counts as a separate individual...

The same is true for employing cognitohazards against him. It will compromise a number of his instances, but then his autonomous self-monitoring systems will kill them upon noticing their abnormal behaviour, and his dead-man's switches will create a new batch of Fel Seeds from backups.

(Or, at least, that's how I would have set it up if I were him.)

Dropping the Void Beast on him is still a foolproof plan that can't possibly go wrong, though, [[/u/blueeyedlion][u/blueeyedlion]].
