Well no... If you /really/ didn't wanna play, you'd just... stop moving or keep killing yourself. Killing the dmpc accomplishes zero and has important drawbacks.

1) you're still trapped 2) the dm can just grab a new character, take over another existing party member 3) what if you're wrong 4) everyone who is stuck in the simulation with you but doesn't agree with you is now upset 5) the character might still be their own person /despite/ also being a dmpc (the dm just created a real person and minor manipulated them to make the necessary decisions)

If you're going with the strategy of giving the game an honest play through, which is what Joon and Arther are basically doing, this doesn't really make sense.
