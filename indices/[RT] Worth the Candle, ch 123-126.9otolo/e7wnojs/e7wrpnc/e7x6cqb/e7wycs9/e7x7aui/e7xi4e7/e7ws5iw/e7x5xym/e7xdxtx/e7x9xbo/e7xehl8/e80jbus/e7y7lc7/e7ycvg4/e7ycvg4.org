From chapter 93:

#+begin_quote
  “No, you're not,” I said. “Just ... asexual?”

  “Mostly,” said Amaryllis. She frowned at me. “Did you know before I did?”

  “After our long talk in the bottle, it seemed like one of the two likely options,” I said with a shrug. “The other being that you were lesbian.” I hadn't wanted to pry or make assumptions, but I'd really been hoping that her revulsion towards sex with me wasn't just because it was me.

  Amaryllis gave a nonchalant shrug. “A bit.”
#+end_quote

She is mostly asexual and lesbian when she isn't (Joon having been the only exception before she edited herself).
