While I like your theory, there is one major issue and several minor ones. The major one is that revision magic normally kills you if you are reverted past a certain point, and while there are some rare entads or items that can cancel that out, there is little chance she would not have accidentally become a revision mage at some point if those were used. For some minor ones: people would have almost certainly noticed if the same person showed up like that for centuries, and if she was someone that important anglecyn would almost certainly not have acted the way they did with regards to her and would have tried much harder to protect her, especially with how people in their government kept on trying to jill her and this seemed to be a semi-open secret.
