I enjoyed the trilogy and didn't really feel it was /too/ mystery-boxy; its greatest failing in my opinion is that it was a trilogy when it would have been more effective as a single volume. The gripping parts where the characters recognize and take measures against the hypnosis responsible for a good deal of the reality distortion they experience or, later on, face down and come to terms with the truly alien thing that has infected our reality, and realize that the intensely irrational policies of the Southern Reach organization stem from the fact that Area X has /infected/ the hierarchy of the organization itself are altogether diluted by, frankly, a bunch of filler and red herrings. I don't think anything /really/ interesting ever came of the S&SB plotlines, which was really a missed opportunity. (Not that it would have been better if their sleuthing had Gotten To The Bottom Of It All, but I compare that wandering plotline unfavorably to, say, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps: Too Clever For Their Own Good]], which is a great example of characters /trying/ to Get To The Bottom Of It All with horrifying consequences.
