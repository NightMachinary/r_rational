Remaining plot threads I think we might still see:

- Who Aerb's Joon once was

- The gods of Aerb

- The locus

- The destruction of Hell

- Either the Void Beast or the Other Side (I think it's unlikely we'll see both, for the same reason I think it's unlikely we'll see Joon murdering his way through every excluded person)

And, of course, Arthur and Fel Seed
