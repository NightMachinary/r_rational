I can see the argument for that, given that Aerith in FF7 could be described as a DMPC: “Girlfriend-NPC that dies to move the plot forward, but also provided levity while she was alive---and accepted death with open arms---precisely because she wasn't taking being alive seriously in the same way everyone else was, because she was just a temporary manifestation of a higher-dimensional being (the lifestream; the DM.)”

Also in the sense that a PC that dies 2/3rds of the way through a campaign is somewhat of a problem for their player, in terms of that player now having to build a replacement character that will start out with no rapport to a meshed team. ---unless, of course, that player is the DM, because the DM doesn't /need/ to replace the DMPC with another. They can just stop having a DMPC.
