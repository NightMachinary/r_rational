Joon appears to be the only man Amaryllis has ever liked (and if the DM arranged her romantic preferences the same way he arranged her appearance, then its entirely possible Joon is the only man she could possibly be attracted to). So in a pre-Joon era, she would appear to be entirely lesbian.

Right now Amaryllis has soul edited her self to be completely lesbian because she thought her attraction to Joon was unhelpful.
