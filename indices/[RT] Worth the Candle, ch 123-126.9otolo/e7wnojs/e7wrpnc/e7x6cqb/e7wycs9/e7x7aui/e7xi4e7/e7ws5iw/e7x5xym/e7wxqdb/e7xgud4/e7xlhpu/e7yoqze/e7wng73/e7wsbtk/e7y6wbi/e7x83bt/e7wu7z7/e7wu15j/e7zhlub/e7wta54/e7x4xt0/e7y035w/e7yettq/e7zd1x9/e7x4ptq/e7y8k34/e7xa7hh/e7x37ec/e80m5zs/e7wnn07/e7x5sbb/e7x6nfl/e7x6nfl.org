From the Library's perspective (or more accurately, from the perspective of nominal authors of the books in the library), anyone who goes into the Library vanishes, never to be seen nor heard from again, which is obviously not the case, since people /do/ exit the Library.

However, the Library resets when people go /in/, even though it's already accounts for those people by pretending that they vanished forever. So Amaryllis is asking why the Library would reset, since in theory it doesn't need to change the future that it's portraying, which already accounts for that disappearance.
