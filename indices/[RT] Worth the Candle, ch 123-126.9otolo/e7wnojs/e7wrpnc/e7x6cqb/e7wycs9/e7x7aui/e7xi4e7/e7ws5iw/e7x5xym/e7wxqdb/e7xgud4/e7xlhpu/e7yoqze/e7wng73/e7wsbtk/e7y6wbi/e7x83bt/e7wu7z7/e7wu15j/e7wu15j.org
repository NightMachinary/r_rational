So... does Fel Seed's magic count parts of his flesh that aren't physically connected to the 'whole' when it comes to the regeneration thing? I have to assume so, because otherwise I'm /sure/ there's some matter-deletion ability that one could use on him (it?) that would destroy all the connected tissue.

However, that would imply some sort of super stretched-out flesh monster, and the 'blink-fast' description seems further evidence that Fel Seed himself is a dude, and the other flesh is unconnected from his body, but he still retains a degree of control over it, given 'flesh-monster.'

The brides are, what, people he grafts his skin to? Probably something more horrifying, but I dunno.
