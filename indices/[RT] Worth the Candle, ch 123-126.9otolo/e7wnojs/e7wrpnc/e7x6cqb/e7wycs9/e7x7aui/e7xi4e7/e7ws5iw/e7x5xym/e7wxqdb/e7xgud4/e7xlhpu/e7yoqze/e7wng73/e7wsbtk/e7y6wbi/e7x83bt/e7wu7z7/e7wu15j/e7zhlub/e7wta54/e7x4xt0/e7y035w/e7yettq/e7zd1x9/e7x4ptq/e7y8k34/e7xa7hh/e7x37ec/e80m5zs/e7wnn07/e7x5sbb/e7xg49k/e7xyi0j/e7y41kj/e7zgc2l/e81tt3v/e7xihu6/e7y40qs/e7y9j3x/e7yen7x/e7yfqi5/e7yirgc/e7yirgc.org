  you're still trapped

Uncertain if that's going to be the outcome or not. What Uther did know is that for decades the narrative cycle continued... and Vervain was there the entire time, urging him on. Knowing Vervain is the DM (or a character controlled by the DM) could mean that taking the DM out of the game makes the game stop.

I don't mean Aerb gets destroyed - I mean all the big nasty monsters that the DM keeps throwing at the world stop showing up.

  2) the dm can just grab a new character, take over another existing party member
#+end_quote

Sure, that's a potential problem... but Uther didn't know how the DM's powers work. Maybe he could grab others, maybe Vervain was custom-made by him. What he knew for sure is that the DM was there, right next to him, and very stab-able.

  3) what if you're wrong
#+end_quote

It sounds like Uther was getting to the point where he knew eventually he couldn't go on (emotionally). Before he got to that point, wouldn't it make sense to exhaust his options, however unlikely they might seem? If killing Vervain stopped the cycle, Uther could wipe up the remaining horrors in his own time and finally relax a bit and tend to his mental health.

  4) everyone who is stuck in the simulation with you but doesn't agree with you is now upset
#+end_quote

Yep, and that's exactly what happened! Uther rolled the dice, and it didn't work out for him. I imagine he still felt it was a gamble he had to take as he got increasingly more desperate to stop the cycle.

#+begin_quote
  5) the character might still be their own person /despite/ also being a dmpc (the dm just created a real person and minor manipulated them to make the necessary decisions)
#+end_quote

And again, it's quite possible that that could have been the case. Which would hasten Uther's mental checkout... but not killing Vervain wouldn't have stopped it anyway. By the time you're contemplating the murder of a companion who's been with you for decades, your mental health obviously isn't in a great state.

#+begin_quote
  If you're going with the strategy of giving the game an honest play through, which is what Joon and Arther are basically doing, this doesn't really make sense.
#+end_quote

That's the thing though; Uther did give it an honest playthrough, but it wore him down to an emotionally exhausted wreck. And then the hits just kept on coming. He didn't want Aerb to be destroyed if he just stopped playing, but he also knew eventually he wouldn't be able to keep playing at all. So he tried to get the DM to stop throwing catastrophes at the world... and failed to do so. So when Uther checked out and left later, the world was screwed for years to come... exactly like he feared it would be.

That's my take on it, anyway :)
