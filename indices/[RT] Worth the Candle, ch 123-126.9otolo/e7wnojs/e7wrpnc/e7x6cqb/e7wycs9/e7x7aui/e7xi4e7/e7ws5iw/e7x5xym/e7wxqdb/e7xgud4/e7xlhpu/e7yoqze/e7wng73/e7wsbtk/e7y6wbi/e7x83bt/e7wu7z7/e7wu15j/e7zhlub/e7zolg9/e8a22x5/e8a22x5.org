1. we know that there's about a trillion people in the hells.

2. we don't know how many trillions of devils there are, but we do know that people are a scarce and valuable resource in hell, with only high ranking, millennia old devils being able to own one.

3. Valencia started off gaining dozens of tendrils per level, then hundreds per level, then thousands per level. She now has tens of thousands of tendrils, and is likely to have millions by level 20, if this rate of progression stays steady.

4. There's a limit to how many demons she can devour before she needs to recover , and we can guess that she's mostly eating the weaker, younger demons near the surface hells.

5. Even one demon breaking out of the hells is a major event that requires specialized teams to handle.

Working from that, let's say that a high powered Valencia can devour five million demons a day, and that there are only five trillion demons in the invasion force.

She would need to work non stop for over a thousand years to make a noticeable dent in their numbers, and it would take nearly three thousand years to wipe out the initial invasion force. However, we also don't know how demons reproduce , or the full capabilities of the ruling demons in the lowest hells.

A 25% chance of victory seems optimistic.
