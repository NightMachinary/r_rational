Other people and I have already mentioned this, but I'm going to mention this again, since further evidence has piled up in its favour:

It is very plausible that Amaryllis is Dahlia who was repeatedly wound back to a young age using some entad/magic.

Previous evidence includes that Amaryllis and Dahlia look extremely similar, to the point that people who knew Dahlia confused Amaryllis with her. Also, this a parsimonious explanation of things which might otherwise look like plotholes: 1. Anglecynn princes still have strong family resemblance after 10+ generations. 2. Anglecynn hasn't lost its entads to various royal bastards over the last 500 years. (Plus there are species long-lived enough to be able to kidnap a royal bastard and keep them in stasis for a couple hundred years [entads with similar effects are confirmed to exist, they are need for the creation of revision mages]). Both these observation could be explained by the Anglecynn princes repeatedly marrying a rewound Dahlia to 'refresh' their bloodlines claim on the various entads (and this also provides the motivation for Anglecynn to put in the resources to make this plan work).

Things that provide further evidence this update: Dahlia was primarily lesbian, as is Amaryllis. Dahlia dated Pallida, Amaryllis seems to like Pallida. Dahlia lived to an old age (easier to have a chance to fake her death, as opposed to falling in battle which is hard to fake and happened to several of Uthers companions).

While writing this I decided to go back and check which entads Amaryillis has access to too check if she has the inheritance profile you'd expect from Dahlia, and more importantly make sure that Amaryillis doesn't have access to anything that Dahlia wouldn't have had access too:

From:

#+begin_quote
  “Whatever happened between Uther and Zona, she gave him two sons and a daughter, all in fairly quick succession,” said Amaryllis. “This was during the period when the First Empire had been founded but not all of the eventual member polities had joined. A year after Dahlia was born, the ice wizards invaded, and Zona was kidnapped."
#+end_quote

I take that the birth order was the two sons, then Dahlia.

From Amaryllis' character description:

#+begin_quote
  "Amaryllis is the most direct descendant of Uther Penndraig, the Lost King, which gives her special claim-in-fact to a fair number of his estates and heirlooms bound along cognatic or enatic primogeniture, ultimogeniture, and gavelkind rules."
#+end_quote

These are as follows:

Cognatic primogeniture: Cognatic descent means tracing both male and female line, primogeniture means preferring the eldest, ie. the order goes eldest son, second son, Dahlia. So Dahlia would inherit this if Uther managed to outlive both his sons (very plausible).

Enatic primogeniture: Enatic means related via female line, so I assume this system means eldest daughter inherits, that's Dahlia.

Ultimogeniture: This is inheritance by the youngest child, that's Dahlia.

Gavelkind: This one is complicated since their are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavelkind][several systems]] with that name, however it stands to reason that Dahlia would do well under all rule sets (The exception being English Gavelkind and Uther writing an extremely spiteful will). The Welsh and Irish rules tend to split up the inheritance making it more difficult to control a large chunk after 10 generations.

Also, Amaryllis lacks access to male-preference primogeniture which her family ought to have been able to acquire and pass on to her as an only child, though might simply be the case that there are no entads which use that system.
