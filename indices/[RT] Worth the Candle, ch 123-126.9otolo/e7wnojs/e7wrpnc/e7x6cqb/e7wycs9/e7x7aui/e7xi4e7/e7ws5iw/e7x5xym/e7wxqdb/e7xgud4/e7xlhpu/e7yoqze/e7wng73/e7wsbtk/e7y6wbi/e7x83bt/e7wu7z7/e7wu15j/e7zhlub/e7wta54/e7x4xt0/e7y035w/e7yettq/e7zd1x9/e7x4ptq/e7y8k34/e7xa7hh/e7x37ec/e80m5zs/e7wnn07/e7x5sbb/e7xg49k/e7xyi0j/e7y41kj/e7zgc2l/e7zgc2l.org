Very specific. Not the expected suffix '-pathy', just thought. A distinction Bethel would make, since she has no shortage of experiences with all the entads in play.

  capable of altering the electron stream within a television in order to produce moving images of its own design
#+end_quote

I wonder if [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8ph2OVqZeM][video games]] would have the same problem. The beam does need to be /on/.

#+begin_quote
  The best case scenario is increased mental acuity, increased reaction times, better impulse control, and lessened emotional response
#+end_quote

Do we /need/ the entity to get these? Or is she still just describing video games? üòõ

#+begin_quote
  which comes packaged with a direct line of communication to the entity itself.
#+end_quote

Oh.

#+begin_quote
  Non-replicable when the moving pictures are recorded
#+end_quote

So you're saying those electrons have [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cpf2jsZsNFNH5TSpc/no-individual-particles][identities]]. Aerb isn't quantum! You heard it here first.

  and they were locked out of it
#+end_quote

The Library is like the time chamber, but without the time. I imagine they have similar concerns for food, waste, air, and so on. That said, without Sable they would have some different procedures. I imagine we'll find out.

This is a remarkable line. +1

#+begin_quote
  Uther's last known location was the Fel Seed exclusion zone
#+end_quote

...and that's Fel Seed's final gambit? Kill him too hard and they lose Uther.

Unless Fel Seed somehow doesn't know, or Uther /is/ Fel Seed.

#+begin_quote
  There wasn't a source, like the others, some magic gone awry or some entad that came out too powerful.
#+end_quote

I find this troubling. What does that leave? DM action?

#+begin_quote
  She didn't seem terribly put out.
#+end_quote

She has a lot of time.

No one mentioned the new name for Bethel.

#+begin_quote
  donned the Red Mask
#+end_quote

Red Mask? Grand Finale? Don't think for a moment that I don't recognize at least some of these /Slay the Spire/ cards.

#+begin_quote
  I can't tell you more about the entity
#+end_quote

That's the one no one can know about because the knowing makes him stronger. Knowing /about/ LaBeouf didn't seem like quite a fit for that.

  ‚ÄúYou can see down there?‚Äù asked Raven. ‚ÄúYou're an intelligence asset too?‚Äù
#+end_quote

See, /someone/ is following up on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8pok1z/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_101104_end_book_v/e0d9an8/][this]].

I'd like to point out that on its own this is strong evidence that Arthur really was dream-skewered, etc. (As if we needed a reason to continue evaluating that possibility.)
