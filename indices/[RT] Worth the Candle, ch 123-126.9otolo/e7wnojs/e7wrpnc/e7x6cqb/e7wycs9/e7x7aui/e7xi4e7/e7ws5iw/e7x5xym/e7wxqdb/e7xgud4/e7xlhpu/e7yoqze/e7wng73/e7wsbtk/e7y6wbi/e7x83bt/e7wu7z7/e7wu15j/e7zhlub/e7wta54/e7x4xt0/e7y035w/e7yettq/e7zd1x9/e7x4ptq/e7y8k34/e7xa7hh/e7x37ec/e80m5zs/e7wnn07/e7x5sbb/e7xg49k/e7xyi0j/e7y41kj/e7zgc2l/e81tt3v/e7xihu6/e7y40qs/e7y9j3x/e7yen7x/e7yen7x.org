  Does the dmpc instigate trouble to keep the plot going or something?

Maybe not the DMPC himself in his role as a character, but the DMPC is still the DM, and the DM is behind all of this. Uther went through decades of constant life-and-death battles that continually escalated and frequently involved harsh sacrifices borne by himself and his loved ones. And then he finds out that his oldest friend and mentor, the person who has been with him since his very first adventure, is the actually the cosmic entity that's spent years trapping him in this narrative cycle? It's absolutely understandable that Uther would feel a soul-crushing betrayal... and if you wanted to break the cycle, wouldn't it make sense to kill the entity responsible for keeping you trapped in it?
