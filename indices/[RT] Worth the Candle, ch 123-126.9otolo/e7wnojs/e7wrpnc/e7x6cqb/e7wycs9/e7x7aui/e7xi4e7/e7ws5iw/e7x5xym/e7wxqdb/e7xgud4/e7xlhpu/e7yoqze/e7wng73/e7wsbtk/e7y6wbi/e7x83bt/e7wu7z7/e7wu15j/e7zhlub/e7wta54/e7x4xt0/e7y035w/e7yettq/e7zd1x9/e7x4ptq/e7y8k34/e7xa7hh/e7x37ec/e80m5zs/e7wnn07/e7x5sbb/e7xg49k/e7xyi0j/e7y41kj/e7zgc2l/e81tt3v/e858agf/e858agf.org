I'm... not sure what you're referring to?

I think the Void Beast is the only widely known phenomenon, of the 5 listed. It's some sort of unstoppable monster, that gets closer to reality everyone someone uses a void weapon (eg those void guns Amaryllis was crafting at the beginning of the story). Hence the quest title, "Tragedy of the commons".
