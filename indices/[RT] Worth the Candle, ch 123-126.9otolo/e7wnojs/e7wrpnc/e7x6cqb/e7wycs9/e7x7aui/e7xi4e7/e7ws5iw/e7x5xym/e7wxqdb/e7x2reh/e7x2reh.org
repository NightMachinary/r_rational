It sounds like Vervain was used by the DM to keep Uther on the rails without Uther's knowledge. And considering that Juniper was actively hostile to the DM when they met, it would totally make sense for the DM to also have a secret agent doing his bidding.

The DM can't just pop in and say "you should really go check out this particular lead" and expect Joon to cooperate, but if one of the party members suggests it it could work well.
