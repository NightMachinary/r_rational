  Her not particularly ill intentioned but terribly destructive manipulations of Joon and Fenn seem similar to the Maddie situation.

Didn't think of that parallel before but actually really works. And its potentially relevant that the two were introduced at the same time in the plot.

There's also selfishness vs. ethics. She's trying to be ethical via what shes absorbed from Harry Potter. But constantly pushed towards bad actions by absorbing the minds of demons and devils along with fear of abandonment. (For earth Joon its short term self interest, having a relationship with Maddie even though he knew it was a bad idea.)
