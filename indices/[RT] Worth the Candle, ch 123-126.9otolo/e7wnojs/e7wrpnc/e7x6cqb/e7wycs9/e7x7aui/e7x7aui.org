I don't think it is more than metaphor, necessarily, but the start of this block was very heavy on mirroring, to the point that each character seemed like an aspect of Joon post Arthur dying.

Grak as his self loathing and suicidality, Amaryllis as his disconnected, analytic nature, Bethel as his rage and grief at Arthur leaving. Not sure about solace and Valencia, maybe Valencia is his out of control decision making?

I mean, he explicitly says that he favours stories with anthropomorphised character growth, and then the chapter where Amaryllis beats him up is called fight club, a movie where the mc beats himself up. Tons of other snippets, like Joon saying he could imagine cutting fingers off when he was grieving etc.

If it wasn't so trite (and apparently denied), it would make me lean back towards the dmpc being Arthur and Joon.
