  There have been scenarios where knowledge of the entity was presented to the world at large, as you suggest, in the hopes of mutual cooperation. The result, every time, was a race to the bottom as the nations of the world attempted to be the first to get on the entity's good side.

  Chapter 124: Fight Club

'Ahh, 'fight club', and the number one rule of fight club is to not talk about fight club and with all these new allies about to meet up at the house this is going to be a cheeky reference to secrecy and what can and can't be told to various parties'

...well, I can't say I wasn't forewarned

  “The world threw everything it had at him. He fought with a fervor that I doubt most men could ever have hoped to match. He had advantages, we all did, I would never dispute that, but he was put through the wringer until the very end, when there was practically nothing left of him.”

For me, taking believable characters and seeing how they're genuinely effected and changed by situations no normal person has to deal with is part of what I want out of rational fiction. I look at how a flawed but in all likelihood mostly decent person like Arthur could, after being put through a seriously fucked up, emotionally taxing marathon of physical and psychological hardship, turn into the sort of person Uther was and I recognise that most people would have fared no better.

I feel like those that are looking at Joon (including pre-Aerb Joon) and Arthur/Uther in terms of Black and White are missing out on the sort of subtle character concepts and arcs that can be uniquely explored by throwing people into truly unusual fantastical situations. Going Uther = Evil, Joon = Asshole is such a great disservice to their characters and a missed opportunity to experience how a believable character can /realistically/ be effected by some experiences truly out of the possibility space for any human being that has ever existed. (Also, Amarylis has just admitted that Joon is not that bad and she's very likely smarter and more rational than you :P )

  Fenn
#+end_quote

This story really has done a wonderful job of handling the aftermath of Fenn's death. Trying to have a genuine depiction of the characters reacting to her passing, which likely includes having the event cast a shadow over everything for a not insignificant period of time, /while/ not boring the reader or rehashing the same beats again and again sounded like a precarious balance to strike but to my delight I think WTC has handled it superbly.

  'Is one of my party members a DMPC? Could they be? Yes, obviously they could be, but were they?'
#+end_quote

I'd like to pre-emptively argue against the inevitable 'Amarlyis is a DMPC' theory. Yes, as was stated in chapter 124, she is often 'the groups compass', and she certainly functions in some respects to keep the group on course like Vervain apparently did. She also has taken up huge amounts of screen time to delve into her character, all of which would be retroactively pointless if she's been a DMPC all along. We also have a chapter narrated from the POV of End Story Juniper based on information given to him by Amarylis (the chapter where her soul is compromised) and for Amarylis to have been a DMPC without End Story Juniper mentioning the fact would mean that even at the stories end Juniper doesn't know that she's a DMPC (which would mean neither do we which means the whole thing would be mostly pointless) or that the chapter was delivered to us in bad faith by End Story Juniper which would be a cheap trick that I think the author is above.

I know the sub, understandably, likes to discuss the theoretically possible, not just the probable, but if anyone ACTUALLY thinks it's more likely than not that Amarylis is a DMPC then I would be happy to bet with them.
