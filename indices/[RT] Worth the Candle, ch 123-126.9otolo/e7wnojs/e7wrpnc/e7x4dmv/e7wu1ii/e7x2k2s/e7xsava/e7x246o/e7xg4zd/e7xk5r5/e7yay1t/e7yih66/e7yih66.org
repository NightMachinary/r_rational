I don't know. The whole "you can bring one of the party back from the dead easily, but /only/ this one character," and "you can see inside the souls of your companions to see their priorities, but not /this/ companion," both ring as suspicious to me.

Also, if I wanted my characters to explore the length and breadth of the world I'd created, "Find a new home for the last XXX of its species" is exactly the kind of quest I'd assign. Not to mention that it should be a fairly low-level quest, so it's the kind of thing a DMPC would be pressuring them to do /now/ (as opposed to going after Uther or Fel Seed or the Empire).
