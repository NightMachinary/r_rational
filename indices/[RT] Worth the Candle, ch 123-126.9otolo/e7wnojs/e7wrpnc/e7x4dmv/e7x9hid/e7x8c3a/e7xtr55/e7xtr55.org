This is a good point, Arthur was trapped within a narrative. Or at least thought of himself as trapped within a narrative. The DM, in such a circumstance, must be understood as the trapper, and therefore the enemy. So killing the DMPC /can/ make sense.

Juniper, on the other hand, is not 'trapped', so much as he has been shown a path and offered a reward. Unless that reward turns out to be a carrot on a stick, the DM is not an enemy so much as a potential inconvenience. Or a potential benefit, since without the DM Juniper would be powerless and in way the fuck over his head.

And even trying to identify the DMPC is an exercise in futility, as given what we know of the DM's ability to retroactively rewrite reality, literally anyone could be a DMPC at any time -- and that is assuming that the DM's power has limits, which Juniper does not seem to think is the case.

Until the DM is proven to be limited in some way, it's in Juniper's best interest to 1) Play along and be entertaining, and 2) 'Convince' the DM that it is in his best interest to follow through with his promise of DMhood to Juniper.

So really, Juniper getting in the way of the DM is just self-sabotaging. Everything and anything can be fixed (retroactively) after Juniper becomes DM.
