  /I'd like to pre-emptively argue against the inevitable 'Amarlyis is a DMPC' theory. Yes, as was stated in chapter 124, she is often 'the groups compass', and she certainly functions in some respects to keep the group on course like Vervain apparently did. She also has taken up huge amounts of screen time to delve into her character, all of which would be retroactively pointless if she's been a DMPC all along./

Frankly, it doesn't really matter who is a DMPC. All of Joon's party can very well all be DMPCs. They're all actors on a stage, as Joon's dreams hinted.

Joon has a closer relationship with his party than other characters of the plot, allowing them to bring out their subtle personality traits and likes/dislikes to flesh them out. Yet if things were different, e.g. Juniper saved the first girl in Chapter 1, she would be the Amarylis character in a different-yet-similar story.
