As much as is necessary to probe arbitrary mind state data, I suppose? It's probably not generally superintelligent or literally omniscient, otherwise it would have suborned Raven and the other librarians when they read its followers' books, but it could still be very smart and knowledgeable.

What I'm confused about is that part where it could directly communicate with its followers immediately after infecting them. How? Do its memagents conduct some sort of "ritual" upon entering human mind, which creates an extraplanar telepathic link? Or is there some kind of general "psychic network", and the infectees get plugged into it? Or does it just load a copy of itself into every infected human, with no "direct communication" necessary?

None of these ideas sound all that convincing. Maybe all this talk about "dangerous moving images" is just fluff with no predicative power, and it actually works on bullshit magic.
