I don't think revision magic is what would be being used to set Dahlia back, another problem besides killing her and turning her into a revision mage is that it would only go up until the most recent time Dahlia had teleported. It would have to be some other magic /entad.

The fact that Anglecynn doesn't try harder to protect Amaryillis is evidence against Amaryillis being Dahlia, but not very strong one since there are plausibly reasons for this being the case. One is that simply not many parts of Anglecynn know that Amaryllis is Dahlia (too better keep the secret), another is that the organization winding Dahlia back might have been deliberately set up to be very hands off (plausible that previous incarnations of Dahlia would do this if she had a hand in setting it up), another is that if Dahlia dies it is not a huge set back since there would still be people who count as Uthers grandchild and could be used to continue the project.

Assuming Dahlia skips a generation every time, with her family's slow birth rate that would mean she'd show up at the court every ~80 years or so, that's long enough that humans who knew her previous incarnation would have only known her as an old woman, and would think that Dahlia shows a strong family resemblance rather than being the same person. The only problem would be if Dahlia had regular contact to a member of a long lived race across incarnations, but those seem to be at least somewhat rare.
