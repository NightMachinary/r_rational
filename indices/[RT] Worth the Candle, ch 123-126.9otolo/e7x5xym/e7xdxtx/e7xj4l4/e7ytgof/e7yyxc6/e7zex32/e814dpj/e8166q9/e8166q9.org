In Mother of Learning your soul will last as long as you need it too, you body is what is the problem. "(It was probably obvious from the fact that there weren't a bunch of really old humans walking around, and the fact that Amaryllis was the most direct descendant at ten generations removed from Uther, but people still died from â€˜old age'. Even if you took care of physical health, mental health would eventually begin to decline, and if you took care of that, then the soul itself would start to unwind, dropping away bits and pieces of itself faster and faster as time went on. I was pretty sure those rules existed in service of maintaining a world that was a bit closer to Earth, since I'd used similar rules myself to curb the question of how everything becomes different if immortality is easy.)" - Chapter 114
