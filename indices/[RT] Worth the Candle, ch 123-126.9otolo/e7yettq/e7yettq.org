me: aw, my favorite characters are finally going to have a heart-to-heart talk---oh WHAT

man, these guys are /really/ not in a healthy place right now and that's understating things, but these chapters were awesome! I had to think for a minute to puzzle out the meaning of DMPC before turning the page but that was a great twist too. I'm impressed how you manage to make "a bunch of characters talking and info-dumping for 4 chapters" so entertaining.
