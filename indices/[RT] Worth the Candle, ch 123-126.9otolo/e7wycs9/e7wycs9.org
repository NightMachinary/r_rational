Chapter 124 is now one of my absolute favorite chapters. It's an emotional/strategic heart-to-heart with my favorite character. I love seeing her whirlwind of competence in action, and seeing past that to her emotional human core that cares about her friends and feels the weight of her mistakes is something I love even more. One of the strongest moments of the early game was when Joon and Fenn burst into the Gold Mage's place to save her, and the moment she laid eyes on them, her loyalty went up a level. I could hear her thinking "they came back for me" after probably writing off the rest of her life as fucked because it wasn't feasible to save her. After she abandoned Joon to his death right after they met.

God this story is good, and has only been making large strides in the right directions lately.
