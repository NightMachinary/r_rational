Someone here called the story being set on an Alderson disk a long time ago.

It's a great setting, especially because of the other side being habitable. I think it would be used more in fiction if it wasn't pretty much impossible for it to work in the real world because of engineering issues. But having it set inside a sim where you don't have to worry about material strength or making it thick enough for gravity to work means it can work perfectly.
