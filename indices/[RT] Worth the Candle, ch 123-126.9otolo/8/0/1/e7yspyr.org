  It sounds like Vervain was used by the DM to keep Uther on the rails without Uther's knowledge.

Yes - after Uther spent years dicking around. Joon came around on just the third bait girl, and also generally seems to run a much more focused campaign

There's also this from their conversation

  “She was,” he replied. “They all were [set up for Joon]. But they were set up as companions first, and love interests second, and now that they're out in the real world, so to speak, I've been keeping my hands off.”
