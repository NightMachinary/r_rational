I don't disagree with your logic, but I'm thinking more on a narrative level than a practical one. Having directly met the DM, I think it would be in poor narrative form for him to then have a DMPC instead of relying on the game interface or putting a finger on the scales. I don't think I can put it into words well, but that's the impression I get.
