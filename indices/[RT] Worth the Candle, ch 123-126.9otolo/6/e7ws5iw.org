So... Fel Seed sounds partially Zerg Overmind/Tyranid, partially Panacea on crack. Also vaguely Southern Reach-ish. Overall, my verdict is: that's a bad place; I recommend not going there.

I love libraries; I hope they end up travelling to the infinite library. This library outside of the world where you can fight things that will end existence as we know it... gotta say, I'm feeling some Library at Mount Char here, and that book was awesome.

Overall, these chapters have been good so far; I look forward to seeing where things go. As far as DMPCs in the present party go, I feel like what we're going to get at the end is something like...

The Real DMPC Was Inside You All Along.

(i.e. - Juniper or something which originally was him is the DM).
