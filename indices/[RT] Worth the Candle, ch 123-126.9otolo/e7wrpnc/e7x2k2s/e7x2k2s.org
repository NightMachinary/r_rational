  Going Uther = Evil, Joon = Asshole is such a great disservice to their characters and a missed opportunity to experience how a believable character can realistically be effected by some experiences truly out of the possibility space for any human being that has ever existed. (Also, Amarylis has just admitted that Joon is not that bad and she's very likely smarter and more rational than you :P )

Eh, I think assholes can be nuanced but pre-Aerb Joon was definitely an asshole and a bad friend even without going through what Uther had gone through in Aerb (maybe understandably since he was an inexperienced teenager and teens do dumb shit like that all the time but still true). Also, Amaryllis doesn't have the cultural background to understand why Joon's relationship with Maddy was wrong.

Maybe it's just different perspectives on things, but from what I've seen some people deal with stress on their own and others take it out on everyone around them. The stressors still don't excuse that behavior since you can just choose not to be an asshole. Plenty of people go through sheer hell in real life worse than anything even Uther had to go through and are still nice to other people. Unfortunately some people don't have the self-control to do that even by the time they're in their 60s.
