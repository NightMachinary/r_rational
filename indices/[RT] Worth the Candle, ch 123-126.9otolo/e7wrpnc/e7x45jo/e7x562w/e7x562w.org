Poorly worded by me. In chapter 73 we get a 'Amarylis' POV except part way through Joon breaks the 4th wall and tells us that his narration is based on information given to him by Amarylis after the fact. The entire point of an Amarylis POV chapter, even second hand, still falls apart if she is a DMPC though as it would be mostly fabricated.
