On one level, I really like this story.

On another level, I really hate this story because the emotions are just super fucking heavy, there's just /so many/ mental scars and illnesses that the characters wallow in to a ridiculous degree with new ones being introduced all the time--no one has any /real/ fortitude, and no one's had anything but an awful past--and then they all want to have these long unhealthy discussions with each other about their shit and the first time anyone makes a joke or says anything similar that could actually see them start to get past their issues the other person just says "sorry" and drags it back down into uber-serious-depressionness again. All the attempts to tiptoe through stuff as if coddling each other is healthy... Fuck me some of this just isn't fun to read through. :(
