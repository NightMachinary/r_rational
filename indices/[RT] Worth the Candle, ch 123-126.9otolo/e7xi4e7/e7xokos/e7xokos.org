Oh, that reminds me of something I noticed in the chapter. How did somebody on the Other Side know Uther's name, in order for the amulet to teleport him there?

It depends on how the entad defines that (e.g. full name vs. first name vs. nickname, intent required, degree of phonetic similarity), but under some of those interpretations it seems very unlikely that it would be a totally random event.

In such a scenario, how did they find out about Uther, and how much are they saying his name now that he's worried about ending up back there?
