The subject of the Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer. Also, a movie that came out this year (Annihilation).

I read the books and then watched the movie; on the whole, I recommend the movie, but the books were fairly disappointing. Some good prose, but ultimately not worth a recommendation.

Basically, the books were [[https://qntm.org/mystery][Mystery Boxes]] throughout and there were no good answers to the central mysteries at any time. They had all the failings of mystery box works, and because the mystery was kept central to the books plot and not diluted with great characters or more sensible plot elements or whatever there's not really a lot to recommend.

The movie was not that /much/ better at providing answers but the ending was more satisfactory and it also dragged out for significantly less time, and the visual effects, acting, etc were all pretty good, and a number of the characters were better realized even if they were very quickly sketched in because of the limitations of the cinematic format.
