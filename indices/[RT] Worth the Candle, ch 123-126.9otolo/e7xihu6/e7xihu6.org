It was Amazing. And srs guys Joon knows how to defeat fell seed, its just that obvious that its hiding in plain sight. Just ask yourself how you can deafeat anything in DnD, a lvl 1 warrior "can" kill an elder dragon, he just needs to constantly roll 20 and the dragon to roll 1. Plus avoiding being killed by other dragonly means. Doesnt he have luck as a stat? Also elf bones.
