So, I want to eventually write an SI Multicross /(I know)/ that has part of it set in Aerb. I'm kinda scared of eventually doing so, since you set a pretty high bar. It'll probably need to be an AU, because I just don't think I could do the characters justice.

When them worldbuilding docs comin' out? ;)

Love the story! :)
