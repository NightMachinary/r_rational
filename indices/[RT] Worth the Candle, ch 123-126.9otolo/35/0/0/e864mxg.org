Has the Void Beast been mentioned before?

Even if it is widely known, it seemed a bit odd for it to be mentioned in the summary, when it hadn't been mentioned in the meeting. My brain tried to link it to one of the mentioned issues, and chose the Super Secret Memetic hazard. I was then pretty surprised, thinking that Amarylis had carelessly referred to the Super Secret Memetic hazard by name, and amused that June was then helpfully given a summary by the game interface.
