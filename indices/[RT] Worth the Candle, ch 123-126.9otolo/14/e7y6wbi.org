I am a bit worried..each new update of Worth the Candle makes me feel like Juniper on a level-up, but I cannot edit my soul to prevent my longing for new content!

Really enjoying these character interaction and worldbuilding centric segments, I cannot wait to find out what's next in Joon's Wild Ride. Also holy crap, the potential DMPC hidden among the party ramps up the paranoia fuel to a delicious extent!
