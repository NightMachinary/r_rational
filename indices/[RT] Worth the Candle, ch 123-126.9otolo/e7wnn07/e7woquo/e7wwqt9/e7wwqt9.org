This work /generally/ uses male or female pronouns for dwarves, partly because it's a bit jarring/confusing to break out a third gender, partly because it's an absolute pain to write, and partly because Groglir is an ergative-absolutive language instead of a nominative-accusative language (meaning that it's even easier to screw up).

Here, Juniper is reading in the original Groglir and mentally translates gender to 'female' instead of 'male' for unstated reasons.
