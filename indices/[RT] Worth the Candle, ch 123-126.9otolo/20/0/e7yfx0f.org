I dunno, I think Solace makes a lot of sense. You know that rule of thumb, about how any character with more than two adjectives is relevant?

Solace has a single defining factor, druidic ability, which breaks her ability to employ rational thought, and her need to repair the locus is reasonable for her character, but the way she keeps bringing it up and being pushed back seems to clearly be a set-up for a future confrontation where they will have to decide whether to honour their commitments to her and ignore a pressing moral disaster.

She has one adjective, no emotional depth, very little exposition, and is being set-up for a confrontation that will damage the group. Wondering about whether she is the dmpc feels like wondering whether Quirrell was Voldemort, this is rational fiction and if an answer appears to be right we should follow Joon's example and ignore narrative pressure.
