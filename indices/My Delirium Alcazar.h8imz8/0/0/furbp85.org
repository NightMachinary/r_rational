As a person who's read the comic so far (I actually recommended it in the most recent weekly recommendation thread):

It fits quite a lot of the sidebar.

- The characters are fairly intelligent. One thing you don't see in a lot of rational fiction is that they're also /emotionally/ intelligent - the main character is aware of the times when her thinking isn't necessarily at its best due to anxiety or what have you, and takes steps to fix that first (of course it helps that there's a hivemind giving her input).
- A lot of the story revolves around /figuring out/ the motivations of the antagonist / non-protagonists. The main characters themselves have fairly simple goals and motives.
- Dunno, the story hasn't gotten to the climax yet. IMO the payoff of the previous story (Blood is Mine) was pretty good though.
- As mentioned before, the main character is pretty good about figuring out when her mental state isn't great and taking steps to fix it. So far she hasn't done much about improving her reasoning, but she has kept herself from digging below baseline.
- The reason why I recommended this story is because quite a lot of it is about the characters /figuring out/ what the rules are. So far, they've been consistent and intriguing. It's fun!

For the adjacent tropes, this is (as mentioned by the author) sort of a deconstruction of a video game isekai story, with touches of munchkinry and genre savviness - the MC basically makes not-YouTube videos about video games, and then gets isekai'd into a videogame-like space in her dreams.

It's hard to say if this is a fair-play whodunnit since we don't have many answers yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone who's read Blood is Mine would be able to make some guesses. My guess: Personally I think it's pretty clear that the Spooky House is someone's leftover Red, and it's attempting to communicate with Plaire through her dreams, though I dunno to what purpose
