I think rationality would be more dictated by how you interpret reader commands and the ensuing narrative rather than the commands themselves. How much of the sidebar does your story fit?

--------------

Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

Presence of these particular features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

Adjacent tropes: Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence doesn't make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

Fair-Play Whodunnit: story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.

Absence of Deus Ex Machina: established story rules are never broken.

Deconstruction: genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.

Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.

Genre Savviness: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.
