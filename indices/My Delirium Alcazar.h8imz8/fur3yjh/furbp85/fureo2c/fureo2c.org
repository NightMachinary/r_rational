This basically covers it (and I'm way more comfortable having an outside perspective make this kind of call, rather than me the writer trying to be objective about how rational and consistent my own writing is), but I'm going to add I'm definitely /angling/ for a pretty fair-play whodunnit. There will definitely be some big goofy twists on the way there, but I fully expect everyone to start piecing the answers together as more and more context is revealed. Some of the readers have already answered a couple of the story's questions and don't even realize it yet.

Whether I'll /execute/ that smoothly has yet to be seen, but I plan on it being that kind of mystery (or mysteries, I guess). Also thank you IICVX
