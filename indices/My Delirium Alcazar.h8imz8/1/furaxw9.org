I haven't read either of your stories yet, but it looks really interesting. I'm just commenting to ask, why are you posting the sequel to Royalroad, but not /Blood is Mine/? Just seems a bit odd.

EDIT: Whoops. I just realized, /My Delirium Alcazar/ isn't complete yet. I assumed that you were posting one 'book' and not the other. Instead you were uploading chapters as you are writing the story.
