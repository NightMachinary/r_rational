If you don't mind an adventure/mystery series with a secondary focus on romance, the Kitty Norville series- which is about a werewolf radio host- is a pretty rational take on the setting.

The worldbuilding has a good feeling of plausibility- one of the books is set at a series of Congressional hearings on werewolves, while another is set at a scientific conference on the study of vampires. The characters also tend to be unusually down-to-earth for the genre- more ordinary, generally intelligent people trying to make the best of very strange situations than broad archetypes or cheesy wish fulfillment.
