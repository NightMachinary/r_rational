Shortly after I read Worm, I started reading Pact.

Reading Worm was fine, but Pact was so terrifying that I had to stop halfway through. I only was able to continue a year and a half later, and I stopped reading for a week during the stairs scene at the end.

I still haven't worked on the courage to read Twig or Ward yet. Wildbow's work is amazing, but exhausting.
