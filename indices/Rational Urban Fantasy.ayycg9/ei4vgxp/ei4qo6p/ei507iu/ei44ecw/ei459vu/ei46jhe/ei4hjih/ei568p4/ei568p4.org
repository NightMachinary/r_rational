Definitely wasn't saying it's fully rational, although there are certainly some rational elements---most notably the backstory and classification of types of magic, which is based on careful investigation, although a lot of that is subjoined.

/Worm/ isn't urban fantasy, though. It has some fantasy elements, and an urban setting, but "urban fantasy" is a pretty strictly defined genre, where the focus is on naturally occurring paranormal creatures and their conflicts with humans. Arguing whether it actually is urban fantasy is a separate discussion; for the purposes of responding to someone asking for urban fantasy recommendations, /Worm/ isn't an accurate response, anymore than Dresden Files wouldn't be a good response to someone asking for superhero fiction recommendations.
