The first Fifteen Lives of Harry August

â€‹

Not that much urban and only semi rational but very well written and a could fit your needs, Basically he lives his live again and again always same time etc... and there are other people like him, but also comes with its downsides ( being in a mental asylum while pain and drugs were still used). Wont say any more its quite nice and interesting.
