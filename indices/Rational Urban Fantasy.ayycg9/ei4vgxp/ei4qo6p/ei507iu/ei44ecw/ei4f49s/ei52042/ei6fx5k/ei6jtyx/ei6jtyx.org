  This presents a quandary for the ratfic reader, because most of the time, the setting just isn't an equilibrium. The worldbuilding has to explain why the world is somehow exactly the same as ours, yet has this one big gamechanging difference that has no impact on society, on the economy, on politics, on culture.

So I've given this some thought while designing a world for my own writing. You're definitely onto something, but I think it's doable if you make some departures from the typical urban fantasy setting.

- No monsters

- No flashy magic

- Magic was discovered recently and is impossible to rediscover

- Strong magical authority encouraging secrecy

​

No monsters is pretty obvious. If you've got wolves, fae, vampires, and god knows what else wandering around the streets, people are going to notice. There's really no way around that. That's actually okay because there's plenty of stuff to exploit just inside humans -- a villain doesn't need to be a vampire to be evil. You do lose some cool thematic stuff, but most of that's been done so much that it's pretty cliche by now so you aren't missing out on much. Wolves form hierarchies, are overprotective, and fight a lot. Vampires form covens and have human cattle. Faeries are capricious and cruel. We get it.

​

Flashy magic, like virtually all pyromancy, is also a big problem because it's too easy to leak. All it takes is two morons in a public place who can't set aside their grudge and it's all over YouTube. Fortunately, text doesn't lend itself particularly well to flashy effects, so this isn't a big deal as long as magic is still interesting. For example, instead of throwing a fireball (obviously magical), magic could just light the target on fire (still strange, but less obvious).

​

Recently discovered magic means that civilization hasn't had much time to diverge from our reality. I'm thinking something like the last hundred years, and most of that was spent with only a handful of people aware of magic. That neatly resolves the whole impact on science, tech, society, etc. If magic can't be rediscovered (it was a chance finding, it's really really hard, etc) then the only way for the outsiders to learn about it is for an insider to tell them.

​

Authority is important, because in traditional urban fantasy you have a bazillion factions and somehow they're all working together to keep things quiet... yeah, that's not going to happen. But if there's a single powerful authority and a bunch of weaker factions, then the underdogs have a good reason to stay silent. Plus, a centralized power means they can deal with covering up the occasional mistake quickly and efficiently (no politics).

​

But finally, even with all that, I think the best that can be done is a local, temporary equilibrium. There's just no way to keep it a secret forever. Information spreads. Even relatively harmless censored information tends to spread, and magic is something everyone would want once they knew it was real. So keep that in mind and have it be part of the story. The world isn't static and unchanging, it's in the middle of huge world-changing times. There's /so/ much potential for interesting ideas there.
