... aw, well dang. I enjoyed Worm less and less as time went on due to the grimdark. By the end, I was just... Done with it. TGAB might not be strictly rational, but it was a damn good palate cleanser from the utter pessimism of Worm. I wanted to get back to Wildbow, and I had heard positive stuff about Pact... But if it's even worse (emotionally) than Worm? Forget about it ðŸ˜¥

Not to say Worm was poorly written; far from it! But it just made me personally stressed and depressed. Wildbow's a good author for being able to do that, but it's past my limits. If Pact is even worse/better? Big ol' nope from me.

... Gonna go catch up on the Rationally Writing podcast instead!
