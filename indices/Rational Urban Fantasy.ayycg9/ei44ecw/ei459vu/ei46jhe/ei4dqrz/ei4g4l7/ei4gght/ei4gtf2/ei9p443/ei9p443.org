It's still grim. The world itself is definitely /more/ grim even. Tvtropes for instance says that it is a world where everyone is Bonesaw.

The main difference is that there are much more moments of downtime, lightness and happiness interspersed between the intense action and horror than there were in his previous stories. So the world is darker but the group of main characters is more wholesome in a way.
