Yeah, but I'm not sure whether I'd qualify it as rational. The whole idea of magic as being based on symbolism and hand-waviness is flavorful, but kind of flies in the face of rationalfic IMO. I just never really got a firm grasp on what the various characters' specific capabilities were, because they were all nebulous by design.

Worm is much higher on the rationality scale, while still being arguably fantasy. I mean, yes, there's fantasy meaning "elves and wizards," but people who can turn into dragons and control darkness also qualify as fantastical even if they're wearing tights and a cape.
