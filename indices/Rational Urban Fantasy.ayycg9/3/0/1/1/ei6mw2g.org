The magic system running on symbolism and conceptual stuff does run contrary to what this sub generally likes to worldbuild, but a key factor of that is that the people treat it like a system that can be understood and interacted with beyond the surface level, even if that understanding is 'this action will appeal to the conceptual voodoo that runs the universe and might help me going forwards'.

It /sounds/ like it should be full of handwavium and plot armor and stuff because it's vague and subjective, but it defines its rules and pretty much plays them straight, so it's pretty coherent in my mind.
