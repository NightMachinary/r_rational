In the cartoon "chi" was brought up a lot. Chi is an energy that's projected as the "elements" Air,Water,Earth, and Fire. And their seems to be sub elements as fire benders can also bend lightning if their good enough. Maybe everyone has chi but some are actually able to use it to project it as a element. And the avatar is the only one who can project chi as all the elements.

As for uses for bending their are many uses for air. For one theirs sound manipulation or Sound distortion: Air benders could create compression waves to distort sound. One could create a sonic boom to stop opponents. Air benders could also alter the ambient pressure, very useful for stealth.

Air benders could also create shock waves by manipulating the air. By compressing air very densely you could create a bomb and depending on the circumstances "fire bend".

Earth could be used for sand bending. I figure a very talented earth bending can bend metal not anything about their being earth in metal or grains of sand could be out in metal.

Fire could be augumented for more power. Its sub element,lightning, could be used for magnetic fields running electricity through electromagnetics. With electromagnetism one could generate shock waves at best stun an opponent or fuck their eardrums.

Water benders could vaporize their water and humidify the area, soak or saturate it with enough moisture like a water defense where a water bender can compress the water to change its state of matter.

The monks could prefer thinking more not so much about spiritually. Concepts such as mathematics, science, etc will be concepts that Aang will be taught.

Sokka could be shikamaru-like just more eccentric. Spirits could be extra-dimensional alien entities or even extraterrestrial.
