  Every Japanese celebrity writeup and every anime character description with any claim to authority gives the person's (or character's) blood type. Why? Because, thanks to a remarkable bit of Science! by a gentleman named Furukawa Takeji, many Japanese believe that a person's blood type affects their personality.

It's actually extremely common to give their blood type because of this.
