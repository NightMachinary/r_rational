First point: Basically every review you've ever left, either on FFN or on Reddit, has come across to me as at least somewhat insulting and has expressed how something in the story bothers you. Furthermore, your comments often show that you have misread, not read, or misunderstood something. Then, at the end of your reviews, you often say "really enjoying it" or "can't wait for book 2". The combination of these three things is really confusing for me. No matter what, though, I wish you would phrase things a little more politely.

  I really dislike that kind of concept where if you're angry enough suddenly Gods power doesn't work[....] As if people who cave into it like Suze just aren't angry enough or aren't using the right emotions that the main character is that obviously solves it!
#+end_quote

That isn't what happened; it was explicitly stated that Macht had hit Jake (and Suze) with the fear and then let it go. It was slowly wearing off, and Jake managed to get out from under it as it wore off. Suze, having been repeatedly described as "mousey", had a harder time fighting it off and it took her a little longer.

  They [the Gods] felt him [Neklos] vanish from the multiverse, but how did they even know that it was Suze who did it?
#+end_quote

"They" didn't. Arros did. He's the God of Magic. His portfolio sense informs him every time anyone casts a spell anywhere. As a greater god he can even look into the past or the future to see who has been casting spells.

I really don't know how you want me to address this point, so I'll just move past it.

#+begin_quote
  [Portfolio of Pain; bacteria and cells]
#+end_quote

The Portfolio of Pain was never discussed; I'm unclear what you're asking for here.

#+begin_quote
  [Arros, Zone of Truth, etc]
#+end_quote

No, most of the gods there were casters and could have performed the spell, if they had it prepared. Arros, however, is the God of Magic; he can cast any arcane spell as a free action without having to expend a spell slot. Why pay money for something that your friend can do for free?

Again, just going to roll by this one.

#+begin_quote
  I don't even understand why they would just be like "ok let's argue about her two suggestions"
#+end_quote

The point of that section was that every god wanted the portfolio of Death, but no god wanted any /other/ god to have it. No one was starting the discussion because they all knew it was going to be a problematic one. Herr√∫n got the discussion started by focusing the discussion on two separate gods, both of them very powerful.

#+begin_quote
  Ok, what the fuck? Trial of combat = death could just have declared war on every other God one by one and kept expanding his portfolio? That rule = one guy is powerful = RIP everyone else.
#+end_quote

Gods prefer not to fight directly. It tends to draw in their allies and turn into a giant war of god against god. Instead they stick with proxy wars, killing off each other's worshippers to weaken one another.

  lOoking forward to Book 2

Thank you for saying that.
