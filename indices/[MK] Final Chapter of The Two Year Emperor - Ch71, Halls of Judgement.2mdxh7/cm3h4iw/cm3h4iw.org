Emotions that don't make sense can't just be ignored, schizophrenic people often know what they're seeing is hallucinations or what they're hearing, that doesn't change anything, it doesn't make it easier to cope with or better, I'm sure there's some point in your life where you've had rational thought inside your head while your body did something else, it's the same thing. I really dislike that kind of concept where if you're angry enough suddenly Gods power doesn't work, as if Gods power and even emotion would function like that. As if people who cave into it like Suze just aren't angry enough or aren't using the right emotions that the main character is that obviously solves it!

They felt him vanish from the multiverse, but how did they even know that it was Suze who did it? They don't know it was Suze in particular so why do they think it was any of them? Where do they get that idea from?

If you felt that A GOD WAS KILLED, why would you BE POLITE? He's the fucking God of War, he literally speaks about not giving up advantage to be honourable, WHEN HE ISN'T IMMEDIATELY READING THEIR ENTIRE MIND?!?? Hell, I thought Gods always automatically knew when they were being lied to, isn't that part of the parcel? Are they really so simple they can't detect body language or any of a dozen other signs higher beings notice?

  Tell that to the man lying crushed and broken at the bottom of a cliff. Or the child who was just run over by the oxcart. Or the woman too old to walk, wracked with pain in her joints. Death has its place, mortal. Now, tell us what you did

How is he going to justify the Portfolio of Pain? Also, shouldn't like, everyone be immediately fucked as cells and bacteria fail to die?

Did Arros actually audibly have to cast Zone of Truth, is he the only God there that can do that? Can Gods not cast all spells? Do Gods need to go through POPE? No God of Truth or Honour or True Intentions?

"I just happen to know how to change the laws of Physics"

That's a direct lie, that's completely a lie, in every way.

He is also not trapped outside of time.

Also Macht interrupted him after like 2 seconds of talking about Einstein.

What the fuck? Are the Gods that stupid? Herrun and Loki seem infinitely smart to the other Gods, oh wow some new God known for causing trouble and hanging out with Loki suddenly volunteers some stupid suggestion that no one else is supporting BETTER ARGUE VEHEMENTLY. BUT WAIT, NO ONE WANTS THE GOD OF WAR, WHO AM I ARGUING WITH?!?!

I don't even understand why they would just be like "ok let's argue about her two suggestions"

The Gods portrayed as is I'm surprised the universe functions, they've existed with Loki for millenia and they're still led astray by the most obvious of things?

Ok, what the fuck? Trial of combat = death could just have declared war on every other God one by one and kept expanding his portfolio? That rule = one guy is powerful = RIP everyone else.

lOoking forward to Book 2
