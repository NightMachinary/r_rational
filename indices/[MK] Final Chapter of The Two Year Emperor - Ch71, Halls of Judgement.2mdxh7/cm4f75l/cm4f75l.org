If Suze gained the portfolio, does it come bundled with an ascension, or is that a separate attribute?

This raises a few interesting questions. Of immediate importance, could Suze alter the portfolio, changing the nature of death in any way? For example, instead of automatically dying at -10, there's no limit to how far into the negatives your HP can be, and dying is now a free action alongside dropping items and talking.

Of past relevance, doesn't this kind of make the threatened divine punishment from making a perpetual Wishing loop moot? If a god needs a portfolio to be a deity, then Jake couldn't possibly use the ring of three wishes to steal a portfolio, especially considering that it seems to have ownership mechanics preventing any one deity from just nicking it when no one's looking, even when it's one that's currently inactive in the world.
