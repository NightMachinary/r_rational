Shouldn't Arros have just known anyway? Wouldn't having the Magic domain give him a protfolio sense every time someone casts a spell (like, say, /Plane Shift/ or /Polymorph Any Object/)? Even if he didn't notice it at the time, portfolio sense extends into the past, so if he /can/ detect when a spell is cast, he could figure out it was her after the fact.
