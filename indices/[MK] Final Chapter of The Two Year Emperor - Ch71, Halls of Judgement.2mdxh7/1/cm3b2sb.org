This was what I'd predicted, but I'm surprised Arros suggested it. When he began the trial by combat speech I thought he was going to challenge the empty portfolio or something, and take it.

Taking the portfolio of death doesn't necessarily seem as though it would be great for Suze though. A massive power boost, of course, but if gods are shaped by their worshippers and Suze takes Neklos' position, his worship may carry onto her, and make her evil.
