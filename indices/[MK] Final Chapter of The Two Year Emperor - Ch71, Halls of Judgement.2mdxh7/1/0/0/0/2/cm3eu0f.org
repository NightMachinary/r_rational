While on the subject of madoka I would like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To the stars]] a pretty good rationalist fanfiction that is written as a sequel to the puella magi Madoka series. Though I highly suggest watching the original series first as it is an amazing show and deconstruction of the magical girl theme.
