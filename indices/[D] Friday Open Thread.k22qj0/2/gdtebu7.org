  There is a story that the Powers tell, that the scientific world began when the angel Za'afiel smote the Earth. It was before humans were around, or at least, they were in Eden, but the dinosaurs were there, and one of them defecated on or near an angel.

  And so Za'afiel smashed the Earth.

  And the Earth couldn't just say, “That wasn't my fault.” Because whenever you say that something isn't your fault, what you're really saying is, that /could/ be my fault. Maybe. There's something there. Maybe I'm just an ugly and broken enough world, what with dinosaur digestive issues and all, that I deserve K-T extinction events.

  So instead it did things one better, and said: of course I don't deserve that, because /there's no such thing as deserving/.
