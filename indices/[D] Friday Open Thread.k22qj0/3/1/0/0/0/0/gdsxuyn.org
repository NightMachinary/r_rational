I don't know much about your field, but I have seen people in fields seemingly unrelated to programming make use of prediction analysis or reinforcement learning to great effect. I admit a lack of experience in this area and advise contacting someone who switched from a field related to yours to data science, but from what I understand, a good methodology would be to learn just enough of the basic concepts in ML/DL to get a rough understanding of which direction seems promising with respect to your work.
