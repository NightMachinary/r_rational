Thought to follow-up on this -- asked for a laptop and was given carte blanche, so I'm getting a macbook with a few upgrades (e.g. to the i9 processor, 64 gigs of memory, etc.). Also told that if I needed anything else, like a fancy ergonomic desk or eGPU / server etc. to just ask. So it sounds like that shouldn't be a problem, at least!
