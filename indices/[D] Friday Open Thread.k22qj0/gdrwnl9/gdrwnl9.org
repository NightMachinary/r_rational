So, mostly trolling, but despite the whole thing being mindless happy fluff and nearly all the side characters holding giant idiot balls nearly all the time... I hereby declare this season's "Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle" anime is, in fact, rational fiction.

Hear me out:

- MC makes full use of her (initially few) abilities and inherent properties of the world, up to and including death not being permanent, to experiment with and learn about her environment and expand her options

- Although MC is not very knowledgeable, and some "facts" others have taught her are blatantly incorrect, she tests her knowledge and learns from her tests

- MC has goals which, although not aligned with commonly accepted human morality, are consistent and well defined

- MC directly, ruthlessly, relentlessly exploits all objects and sentients in her environment and properties of it to achieve her goals
