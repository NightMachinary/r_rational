Ah, true --- I should ask if we can rent something through work, I think I'm just a bit shy to ask (and my new PI is around two orders of magnitude better funded than my old one, so presumably has room in the budget for computer hardware)! Though having one of my own would be nice for side projects and other personal use, and I do so like shiny toys...

I have heard to steer clear of the new macs though, with their recent vertical integration / new CPU architecture, at least for a generation or three. Would maybe even go for the 2015 13‚Äù MBP --- had one up until the start of this year, when a student stole it while my back was turned lmao
