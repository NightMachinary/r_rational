Ah I've always maintained an aggressive (if not downright irresponsible) work-life balance, probably working closer to 20 or so meaningful hours each week, if that. But I'll be sure to ask about the computer situation :) I think it's also just that going through the formal channels is such a rip off that spiritually I'd rather just spend my own money, especially if it's for something that'll serve multiple purposes and will allow me to recoup costs later (e.g. when Ryzen first dropped I put together an 8-node cluster for around a tenth the yearly buy-in for the equivalent amount of compute, which ran most of my grad school projects and will probably get sold off in the coming months with fairly minimal losses).
