I have known dozens upon dozens of fresh-faced young postdocs and grad students, and almost every single one was "a bit too shy to ask" for this or that, or didn't think it was a big enough deal to bring up.

*Ask anyway*. Your job is a job. You exchange your labor for money; they exchange money for your labor. None of your money or capital goes into the job, and none of your personal time goes into the job.

If your PI wants you to supply your own computer, it's your computer, and they don't get to dictate what you do with it or what software you install on it.

(This has been your intro-level Pastarant about academia's broken expectations of postdocs/graduate students. Don't even get me started about working hours. Just say no to unpaid overtime for any position with less than 1% of the venture's total equity.)
