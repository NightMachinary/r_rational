Programming is not for everyone, but if you think you'd enjoy it, I suggest learning the bare basics of a few domains like front-end web or app design (ReactJS/React Native or Flutter, along with a basic understanding of JavaScript), back-end development (JavaScript, and a framework like NodeJS or Django), software development (I'm not entirely sure what's in use today, so I suggest you look into it on your own - best bet I have is on Java or C++), or machine learning (Python, and ML frameworks like Tensorflow). Again, just try the basics to figure out what you'd be interested in, because tastes wildly fluctuate between these - I enjoy front-end development, but I detest working on the back-end, for example. Beyond that, you learn best in practise, so I'd recommend doing/collaborating with others on projects like websites, apps, or open-source contributions to frameworks, or freelancing, which does bring in some nifty side income.

There are some very good courses to learn all of them, although depending on how you learn, there are some website guides (like w3schools) that might be better (I learned front-end development from one of those, and ML programming from a course).

In data science, there are some well-researched resources to learn it the best you can. Here's [[https://80000hours.org/articles/ai-policy-guide/#resources][one]] by 80000hours.org, and [[https://humancompatible.ai/bibliography][another]] by FHAI. They both recommend Andrew Ng's [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning][course on Machine Learning]] as an excellent starting point.

If you're asking specifically about creating a resume attractive to companies, I'd recommend finding projects to work on either alone or as part of a group (there's a lot of space to find ideas while you're learning the concepts, and there are always people looking for collaborators on their projects online), and if you have the time, getting an internship in the field, or working with someone on a research paper.
