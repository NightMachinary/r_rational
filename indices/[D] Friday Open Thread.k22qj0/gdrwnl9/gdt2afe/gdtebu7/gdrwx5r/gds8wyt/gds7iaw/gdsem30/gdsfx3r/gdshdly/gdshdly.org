Yeah, I probably wouldn't want to go for any full-fledged internships or anything, but my soon-to-be position is still considered a training program, and the PI is very flexible with what I'll actually be doing (there are a bunch of initial projects I can pick from to hit the ground running, but he's also cool with me using whatever data or technology I want to work on anything that's at least vaguely relevant to the lab's overarching theme). Those initial projects won't necessarily be the sexiest, but they should be pretty interesting and impactful still (probably not nature / science / cell flagship tier, unless we get really lucky results, but in their broader publishing groups).
