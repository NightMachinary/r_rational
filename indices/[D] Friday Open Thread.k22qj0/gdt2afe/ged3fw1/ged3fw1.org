I'm about to start grad school in January and wish I could defer for another semester, but I have $3,000 in non-refundable tuition deposits and $60k in grants saying no. I'm hoping to milk every last util out of online classes in the spring, and that vaccines will roll out fast enough that I can be on campus with some semblance of normalcy in fall '21.

Glad you figured out an alternative, and I hope you get back to school sooner than later.
