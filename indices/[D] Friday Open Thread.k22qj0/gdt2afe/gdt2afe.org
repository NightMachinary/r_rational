I'm taking a leave of absence from school until classes are in-person again. I spent the 7 years before law school working remotely, and a big part of the reason that I went back to school was for the human interaction. Zoom classes are both significantly lower quality and completely fail to satisfy the human interaction component that I desired.

There are plenty of logical reasons to take a leave of absence, and I'll be working on a really interesting startup during my leave -- but it still feels a bit like I'm wimping out/giving up. This pandemic sucks.
