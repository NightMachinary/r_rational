I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/jycuyj/received_these_emails_backtoback_this_week_no/][graduated last week]] and will be starting my first "almost-real big-boy" job next Tuesday! Have a good few projects to choose from, none of which I'm really familiar with, so lots of learning & exciting times ahead. Does anyone here have any hot beginner tips & tricks for new postdocs? Also, if anyone here's a programmer or data scientist -- those are my main fallbacks in case academia doesn't work out -- so I'd be keen to hear how best to make myself more attractive to those industries these next 1-3y (anthropology grad... [[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k08ei9/recent_anthropology_grad_w_little_formal/][more details here]]).

Otherwise, today is Black Friday, which despite its US origins has become something of an international holiday. Are you buying anything? I made a list of things I'd like to get in case there are any good sales:

- a lightweight, portable laptop, ideally <14" w/ non-soldered storage and memory, with 8c/16t, able to dual boot into windows / linux (i.e. good driver support), or maybe a macbook pro

- a graphics card capable of gaming at 4K/60Hz on "high" settings in recent titles, with freesync support, and also decent at graphical computing in a pinch -- maybe a used Turing or an in-stock Big Navi / Ampere

- a tablet to read articles / books on, maybe the 4th gen 13" iPad Pro, or one of the 13" e-ink screens

- a telephoto zoom lens for my camera -- the Sigma 100-400mm E-mount being my top desire atm

- a decent road bike, to upgrade my 7 year old $150 hybrid for commuting

- moar weights (both DBs and Plates) and an incline bench, for lifting purposes with gyms closed in the indefinite near-term

Probably not gonna get all of those this year even, but keeping my eye out for deals (mostly through the weekend -- going hiking in a low-service area today) and trying not to get too much random shit (which I've already failed, having bought a bunch of whey and a Kindle Oasis, the latter of which will mostly get used for reading stuff off here). Anyone here looking for anything in particular?
