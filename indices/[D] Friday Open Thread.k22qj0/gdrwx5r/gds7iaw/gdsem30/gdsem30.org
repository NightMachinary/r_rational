Thank you for the advice! :) I have some familiarity with the specific tools you listed, and will probably gain more in the coming years. I've heard side projects and academic work are not very highly regarded by industry, at least compared to actual experience at actual companies. Do you know if that's true, or if it varies by type of position (I think my ideal job title in this possible future would be some sort of “Senior Data Scientist” type thing at a FAANG-like company, rather than at a random startup, though I'd also be more than happy to start in a junior role or work in a less established company initially).
