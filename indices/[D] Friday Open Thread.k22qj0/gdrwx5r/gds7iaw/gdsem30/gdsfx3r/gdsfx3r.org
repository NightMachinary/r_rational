Actual experience is definitely regarded more highly than side projects and academic work in general, but I assumed you wouldn't have the time for that if you were busy with your current job. Although, the point about projects is a very generalized one, because most side projects by CS students are basic or unoriginal. If you work on a good project - something that you could deploy, or publish a research paper on - that's valuable on a level comparable to mid-tier work experience.
