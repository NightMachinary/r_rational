I think software compatibility would be my biggest concern, especially also wrt comparability with as-yet-uncertain security (e.g. medical confidentiality) software. Otherwise I'm “professionally” most familiar with the macOS ecosystem, since it's also what most of my colleagues use and what I've used historically (e.g. the bash shell, Xcode... there are workarounds, sure, but I like the “native” support, since otherwise I've used hackintoshes the last 5 or so years and the tinkering can occasionally be a headache). Plus the build quality and aesthetics are nice lol :) and I wouldn't be using it for any heavy lifting, that would all be outsourced to clusters, so budget-wise I'd be shooting for the ~$1k range anyway. On top of that, one can take advantage of occasional promos, e.g. Best Buy and Target are currently giving you a $20 gift card with the purchase of a $100 apple gift card, effectively ~17% off if you shop at either store. But yes, going back to Linux is certainly on the table!
