If you need work-issued spyware on your laptop (as I do, and many others as well), they need to either buy/reimburse the laptop or provide you with one. If an employer demands that you both provide a laptop that you paid for and that you install oversight software on it, I hope you are aggressively looking for a new employer and triple-checking your contract and benefits, because that kind of toxicity is always systemic/structural.

Xcode is very nice but VSCode is perfectly fine, zsh is zsh is zsh, etc.
