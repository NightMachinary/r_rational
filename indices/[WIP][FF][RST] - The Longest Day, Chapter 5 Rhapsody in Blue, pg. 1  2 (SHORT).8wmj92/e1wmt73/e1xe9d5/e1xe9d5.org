Okay... we know Hermione's an alicorn at the moment because she copied Twilight's body plan, but if she comes back to life as a pony, will she continue being an alicorn because she's now survived death?

(I guess the reason for her to be a pony would be if she decides Atlantis aka Equestria is so fascinating she wants to visit and research there herself. She probably wouldn't stay long if Harry's still on Earth, though.)

On another note, which Element maps to which?
