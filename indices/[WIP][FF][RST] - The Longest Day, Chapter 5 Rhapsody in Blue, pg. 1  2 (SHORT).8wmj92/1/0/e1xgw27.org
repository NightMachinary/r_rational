Questions that will definitely be answered as the story goes on... :)

As for the Elements, the mapping is as such:

Generosity/Beauty -> Space (Mirror of Noitilov)

Honesty/Strength -> Power (Philosopher's Stone)

Laughter/Hope -> Time (???)

Kindness/Healing -> Life (Deathly Hallows)

Loyalty/Bravery -> Mind (???)

Magic/Sorcery -> Love (Friendship is Magic!)

The Element of Mind and Time will have brief cameos in the upcoming chapter.
