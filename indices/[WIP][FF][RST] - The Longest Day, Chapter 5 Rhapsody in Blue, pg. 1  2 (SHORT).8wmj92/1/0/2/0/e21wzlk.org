Thanks for the formatting tip!

My understanding (not being a Latin major either) is that the "generosa" meant more like "nobility" rather than explicit power. But they do go hand in hand; that interpretation had crossed my mind. But my hands were kinda tied since MLP canon pretty much specifically defined Honesty as mapping to Strength.
