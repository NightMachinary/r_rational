Ubua is kind of right, Catherine is not so different, especially when you take into account her allies.

Ubua has her own justification, her own belief in her culture and people her own wish for survival of the way of life of her nation.

The difference is in two things.

One is that Catherine is not willing to go to the same lengths to achieve victory, and the other is that Cat's people have a saner culture that is objectively less evil.
