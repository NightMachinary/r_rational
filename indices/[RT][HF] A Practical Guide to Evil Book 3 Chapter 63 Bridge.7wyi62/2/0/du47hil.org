Yeah, I find myself actually waiting for the Crusade, since the Good guys' reactions to the events in Callow were far more interesting than Akua's changing her opinion mid-sentence and pretending that everything ever goes according to her plan. "Ahead of predictions" my ass.

Good guys that aren't William are the viewpoint that this story sorely needs. I get that setting up the positions in the debate so they have a chance of winning is Cat's and Black's (and in longer term, Bard's) thing, but the warped narrative that ensues sometimes gets as uncomfortable to read as the sequence that leads to Captain's offscreen death (if not as explicitly deliberate).
