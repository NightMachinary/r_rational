Fall is also her only "anti-army" aspect. She can use it to clear a path through the horde and she can't use it on Akua anyway. Akua is Diabolist, a mage who's messing with other dimension as a hobby, not some Summer noble with an allergy to Winter magic. Also, she can't use Break or Take anyway. Akua is right, there's no way for the Squire to win that fight.

That's the thing though. Cat is getting pushed toward taking a stance on her past action and redefining her path, her objectives and the method to support both. Her story, in a way. Cat isn't going to stay the Squire for much longer.
