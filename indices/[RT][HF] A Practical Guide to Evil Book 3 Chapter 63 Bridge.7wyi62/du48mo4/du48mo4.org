Fall is a rather strange choice for an opening move. Certainly, there's nothing she could Take yet, Break should be held back to match Bind, and she moved close to Diabolist's forces before waiting for them to move in for a fight, so she'll be able to freeze everything on sight, but the downsides are nothing short of disastrous.

Akua has just implied that she's seen the defeat of Princess of High Noon in detail, which means that her dimension-scrying artifact isn't affected by Fae-induced lens flare, and so she's likely seen what Fall can do and prepared for it. If entering her domain is as brief and tiring for Cat as it was last time, she'll have reinforcements moving in as soon as it goes away, when Squire is at her weakest.

The only way this will be of any longer tactical significance is if Cat will blackout the whole Liesse like she did with Sulia's crippled domain, but given that Liesse is Diabolist's home turf, I wouldn't bet on it. I honestly expected Cat to get into a fight or bait Akua before using an Aspect first.
