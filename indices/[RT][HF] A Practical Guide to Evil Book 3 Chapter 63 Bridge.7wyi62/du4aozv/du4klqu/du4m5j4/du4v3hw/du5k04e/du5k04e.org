Agreed. Cat has a purpose, not a justification. She /has/ killed people for little reason (remember the smuggler with "choke on your tongue"?). There's a goal for it, but unlike with a justification she's turned herself into a horrible, murder-y person to reach that goal. There's no excuse, she /is/ a bad person, but the difference is she's doing what she has to, rather than what she wants to.
