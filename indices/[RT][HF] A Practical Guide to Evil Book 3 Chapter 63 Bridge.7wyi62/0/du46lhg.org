Hey, looks like you've taken over my chapter posting duties :P

Decent chapter, though I do feel like the impact of Akua breaking the news to Cat is muted, as we saw exactly what happened with the battle. There's probably a better structure that could've been implemented there.

Poor Thief. Her entire appearance in the story so far is getting blown up/burnt/maimed/beat.

I didn't realize that Cat and Black had split up. Was that mentioned at all?

Also, thoughts on whose silhouette that was?
