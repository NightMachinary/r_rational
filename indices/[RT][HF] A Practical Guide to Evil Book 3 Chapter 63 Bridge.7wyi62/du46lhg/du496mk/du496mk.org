You know, it's strange that Akua would notice the hero who has Hide for an Aspect, but somehow miss entire cohort of goblins that entered city the same way. My money is on her laying a trap for someone specifically capable of bypassing wards (like a ward containing combustible gas or something), and Thief having collapsed it prematurely to make a distraction or opening.
