I'd say that, given that we weren't actually told what the silhouette said, it's something related to the plan or changes therein. It also is a last-minute message that risks attracting the attention of Diabolist, so it's someone's personal message, not a note prepared in advance.

We don't know yet whether this is actually happening during the beginning of the third Interlude or Akua's being selective in her assessment of the situation as usual, but the both actual mage-Names are probably out of the picture. Thief probably survived but none of her powers lend themselves to remote controlling magical constructs: she's more about bypassing magic entirely. Given that it's called a silhouette in the text, I'd expect Black to sneak a message in, but discreetly taking her enemy's magical construct sounds more like Malicia's doing. Perhaps she left long-term commands in the minds of Akua's henchmen, and they gave her the controls?
