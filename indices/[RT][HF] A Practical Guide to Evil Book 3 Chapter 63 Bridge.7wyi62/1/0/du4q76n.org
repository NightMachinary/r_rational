  Cat is now very firmly in the role of a hero
#+end_quote

Historically, acting as a hero ends with her powers weakened. Narrative power notwithstanding, it's a square peg/round hole situation. She's not a heroine, and even if the story wants her to be, the mantle of her power gets shaken loose if she tries to do it. It worked with the fae because they're not really part of Creation/Names, and because they were bound to the narrative and thus able to be manipulated. Ubua is not, and they're in Creation again where Names reign over narrative.

Cat could theoretically inherit a new Name, even a heroic one; but doing so would still leave her weak. Names very rarely inherit more than a single Aspect from the start; it takes weeks or months to learn them all. If the Gods Below decide to grant her a new Name, I can only see it working if Ubua's already on the ropes (eg, has already used all three Aspects). But even that's... boring. Too much of a trope. I feel like if Cat's going to get a new Name, it's going to be in an unexpected way, like Ubua controlling her soul, forcing her to kill Black, and her inheriting his title. It would turn the trope on its head, power up Cat, and be horrific.
