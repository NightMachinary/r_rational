Well, Akua is boned. Cat is now very firmly in the role of a hero: her mentor is captured, her army will be defeated without her intervention and her friend is possibly dead. She even gets a "we're not so different" speech from the main villain!

Time for some divine intervention from Gods Below? It would be interesting if, like in Book 2, Cat was offered a new name but this time from an agent of the Gods Below. The conflict is even taking place in a demonic version of Liesse.
