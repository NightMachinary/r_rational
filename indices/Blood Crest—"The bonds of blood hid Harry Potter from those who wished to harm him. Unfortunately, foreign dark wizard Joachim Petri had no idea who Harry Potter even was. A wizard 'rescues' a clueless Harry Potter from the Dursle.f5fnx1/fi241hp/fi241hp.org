Wow, this is really fucking good. Refreshing is a good way to put it. I really like the in-depth approaches to explaining the magic we see in the original series.

I do feel like Harry lacks a lot of agency especially at the point I'm at right now (chapter 32) but I can wholeheartedly recommend the story even with its flaws.
