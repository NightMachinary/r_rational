If your intent behind this is to prevent people from spending time on frustratingly bad reads, I understand where you're coming from. The same happened numerous times to me, and my response was to try some more and (if nothing changes) drop the series. No harm, no foul. Everyone has their own pet peeves.

In this, I do not trust your judgment. This is fiction, and such a low resolution judgment as the one you espouse needs to align extremely well with viewers' criteria (and the weights thereof) to be valuable and not harmful.

How highly selective the "review" process is, combined with the inherent persistence of the bot effectively results in dubiously sourced low resolution judgment seem like gospel whenever a fiction is submitted. The fact that (at my time off writing) the removal option is winning in your optional poll to address your non-optional (as it operates) bot seems to show that this is not a minority opinion.

Finally, and I didn't even know about you doing this, you tag stories based on how you feel about the author as a person based on ideology? In addition to the above problems applying to this, there is at least the obvious problem:

If I could not separate the author and the art, I would not have read OSC or any of HP Lovecraft. People are certainly free to do otherwise, but your low-resolution, highly selective, and in this case extremely subjective author-tagging is more harmful than it is helpful. (what do you think of as an appropriate bad ideology tag? Sure you may have some easy targets like Nazis whom we've societally agreed are bad, which makes this implementation easier to justify for you, but is that where the ideology tags stop, and are you sufficiently confident in your evaluation to tag all authors with something so widely considered to be abhorrent?)

Given the voting at my time of worrying, the majority seems to want this system gone. I too voted that way; though I cannot help but note that this is not the actual point.

Anyway, I hope you don't misunderstand me: I can actually see where you are coming from, so consider these two suggestions:

1) Make it a browser plugin instead of a reddit bot. You can solve many of the above problems, insofar as you believe they are problems. In addition, the private nature of the plugin would help ease the feeling that an extremely opinionated and equally persistent bot is holding this community's common hobby hostage.

2) Create a more nuanced review system and deploy it on an external site that your bot can then link to. Like topwebfiction, but in the form of more in depth reviews. A useful function to help authors grow could be to focus on recency (as well as review "upvotes" like many platforms do) to encourage development. That may have other drawbacks, but it's up to you.

In summary: I sympathize with what I think to be your initial motivation. However, your idea's current application seems at least to be polarizing and mostly disliked (according to current votes). I believe there are ways that you can achieve what I presume to be your core goals in better ways. Also, please don't make a reddit bot where you tell everyone your judgment of an author's character in a fiction subreddit. I'm sure that egregious and easy examples can be given to justify that course, but 1) the execution is tyrannical 2) you do not have the right to deny redemption and trap people in categories you deem to be evil. I am unconvinced by your neutral stance in this.

In short, there are better ways to do what you say you want to do. As it stands, the bot is at best useless, and at worst harmful.
