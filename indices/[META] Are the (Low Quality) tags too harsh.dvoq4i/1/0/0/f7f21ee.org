I really mean it when I say I sympathize with where you are coming from on the story front. As I said, I had similar experiences of my own and most of those stories were very well-liked by a large number of people.

Perhaps you could consider specifying the axes of ratings/tags that people can use. I'm sure this has occurred to you. However, (beyond the obvious like "Grammar", which is mentioned often) a way to ease the burden on you in this regard could be to make a poll like this on the bases of judgment here, the community (that I think) you have built a service for. The low bandwidth nature of both the bot and communication here seems to be hobbling that. I would love to see your work blossom; and I mean it. Solving the core problem behind the idea (which is non-trivial) would be of great value.

On the topic of tagging author politics, I believe this is not the right place for the discussion to go where it currently is. The medium itself is difficult. We are speaking past one another, on different levels of generality, and that is not an accusation on you. With that in mind, I won't.
