  it will surely apply to subreddits that get taken over, too; as soon as violence gets "glorified or encouraged" the community gets banned. Right?
#+end_quote

Yes. Some Nazis are smart enough not to openly encourage violence, but when enough gather and everyone else is driven out, that's generally what happens. However, I don't /want/ this sub to be banned.

  And any means by which this can be disguised in a taken-over community is also a means by which it can be disguised in a new subreddit.
#+end_quote

A /fully/ taken-over community will eventually have the Nazis surface. Unless there are still a large enough amount of people, especially mods, from the original community that don't like Nazis.

  We don't need to permanently be on alert (and permanently being on alert will effectively change the subreddit in unwelcome ways).
#+end_quote

I believe this is true---/if/ Nazi ideology and bigotry is just flat-out banned whenever it's spotted. However, I've seen a grand total of zero of the first banned, probably because the mods /would/ ban open Nazis here, and I have seen /many/ instances of bigotry which the mods have taken no action against, presumably because they don't want to ban someone on the off chance that there's a good faith reason for expressing a bigoted opinion.

#+begin_quote
  Yet you appear to be including in said group people who merely "imply homophobia is okay".
#+end_quote

Nah. I'm saying that the Nazis were homophobic as well as advocates for mass murder, and nothing is lost by banning homophobia, which is not a good opinion on its own.
