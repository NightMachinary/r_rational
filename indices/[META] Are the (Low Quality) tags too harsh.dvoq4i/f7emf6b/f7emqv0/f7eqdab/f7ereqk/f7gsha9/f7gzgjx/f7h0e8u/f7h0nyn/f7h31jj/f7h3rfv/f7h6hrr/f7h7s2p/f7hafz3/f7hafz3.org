  I don't think so. First off, I don't believe this is well known---I instead think the exact opposite is known. However, while I agree that simply shoving evidence at someone will not change their mind in most cases, what would you say if I claimed that if someone were able to experience my life exactly as I have, moment by moment, many of my conclusions on bigotry and related topics be shared? I confess that saying that makes me look arrogant, but the thing is, bigotry generally stems from a place of experience, emotion, and most of all, flawed nurturing.

I agree that someone else who has experienced your entire life and nothing else will agree with you on /many/ things (I hesitate to say "all" because people are complicated). However, that is not quite where I was intending to go with that point.

So let's consider a more concrete example.

I state, without (yet) providing any evidence one way or the other, that person X has 'objectionable politics'. What are the odds that you would, if you did the research on Person X, agree with that assessment?

What are the odds that you would agree with /all/ such assessments that I make?

  I don't believe so. However, I submit that the harm caused by doing so is less than /not/ dividing people into Them and Us---when those labeled Them are actual Nazis.
#+end_quote

There are two flaws that I believe I can see in this statement.

The first flaw is the idea that it does little harm to /incorrectly/ label someone as a Nazi. (This ties in to the above)

The second flaw is that it does little harm to divide off the Nazis so that their only company is each other, such that they can reinforce and strengthen each other's views. (This ties in to the below)

(There are a number of further practical problems with any Them/Us division as well, quite apart from the above).

  Here are some of my beliefs. People cannot be evil because I believe that is a nonsensical claim. Actions can be evil, ideas can be evil, but no matter how much evil a person does, they are not themselves evil. Even a psycho/sociopath is not inherently evil; it's just much easier for them to do evil things. It's probably not a big distinction for most, but it is for me. And while redemption can be very rare in some cases, I believe that if there were enough scientists with enough resources studying a person for a long enough period of time, then no matter who they are or what they've done, redemption is always possible. Though I'm not sure our definitions of redemption coincide, so maybe not. Definition swap?
#+end_quote

Redemption: Realising that a course of action, undertaken in the past, was incorrect. Taking effort to eliminate, as far as humanly possible, the negative consequences of said action. Taking effort to ensure that said action is not undertaken again in the future, particularly by oneself. Having the above recognised by the victims of the original course of action.

I do not merely believe that redemption is possible; I would go further and say that it is /likely/ in many cases. Especially when the offense is minor.

    It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.
  #+end_quote

  As above, I say here that I don't believe the former statement is true, but I do believe the latter is in many cases.
#+end_quote

I believe that the latter is false, in many cases. The reasoning is thus: most people want to be good. Most people therefore do not /intentionally/ try to corrupt people. (This includes people with objectionable politics of almost every stripe).

What people do do, is they intentionally try to /redeem/ other people. (Sometimes two people can work at cross-purposes, because they have different ideas of what the 'good' course of action is.) If members of Them are permitted to interact with Us, then I put it to you that the result is /more likely/ to be the redemption of Them than the corruption of Us.
