[[/starlightconcern][]]I'm starting to think the same. You know, I've always tried to hold on to my principles no matter what. It's ... exhausting, to have many dozens of arguments thrown at you, each with just enough of a point that it feels like /not/ responding simply isn't an option. I'm not sure how I feel. I thought a good sleep would clarify things, help me come to a resolution. The truth, however is that I'm still tired. I was never the most optimistic person, despite my efforts, and all it takes is enough little nudges in the right places to send me to a place I'd really rather not be. If If I hadn't made a habit of not lying to myself I might consider my final decision a compromise, or even a victory. The reality is that I felt an immense weight from several directions, and caved to the first suggestion from someone I perceive as having enough authority that acceding to his suggestions felt like putting everything in his hands. I'm going to rebuild the bot, and then I'm taking some time off for my sanity.
