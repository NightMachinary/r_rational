  Nay, that's not what I'm implying. I say if they go through the process of experiencing my life, and then after they do so all other memories return, I believe they will likely be at least less of a bigot.
#+end_quote

I believe that, after all their other memories return, that they will then agree with you about /less/ than before that happens.

How much less, and why, I cannot say. There are too many variables.

#+begin_quote
  I can't say. I made a point of it to only append the tag if said evidence is provided. I'm not really sure what your point is here, since without evidence I can make no conclusions one way or another, and there are no examples mentioned. I suppose if you really want me to provide odds, I could find the percentage of the population of the Earth that are Nazis or bigots as defined by some source, probably a collection of polls, and then find the percentage of people who are writers, and then use those numbers to find the odds.

Mmm-hmm. Let me make it explicit, then.

The first time that I see a story labelled 'objectionable author politics', I have to ask myself, what does that /mean/? Does the author disagree with some reviewer on the subject of (say) gun control? Or (to take an example from Gulliver's Travels) which end of the egg to open at breakfast?

Has the author been slandered by an enemy? Has the author said something in innocence that has been badly misinterpreted? Has the author been attacked by political mudslingers, or expressed support for a single good policy of an otherwise reprehensible person?

Has the reviewer actually done /thorough/ research, or merely skimmed the surface?

There are so /many/ ways in which even a committed and thorough researcher can get someone else's politics /wrong/ that it's a near-certainty that it will happen sooner or later. And that's /before/ I consider the possibility that the reviewer's politics might not align with my own.

#+begin_quote
  Doing that does do harm. However, would you not say that someone who spouts actual Nazi propaganda on their Twitter feed is a Nazi?
#+end_quote

Define 'Nazi propaganda'. Extreme counterexample: Hitler was a vegetarian. People supporting vegetarianism should not be considered to be 'spouting Nazi propaganda'.

Personally, given how much of a bad name the Nazis have had ever since WWII, I'd find it hard to imagine them being taken seriously as a political concern.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps if they have multiple places to gather, but deplatforming works.
#+end_quote

Deplatforming takes people out of the public eye and removes their audience. This is, in my view, an /extreme/ step which should not be taken lightly (albeit sometimes a necessary step).

#+begin_quote
  Indeed. A world where this is not the case would be bleak indeed. Fortunately, Reddit provides an easy way for someone who has committed such offense to correct it and come back with no one finding a connection between the two accounts if they so choose, completely eliminating any social stigma their former positions may have incurred.
#+end_quote

I put it to you that merely putting on a new mask is /not/ redemption. Redemption requires acknowledgement of wrong and an attempt to make it right; not merely a dodging of consequences.

#+begin_quote
  I have to disagree there. There are a few harmful ideas which cause the people holding them to promote said ideas. Most religions do this, as they say that converting people is one of the best things one can do. Nazism is another one of these beliefs, because anyone who is not a Nazi is seen as an enemy.
#+end_quote

...okay, I acknowledge the main substance of your point, though I believe it's rooted in a misunderstanding.

Most people believe that they are good, and that their attempts to spread their own ideology are attempts to redeem, not to corrupt. These people operate under the /belief/ that they are redeeming.

#+begin_quote
  This holds true in many cases, but not for Nazis. When a Nazi sees that a place will tolerate them, it becomes a signal for more to come join, and push the politics of that place further right with their presence and arguments. It is a very rare Nazi that wishes to change their mind---when you join a community pre-committing to refuse all persuasive arguments, it takes a boxed AI to get through that and peel back those kinds of beliefs.
#+end_quote

...this suggests that you may have fallen into one of the major traps of the Them vs. Us mindset; to be precise, a belief that there is a sharp gulf between the two groups. That 'Them' are actively malicious, and not merely mistaken; that 'They' are the enemy and are diametrically opposed to Us. Moreover, that 'They' are a cohesive and well-organised group.
