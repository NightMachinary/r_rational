  The moment that they start to push a vote for an actually objectionable cause - like allowing anti-Semitic rhetoric while simultaneously banning all other politics - they will lose that vote.

Ah, but by that point in time there are enough Nazis that the vote becomes controversial instead of obviously fated to lose. And if they're not yet at that point, well, you only need half a dozen dedicated people to fake a consensus, especially in smaller communities. And if everyone who posts things that are even mildly anti-Nazi sees constant disapproval---well, some people might see that their community seems to be constantly downvoting posts by Jewish people. And so the more sensitive members leave, and now there are only moderates and Nazis. And so now Nazis continue shaping community consensus in an effort to drive off the most sensitive of the moderates. And when they're gone...

  Is it still a good thing if it drives away non-Nazis?

I'll be honest here, if it drives away someone who supports a Nazi, in my mind they're not that different from said Nazi.
