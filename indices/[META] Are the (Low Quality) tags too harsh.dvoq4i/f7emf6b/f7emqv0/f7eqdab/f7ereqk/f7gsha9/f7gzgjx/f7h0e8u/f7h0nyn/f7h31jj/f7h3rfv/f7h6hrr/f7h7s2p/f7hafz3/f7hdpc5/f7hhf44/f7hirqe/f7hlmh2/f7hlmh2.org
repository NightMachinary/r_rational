  What if this only includes bigotry (homophobia, transphobia, etc), Nazis/Nazi propaganda, and communists/communist propaganda?
#+end_quote

Those are /largely/ policies I agree are bad. (I say 'largely' only because of the inclusion of the communists on the end; while historical implementations of communism have pretty much all gone wrong for various reasons, I do believe that there is an argument to be made in favour of community ownership of infrastructure in some cases. I'd put forward the Free Software community as an example of this sort of thing done right.)

However, as I had noted above, this does nothing to reassure me that the reviewer is /right/ about the author's politics. I don't know how strong the reviewer's standards of proof are. I don't know how much evidence he has considered, and whether that evidence is actually a true reflection of the author's politics.

  Nazi talking points. The fourteen words, 'we should create a nation for white people,' that sort of thing.
#+end_quote

I don't know what 'fourteen words' you're even talking about. And the last time I heard a serious suggestion of 'a nation for white people' was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeremag][the boeremag]] who, while hugely racist, were not Nazis and (so far as I can tell) had nothing against Jews. (They were also convicted of treason).

  They seem to be gaining momentum, especially online. Places like 4Chan with low moderation don't kick out the actual Nazis, so what starts out as people ironically trying to be shocking turns into an actual Nazi hangout.
#+end_quote

Oddly enough, I haven't seen any particular sign of them. Presumably I don't hang out in the wrong places.

#+begin_quote
  So what about said Nazis?
#+end_quote

I'd say that deplatforming is a valid tactic to use against anyone seriously advocating mass murder who refuses to stop doing so.

#+begin_quote
  It is extraordinarily easy to dodge consequences on Reddit. But if someone is, say, deplatformed, and no one wants to hear them out because they were an actual Nazi for a long time, and then they have a change of heart and make a new account, they can do that.
#+end_quote

Noted. But I think we're getting away from the point here.

The point of this discussion isn't 'how to deal with actual Nazis'. The point is to consider the possibility of flaws in a certain chain of reasoning.

--------------

I will agree with you that anyone actually willing to kill people based on nothing more than their ethnicity or culture deserves far more than merely being banned from online discussions. I will further agree that anyone trying to persuade other people to kill people based on nothing more than ethnicity or culture should be prevented from reaching a wide audience.

However, nothing in my previous paragraph has to do with the flaws in said chain of reasoning.
