  so I don't think there's any danger of this in the near term.

Indeed. All we have is a few bigots, so far.

#+begin_quote
  Bigots, on the other hand, are far more common; and far less likely to advocate for violence.

This is true, but the latter is a subset of the former, and neither of them are good for a community.

#+begin_quote
  Point the first: were the mods aware?
#+end_quote

It is extremely likely, since in the most recent instance one mod went down the thread, went by it, found one of my comments, and locked it. However, I cannot be /certain/ because I didn't report it, so I'll give you that.

I will admit that I have seen no evidence that this /doesn't/ happen---however, that sort of thing shows. I have an extension that allows me to [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/removeddit/epigemnhfmbapjjpkdaaholmachfnfem?hl=en][see removed comments]], so not seeing any evidence that something has been removed is perhaps a piece of evidence in and of itself.

I believe that this is happening in every situation where the bigotry is expressed in polite language.

#+begin_quote
  Is anything lost by banning people who say something that appears homophobic?

Mod discretion is advised. In that case, the mods would ideally give the user a warning, and keep an eye on them to see if it's a frequent occurrence.
