  that they will then agree with you about less than before that happens.

Well, alright. I can't prove it, so I'll let it go.

#+begin_quote
  There are so many ways in which even a committed and thorough researcher can get someone else's politics wrong that it's a near-certainty that it will happen sooner or later. And that's before I consider the possibility that the reviewer's politics might not align with my own.
#+end_quote

What if this only includes bigotry (homophobia, transphobia, etc), Nazis/Nazi propaganda, and communists/communist propaganda?

#+begin_quote
  Define 'Nazi propaganda'
#+end_quote

Nazi talking points. The fourteen words, 'we should create a nation for white people,' that sort of thing.

#+begin_quote
  I'd find it hard to imagine them being taken seriously as a political concern.
#+end_quote

They seem to be gaining momentum, especially online. Places like 4Chan with low moderation don't kick out the actual Nazis, so what starts out as people ironically trying to be shocking turns into an actual Nazi hangout.

#+begin_quote
  This is, in my view, an extreme step which should not be taken lightly
#+end_quote

So what about said Nazis?

  I put it to you that merely putting on a new mask is not redemption. Redemption requires acknowledgement of wrong and an attempt to make it right; not merely a dodging of consequences.
#+end_quote

It is extraordinarily easy to dodge consequences on Reddit. But if someone is, say, deplatformed, and no one wants to hear them out because they were an actual Nazi for a long time, and then they have a change of heart and make a new account, /they can do that./

#+begin_quote
  Most people believe that they are good, and that their attempts to spread their own ideology are attempts to redeem, not to corrupt. These people operate under the belief that they are redeeming.
#+end_quote

Indeed. Nazis believe that whiteness is good, and superior, and that anyone who does not fit their vision of a good person is /in/human. They have good intentions, yes, but they would not hesitate to push a button that killed all Jews.

#+begin_quote
  That 'Them' are actively malicious, and not merely mistaken; that 'They' are the enemy and are diametrically opposed to Us. Moreover, that 'They' are a cohesive and well-organised group.
#+end_quote

They are a minority, but being actively malicious in support of a cause is /still being mistaken/. From a Nazi's perspective, it is /just/ and /right/ and /good/ to kill Jews. It is just as right to infiltrate online spaces and promote their ideology whatever the cost. It is important to precommit to ignoring persuasive arguments, because /they are the enemy/. It's the paradox of tolerance, see? Tolerate anything except intolerance, because when intolerance becomes intertwined with an ideology people who believe in it become zealots. You don't calmly reason with a terrorist holding a bomb, for example---you /disarm the bomb/.
