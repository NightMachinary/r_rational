  Or people can just separate the artist from the art?

Not everyone wants to do this. If you're comfortable with doing so, then that's well and good. Ignore the tag. Other people may feel betrayed that no one mentioned the art they enjoyed was made by a Nazi.

The only political tags link to transphobia and Nazism. I don't think Orson Scott Card is a Nazi, and he hasn't let his homophobia seep into his work, but if someone asked me to add a politics tag to his titles I would do so.
