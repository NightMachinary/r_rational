/Everything/ is politics. Refusal to see this doesn't make it untrue. Now, refusal to listen to detractors does matter if they have valid points, which is why I've made a point of it to respond to every one of them that I've seen. However, I will not allow the minority of voices that shout the loudest to rule my actions. Which is why I've set up a poll. I did not have to do that---in fact the incentive for me to do so is /negative/ if you assume I'm acting in bad faith.

However, since you /do/ assume that, we cannot have a productive discussion.
