I'm not sure you can really make a fine dividing line between the wide scope of what you are talking about and a recommendation.

I mean try saying 'The writing, plotting and characters are all subpar - strongly recommended'. I think it sounds absurd. 'Low quality' as a tag with no qualifiers attached is functionally identical to saying 'not recommended'.

If you want to attach tags to links, I wouldn't mind something like (original) vs (fan-fiction) - I generally tend to prefer original stories, or if I am going to read fan-fiction it'll only be for specific settings I'm interested in other takes on (e.g I like Worm & Ward, but have little interest in other author's Worm spin-offs).

From the title of a story alone it is not always clear what category it falls into.
