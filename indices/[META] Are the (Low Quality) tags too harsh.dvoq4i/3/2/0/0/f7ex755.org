The aesthetic avenue is fair, and is why the poll above exists. However, my politics are essentially ‘don't be a bigot' and ‘no Nazis please.' I do think providing a tag which says only ‘Author Politics' and links to a discussion where proof is provided that someone is actually a Nazi is valuable to a certain subset of people. Namely, those who don't want to support a Nazi with ads or traffic.
