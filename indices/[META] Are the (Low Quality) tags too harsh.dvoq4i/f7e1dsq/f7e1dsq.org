I personally think that they should be removed. I feel like they are detrimental to the community as a whole.

By immediately judging and labelling a story 'low quality' we are arbitrarily prejudging it for everyone who sees it.

I personally am writing a story that I want to consider rational, but I am an amateur and it is obviously the work of an amateur. Does that make it 'low quality'? Perhaps, does that mean it deserves to be labelled low quality? I don't think so.

I voted for remove, but if replace wins, then perhaps replacing the tag with 'amateur story' or 'constructive Critique only', something that will tell the reader not to expect a master work but not to judge the work like they would judge a story that has been edited and published by a professional Writer and a full team of editors and beta readers.
