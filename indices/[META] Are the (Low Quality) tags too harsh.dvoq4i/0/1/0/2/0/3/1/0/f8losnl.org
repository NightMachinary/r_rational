For what is worth at first I assumed he is in the wrong and was surprised when I didn't find anything showing it in the thread. Here's how I read the thread

You start off with strong accusations with him, but no evidence.

#+begin_quote
  I already had a problem with this [[/u/Lightwavers][u/Lightwavers]] person before any of this nonsense. It seems like a lot of other people did as well.
#+end_quote

Nobody else has chimed in, and the bot 'issue' is very separate (and he's clearly fixing it in this very thread) from the attack on his character, so *a lot of other people* already seems like a potential exaggeration.

Then you start making some even more serious statements, while mainly justifying them with your dislike

#+begin_quote
  ..I get a bad feeling from them. Saying whatever they have to say to make it look like they're the one who's right. Disingenuous. Somewhat manipulative. That sort of thing.
#+end_quote

This is also the first comment that actually lists something concrete

#+begin_quote
  of their commenting history indicates that they sincerely believe that "tulpas" are actually real, and that causes me to question their mental health.
#+end_quote

Now there's something to examine - which I did. After seeing his comments I quickly looked at his history (ctrl-f tulpa) and it seems he shares the common position here that Tulpas are something in the general direction of a directed hallucination, extension of someone's inner voice and/or modelling of others etc.

You continue over multiple comments to double down on this (while it still being your only real accusation).

#+begin_quote
  It feels like arguing with a creationist.
#+end_quote

Reading more, it sounds like you had a disagreement. I specifically looked through the thread for other links to something he has done/said that's obviously bad and didn't see them - the most I saw was citing someone from [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]] that didn't like him or disagreed with him. The thing is you can find a comment like that about anyone that's spent significant time on reddit, so citing it here makes it look like there's nothing better to find. The quote from [[/r/tulpa][r/tulpa]] you cite is

#+begin_quote
  You just want to establish your personal opinions and ideas as the 'right' ones, the only correct way to think.
#+end_quote

Again, I'm sure you can find a comment like that about many redditors that are active enough.

Having said all that, someone giving you bad vibes is totally valid internal evidence, that I wouldn't say should be discarded by you. However, accepting 'bad feelings' as the main/only argument against someone is not great for us. Anyone can say it about anyone and in a forum if someone is problematic it should be possible to find evidence of it and show that instead.
