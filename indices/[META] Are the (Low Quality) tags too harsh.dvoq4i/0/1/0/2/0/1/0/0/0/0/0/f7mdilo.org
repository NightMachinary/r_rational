  I don't necessarily have beef with you, but you give off bad vibes.

First, ideas and opinions can change. Though that isn't the case here. Do be aware that there is a difference between recognizing what a phenomenon /is/, and what you should treat it as. Tulpas, clinically speaking, are simply the manipulation of that inner voice most people have, and that I believe all neurotypical people can learn to build if they don't. However, if something acts human, my philosophy is that it's safer to treat it as human than not.
