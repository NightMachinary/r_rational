Elsewhere I suggested some kind of rating system instead of these tags, but I like this suggestion much better. Reviews work much better than ratings, while not carrying a (possibly undeserved) connotation of authority.

This should also be relatively easy to implement I think. You only need to update the links in the bot, the wiki itself can be community-maintained.
