Ironic given the meta discussion, but I see a lot of negativity directed toward you. Disappointing given your good intentions.

Anyways, thanks for creating and sharing your super convenient tool! Really appreciate not having to search up the titles.

Re: controversy, people apparently find your objectionable tags objectionable (to the point where they irrationally hate the bot itself rather than its current iteration) , so the neutral solution is posting the links only.

On a side note, having to police beneficial technology because of human foibles and quibbles is always depressing...
