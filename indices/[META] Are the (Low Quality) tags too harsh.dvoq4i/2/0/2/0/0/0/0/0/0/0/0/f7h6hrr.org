  First though, if you do detail them, do you want me to respond if I think they're not necessarily valid, or no?

[[/twibeam][]] Oh, please do! We can both benefit from a thorough discussion of flaws in a presented chain of reasoning.

[[/sp][]]

[[/psychiatwi][]] Okay! Let's start off with a few simple, straightforward points. I put it to you that the following statements are all false:

- Everyone, when presented with the same evidence as I have seen, will inevitably come to the same conclusion if they take the time to properly consider the evidence. This is well known.
- People will always understand precisely what I mean when I make any statement.
- It does no harm to divide people into Them and Us.
- There exist people in the world who are Evil. While redemption is possible, it is rare to the point of being vanishingly nonexistent.
- It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.

Any of the statements in the above list, taken as true, would represent a different potential flaw. Are there any of the above statements in which you /cannot/ see the flaw? (I ask this mainly so as to avoid spending a lot of words going over something that you are already aware of).

Alternatively, are there any of the above statements where you cannot see what the statement has to do with your bot's tagging?
