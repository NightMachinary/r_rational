Going to look at that subreddit, I see that it was banned for "the posting of content that glorifies or encourages violence." Given that that is the policy, it will surely apply to subreddits that get taken over, too; as soon as violence gets "glorified or encouraged" the community gets banned. Right?

And any means by which this can be disguised in a taken-over community is /also/ a means by which it can be disguised in a new subreddit.

  Well, that's unfortunate, but I think we're at the point where we have to either do that or accept Nazis into the community.

You know, you don't /need/ to suffuse a community with any particular sentiments to do that. Just report any Nazis that you spot to the moderators and/or site admins, and let them deal with the problem. We don't /need/ to permanently be on alert (and permanently being on alert will effectively change the subreddit in unwelcome ways).

That's the first point.

And as another point; I don't think that you and I are understanding the same thing by the word 'Nazi'. I am understanding it to mean a follower of the circa-WWII policies of Adolf Hitler, specifically with regard to Aryan supremacy and the policies that led to the Holocaust. (These are the people that I do not think are common).

Yet you appear to be including in said group people who merely "imply homophobia is okay". I think that you'll agree that that is a far lesser offense than mass murder.
