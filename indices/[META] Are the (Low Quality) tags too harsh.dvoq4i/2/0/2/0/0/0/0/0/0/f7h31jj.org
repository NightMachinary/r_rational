[[/twiponder][]] For what it's worth, I can see where you're coming from here. I can see a chain of reasoning that would lead to the action you took, to the arguments that you made, to the positions that you hold. And I can see how that chain holds /absolutely/ zero malice, zero desire to deceive anyone, and a genuine wish to be helpful.

I am assuming that the chain of reasoning that you followed is (at least broadly) similar to the chain of reasoning that I am considering. And, while there are flaws in this chain of reasoning, those flaws are subtle. They are sneaky. They are /incredibly common/ flaws in human thinking; the sort of flaws that will likely trip up most people who are not being /extremely/ vigilant about their thinking.

[[/ktwieager][]] If you'd like me to, purely in the interests of better being able to identify the same flaws in the future, I can go into thorough detail!
