  Which is only useful in situations where there is a vote.

Precisely. A given situation might be, say, one where some Nazis have invaded a subreddit and are attempting to push a particular set of ideas to make it more accommodating to them. Perhaps pointing out that some users are Nazis actually starts driving away the Nazis---that's undesireable, so they might push forward the idea that politics shouldn't be allowed.

I think that /is/ the core. Because if a link bot refers to the politics of the author, and that manages to drive away Nazis, then that is a good thing.
