For what it's worth, I applaud your effort and intention. I just think you've gotten a lot of feedback that should be used to recalibrate how thorough your initial intuitions and reasoning were in deciding the value/dangers of your idea.

Take care of your sanity first and foremost. Without that you're not going to be able to do much else, principles or not.
