  This is true, but the latter is a subset of the former, and neither of them are good for a community.
#+end_quote

...either I've got the two mixed around or this just said that bigots are a subset of Nazis, which I'm pretty sure is not the way round that you intended.

#+begin_quote
  It is extremely likely, since in the most recent instance one mod went down the thread, went by it, found one of my comments, and locked it. However, I cannot be certain because I didn't report it, so I'll give you that.
#+end_quote

It is possible that your post was reported, for... whatever reason, and so the mod read your post without reading all the parent posts.

But yeah. If you find posts you object to, then report them.

#+begin_quote
  I will admit that I have seen no evidence that this doesn't happen---however, that sort of thing shows. I have an extension that allows me to see removed comments, so not seeing any evidence that something has been removed is perhaps a piece of evidence in and of itself.
#+end_quote

I have no idea how that particular extension works. Does it still allow you to see that a comment /has been/ deleted, or do they simply appear as if they were never deleted?

#+begin_quote
  Mod discretion is advised. In that case, the mods would ideally give the user a warning, and keep an eye on them to see if it's a frequent occurrence.
#+end_quote

Seems sensible. And mod discretion would also be the answer to the question of how to tell the difference between actual homophobia and the mere appearance thereof.

Again, though, it seems to me that the correct and proportional action to take in response to such a post it to report the post to the mods, and allow them to use that discretion.
