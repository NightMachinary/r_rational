I think I've misunderstood what the issue here is because in the past month or two I've been using reddit much less frequently. I notice often on the front page that there'll be a story or three (usually pony related) that you're posting as a recommendation. I thought that was the issue. If the actual issue is that you've got a bot that's going around and commenting something like "this fic is low quality" on /other peoples' recommendations/ then you should probably be banned from this subreddit.
