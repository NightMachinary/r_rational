Yeah that analogy works too. I feel empathy for that person.

Ask forgiveness not permission, that'd never have been approved if they asked but no one might raise enough of a fuss if they present it fait accompli. Cost comes out of social capital I suppose

I don't see the it's not your responsibility as a good argument for anything. People stepping up to tasks abandoned (in this case everyone going to hell or whatever) should be praised. The issue with this scenario is that we don't believe in the end goal. No one complained about him providing links prior to the addition of comments yet if he had asked someone might have said we don't need it. People will just comment if they want the link. People can Google.

But if no one had bothered buying a calender for any cubicle and they'd went around realising how inefficient that was and improving it. Well not their responsibility still? And you bet people would find some reason to be annoyed in an office.
