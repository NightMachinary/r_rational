  I don't see the it's not your responsibility as a good argument for anything. People stepping up to tasks abandoned should be praised.

You're conflating two different things.

Planting a tree isn't your responsibility, but if you do it then you've stepped up to an abandoned task.

Planting a tree /on your neighbor's side of the property line/ isn't your place, and if you do it then you've acted out of line.
