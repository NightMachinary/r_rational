  'Low quality' as a tag with no qualifiers attached is functionally identical to saying 'not recommended'.

Indeed. Links are attached that point to reviews/comments that display specific critiques.

  links, I wouldn't mind something like (original) vs (fan-fiction) - I generally tend to prefer original stories, or if I am going to read fan-fiction it'll only be for specific settings

An interesting idea. The system right now doesn't support more than one tag, but I might redesign it to point to fandoms if I have the time.
