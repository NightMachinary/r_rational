You're correct that putting in work to come to that particular solution would be something I'm not particularly keen on doing, since I've spent the time on a system right now. The poll seems to be heading in the direction of removing the (Low Quality) tags entirely, so how about I do that and then replace the tags with links to the story's wiki, if applicable?

Also, what's your opinion on the (Author Politics) tags, which link to a specific Reddit discussion, including links/evidence to support that the author or work portrays certain political ideas in a certain way? So far that's just been to stories written by Neo-Nazis and ones which display bigotry toward trans people.
