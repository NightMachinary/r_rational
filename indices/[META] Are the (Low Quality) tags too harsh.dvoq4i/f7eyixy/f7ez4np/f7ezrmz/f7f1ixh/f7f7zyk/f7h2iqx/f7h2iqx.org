I believe [[/u/lightwavers]] took your earlier responses not as hypothetical "I get that this might not be something you would do for free" but actual offers of payment to do the proposed things. If that was your intention, that's the "what" he is suggesting; that he completes it first, you judge the quality, then decide to pay him after.

If you brought up payment as a rhetorical point, that should probably be clarified.
