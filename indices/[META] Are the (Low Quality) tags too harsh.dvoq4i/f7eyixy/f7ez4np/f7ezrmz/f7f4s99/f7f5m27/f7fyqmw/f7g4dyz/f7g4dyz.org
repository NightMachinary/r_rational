Y'know how Seraph in the Matrix Reloaded says "you do not truly know someone until you fight them"? I've been in at least one argument with Lightwavers before this, and I can see the arguments they've been having with other people. I don't like the way they argue. I get a bad feeling from them. Saying whatever they have to say to make it look like they're the one who's right. Disingenuous. Somewhat manipulative. That sort of thing.

And of course, there's also the fact that a quick perusal of their commenting history indicates that they sincerely believe that "tulpas" are actually real, and that causes me to question their mental health. Is it fair to allow that to color my judgement of their behavior? Because it does.
