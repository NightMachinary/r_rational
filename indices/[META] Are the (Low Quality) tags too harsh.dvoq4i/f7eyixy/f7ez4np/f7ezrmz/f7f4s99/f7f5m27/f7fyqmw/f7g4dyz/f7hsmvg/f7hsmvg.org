Fair enough. Though regarding the tulpa stuff, I have no personal experience beyond having lurked on their subreddit once or twice, but I thought it seemed like a plausible way to train drugless hallucination and extreme compartmentalization. Or is Lightwavers one of those who think tulpas deserve actual rights as sentient beings?
