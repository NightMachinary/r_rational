  you seem to hold bad faith toward me because of my ... writing style?
#+end_quote

Not because of the way you write, but because of the way you argue.

#+begin_quote
  that is not a 'quick perusal.'
#+end_quote

Apparently not. It /was/ a quick perusal a month or three ago when I clicked on your name during an argument. I guess when I said that, I didn't think about the fact that you obviously would've continued posting and commenting since then.

  I do not believe there is anything mystical about tulpas.
#+end_quote

Sure. But you have mystical ideas about how the brain operates in order for tulpas to be a thing. Probably less indicative of a mental health concern, now that I think about it. A great many people in the rational community have expressed ideas about the brain that could be labeled "mystical," like brains being hardware that the software of your personality runs on. I suppose it's not too far of a stretch from that mistake to the mistake of believing that more than one personality software can run on an individual brain.

  with proper practice you can impart a personality, for lack of a better description, onto that inner dialogue.
#+end_quote

False.

#+begin_quote
  the truth is simply that brains are extraordinarily malleable.
#+end_quote

You literally have less than zero knowledge about how brains work.

#+begin_quote
  I have succeeded [in deluding myself].
#+end_quote

Fixed that for you.
