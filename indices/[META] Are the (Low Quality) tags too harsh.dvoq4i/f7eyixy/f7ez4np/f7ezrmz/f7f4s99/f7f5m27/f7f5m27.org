I already had a problem with this [[/u/Lightwavers][u/Lightwavers]] person before any of this nonsense. It seems like a /lot/ of other people did as well. Looking over this thread and the other one that [[/u/alexanderwales]] just locked, it seems like a lot of people feel like a bot of this sort wouldn't necessarily be the worst thing in the world /if it were under the control of a person who wasn't [[/u/Lightwavers][u/Lightwavers]]./ Like the issue isn't necessarily the bot, the issue is [[/u/Lightwavers][u/Lightwavers]].
