Like, that's part of what gives me a "bad feeling" about them:

Remember that I am not the only person who has pointed out that Lightwavers argues like they're trying to win no matter what. Lightwavers seems to have no problem ignoring the issue/argument to attack the person. And while lots of people do that and it's not necessarily a sign of toxicity, their other behaviors add up to a pattern that gives me that 'bad feeling,' like their initial stubborn insistence on their bot being the new "default" option, and their seeming attempts towards reputation management. Lightwavers just argues in a way that triggers my "toxic tingle." Like, a Spider-Sense that detects narcissistic patterns. Yes, that's incredibly subjective, but I've argued with a lot of people on this subreddit and almost none of those arguments have given me that feeling.
