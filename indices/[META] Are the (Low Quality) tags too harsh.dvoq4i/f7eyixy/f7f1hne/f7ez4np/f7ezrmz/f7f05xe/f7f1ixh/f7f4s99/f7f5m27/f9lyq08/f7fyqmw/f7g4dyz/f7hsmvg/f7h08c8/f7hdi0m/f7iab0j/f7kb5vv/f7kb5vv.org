  I didn't think about the fact that you obviously would've continued posting and commenting since then.

I see. I'll retract that accusation, then.

  But you have mystical ideas about how the brain operates in order for tulpas to be a thing.

No. I do not. Many, /many/ people have an inner voice that does not just disagree with them, but /violently/ does so. It's more common in depressed people, and /multiple/ voices are /much more/ common in people who are schizophrenic, or might become schizophrenic given the wrong triggers. Manipulating your inner voice to give it a different personality than "you, but nasty," is an extremely valuable technique. Once done, it's common to call that altered inner voice a tulpa.
