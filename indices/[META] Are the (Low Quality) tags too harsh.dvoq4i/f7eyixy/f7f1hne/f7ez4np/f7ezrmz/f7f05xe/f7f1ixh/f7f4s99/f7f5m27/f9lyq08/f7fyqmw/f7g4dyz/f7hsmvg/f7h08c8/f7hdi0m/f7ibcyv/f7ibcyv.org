It feels like arguing with a creationist. That's the feeling I get from arguing with Lightwavers, the same feeling I used to get half a decade ago when I was wasting entirely too much time arguing with creationists in the comments sections of youtube videos and facebook posts.

I've been in plenty of arguments with plenty of people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] over the past three years. The vast majority of those arguments haven't triggered that feeling.
