  I get a bad feeling from them.

This is what your argument seems to amount to. If that is all, then that is fair. Arguing the point will not get either of us anywhere, as you seem to hold bad faith toward me because of my ... writing style?

  a quick perusal of their commenting history indicates that they sincerely believe that "tulpas" are actually real,

Point of order: that is not a 'quick perusal.' You have just lied. My last post in the community that shows support for the phenomena is several pages down. Next, I do not believe there is anything mystal about tulpas. They are simply a name for a mental process that you might call an imaginary friend. Many people have an inner dialogue, and with proper practice you can impart a personality, for lack of a better description, onto that inner dialogue. The community has been partially coopted by people who genuinely believe there is something mystical about all this, but the truth is simply that brains are extraordinarily malleable.

Being someone who tries to follow the evidence where is leads, despite my extreme skepticism in the phenomena, I found enough people who genuinely believed there is something to it to try it myself. I have succeeded.
