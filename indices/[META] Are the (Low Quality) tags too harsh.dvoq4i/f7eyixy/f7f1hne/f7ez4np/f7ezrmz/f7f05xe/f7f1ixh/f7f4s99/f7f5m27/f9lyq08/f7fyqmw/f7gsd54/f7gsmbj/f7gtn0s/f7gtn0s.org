Apparently a lot happened while I was asleep. And people are forming strong opinions and arguing them forcefully.

I think that a bot that only posts links is a good thing. And a bot that appends these links with author-politics-based tags is a bad thing. I /don't/ think it matters who runs the bot, as long as the bot is run in a sensible manner (one sensible way in which to run the bot is to have no tags; this is not the only sensible way in which to run the bot).

So, in the specific case of the tagless bot, I don't particularly mind who runs it; as long as it remains tagless.
