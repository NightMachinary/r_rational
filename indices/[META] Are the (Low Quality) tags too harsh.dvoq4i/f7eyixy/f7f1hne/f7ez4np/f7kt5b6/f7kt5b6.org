The bot now points toward the wiki for each title it links. Since anyone can modify the wiki, I've held off on working on an auto-populate function, as any user can simply click the creation link and add their content. That functionality can be added if requested.

As per the about page, found at [[https://redd.it/dw7lux]], I can give users administrator positions, which means they can use the !Add function if they notice a title going unlinked. The !Add function is fragile and must be used exactly as shown, so keep that in mind if you have any usernames that I should give administrator access.
