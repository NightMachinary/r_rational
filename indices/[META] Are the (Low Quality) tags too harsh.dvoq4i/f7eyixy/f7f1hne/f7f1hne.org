From a reader perspective, I see this as a reasonable compromise, especially regarding tags other than [Low Quality]. I highly value getting a rough overview of other readers' feelings regarding a work, as well as anything in the author's Weltanschauung that I might want to take into account either before deciding if their work is worth my time, or during my enjoyment of said work. I am most jealous with my free time, after all.

Though of course tastes vary drastically, it seems patently absurd to me that anyone in this particular community *wouldn't* want any meta-information with which to update their probabilities on something that they'd likely be spending many hours consuming, even filtered as they are through the poor metaphors for reality that we mere humans can contribute.
