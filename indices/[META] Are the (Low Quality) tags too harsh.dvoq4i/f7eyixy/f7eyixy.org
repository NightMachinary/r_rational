Hi, [[/u/Lightwavers]]! Thank you for having put in the work on that bot, by the way! I hadn't even been aware of your recent bot changes at the time I wrote my own recent post. That said, yeah, putting a [Low Quality] tag on Metaworld Chronicles does seem to me like pushing it from two directions - the first direction being that an automated bot posting things at high volume takes on aspects of requiring community approval and not just a personal opinion, and the other direction being that it does seem like a bit of a slap for somebody to see that autoreply after posting a glowing review of Metaworld Chronicles.

Like the trueborn nerd I am, I have a thought about a technical solution to this political problem. It would require added work on your part and you should feel free to say in reply something like "You'd have to pay me $500 to do that".

My thought is to allocate wiki pages, on the reddit wiki or on some other wiki, to each new story that comes up for recommendation. The top of the wiki page links directly to the story. The bot links to the wiki page, /without/ any annotations shown inside the Reddit comment itself. People are free to post their own negative or positive reviews on the wiki page, but without the connotation of any of them replying to each other, and with etiquette saying that you are forbidden to suggest that other people shouldn't or won't enjoy something aside from you talking about your own experiences. All reviews on a wiki page must be signed by a /u reddit username.

It would also be nice to have something that automatically aggregated and posted all the story reviews, by a particular poster, to their own wiki page, and that replaced their signature inside the Wiki article with a link to that page.
