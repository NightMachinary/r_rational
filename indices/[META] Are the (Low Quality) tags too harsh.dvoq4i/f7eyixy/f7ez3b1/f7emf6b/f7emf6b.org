Yeah, how about just nixing all the tags save for the link itself?

Trying to inject your subjective opinion of a work into every mention of the story that goes on in this sub leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It would be like someone spamming a copypasta rant every time a story gets mentioned, which is just low quality participation.
