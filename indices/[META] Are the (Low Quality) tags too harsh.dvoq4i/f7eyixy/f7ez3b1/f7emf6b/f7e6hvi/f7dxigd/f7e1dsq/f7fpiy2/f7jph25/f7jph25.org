I expect that the underlying issue is that you are trying to enhance your bot, which was originally limited to providing links to third party sites, to provide what is effectively recommendation data. Or anti-recommendation data, as the case may be.

The problem with it is that recommendations are a notoriously complex area. Even Amazon, which has access to its users' browsing history and their purchasing history, not to mention a lot of experienced developers, has had trouble with them over the years. And they have every incentive to get recommendations right in order to sell more books.

Something like /Taylor Varga/, which you currently [[https://www.reddit.com/r/LightPieces/comments/dtszrx/taylor_varga/][list as (Low Quality)]], is a good example of the challenges involved. It's a hugely polarizing fics; some readers love it and some readers hate it. The quotes that you have collected are a decent cross-section of the reasons given by the people who dislike it. However, you could also come up with another list of reasons given by the people who like it. Which is why it is [[https://wormstorysearch.com/?direction=desc&is_nsfw_eq=any&limit=20&page=2&searching=true&sort=stories.rating][currently ranked 32rd out of 7,000+ /Worm/ fics]].

In my case, I had finished 180 /Worm/ fics before I started researching /Taylor Varga/ in depth, so I knew what I was doing. And yet even after reading all the arguments "pro et contra" I wasn't sure whether I would like it. I had to actually sit down and read the 2,000,000-word monstrosity in order to decide for myself. Moreover, my opinion changed repeatedly as I progressed through the text. If I had stopped after the first 300K words, when some of the issues with the fic became more pronounced, I would have had a different opinion than I have now. If you were to ask me today whether it's a "low quality" work, I would shrug and say that it really depends on what you are after, what kind of sense of humor you appreciate, whether you can handle well-written but repetitive scenes, etc. There are sections of /Taylor Varga/ which I find to be very enjoyable and there are section which I find to be very irritating.

As a general observation, I find that using objective quantifiable data helps when creating recommendation lists. It's not a perfect method by any means, but it helps minimize controversy. Things like [[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/most_popular_table.cgi?1][the ISFDB's list of Novels Ranked by Awards and Nominations]], which I put together a few years ago.
