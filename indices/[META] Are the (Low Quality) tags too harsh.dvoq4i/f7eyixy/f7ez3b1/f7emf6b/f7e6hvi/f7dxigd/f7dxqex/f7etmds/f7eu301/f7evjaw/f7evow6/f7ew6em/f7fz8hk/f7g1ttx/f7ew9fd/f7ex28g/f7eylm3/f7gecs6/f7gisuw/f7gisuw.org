  “It isn't your place” is a status-based argument and you should be suspicious of yourself for making it.

Consider the following statement:

"It's not my place to come to your house while you're at work and start painting it purple with orange polka dots."

Even if that /is/ status-based, it's still entirely valid.

The real reason I've been participating in this argument (and you should be suspicious of yourself for trying to be a telepath, ascribing to me an emotional state based on how you inferred I must have been feeling - as though I couldn't /possibly/ have said the things I said unless I was upset) is because Lightwavers attitude ("as long as there are no titles unlinked, there will be no links and thus no tags provided") struck me as similar to "if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear."

It's like, no, you don't get to assume that this decision you've made is the default option. I don't even care if there's a bot or what it does, I barely interact with this subreddit outside of the Friday thread anyway.

And if you'll follow this argument to its conclusion, Lightwavers thought they had a "gotcha" with the "prove it's objectively true." I responded with two short, simple sentences. Then they went back and said "... yeah, okay, I'm messaging the mods for permission right now." So, like, idk what you're doing here but I'm wanting to be shut of all this, I haven't heavily participated in reddit for a hot minute and I feel like I wasted my entire day thinking about this nonsense, so...
