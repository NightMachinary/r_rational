The difference is, one is illegal while one is merely against convention. It's like the example that [[/u/RMcD94]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7g6gej/][gave]] about asking forgiveness not permission. That's totally fine when it's just a convention that you're breaking, and the convention is one you understand why it's in place (Chesterton's Fence) and what it's for, and you're breaking it for a specific reason that you think will improve the situation. I will charitably ascribe this motive to Lightwavers as I don't think his behaviour contradicts it. (Although I don't /know/ how hard he thought about it first, by default one should be charitable in their interpretations of others, I feel.)

Sorry about using the word "upset." I meant it as more of a stand-in for the longer phrase "arguing about this on the internet." I see this as mostly a pointless activity, so I don't do it much. Possibly I am guilty of ascribing a motive to you because you are engaging in an activity I find to be low-value.

I'm sorry to hear that you feel you wasted your day thinking about this. I may have contributed to that, for which I apologise again.

  It's like, no, you don't get to assume that this decision you've made is the default option. I don't even care if there's a bot or what it does, I barely interact with this subreddit outside of the Friday thread anyway.

Why not? Why can't people contribute as they see fit, if they look at the current state of things on [[/r/rational]] and go, "Hey, I could do this and it would be a definite improvement. I know about all the likely errors I could be making in this judgement, and have specifically thought about why things are the way they are, and I still feel that this would be an improvement." And then the only thing they do is break a (previously unenforced) convention. As an honest, genuine question, what is the problem with this?

(A separate issue: I can see why people dislike Lightwavers injecting personal commentary into bot-like behaviour which should be "impartial." I mostly agree with the criticisms here and so voted to remove the extra tags on the poll he put up.)
