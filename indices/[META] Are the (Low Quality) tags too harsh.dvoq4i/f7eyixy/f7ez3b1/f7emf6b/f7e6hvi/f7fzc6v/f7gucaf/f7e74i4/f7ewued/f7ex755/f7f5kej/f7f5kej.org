Just want to preface this by saying that I've found the links helpful, and used them on a number of occasions. And also that I think your heart is 100% in the right place.

I'm probably not the only person who is saying this, and I know that getting criticized from multiple places simultaneously can be stressful and alienating even if individual responses are relatively restrained. So sorry, too, if this is adding to a pile of similar responses that is creating a negative effect on you. But I think adding any kind of politics tags to posts is damaging to the community. Besides the fact that it's specifically against the rules, the fact that the bot respons so prolifically and prominently in the recommendation threads makes it highly likely that a politics tag will trigger a political discussion. I've already seen it multiple times since the bot started up and almost never before that.

Secondarily, the subjective nature of the tags leads to unresolvable contradictions, and the system seems to be based on a number of cultral assumptions. For example, the Lord of the Mysteries tag for author politics is based on views that are commonly, really near universally, held in mainland China. It's really saying you have a beef with another culture, which in this case is Western-centric. It also means you would, for example, have to put an author politics tag on 95% of the works written before 1960, or which were written in the middle east (maybe more like 70% on that one). I think that just doesn't show enough respect for cultural difference. The fact that it's yourself, or yourself and two hand-picked friends, means that this isn't something that the community has chosen for itself, but that you're implementing unilaterally. And I do think the disucsioon kicked up by these tags is convulsing the community, and even if the tags themselves have some value they're not worth it.

I know you've invested a lot in the bot, but I wonder if you could make it go back to just linking to texts. Please. :(
