  ...then the invaders will have, with much effort, managed to do what they could have much more easily done by simply creating a new subreddit.

But they don't want to create a new subreddit. They want to take over things that exist and make them new territory. They've already done that, the creation of new subreddits, and /undisguised/ Nazis get banned by the admins. Look at [[/r/frenworld]].

  What if it drives away an innocent person who has been mistaken for a Nazi? What if it drives away people who see a clear Us/Them division and, having been the victims of bigotry before, don't even bother to look further before leaving?

Well, that's unfortunate, but I think we're at the point where we have to either do that or accept Nazis into the community. If we were planning to /make/ a community, it's easy to subtly influence it to steer away Nazis from gaining ground in the first place. Suffuse a place with anti-Nazi sentiment, or just ban all bigotry in the comments. For example, someone who says or implies homophobia is okay is just gone, no matter how politely they word it.
