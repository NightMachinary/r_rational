  and nothing else

Nay, that's not what I'm implying. I say if they go through the process of experiencing my life, and then after they do so all other memories return, I believe they will likely be at least less of a bigot.

  I state, without (yet) providing any evidence one way or the other, that person X has 'objectionable politics'. What are the odds that you would, if you did the research on Person X, agree with that assessment?

  What are the odds that you would agree with all such assessments that I make?
#+end_quote

I can't say. I made a point of it to only append the tag if said evidence is provided. I'm not really sure what your point is here, since without evidence I can make no conclusions one way or another, and there are no examples mentioned. I suppose if you really want me to provide odds, I could find the percentage of the population of the Earth that are Nazis or bigots as defined by some source, probably a collection of polls, and then find the percentage of people who are writers, and then use those numbers to find the odds.

  The first flaw is the idea that it does little harm to incorrectly label someone as a Nazi.
#+end_quote

Doing that does do harm. However, would you not say that someone who spouts actual Nazi propaganda on their Twitter feed is a Nazi?

#+begin_quote
  The second flaw is that it does little harm to divide off the Nazis so that their only company is each other, such that they can reinforce and strengthen each other's views.

Perhaps if they have multiple places to gather, but [[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjbp9d/do-social-media-bans-work][deplatforming works]].

  I do not merely believe that redemption is possible; I would go further and say that it is likely in many cases. Especially when the offense is minor.
#+end_quote

Indeed. A world where this is not the case would be bleak indeed. Fortunately, Reddit provides an easy way for someone who has committed such offense to correct it and come back with no one finding a connection between the two accounts if they so choose, completely eliminating any social stigma their former positions may have incurred.

  Most people therefore do not intentionally try to corrupt people. (This includes people with objectionable politics of almost every stripe).
#+end_quote

I have to disagree there. There are a few harmful ideas which cause the people holding them to promote said ideas. Most religions do this, as they say that converting people is one of the best things one can do. Nazism is another one of these beliefs, because anyone who is /not/ a Nazi is seen as an enemy.

  If members of Them are permitted to interact with Us, then I put it to you that the result is more likely to be the redemption of Them than the corruption of Us.
#+end_quote

This holds true in many cases, but not for Nazis. When a Nazi sees that a place will tolerate them, it becomes a signal for more to come join, and push the politics of that place further right with their presence and arguments. It is a very rare Nazi that wishes to change their mind---when you join a community pre-committing to refuse all persuasive arguments, it takes a boxed AI to get through that and peel back those kinds of beliefs.
