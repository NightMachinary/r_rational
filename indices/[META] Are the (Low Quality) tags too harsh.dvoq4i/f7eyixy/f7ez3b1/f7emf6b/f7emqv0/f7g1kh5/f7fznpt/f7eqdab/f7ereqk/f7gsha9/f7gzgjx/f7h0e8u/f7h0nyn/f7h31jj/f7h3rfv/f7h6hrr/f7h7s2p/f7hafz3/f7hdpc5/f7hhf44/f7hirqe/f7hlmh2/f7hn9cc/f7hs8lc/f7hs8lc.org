...okay, clearly there is a /history/ to that 14-word phrase that is not obvious.

And no, I don't go around looking for Nazis. As a general rule. Furthermore, I haven't heard of Stormfront.

But all of this is beside the point. The point isn't the actual Nazis.

The point is whether or not it's a good idea to label /suspected/ Nazis (or other people one disagrees with) as having 'objectionable politics'.

  I think the core conflict is this: I see Nazis gaining a foothold in internet spaces while you don't seem to see the same thing. This may be because I am more sensitive to Nazi ideology---I know the fourteen words, and other Nazi dogwhistles, so I can more easily perceive them where they exist. Even on Reddit, the president's subreddit has more than a few white nationalist talking points repeated ad nauseam.

Okay, I had to go and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics][look that up]]. It turns out the dog-whistles are absolutely not about trying to convert other people to your ideology. Rather, it's about tricking people into voting for a given ideology by couching it behind innocent-seeming codephrases.

Which is only useful in situations where there /is/ a vote.

And the biggest problem with innocent-seeming codephrases is that sometimes people really do say innocent things. Which may lead to them being unfairly considered part of a group that uses said phrase.

...I'm getting off-track.

While the conflict that you perceive is /a/ conflict between us, it is not the conflict at the core of the debate. The conflict at the core of this debate regards how useful or harmful it is to have a link-bot refer to the politics of the author next to the link of the fic.
