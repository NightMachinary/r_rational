  Everyone, when presented with the same evidence as I have seen, will inevitably come to the same conclusion if they take the time to properly consider the evidence. This is well known.
#+end_quote

I don't think so. First off, I don't believe this is well known---I instead think the exact /opposite/ is known. However, while I agree that simply shoving evidence at someone will not change their mind in most cases, what would you say if I claimed that if someone were able to experience my life exactly as I have, moment by moment, many of my conclusions on bigotry and related topics be shared? I confess that saying that makes me look arrogant, but the thing is, bigotry generally stems from a place of experience, emotion, and most of all, flawed nurturing.

  It does no harm to divide people into Them and Us.
#+end_quote

I don't believe so. However, I submit that the harm caused by doing so is less than /not/ dividing people into Them and Us---when those labeled Them are actual Nazis.

#+begin_quote
  There exist people in the world who are Evil. While redemption is possible, it is rare to the point of being vanishingly nonexistent.
#+end_quote

Here are some of my beliefs. People cannot be evil because I believe that is a nonsensical claim. Actions can be evil, ideas can be evil, but no matter how much evil a person does, they are not themselves evil. Even a psycho/sociopath is not inherently evil; it's just much easier for them to do evil things. It's probably not a big distinction for most, but it is for me. And while redemption can be very rare in some cases, I believe that if there were enough scientists with enough resources studying a person for a long enough period of time, then no matter who they are or what they've done, redemption is always /possible/. Though I'm not sure our definitions of redemption coincide, so maybe not. Definition swap?

#+begin_quote
  It does no harm to exclude people labelled as Evil; in fact, by removing a corrupting influence, this does a lot of good.
#+end_quote

As above, I say here that I don't believe the former statement is true, but I do believe the latter is in many cases.

#+begin_quote
  People will always understand precisely what I mean when I make any statement.
#+end_quote

I have many, many experiences which lead me to say that this is emphatically /not/ the case.

[[/raritydress][]]I think I see where you're going with this, but I don't want to preempt you, especially if I'm wrong.
