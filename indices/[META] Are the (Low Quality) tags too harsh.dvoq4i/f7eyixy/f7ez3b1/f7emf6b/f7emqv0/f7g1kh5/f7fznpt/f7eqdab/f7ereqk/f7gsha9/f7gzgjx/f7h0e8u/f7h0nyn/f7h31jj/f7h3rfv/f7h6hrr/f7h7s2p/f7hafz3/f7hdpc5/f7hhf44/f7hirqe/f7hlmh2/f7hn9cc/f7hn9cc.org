  The fourteen words
#+end_quote

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words]]

"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."

#+begin_quote
  And the last time I heard a serious suggestion of 'a nation for white people' was the boeremag who, while hugely racist, were not Nazis and (so far as I can tell) had nothing against Jews. (They were also convicted of treason).

Perhaps you're not going looking for Nazis? It's commendable, if that's the case, but the thing is, there are Nazis on the internet. Have you heard of Stormfront?

  Presumably I don't hang out in the wrong places.

Ah. Likely, then.

  However, nothing in my previous paragraph has to do with the flaws in said chain of reasoning.

I think the core conflict is this: I see Nazis gaining a foothold in internet spaces while you don't seem to see the same thing. This may be because I am more sensitive to Nazi ideology---I know the fourteen words, and other Nazi dogwhistles, so I can more easily perceive them where they exist. Even on Reddit, the president's subreddit has more than a few white nationalist talking points repeated ad nauseam.
