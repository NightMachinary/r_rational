  Precisely. A given situation might be, say, one where some Nazis have invaded a subreddit and are attempting to push a particular set of ideas to make it more accommodating to them. Perhaps pointing out that some users are Nazis actually starts driving away the Nazis---that's undesireable, so they might push forward the idea that politics shouldn't be allowed.

And that prevents them from spreading their ideology, neutering them entirely.

The moment that they start to push a vote for an actually objectionable cause - like allowing anti-Semitic rhetoric while simultaneously banning all other politics - they will lose that vote. Dog-whistle tactics don't work unless you can make something dangerous sound innocent and then /still implement the dangerous thing/.

  I think that is the core. Because if a link bot refers to the politics of the author, and that manages to drive away Nazis, then that is a good thing.

Is it still a good thing if it drives away non-Nazis?
