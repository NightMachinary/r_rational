  However, I don't /want/ this sub to be banned.

Noted. However, there are several steps that would need to happen before that point (probably starting with the banning of individual users for glorification of violence), so I don't think there's any danger of this in the near term.

  I believe this is true---if Nazi ideology and bigotry is just flat-out banned whenever it's spotted. However, I've seen a grand total of zero of the first banned, probably because the mods would ban open Nazis here, and I have seen many instances of bigotry which the mods have taken no action against, presumably because they don't want to ban someone on the off chance that there's a good faith reason for expressing a bigoted opinion.

Ah. Now we're onto an important point here. Nazis, I put it to you, are vanishingly rare. Bigots, on the other hand, are far more common; and far less likely to advocate for violence.

Two points. Point the first: were the mods aware? (There is a 'report' button under posts which can be used to make the mods aware if you are not sure).

Point the second: No action /that you saw/. It is possible that, in certain cases, the action that the mods would take is one of the following:

- Conclude that the statement has an innocent interpretation, and/or is being taken out of context, and give the poster the benefit of the doubt
- Send the poster a private message, warning them to be more careful or face stronger sanctions in the future
- Request that the poster edit the post to something less objectionable
- Very quietly delete the given post (perhaps with, again, a castigation of the poster via private message)

Generally, the first two will look like nothing; but a poster with a habit of objectionable statements would be more likely to end up in trouble than a poster who says something easily misinterpreted (perhaps due to tiredness).

#+begin_quote
  Nah. I'm saying that the Nazis were homophobic as well as advocates for mass murder, and nothing is lost by banning homophobia, which is not a good opinion on its own.
#+end_quote

Is anything lost by banning people who say something that /appears/ homophobic?
