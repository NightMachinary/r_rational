I don't think "malware" maps to "features that I don't like". Personally, I like Discord. Ideally, every program would be open source, but I feel like decentralized communities are bound to be smaller, and Matrix doesn't seem to have all of Discord's ease of use features (let alone video chat), so it's not a real competitor.
