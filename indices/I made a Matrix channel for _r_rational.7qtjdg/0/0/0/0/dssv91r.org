Thanks!

However, I think at some point I ought to test my beliefs about free software. For example, I believe that proprietary software is often malware. I think I could test that by taking samples of popular software that is commercial, freeware, open source but nonfree, and free, and figuring out how many from each category contain features/antifeatures that I wouldn't like.
