Coming in from 2 months later - the 100 years one I'd say is the smoking gun. We had this scenario 100 years ago. All we needed to learn from it, adequately, was 'Wear cloth masks when a new dangerous disease is out there until infection vectors are fully understood, and then adopt societal precautions accordingly', with a slight economic damper due to maintaining a stockpile of cloth masks that has to be occasionally thrown out with age and renewed (Though there are massive efficiency gains possible here).

Had we done that, and as soon as it was clear international transmission had happened, simply societally masked up, instituted social distancing, and went about our business, we'd look like Taiwan or Vietnam right now instead of, well, America.
