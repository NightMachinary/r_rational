100 years gets you back to Spanish flu sure, or it might just be a nice round number. It would also be very ironic if it were a deliberate reference to pandemic in that sense, since you skip over a few epidemics to get there. Consider, "Are we going to have to do this again in 100 years?" "Nah, this sort of thing happens every 10 years or so... you forgot about a few of those didn't you?"

As for future readers missing things; the thing about references, or at least obvious references, is that they tend to be hard to miss and date the work they appear in.
