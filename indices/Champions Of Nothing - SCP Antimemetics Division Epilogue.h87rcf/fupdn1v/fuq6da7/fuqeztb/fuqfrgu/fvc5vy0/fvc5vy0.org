I'm pretty sure the human who rides the spiders is Red, the cult leader from [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ojai][Ojai]]. I believe he was wounded by Marion's gunshots in [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are][Unforgettable, That's What You Are]]. This is alluded to in [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/immemorial][Immemorial]]. Red also appeared briefly at the end of [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unthreaded][Unthreaded]]. That body was killed by Adam Wheeler at the end of [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/blood-brain][Blood-Brain]].
