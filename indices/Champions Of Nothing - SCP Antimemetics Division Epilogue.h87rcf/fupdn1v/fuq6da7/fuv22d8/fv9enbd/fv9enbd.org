Part of this depends on how you measure the order of magnitude of the failure. SCP-2000 indicates previous extinction level events that it was then used to fix. It would have been powerless to help against 3125 however, even assuming it wasn't compromised when the SCP manifested fully any clone army it tried to make to fight back would have been the moment they left. An argument could be made that this means 3125 is worse than the threats that 2000 has already helped correct.
