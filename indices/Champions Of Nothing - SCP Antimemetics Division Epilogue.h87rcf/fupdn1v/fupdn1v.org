To be accountable for something, you must have had the ability to stop it. And while the Foundation might like to pretend that it could have stopped SCP-3125, the reality is that there would be little more sense in holding the Foundation responsible than there would be a child. They fought, to the best of their ability, intelligently and ceaselessly, and they lost anyway. How could they have not?

But I'm still glad to see an O-5 at least thinking about the question of how to do better.
