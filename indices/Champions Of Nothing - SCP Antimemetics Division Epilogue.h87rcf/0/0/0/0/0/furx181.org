None of these point to Covid with any sort of specificity. They are quite generic post disaster observations that could apply to every disaster, and so can't really point to any of them specifically.

Well, except the 100 years thing. That is an awfully optimistic timeline for the O5 to have about most sorts of disasters. As for epidemics specifically, Ebola was a thing 4 years ago, H1N1 was only 10 years ago.

To put it another way, do you think a reader 20 years from now would read this epilogue and immediately jump to "2020 Covid" or would something more recent come more readily to mind?
