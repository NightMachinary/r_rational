We have zero data about what sort of threats led to necessary recovery with SCP-2000, only an idea of the scope of the damage that needed to be recovered from; these unknown threats left a seemingly-life-sustaining world once resolved with, and so did SCP-3125. These unknown threats left an almost-extinct humanity, which SCP-3125 didn't. With no information to judge whether the threats were better (e.g. temporary extinction events only) or worse (similarly potentially permanent extinction events which were dealt with somehow), I would argue that the only scale we have for ranking 'failure' is the actual outcome in terms of damage, for which the scale (effectively) saturates at SCP-2000 necessity and is anthropically undefined for humanity-wiped-out-forever because there's no one there to assess the damage. (Where 'humanity' is presumably defined as 'a self-aware mind which identifies with the previous humanity'--it's interesting to imagine a future in which only certain SCPs roam the Earth or surrounding universe, some of them thinking of themselves as human.)
