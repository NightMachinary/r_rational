I couldn't find them/him named, but the humanoids riding the spiders in /Unforgettable/ and /Immemorial/ are very similar to Gray and Clay, so they're connected to 3125 in a stronger sense than that. I believe there was a third __ay name but I couldn't find it. Given that they're also 3125 vectors, it would be very unusual for there to be two types of humanoid, embodied, deliberate 3125 vectors which weren't the same type, if not quite the same 'breed'.
