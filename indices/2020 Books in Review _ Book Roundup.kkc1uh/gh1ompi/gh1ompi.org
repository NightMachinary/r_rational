*Web Serials* (books in a different comment):

I re-read *Unsong*, which remains probably the best web serial ever written. Fake, glorious Kabbalah, incredible biblical puns of extraordinary awfulness, obsessive and human characters, a sysadmin angel, the end of times, and the greatest notarikon reveal I've ever seen.

I re-read *Lady Knight Volant* (featuring Protector of the Small's Keladry of Mindelan), which remains probably the best fanfic ever written. Enough people asked whether the author was Tamora Pierce herself. No; it is not. Also it has some sequels, which I read. LKV specifically is about Keladry building her holding; at first to protect the refugees she's assigned to shepherd, and later building it into a glorious fortress-steading in the face of adversity.

*Katalepsis* is the best ongoing web serial on my list. Sapphic romance, friendships through trauma with traumatized people, mental health, a great vast all-seeing eye that screams hyperdimensional mathematics into your brain until you bleed out from your ears, it's got it all.

*Ward* by Wildbow (the sequel to his debut, Worm) wrapped up. It's amazing how much the fanbase hated this serial. He started his new serial, Pale, which is set in the same setting as his older Pact but with a totally different cast of characters (and is much less bleak). It's much more cerebral than Worm, I think. I really liked it. I really liked Victoria's struggle with trying to figure out how to be the person she needed to be, and how to figure out who and what she wanted to be.

*Just a Bystander* is a serial about a student going to the Mage Academy learning to deal with the fact that he's gotten wrapped up in some gosh darn Chosen One prophecy, and he does not approve.

*The Wandering Inn* is an extremely long (7ish million words and going!) slice-of-life litRPG story. It starts out pretty bad, so if you're giving this serial a shot, you owe it to yourself to read until the chess match happens, at which point if you still don't like it put it away and don't come back. Pirateaba (the author) publishes more words of web serial than anyone else writes of fiction, we're talking like 50k words a week. On update days, I don't need anything else to read while I do my morning cardio. It's not particularly rational, though there are characters (Saliss!) who are standouts in terms of having a clear internal narrative that drives them to behave the way they do. It is, however, extremely long, so it's got that going for it.

*A Practical Guide to Evil* by ErraticErrata started out YA and has long since left. Catherine Foundling, recruited by the Black Knight to become the Squire, has gone far and seen amazing things, and the recent chapters have been just gut-punch and moment of awesome packed. There's a lot of meta in this story, and a lot of meta-story. Every trope in the book is played with and analyzed with clear eyes.

*The Zombie Knight* (George Frost), a serial about a young man who commits suicide... and is then offered a chance to stick around and make a difference, but with superpowers this time, as an ancient reaper's sidekick. Has some very interesting superpowers, which are used in very interesting ways.

*Worth the Candle* (Alexander Wales), needs no introduction on this subreddit.

A bunch of other isekai litRPGs that don't get their own line. *Delve, Cinnamon Bun, The Many Lives of Cadence Lee, Eight, New Life of a Summoned Demoness*, (arguably) *Dungeon Crawler Carl, Devil's Foundry, Unbound, Vainquer the Dragon.*

*Blessed Time* and *Tower of Somnus*, the former a non-isekai timeloop litRPG and the latter a serial-numbers-filed-off Shadowrun Earth being actively quarantined by galactic civilization. Tower of Somnus is probably the best-realized Shadowrun-esque setting I've seen. It understands that Shadowrun as presented in most contexts is absurdism and that if you want to present a literalist world you have to do some work... and it does that work. (Also recommended to me via this subreddit.)
