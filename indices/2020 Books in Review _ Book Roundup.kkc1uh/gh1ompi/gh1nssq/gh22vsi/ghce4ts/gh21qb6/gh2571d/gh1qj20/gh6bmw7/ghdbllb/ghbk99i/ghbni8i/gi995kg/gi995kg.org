I'm a few days late here, but I wanted to get to the end of the Wheel of Time novel I was reading.

So, let's start with those.

In 2020, I read the first six books of *The Wheel of Time*.

The worldbuilding so far has been epic fantasy at its finest. The magic system is a little squishy for my taste (I can suddenly heal [this injury], which no one has ever done before, because I tried a combination of [two of the five elements], which no one has ever tried for this injury before!), but there appear to be pretty firm limits on what can be done, with only minor stretching as the series goes on. The history is detailed and not obviously inconsistent, the nations are recognizably the way they are for reasons that make sense given their history (even if those traits sometimes approach the point of caricature).

The protagonists, almost to a one, start out really grating, but I think that was a deliberate choice by the author, and makes sense in context. Many of them are teenagers or young adults who grew up in an insulated community, and are basically being dragged around against their will by an authority figure they have little respect for. /Of course/ they're going to be brats about it. This gave them plenty of room to grow, and they have taken full advantage of that. Although not all of those characters have grown out of the whinging yet (looking at you here, Mat). The characters are still a little two-dimensional for my taste; they tend to get hyper-focused about whatever they're working on, with only small diversions for minor side plots that almost always involve romance so fluffy that Disney princesses would go into diabetic shock from reading it.

As for the antagonists, a second dimension would be an improvement. It's fortunate that the forthcoming apocalypse, and the conflict between protagonists about how best to face it down, is enough to give the story some tension, because I cannot take even one of these Evil Overlord Academy washouts seriously. Big Boss included.

I don't want to say much about the plot, because I don't believe it would be fair. The first couple of books kind of worked as stories on their own, each with clear beginnings, middles, and ends, and self-contained story and character arcs, but the further I get into the story, the more I feel that Jordan is going for a more Tolkien-style "one book, published in [fourteen] volumes" rather than a traditional structure where each book, while taking place as part of a larger narrative, is satisfying to read on its own.

One major recurring negative that bugs me is all of the narrative convenience. It's somewhat justified within the story (one of the powers of the three male leads is that weird shit convenient to the narrative is just likely to happen around them), but that doesn't make it not-annoying when it happens.

Thematically, I like that a lot of the focus of the book is on /realpolitik/, about how someone might ethically gather nations together in the lead-up to an apocalyptic event. And as fluffy as the romance is, I'm very happy that they don't present love as one of those "Meet the right person and live happily ever after" things. I was hoping to have more exploration of the metatextual references (e.g. in exactly what sense is Egwene al'Vere a cyclical repetition of Guinevere?), but that might be something for the later books. Hopefully that actually gets paid off somehow.

Writing style: it's a slog. If I were an editor and were handed this series of books, there is a lot that I would cut out. There are /so many/ pages about love-struck characters agonizing that they can't be together; if I cut just half of that agonizing out I could probably reduce these six books down to five. And there are long periods where the author describes nothing happening. The plot got more development in the last third of book six than in the book and two thirds before it. When tension does build up, it's almost always resolved almost immediately. A character gets kidnapped in the last ten chapters of the 55-chapter Book 6. I thought that might be a set-up for the next novel, but nope, all of the planning, preparation, and execution of the rescue plan takes place in those ten chapters (with the help of a heaping serving of more narrative convenience).

I'm definitely going to finish this (I hear the pacing issues above get worse from here, which OH GOD PLEASE NO), but I would not recommend it to anyone who isn't either in it for the worldbuilding, or a completist who wants to read a very influential work in the fantasy genre. I'm definitely more the latter; the worldbuilding alone, as spectacular as it is, would not keep me reading this.

Moving on.

This past year, I also read the new *Dresden Files* books by Jim Butcher, *Peace Talks* and *Battle Ground*.

Three things I would keep in mind for these books:

First, read *Brief Cases* immediately before these books. Nearly all of the short stories tie in to the plot of these novels, in one way or another. There are a couple of references back to one or two stories in *Side Jobs*, so there's no reason /not/ to re-read that, too (h/t to Daniel Greene for the suggestion to read the short stories first). Most of these tie-ins are given enough context that the story doesn't lose much if all you know about those events is what the narrator explains to you, but there is one short story in Brief Cases that gets referenced over, and over, and over, and really explains a lot about one character's behaviour towards the protagonist, and the narrator/protagonist /wasn't there for those events/, so he /doesn't know/ the context.

Second, these are a single story. I haven't had possession of both books at the same time, and there are several things in the second book that I am /itching/ to go back to the first book to check out. If you can read them back-to-back, and then read them back-to-back again, do that. I certainly plan to.

Third, these are book #16 and #17 in a longer series; even paired up to make a full story, they do not work well without the context of the rest of the novels.

In-context, though, they're excellent. That thing I was talking about earlier, where you tell a story that is part of a larger narrative, while still having the smaller story feel satisfying in its own right? Jim Butcher is great at this. Even with the caveat that "these two books are a single story," the first book of the pair still satisfyingly wraps up its A-plot, with the B-plot ending on a cliffhanger to become the A-plot of the next book. And on a larger level, this pair is the satisfying wrap-up of a five book arc, and provides some hooks for the next arc.

The one point that I really didn't enjoy is that, even knowing that this series is supposed to be a pastiche of old film noir private eye stories, there's a whole lot of Dresden leering at women going on. Even, near the beginning of Peace Talks, his daughter's teenage babysitter. It's a recurring trend in these novels, and it's always a bit cringey. Dresden leering at his love interest is fine. Dresden leering at the lust-inducing sex vampire, sure, who can blame him. The babysitter was just a bit too squick for me.

But, all things considered, I am definitely adding these to my bookshelf, and I will probably be doing a full re-read of the whole series this summer.
