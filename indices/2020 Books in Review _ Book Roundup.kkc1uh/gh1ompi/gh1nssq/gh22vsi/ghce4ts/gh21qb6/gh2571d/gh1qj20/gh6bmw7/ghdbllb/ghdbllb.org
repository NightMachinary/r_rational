The most interesting work for me was Orson Welles' radio rendition of /War of the Worlds/ on [[https://www.bornalone.org/index.html][The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]. Tense, with an artistic touch, and a thought-provoking tone for the ending monologue. /Dracula/ was also good. Liked The Mercury Theater way better than his movies, though /Touch of Evil/ wasn't bad, and I have a soft spot for /The Stranger/.

Apparently the world of radio drama which I've never bothered with has some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet,_Please][gems]] worth trying.

/Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!/ was interesting enough that I've also started reading [[https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/][The Feynman Lectures on Physics]].

I've been going through the [[https://www.bartleby.com/hc/][Harvard Classics]]. Special mentions go to John Woolman's /Journal/. Woolman was an American Quaker, and the journal is an interesting and often powerful mix of travel story, musings on conscience, and history, with a touch of Quaker oddity.

For works posted on this sub, I've taken a liking to /Pokemon: Origin of Species/ and /The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere/.

Just to mention some ordinary novels: /HakoMari/ (exceptionally good 1st book, was also one I learned about from here), /The Fountainhead/ (better than expected, Ellsworth Toohey was a great villain), /Casino Royale/ (interesting characterization of Bond, but inferior to the movie), book 2 of /The Lost Fleet/ series (Jack Campbell, writing is, um, not inspired, but I liked Geary's character- controlled, hard-working, a man of integrity), Sanderson's /The Emperor's Soul/ (short, focused, liked it better than Mistborn but the ending wasn't perfect), /Ender's Shadow/ (a retelling of Ender's Game from Bean's perspective, good, a little uneven, and feels a little like some retconning going on with Bean's character), the first Hornblower novel /The Happy Return / Beat to Quarters/ (was simply magic, and was an influence on /Star Trek/- reportedly Patrick Stewart was given a Hornblower novel when he asked about his character).

Poe's /Masque of the Red Death/ was as expected great.

Things I started but haven't finished yet: Borges (seems to be one of those remarkable names that everyone knows but no-one talks about), William Morris' /The Well at the World's End/ (apparently Tolkein and C. S. Lewis had a high opinion of it, its fascinating if you can tolerate the slow pace), /Null-A/ (can't say I understand what its all about but its written well). One day I'll finish reading an actual Shakespeare play rather than watching the animated BBC versions. May try to read out Zamiatin's [[https://mises.org/library/we][We]] before the year ends.
