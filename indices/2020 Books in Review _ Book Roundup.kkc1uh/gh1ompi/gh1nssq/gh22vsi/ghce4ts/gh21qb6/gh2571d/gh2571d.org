Holy shit. I just looked up a bunch of these and they seem right in my wheelhouse. Thank you very much for these which will act as a late Christmas present to me!

Edit:

Should probably add some of my own.

Mother of Learning finished this year:

Focused on a less-than powerful mage-in-training who is caught in a time loop and has to navigate this interesting setting that's filled out pretty well. The setting isn't anything completely original but it combines a lot of more general elements of fantasy world and really merges them into a finished product looks post acceptable and complex. Decently rational on its own with a pretty solid world and relatively simple characters which play out entertaining conflicts in creative ways. Very reminiscent of lots of Progression fantasy, but in a way that's more complex at satisfying than Numbers-Go-Up even if it takes a bit longer. The author has just now released the definitive premise for his news story which will follow a powerful arch mage in a separate fantasy universe which seems to be much more focused on the political and dramatic it's of the world and building up an empire rather than individual power

Worth the Candle speaks for itself.

I pretty randomly read the Ex-Heroes series by Peter Clines which turned out to be surprisingly fun. Set in its own Marvel/DC-inspired super universe that has fallen way to a zombie apocalypse which scoured the planet. An extremely comic-bookey and absurd premise, but pretty fun and enjoyable and it's execution. The characters and conflicts stuck with me which is a lot more than I can say about other things I've read. The characters are easily enjoyable and grow on you and it really has its own sense of personality which is rare. I was a little iffy on the depiction of a female character in the first book, there was nothing egregious, it just give me some bad vibes, but someone must've talk to the author by the second book because I really enjoy her from there on. This author did a really good job at describing the world, and used some relatively simplistic but incredibly effective setting techniques that I'm definitely gonna borrow. I don't know why, it's not one of the greatest things I've read, but this series really grew on me and I can honestly see myself rereading it in the future. If you're a fan of comic book movies and want to read a series with likable characters in fantastical scenarios with with decently written, and enjoyable characters, written in a grounded and researched way, this is for you.

I finally read Cradle by Will Wight and it is underdog, progression fantasy distilled to its purest form. The characters are far enough, the MC isn't anything to write home about but some of the cast and antagonist are really enjoyable. If want to read a story about a kid coming from nothing and slowly ascending in power to reach the strongest than this might be for you. Inspired by the Cultivation genre, the magic system is relatively simple but it's fun to think about. This is a pretty straightforward slow burn power fantasy that's really solid with enjoyable action but nothing really special about it. If you enjoy typical progression Fantasy you WILL enjoy this, otherwise you might want to read it if you're in the mood for some fun action.
