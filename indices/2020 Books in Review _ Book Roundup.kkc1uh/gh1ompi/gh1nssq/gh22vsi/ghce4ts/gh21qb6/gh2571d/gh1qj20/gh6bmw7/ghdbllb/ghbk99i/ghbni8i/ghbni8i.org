*Automatic Reload* by Ferret Steinmetz

Protagonist is a mercenary who has four prosthetic limbs because AI and robotics have become a lot better at fighting than unmodified humans wielding dumb weapons - and he obsessively programs and optimizes them to get tiny performance improvements that can literally mean the difference between life and death. He takes on a job protecting cargo that turns out to be a woman transformed into a biological weapon by the IAC - the scariest and most amoral private military contractor out there, with all the best computers and technology - and the two of them go on the run, hoping to survive as long as possible and fight back as much as they can before they're captured or killed.

In terms of it appealing to the audience here, Characters do attempt to make reasonable decisions in the face of what might be superior intelligence ("our escape plan has to be stupid because all the smart things are too predictable and we'll get surrounded and caught right away, but we have to make our stupid plan as smart as possible anyway so it has a chance of working") and there's even some AI alignment talk which should appeal to the LessWrong crowd. ;) I enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend it.
