Incomplete list of everything I can remember reading this year, in no particular order.

*Unsong*

Extremely funny and pun-laden work, with a unique world built on biblical literalism and Jewish mysticism.

Has a lot of characters and interactions I really enjoyed, but I think it has structural problems and an unsatisfying ending. Still highly recommend.

*Cordyceps*

A horror story where the twist is extremely obvious.

One of the main characters is very annoying in an intentional and well-rendered way that I still found exhausting to deal with. I didn't find this one nearly as enjoyable as everyone else here.

*Mother of Learning*

Time loop story, our hero unexpectedly finds himself in an endless repetition of the first month of Junior year of wizard school. Really nice slow, steady progression in the character, both in power and in becoming less of an ass.

Fun world building, good use of the time loop, nice use of revisiting challenges that were too much before. Somewhat weak on interpersonal character development. Really bad at establishing convincing stakes - every time the author establishes the potential for permanent setbacks or permanently missed opportunities he stretches it out for ages and fails to actually pull the trigger. Great overall, and very comfy, would highly recommend, especially during quarantine.

*Worth The Candle* (Ongoing)

Guy who's usually the Dungeon Master in his RPG group gets sucked into a fantasy world that appears to have been constructed by smashing together all of his campaign notes. He gets game mechanical superpowers to deal with the ever-escalating object-level challenges of the world, but the real challenge is causality bending everything to make him confront his traumas and failings.

There's a lot to unpack with this one. Good prose, good pacing, creative action scenes, incredible world-building, excellent internal character psychology. Does extremely subtle and impressive things with the narrator's changing mental stats. Very impressive post-modern flair as it goes on. Extremely highly recommend, unless you want something comfy, because this one is pretty damn rough. No seriously - the author is routinely on this subreddit asking for ideas for a cozy low-stakes setting he's planning on next, because even he's clearly needs a break from how rough Worth The Candle gets.

Would also recommend reading Metropolitan Man by the same author first. It's a lot shorter, and more quickly establishes what the author is capable of. The first several chapters of WTC can come across as a generic but somewhat better-than-average isekai.

*Ward*

Sequel to Worm, an action-packed superhero deconstruction/reconstruction/rationalization with an escalation fetish and an author who's become known for raw output, prose quality, and ability to write altered mental states, and infamous for dragging his characters through Hell.

Ward is a very different beast from Worm, focusing much more on the processing of and recovery from trauma. Superpowers now are much more tied into the metaphor, and no longer simply drawn, clearly specified, munchkinnable things. If you think "pacing" means the rate of change on characters and the state of the world you'll find it's much improved here, and if you think "pacing" means the time between action sequences you'll be disappointed. Still suffers from filler arcs, still lurches awkwardly from combat to combat at times. Still a Wildbow work where you can expect everything to be suffering all the time.

Overall I think Ward was a lot better than Worm, but if the above description doesn't sound like something you'd like, you're probably right. I'd also consider listening to the podcast We've Got Worm between Worm and this, as the attitude towards Worm that the podcast has is much closer to what Wildbow is going for in Ward than the attitude the general (spacebattles) fandom has.

*I Just Love Killin'* (abandoned, but not dissatisfying so)

Worm/Rick And Morty crossover. Worm knowledge is necessary, for Rick And Morty you can get away with the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDr9axb7X7E][two]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OWdwiU1W7g][scenes]] that Krombopulous Michael shows up in. Taylor's superpower is replaced with having a cheerful alien assassin stuck in her head, who decides to be her mentor.

Very funny, extremely well-paced, nice breezy casual thing about training and planning paying off. Would recommend.

*Wake of the Ravager* (ongoing)

In a world where everyone gets RPG-style stats, skills, and level ups, our protagonist dreams of being a super powerful wizard. He lucks into a broken combination of abilities, but doesn't rest on his laurels and instead constantly pursues more power, often through munchkinning and experimentation. There's also a harem.

This is a dumb adolescent wish fulfillment / power fantasy, but I think it's the best possible version of that. The action is solid, the pacing is usually excellent, and it enjoys being what it is. In particular, I'm impressed with how fast the author adds new ideas, powers, setting elements and characters, while still managing to keep juggling said elements without dropping them (it does eventually buckle under its own weight though). I think the Warp Tank arc is the part the audience here would enjoy the most (it has the most munchkinning and experimentation). It's also where I'd suggest stopping; I lost interest a few arcs later.

*Pokemon: The Origin Of Species*

A gritty Pokemon fanfic where, somehow, the world of Pokemon has been hammered into a form that actually makes sense. Our three POV characters seek to change the world through various rational lenses. They travel the world, try things that both fail and succeed, actually suffer from their failures, and actually benefit from their successes.

This is just incredibly solid from a rationalist standpoint. The characters are driven, intelligent, and good at what they do without having handwavy brain superpowers (even the psychics aren't handwavy!). The world is consistent and makes sense. The pacing is great, the stakes are extremely believable (the author puts in the work to show that things can go wrong).

Super big recommendation for this. I think it's highly underrated, easily one of the best stories in this subreddit's milieu, and the single best at whatever "rational fiction" is supposed to mean.

*You Needed Opponents With Gravitas* (incomplete/probably abandoned)

Worm/The Culture cross. You do not need to be familiar with The Culture to enjoy it, but you do need to be familiar with Worm. The world of Worm experiences an intervention by super advanced post-scarcity anarchist aliens.

I really enjoyed this. It's well-written, well-paced, has some neat world-building, shows off some uncommon ideas, and has a mature understanding of societal organization. It's a shame that it got abandoned, but since it was rather low-stakes (the conclusion was obvious, it was just an interesting to read journey), stopping short doesn't sting that much.

*Significant Digits*

Fan sequel to Harry Potter And The Methods Of Rationality, a Harry Potter fanfic where everyone is absurdly intelligent, the author considers imparting his unusual version of the scientific method to be his holy mission, and the genre changes completely every 20 chapters.

Significant Digits shows expanded world-building and scope, more mature understanding of human politics, and a more self-consistent understanding of itself than HPMOR had. I think in many ways it's an improvement, though it lacks the sort of sheer manic joy in being what it is that HPMOR has. This year I found myself rereading and enjoying it, even though I've outgrown HPMOR itself by now. Would recommend.
