Honestly, most of the stuff I have read this year that I can remember has been fan fic, and not even the good kind.

A book that comes to mind that is better than most would expect is "The house of the Spirits" by Isabel Allende. Its a magical realism story set in a South American country and covers three generations of a family while discussing South America in the 1900s. I never thought to myself that it was great writing prose wise, but it was well built and definitely makes you think book.
