I know it's kind of a classic, but I finally read *Hyperion* by Dan Simmons. And what can I say, I think it deserves its status. It's a really interesting book with a lot of interesting themes and intertwining stories as well as literary references. John Keats being the obvious one, but there's quite a lot of Canterbury Tales too in this story of pilgrims telling each other stories as they progress towards their goal (but being sci-fi, the pilgrimage is on another planet, and the goal is a meeting with some kind of otherworldly, alien, possibly time-transcendent beast that will most likely just kill them all).

Problem is, I still haven't gotten around reading the sequel, *The Fall of Hyperion*, mostly for trivial reasons. Namely that the pandemic means I don't commute any more, and that has severely cut into my usual reading habits. Oh well. I really need to find a better balance with the whole "working from home" shtick. I should get around to it before I forget all about the previous book though.

Oh, on another note, just a curiosity, but I'm currently reading an Italian novel by one Michele Mari, *Io venia pien d'angoscia a rimirarti* ("I came full of anguish to admire you", I don't believe it has an official English translation though). Another book involving a famous romantic poet - this time it's the Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi - but the funny thing is that it's told in the form of a diary written by his (real) brother, and it seems pretty blatant it's a story about... lycanthropy. It's a genuine, not shlocky but actually written with stunningly accurate XIX century prose, book about Giacomo Leopardi - a gloomy, nerdy, hunchback poet whose core philosophy was built upon how much of an evil bitch Nature is to its creatures and who likely died a virgin younger than 40 - dealing with a werewolf. Or /being/ a werewolf, I'm not sure yet. Make of that what you will.
