Lol the Venn Diagram between what I've read and what this sub would like is mostly non-existent. xD

I could probably rec Not Even Bones by Rebecca Shaeffer. It's about a girl whose mom kills zannies (humanoid monsters) and the daughter dissects them for purchase. It's rather interesting so far. I've been reading the comic version on webtoon.
