*Books* (web serials in a different comment):

Glynn Stewart: 30 or so books of spaaaaace operaaaaaaah milSF across his various serieses plus a fantasy trilogy about goblins. They're exactly what it says on the tin. Well-realized pulp. A lot of this is at least a little bit character driven, which is nice. The math checks out and with the exception of some of his earlier books not considering all of the cool things you can do if you travel FTL, he covers all the usual ground and avoids the usual mistakes.

*Martha Wells, Network Effect*. A murderbot novel! I love murderbot! Aww, who's a precious terrifying terminator who just wants to hang out with his dumb take-too-many-risks science friends and watch anime. Murderbot is! Seriously, Murderbot is funny but also a great exploration of what it means to be a person, a friend, a teammate, and an AI.

*Jim Hines, the Libriomancer series*: what if librarian nerd book magic. As a nerd book kind of guy, yes, I loved it. Great for people who, like me, obsess over optimizing "if you could pull items out of books, what's your best option for self-defense".

*Emma Bull's War for the Oaks*, courtesy of my book club: wow, there are so many things that I only knew as tropes that originated here, and it was really good, too! This is recommend to folks who have a deep connection with rock (as in, the music genre) or who want to read the originator for a huge array of urban-fantasy tropes.

*Bujold, The Physicians of Vilnoc*: too on the nose, TOO ON THE NOSE. Also, it had basically no Penric-being-Penric. He doesn't even shit-talk his God once. *Masquerade in Lodi*, on the other hand, was fantastic and extremely Penric, so that was nice. These are both quite in-the-head books; they're in a way both whodunnits, though the first one is not a murder, it's a plague.

*Jo Walton: Lent, Lifelode, Or What You Will*. She's so utterly amazing. I don't even like art museums and she makes me want to visit art museums. How does she even do that? Also, she writes Catholicism, genuine full-faith Catholicism, better than anyone I've ever read. Recommended to anyone who enjoys books that have philosophy in them. Seriously, Jo Walton is the queen of that.

*Adrian Tchaikovsky: Redemption Blade*. "OK, we killed Sauron... what now?" really good. Really really good. Great grappling with coping with what was lost in the war and what war costs the people and the persons.

*Mary Robinette Kowal: The Relentless Moon* came out, it's set sort of at the same time as another book in her historical-fiction space race series but completely separate plot. She writes this alternative history with such amazing grace, humanity as humanity warts and wonders and all. To some degree it's a whodunnit, to some degree it's a journey into the past (an alternate, very grounded in history past). This series is extremely emotionally wrenching to me, very good at plucking my heartstrings.

*T Kingfisher AKA Ursula Vernon: **A Paladin's Grace* (superb) and *A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking* (OMG AMAZING). The former hits all of the usual Ursula Vernon "sit down and shut up and let me show you how Paladins should work" buttons that I love so much, and the latter is an excellent look into how to optimize a rather unusual and weak-seeming magic... and also how you can have a child stepping up to be the hero without having them abandoned by their caregivers.

*Seanan McGuire*: Between the October Daye books, the InCryptid books, and the Wayward Children books, that's like thirty books. Plus a standalone about cheerleaders. Seanan McGuire has a thing for cheerleading. The InCryptid books feature science-minded, thoughtful characters and also the protagonist (of the first two). Of all McGuire's works I'd recommend them for y'all.

*Tamsyn Muir's Harrow the Ninth*: I literally don't go a week without thinking about this book and I read it back in August. Obviously you should read Gideon the Ninth first, but this is probably my highest-emotional-impact book of 2020. Necromancers in space, sure, but also "How do people break in different ways and how do they manage to keep moving forwards".

*Katherine Addison, The Angel of the Crows*: Yet another delightful retelling of Sherlock Holmes in a supernatural setting. Yay! It's... Sherlock Holmes-y. What's not to love.

*Mike Brooks, Rites of Passage (WH40K)*: A decent read, but it would have been a better book in literally any other setting, because WH40K is absolute fucking garbage as a setting. I mention this only because it lets me shit-talk WH40K as a setting, which I literally never get tired of doing.

*Elizabeth Bear, Machine*: I fucking love this setting, it's so beautifully at the exact most optimistic edge of the realism space. This book was great! Sort-of-transhumanist hard-SF. While there's plenty of cyberpunk out there, it's rare to see something go hard on the solarpunk side of things, and I'd say this (and Ancestral Night) / The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (and its sequels; not by the same author as this book) are a rarity in taking that approach. Highly recommended; not all science fiction has to be about pewpew-my-engines-go-this-fast-and-my-missiles-go-that-fast.

*S. L. Huang, the Cas Russell books*: God, Russell is such an ass, but her friends are great and math-as-superpower is great.

*Andrew Rowe: How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* is a litRPG critique/sendup of Zelda, and was an entertaining read.

*Diane Duane*: I'm working through the Young Wizards series. Extremely fun. Mentioned because my introduction to the series came from here.

*Graydon Saunders, A Mist of Grit and Splinters*. This series starts off with The March North, which is a straight-up military fantasy novel that delivers a radically different setting and set of characters, which get built on with two sorcery school novels. I love, love, love these books. Warning, it's written technically in English, but hoo boy is it an engineer's English.
