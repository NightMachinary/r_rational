If you are frustrated by "the people who are better and more experienced than Catherine Foundling at politics manage to hand her a loss in a political setting," it seems likely that your concern is that the fic isn't protagonist-friendly enough rather than that it's not rational.

If you are frustrated that you, as the reader, don't understand why the Empress didn't immediately take Cat's side, I can assure you that those of us who are caught up have a much better idea of why that is.
