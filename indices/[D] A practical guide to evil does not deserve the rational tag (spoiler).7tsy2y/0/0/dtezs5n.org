Fair enough.... My post probably came off as a rant and it probably is one. But I don't really think that her mistakes are quite as plausible as you make them out to be. I enjoy characters who make mistakes, just that the mistakes seem plausible. I mean she's not making reckless mistakes that suit her personality.... That entire scene was just unadulterated stupidity.

Why didn't anyone point out that no stakes were put up in exchange for a high level military post?

Where is the tension of meeting with the most powerful people in the world, understanding that you are out of your depth so just act careful?
