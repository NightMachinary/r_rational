For what it's worth, I'm reading and enjoying the series quite a lot, but I felt like this arc here was the weakest of them. I disagree that it was poorly written, but it was a bit boring and slow and the actual pieces moving in the background are totally opaque until much later. The parts following this at the war college is also somewhat dull. If you can get through that, I do feel it picks up quite a bit.
