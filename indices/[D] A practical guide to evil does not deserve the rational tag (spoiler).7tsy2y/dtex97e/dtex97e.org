Cat is not perfect.

PGtE isn't competence porn unless you're talking about the Calamities. (And even then ...)

Praes has history in its politics.

None of these things disqualify it as a rational fic.

So Cat has emotions and blindspots, so do we all. It's the mindset she and Black bring to solving problems, that make it a rational fic. Their styles are different but they both (as well as others) try to work with the world as it is, understand it, and try to shape it to their will as effectively as possible.

They don't always succeed, but they try.
