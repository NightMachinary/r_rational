That's perfectly fine. Anything you are new to, you are expected to fall and pick yourself up and get better. But where is that tension and nervous as you get into your first ever bike?

My favorite character is Ninefingers from first law and he is basically a gigantic failure, achieving almost nothing of what he wanted to and ending up worse off that he began the book with. While I don't expect that level of writing but surely there needs to be a balance.

Where is the nervousness of meeting the most powerful for a game you ate most ill sorted for? What's up with the lack of any stakes from one side?
