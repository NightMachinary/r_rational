A Practical guide to evil is /testably/ rational. I held the same opinion as you, but another poster convinced me it was rational by using the internal logic of the APGtE world to make testable predictions about the upcoming events in the APGtE world, of which a sufficient number came true to convince me that APGtE is rational.
