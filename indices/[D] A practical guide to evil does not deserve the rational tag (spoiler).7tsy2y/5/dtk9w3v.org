Cat is a realpolitik idiot, but a savant at governance. Nobles can dance around her, but she has terrifying ability at surrounding herself with loyal underlings and powerful patrons.

Also, book 1 /ends/ with a mock battle. Heiress is still kicking by /end of book 3/. Of course Cat will have to lose some.

--------------

Blow by blow:

Cat gets baited by Akua becase baiting is to Akua what fighting dirty is to Cat. If Akua took on Cat in, say, a fistfight, and lost, you wouldn't berate Akua for being bad at fighting dirty. Cat has character flaws, Akua seized on them. Sometimes you loose.

The wager isn't stupid, because Cat's specialty is beating the odds (for a given definition of odds.)

And the Empress doesn't care, for reasons which are apparent, and reasons will become apparent in book 3; indeed many of the Legions are already headed by Wasteland noblility.

And no, the wager isn't heads-i-win-tails-you-lose, because it specifies that if Cat /loses/, she's fucked. Battles can be won, lost, or stalemated. (And besides, Cat is /named/ which makes her worth twenty soldiers.)

Akua is /not/ a civilian. Don't you think Wasteland nobility are trained in the art of war?

Is it unfair? sure. Cat will deal.

That adresses your /points/, the rest is anger-driven rambling, which I will not address.

You obviously care about Cat. So take a break and come back. Worm, APGTE, and other long-form, high-intensity web serials were never meant to be read in one sitting, or even binged extensively.
