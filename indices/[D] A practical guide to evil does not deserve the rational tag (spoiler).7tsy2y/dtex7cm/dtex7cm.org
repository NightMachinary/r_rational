Man, it's almost as if they're in a world that literally runs on tropes, and Cat's an inexperienced Squire new to her Name whose entire character revolves around dragging people down to her level and beating them there, being manipulated by various nobles and Named far more experienced/powerful than her. Gee, she really took a thematically appropriate loss there, didn't she, considering EVERYTHING SHE IS AND THE WORLD IS AND-

If the story infuriates you that's fine, you don't have to read it, but a rational story doesn't mean that people make mistakes. It means that they make understandable mistakes, that the rules of the world are consistent, etc. /Characterization is not bad writing/. Bad writing would be having the inexperienced girl with anger problems and a severe dislike of authority walk into the Tower totally unprepared and deftly sidestep the net of plots, jibes, and baiting thrown at her because rational.

Also, the story makes no claims to being rational. That honour is bestowed entirely by the readers, who post it here.
