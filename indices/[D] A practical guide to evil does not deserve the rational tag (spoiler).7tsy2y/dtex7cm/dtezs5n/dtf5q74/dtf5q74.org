For what it's worth, you just aren't seeing the whole picture. Neither is Cat, so that's alright.

Malicia had decent political reasons to not directly oppose the bet made by a Named who is a daughter of her strongest political rival, but she did shift the odds ever so slightly in Cat's favor. Bet you didn't even notice, but it's revealed a few chapters later.

Black is a cunning son of a bitch too-if things went too out of hand he'd have intervened directly, but as is he probably just considers this training. Plus, you'll note he (having presumably predicted something of this sort) insured the bet would be pointless even if lost-all he has to do is say "alright, Akua can have 15-th legion, but then I guess noone will mind if I give also-currently-nonexistant 14-th to Catherine? Such shame, we weren't going to assemble 15-th in the next 30 years either, guess Akua will have to wait a while to command."

Finally, Names have minor mind-altering affects on people. It's an observable effect that is often mentioned later on. While it doesn't force anyone into any action, it does make it harder for Squire to resist political fuckups against Heiress.
