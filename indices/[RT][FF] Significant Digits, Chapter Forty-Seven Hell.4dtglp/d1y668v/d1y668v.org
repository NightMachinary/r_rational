Interesting. I am surprised by how little discussion this gets, here. I wonder how much of it is due to the fact that it's just more alive on [[/r/aih][r/aih]], versus how much that at this point, the story is less overtly rational (just as HPMOR was less overtly rational towards its end, and much more about plot; this was not a subtle criticism).
