Sort of a rush-job chapter to get us back up to speed after a month skip.

Akua's separation of personality might be the means of betrayal, though. Cat's questions might be being asked to one and not the other. I doubt Diabolist would tip her hand so early, but maybe Akua would.

It's generally agreed on this subreddit that Akua will take the Mantle of Winter and we'll get Cat with a Name again, while I tend to agree, Cat is still clenching her teeth about Liesse. How does the Queen of Winter make up for past sins? Nothing about Akua, Diabolist or Winter suggest to me that it'll be a peaceful abdication.
