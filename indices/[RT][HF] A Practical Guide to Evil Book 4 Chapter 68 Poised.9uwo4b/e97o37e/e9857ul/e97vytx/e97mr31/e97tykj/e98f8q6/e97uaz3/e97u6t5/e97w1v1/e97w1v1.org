The sigil-holders apparently took the oaths and may have been granted fae titles; as Akua now calls them the Peerage. Though I do agree that forcing Mighty into service like that seems worryingly villainous.

Absolute positioning involved aligning specific places in Creation and Arcadia and opening a portal between them. That wasn't what she did when she stranded the Mighty or drained the lake here, she just opened a single portal to whatever part of Arcadia corresponds to this area and then closed it again.
