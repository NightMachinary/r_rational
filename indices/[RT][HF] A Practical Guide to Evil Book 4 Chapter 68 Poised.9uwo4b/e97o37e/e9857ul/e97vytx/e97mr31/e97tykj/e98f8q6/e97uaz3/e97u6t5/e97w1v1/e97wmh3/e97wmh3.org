  as Akua now calls them the Peerage
#+end_quote

This actually isn't stated. Akua calls the titled Drow the Peerage, but all we know of who those Drow are is that it includes "Soln and its fellows". How many of its fellows? Your guess is as good as mine. How did Soln end up oathed and titled? Your guess is as good as mine. Was there any change in protocols with the Drow who didn't originally sign up by choice? You get the idea.

  Though I do agree that forcing Mighty into service like that seems worryingly villainous.

Add onto this that there's a single obvious failure point for the Drow - the oaths - and it gets even more worrying. We've been told how obvious failure points tend to fail at just the wrong moment, even if we haven't really seen it happen.

  she just opened a single portal to whatever part of Arcadia corresponds to this area and then closed it again.
#+end_quote

This potentially makes it difficult/impossible to get the lake back /out/ of Arcadia like she thinks she can (if the other side is, say, a hill/incline or even just flat land)

But throwing mountains and volcanoes on her enemies is definitely the sort of thing that absolute positioning would be used for. Hell, she threw a /lake/ onto her enemies just a few chapters ago, the exact act that was shown to require absolute positioning.
