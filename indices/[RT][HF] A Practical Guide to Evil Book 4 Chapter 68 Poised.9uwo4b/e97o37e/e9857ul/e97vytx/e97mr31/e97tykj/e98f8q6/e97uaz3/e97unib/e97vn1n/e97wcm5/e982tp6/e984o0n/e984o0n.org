Cat, Larat and now Akua all can create gates to and from Arcadia, with some degree of "aiming" to the other side and precise control of where the gate appears on whichever side they are currently sitting on, this we already know and was established. Larat can make the largest gates, with Akua second and Cat trailing behind, IIRC.
