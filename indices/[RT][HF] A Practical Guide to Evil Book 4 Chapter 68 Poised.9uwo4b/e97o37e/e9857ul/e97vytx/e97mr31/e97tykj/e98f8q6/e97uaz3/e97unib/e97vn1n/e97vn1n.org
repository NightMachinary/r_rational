Perhaps I should have been clearer, she doesn't need to be able to open a portal at a specific place such as a particular lake like before, due to the volume of water she just needs to be able to open a portal with an accuracy smaller than a province.

I believe that it was never stated absolute positioning required anything specific to Hierophant, he merely guided Cat and provided the bowl of water. There's nothing to suggest that he couldn't be replaced by a mage of similar knowledge such as Akua. Plus for all we know Masego left the bowl with Cat.

Youve also got to consider that Cat is much more in tune with her mantle now and can shove the side effects in to hindred or thousands of Drow.
