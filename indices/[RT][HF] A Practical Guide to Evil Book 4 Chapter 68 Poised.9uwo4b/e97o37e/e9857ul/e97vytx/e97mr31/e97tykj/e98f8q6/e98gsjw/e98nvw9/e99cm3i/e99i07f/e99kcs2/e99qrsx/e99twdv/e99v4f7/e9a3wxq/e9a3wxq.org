  stuck in the mindset that Night can only be used for specific spells,

I mean, looking at the diversity of powers that Mighty Urulan alone displayed in, like, two minutes and you can see the crazy versatility of it, and that's before you add in some of the other Secrets we've glimpsed

Plus there's been a Big deal made about how close Winter and the Night are, with tricks already being converted from one system to the other, and Gate making is a Winter thing...

  (fwiw, I think that they can only quickly learn skills from other Night users, since a given fae has no Night to harvest. but your point stands regardless)
#+end_quote

Actually, Night can be harvested from non-Drow too:

#+begin_quote
  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

  Narrative causality doesn't interfere in quite the same way (see: Akua & the monster thread last book)
#+end_quote

This is funny, because I was going to point to the Akua fight as an example of the significance of narrative fights in Evil vs Evil fights - literally every segment of that fight revolved very explicitly around stories. There was the monster/trial/pivot layout, the mentor in danger, Black's (seemingly) dangerous last-minute gamble, Akua's story based triumph over Cat in Arcadia, and then finally the villain's monster breaking its leash.

And now here we have Cat making decisions of the sort that appear in chapter quotes (hell, I think at least a few of those decisions actually /do/ mirror chapter quotes). She monologued about her inevitable win, she locked the Drow in what she thought was an inescapable death trap, she's making an unwilling army of monsters bound to her though magic, she's using the titles that she was afraid would have story repercussions, breaking truces, using doomsday weapons, and so on. This is the sort of classic Evil behaviour we've been warned about.

And, back to the Drow, they were locked in /Arcadia/, the place where story triumphs over all. I mean, look at what Black said last time Cat dragged someone there during a villain fight:

  “Arcadia was a mistake,” he told me, returning to ignoring Akua. “You won a greater comparative advantage in capacity, but in Arcadia narrative matters most of all. You lacked the necessary weight to win, Catherine. In the future, consult further than Hierophant. His lack of interest in stories is a glaring weakness.”
