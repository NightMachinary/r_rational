Neither of these chapters dealt with what happened with the seven sigil-holders post chapter 67, and Ivah's interlude was an extra chapter that's not even part of the main story.

Cat set up a classic evil situation at the end of 67, with monologues and death traps she walked away from and truce-breaking and ultimatums about joining her, and then somewhere before 68 Soln (and maybe some unknown number of the other 6) was inducted into Cat's peerage. "How did that happen?", you might ask. Maybe they got cold and asked to be let out? Despite how environmental hazards far deeper into Winter have never been shown to worry even far weaker beings than these seven Drow?

What else happened here? Are there any Drow wandering around Arcadia that have vowed revenge and stumbled into a story, as those in Arcadia are wont to do? No clue. Is there anything different going on with the oaths of these Drow who, unlike the rest, were /forced/ into oath-bound slavery against their will? Maybe we'll find out later.

And now Cat has dealt with these seven godlike figures, whose strength and power were built up over several chapters to the point where each one individually was a deadly threat, almost entirely off-screen and increased her military power almost exponentially.

Also she's leapt from struggling against the weakest sigil-holder in a nowhere-city to the point where she is now single-handily sacking an entire city three times the size of Lotow with powers that have come out of nowhere.

She's had the ability to open gates for something like a book and a half now, and has never so much as /mentioned/ the ability to cut things with them before 67. Was she always capable of this, but somehow never thought it would be useful before now? Has she been secretly training off-screen and just never brought this up or hinted at it on-screen? Did she accidentally cut something recently and go "wow, this is neat, this sure would have been useful previously"?

And she can also now pull off absolute positioning without either Masego or the Observatory and can drop volcanoes and mountains and lakes on her enemies, despite how difficult this was shown to be previously. Huh?

And not only was there no build up or explanation given to this, she's not even mentioned this increase in her capabilities after the fact? Apparently no-one is surprised by the incredible power-up Cat received?
