Could Akua be removing her memories of her plan to betray Cat, so when she is questioned she can be honest? Maybe have one of her drow return her memories from time to time, just enough for her to plan what next step is necessary. If anybody is good enough to make a plan that involves the manipulation of Cat, drows, and Akua, it could be Akua herself.
