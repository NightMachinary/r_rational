Yeah, I'm not to into that idea either, I haven't been keeping up too much lately (mostly because I'm waiting for some chapters to build up, I check these comments cause I enjoy spoilers) but I'm not a fan of Cat losing a power that she rightfully earned, I like the idea of her harnessing the power to her will more, changing it in such a way that it conforms to her desires, which has always been Cat's brand of evil.

My pet theory on how her plot with Akua is that at some point their will be a merger, similar to what happened with the mantle, she will somehow merge with Akua and gain all her memories, which would make her better at magic and politics, both of which she dearly needs, but not change too fundamentally as a result.

I have had this theory ever since Akua managed to weave herself into the mantle, it might however happen in such a way that conforms to the above suggestion, Akua makes off with the mantle and to get it back Cat has to take her in with it, this could result in a name, something defined by the act of bending the power of a god to your will, rather than just having it.
