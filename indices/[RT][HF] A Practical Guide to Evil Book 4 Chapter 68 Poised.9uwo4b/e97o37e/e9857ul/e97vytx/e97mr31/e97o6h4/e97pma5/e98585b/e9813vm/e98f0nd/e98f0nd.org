That is a bit of an overlap, my assumption of Heirophant, and most other mage named, is that he is doing it with magic, not name magic, but actual sorcery as it is defined in the world. I believe this because if it isn't true than mage names are complete bullshit.

Heirophant can use the magic to imitate a god's (lower case intentional) action so long as he has /witnessed/, my idea for cat is more domineering than that, she would be an actual threat to all Gods, including above and bellow, and I say this because the story has to have an end, and the most conclusive end I can think of is if Cat manages to tell the Gods to go fuck themselves and leave her continent alone, a conclusion in which she would need the ability to kill and utilise the power of gods for, because the best reason I can think of for them to leave her and her stuff be is if they are /terrified/ of her.
