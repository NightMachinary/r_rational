I wasnt looking at draining anything in my examples. Dropping a mountain into someone's harbor would make it too shallow to be used by bigger ships.

Rivers can be ruined by going upstream, gouging out a different river course and then dumping that soil & rock into the old river. Even just dumping random mountains at various points would stop trading in it's tracks.
