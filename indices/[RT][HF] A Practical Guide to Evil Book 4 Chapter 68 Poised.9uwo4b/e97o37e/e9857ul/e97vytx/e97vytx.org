Thus Cat invented Sim-Earth, though forever after her people wondered wtf "Earth" means.

Seriously, this means she can reshape massive amounts of terrain very quickly. Valleys, mountains, creating or filling in mountain passes. She is become the changer of worlds.

In the real world geography controls far more than people realize. Cat doesnt need an army any longer to destroy empires. She can fill in harbors to uselessness. Reroute rivers important to trade. Bury or steal forests.

I am in awe of the possibilities...and amused at the idea of calernian farmers trying to irrigate with a river filled with underdark leviathans.
