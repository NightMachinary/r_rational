  This actually isn't stated. Akua calls the titled Drow the Peerage, but all we know of who those Drow are is that it includes "Soln and its fellows". How many of its fellows? Your guess is as good as mine. How did Soln end up oathed and titled? Your guess is as good as mine. Was there any change in protocols with the Drow who didn't originally sign up by choice? You get the idea.

Yes? I'm not sure what your point is here. You're right, we know very little of what happened with the sigil-holders. All I was saying was that at least some of them appear to have been given Winter titles.

  Add onto this that there's a single obvious failure point for the Drow - the oaths - and it gets even more worrying. We've been told how obvious failure points tend to fail at just the wrong moment, even if we haven't really seen it happen
#+end_quote

In fairness the reason we haven't seen it happen much is because Black taught her to avoid single points of failure from day one. Although there are two examples I can think of-Cat's plan in the war games back in Book One and the lake-dropping at the start of this book.

  This potentially makes it difficult/impossible to get the lake back out of Arcadia like she thinks she can (if the other side is, say, a hill/incline or even just flat land)
#+end_quote

The lake is described as being half the size of Daoine. It's not going to drain away any time soon

#+begin_quote
  But throwing mountains and volcanoes on her enemies is definitely the sort of thing that absolute positioning would be used for. Hell, she threw a lake onto her enemies just a few chapters ago, the exact act that was shown to require absolute positioning.
#+end_quote

True. Hopefully we'll get an explanation in the next few chapters.
