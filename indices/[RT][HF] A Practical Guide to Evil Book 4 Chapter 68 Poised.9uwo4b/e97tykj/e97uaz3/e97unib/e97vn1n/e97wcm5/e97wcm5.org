  Perhaps I should have been clearer, she doesn't need to be able to open a portal at a specific place such as a particular lake like before, due to the volume of water she just needs to be able to open a portal with an accuracy smaller than a province.

Yes. On creation side. On Arcadia side she's got to put it somewhere it can remain as a lake if she wants to pull it back out again. Or, if she wants to drop a mountain on her enemies, she's got to open a portal to a specific mountain, and then above her enemies.

This is all approximately as complex as what she was doing in the Battle of the Camps, where she opened a portal to a specific lake and then roughly above the armies she wanted to destroy, and that instance was treated as a huge deal.

  I believe that it was never stated absolute positioning required anything specific to Hierophant, he merely guided Cat

He also explicitly used magic to help the process along. And saying that Masego can easily be replaced is something of a leap when he's one of the most powerful mages around and he's doing one of the larger rituals we've seen in the series, with Cat temporarily embracing the perspective of a god

I'll agree that if anyone could replace him here, then it'd be Akua (even without a proper name of her own)... but there's also no evidence that Akua is doing that? And if she was, then it'd be a fairly huge deal anyway, if for different reasons?

  Plus for all we know Masego left the bowl with Cat.
#+end_quote

As a reminder, that "bowl of water" was a link to the observatory, which was a huge investment of time and resources and is presumably less accessible from the Everdark. If Cat even has the bowl, which has never been stated. And where would she carry a bowl for months on end anyway? Do you think she took it to the Dead King?

#+begin_quote
  Youve also got to consider that Cat is much more in tune with her mantle now and can shove the side effects in to hindred or thousands of Drow.

And if this is something that lets her make super powered portals, it'd be nice to have some reference to that in the text, rather than glossing over what's arguably the biggest power boost Cat has gotten thus far.
