  was a big deal to do because of the size of the gate.

Not quite. Cat and Masego, even working together, required the Observatory to pull it off. The observatory which is an incredible tool for scrying, and was an incredible sink of resources to build.

The fact that they needed an expensive scyring tool points towards this being something of a precision act.

  They did this not by creating a traditional gate but overlaying the fae over creation, which I guess is an entirely different thing than gating
#+end_quote

The event was still described as a gate opening up over the armies, several times. The fact that Cat called out the process as somewhat distinct from gating just reinforces how difficult a task it's meant to be.

#+begin_quote
  Cat can do the same thing by herself with her new control and grasp of her powers

I'd buy this more if cat had made a comment literally anywhere about how her capability with gates has expanded, instead of her just receiving one of her biggest power ups seemingly in the background.
