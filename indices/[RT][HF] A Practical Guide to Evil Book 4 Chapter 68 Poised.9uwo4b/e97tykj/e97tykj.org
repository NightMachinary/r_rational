  Great Strycht had proved as much of a wonder as Great Lotow, in its own way.

Have we just skipped over what happened in Lotow then? Because things were not settled there, and the exact way things shook out seems important to know. If Cat's going the classic evil route of kidnapping people and forcing them into her magically bound army, then the details are quite important. Especially if it's literally the first time she's doing it. Outside the serial it lets us know what to expect with this strategy when she does it off screen later on, and inside the universe of the Guide it determines how she's able to move onward to Strycht and the inner cities and is a fairly important turning point within her own narrative.

Like, are the sigil holders still in Winter? Did they all humbly agree to sign up? Did some of them wander off in search of a way out? Did they try and fight Cat? What's the deal with the seven demigods who were individually a threat to Cat and had a great reason to band together?

This chapter has no information, except that Cat's gone to Strycht, and a passing comment that Soln is now with Cat.

What? When did this become an option? First she's apparently secretly had the ability to use her portals to cut through things the whole time, and now she can drop mountains on people and steal cities? This is a crazy amount of power escalation coming out of almost nowhere.

Not too mention that she's apparently now capable of using Absolute Positioning, which was set up as an incredibly difficult, dangerous task, without Masego. She's not even done any practice or training that we've seen.

I mean, Cat's gotten a lot of power ups over the series (an awful, /awful/, lot) but this is one of the biggest so far and has also happened without any commentary or explanation?

What have we learnt about raising death flags Cat?

  Night could be taken without killing

Did we know this? It feels like the kind of thing that could have consequences for Drow society.

God damn Akua. I occasionally find myself liking you, but then you keep dropping things like this. Fantastic character though.
