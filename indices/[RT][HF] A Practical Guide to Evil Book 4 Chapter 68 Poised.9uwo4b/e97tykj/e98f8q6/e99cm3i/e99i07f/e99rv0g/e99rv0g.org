  They're culturally incapable to working together because of the Night.

I think you might have missed the part about cabals.

  Like how? If it is not in the Night then it's not known to them.

I listed a few [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9uwo4b/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_68/e99qrsx/][here]].

  Did you forget that Cat and company can travel though Arcadia safely only because of her deal with the Fae Queen?
#+end_quote

Cat, hakram and Apprentice were walking through Arcadia back before they had a deal and /while activley at war with the fae/ just fine, and this was when Cat was the squire and far weaker she or the Drow are now.

Will survived wandering around for six months on his own, back when he was roughly equal to cat circa book one.

Black, notable in part for his relative weakness, used it for fast travel.

And Juniper/Cat's only concern about sending scouts into Arcadia back at the start of book 3 was time dilation, and they talked about how they'd send an army of normal soldiers in if they knew it wouldn't escalate the situation.

And Arcadia itself is so vulnerable to stories that Cat literally just had to say, in a hesitant voice, "you'll never get away with this" to utterly upend a fight with a powerful Fae who was easily destroying her. What do you think happens if one of the Drow, after being monolouged too and locked in what's meant to be an inescapable death trap, say "I will escape and have my revenge"? Because personally I think things might start looking like the Count of Monte Christo.
