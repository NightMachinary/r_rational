  at having a dramatic showdown with the 7 leaders would be important if it were the climax of the arc. But the 7 were explicitly said to be small fish in a bigger pond

We spent a couple of chapters building up just how strong the weakest sigil-holder in Lotow was, and how the 7 leaders were individually a threat to Cat even before they had a great reason to band together. Then they were put in Arcadia, where they had a whole host of options for getting out, and probably weren't in an incredible amount of danger themselves.

But leave aside the more logistical concerns and look at the narrative: Cat is abducting people, forcing them into magical service, and I'm pretty sure we've had chapter quotes about this exact situation. She was also monologuing about her inevitable win before locking them in an "inescapable" trap and walking away. Knowing how this played out is important if this is going to be standard operating procedure for her, exactly so it can be glossed over in the future.
