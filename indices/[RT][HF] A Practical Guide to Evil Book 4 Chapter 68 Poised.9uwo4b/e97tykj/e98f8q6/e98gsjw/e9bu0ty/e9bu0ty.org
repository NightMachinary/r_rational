The entire point of the Under Dark segment is Cat picking up an army.

We just brushed over her picking up to seven demigods who were each an individual threat to her and increasing her military power almost exponentially.

How did Cat get them? Well,at the end of 67 she set up a classic evil situation - with monologues and death traps she walked away from and truce-breaking and ultimatums about joining her - by stranding them at the edge of Winter and then somewhere before 68 Soln (and maybe some unknown number of the other 6) was inducted into Cat's peerage.

Why did the sigil-holders give in? Maybe they got cold and asked to be let out? Despite how environmental hazards far deeper into Winter have never been shown to worry even far weaker beings than these seven Drow? Will was fine in Arcadia for months back in book one, Black was using Arcadia to portal around with in book 2, Juniper and cat debated sending normal soldiers into Arcadia in book 3, and then Cat, Hakram, and Masego (as Apprentice) walked to the heart of winter without so much as mentioning the cold.

That's without getting into all the ways /out/ of Arcadia that have been set up: with permanent gates existing , or using sorcery, or finding a fae to do it. Or how vulnerable Arcadia is to stories and the set up Cat is handing them on a silver platter.

But let's move on. Cat's also leapt from struggling against the weakest sigil-holder in a nowhere-city to the point where she is now single-handily sacking an entire city three times the size of Lotow with powers that have come out of nowhere.

She's had the ability to open gates for something like a book and a half now, and has never so much as mentioned the ability to cut things with them before 67. Was she always capable of this, but somehow never thought it would be useful before now? Has she been secretly training off-screen and just never brought this up or hinted at it on-screen? Did she accidentally cut something recently and go "wow, this is neat, this sure would have been useful previously"?

And she can also now pull off absolute positioning without either Masego or the Observatory and can drop volcanoes and mountains and lakes on her enemies, despite how difficult this was shown to be previously. Huh?

And not only was there no build up or explanation given to perhaps the single greatest expansion in Cat's power, she's not even mentioned this increase in her capabilities after the fact? Apparently no-one is surprised by the incredible power-up Cat received?

And then there's the story stuff going on here, which I've touched on. But is Cat going Classic Evil now? Monolouges and death-traps are just the tip of the iceberg. She's also enslaving a race to serve in her evil army, is chaining monsters that have both motive and means to kill her if the bindings break, is relying on the single point of failure that is the oaths, is using doomsday style weapons, is creating a court were previously she was worried about narrative consequences, is talking about pulling a dread Empress Sinastra, etc.

You can say that this a Evil vs Evil fight and so the rules don't apply (note; this was mentioned in an Extra chapter, which exists outside the story proper), but we've seen Evil on Evil before with Cat/Black and Akua and stories were critical at literally every juncture of the fight. And, perhaps more importantly, /the actions now are ones that will have consequences later/. Does cat really think that the single point of control over the monsters that hate her, the oaths, isn't going to fail at some critical juncture further down the line?

You wanted to talk about character work, right? Cat's been against classic evil methods for the entire series - why this change in motive? Cat's also been against slavery for the entire series and just recently had a big talk about how she didn't want to kill the Drow prisoners she took - why's she now okay with enslaving an entire race? Seems like a big change of heart.

It's easy to say that the plot details were glossed over for characters development, but what happens with the plot is hugely important in defining that character development. The details matter. Hell, knowing how Cat felt when Soln and whoever else bowing down to her matters a whole lot.
