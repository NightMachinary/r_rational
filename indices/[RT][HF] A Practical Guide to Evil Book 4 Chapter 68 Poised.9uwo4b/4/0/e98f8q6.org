  the exact way things shook out seems important to know.

I couldn't disagree more. Cat having a dramatic showdown with the 7 leaders would be important if it were the climax of the arc. But the 7 were explicitly said to be small fish in a bigger pond. Cat found a winning move without drawing her sword, and the implications of her choice are shown in this chapter. We don't need stilted dialogue where the antagonistic characters assert that they have no choice but to comply, followed by more stilted dialogue where Cat agrees.

Imagine that we got the update that you're asking for, where Cat pops in to Arcadia to check on her prisoners. Maybe it takes a few tries. Eventually they submit. This might be an engaging sequence of dialogue or torture porn but is there any plot-relevant information that we wouldn't otherwise discover?
