I strongly agree with this. What we're getting right now is mostly character work between Cat and Archer and Cat and Akua, as well as world-building, so it hasn't been too bad, but ultimately there's a ceiling for how much interest you can have in "Cat takes on some Strong Mighty who we've never seen before and she has no real reason to care about."
