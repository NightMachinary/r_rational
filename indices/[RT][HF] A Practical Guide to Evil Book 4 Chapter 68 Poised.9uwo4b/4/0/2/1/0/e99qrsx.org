That's fair. A few of the top of my head:

- Will went into and out of Arcadia through a set of permanent gates that exist

- Black and Warlock used Arcadia for fast travel. We don't have the full details on this, but to my best knowledge it involved Black summoning a fae to creation to open a gate into Arcadia, and then Black later finding one and coercing it to open a gate back out of Arcadia

- We've seen magical rituals involved in moving things from creation towards Arcadia

- Book three we find that any high-ranking fae can open a gate out of Arcadia. Which brings us to two sub options: 1) Eat the faerie and take it's knowledge and the Secret of Gate-Making. 2) force it to open a portal with their faerie-queen crushing strength

And what are the chances of any of these things happening, you might ask? It's Arcadia - chance doesn't mean anything.
