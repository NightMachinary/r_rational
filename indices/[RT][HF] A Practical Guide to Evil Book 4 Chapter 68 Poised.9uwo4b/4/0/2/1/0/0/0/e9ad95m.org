Ivan's knowledge of humans is poor because the Drow have been isolated from outside civilizations for millenia. But Arcadia has existed since literally before Creation, and so that knowledge isn't going to go out of date.

Add onto that that there's a significant risk factor just from escape methods /existing/ - the way Arcadia has been explained is that it's going to drop things into you if they're story relevant. Like, say, a way out of the death trap a villain just you in after proclaiming the imminentcy of their inevitable vixtory.
