Good post. I was stuck in the mindset that Night can only be used for specific spells, but there are non-Night methods of escape. (fwiw, I think that they can only quickly learn skills from other Night users, since a given fae has no Night to harvest. but your point stands regardless)

I think your objection can be handled by thinking as a DM. Sometimes plans just work. The potential failures described above require that Cat's court encounters and is defeated by the 7 Mighty. This is a direct inversion of her power, which would be an unfair trick to use as a DM against a player. Alternatively, they require that Cat knows less about her domain than her prisoners do. That is plausible if her victims were Good, but this is evil-on-Evil combat. Narrative causality doesn't interfere in quite the same way (see: Akua & the monster thread last book)

Your concern is justified, but not damning imo
