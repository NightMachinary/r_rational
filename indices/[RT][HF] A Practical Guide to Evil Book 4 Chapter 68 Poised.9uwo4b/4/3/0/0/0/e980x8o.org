  Yes? I'm not sure what your point is here. You're right, we know very little of what happened with the sigil-holders. All I was saying was that at least some of them appear to have been given Winter titles.

Right, I think we're on the same page here as my point is exactly that - we know very little of what happened with the sigil-holders, which is an important thing for us to know about for the reasons I mentioned.

  The lake is described as being half the size of Daoine. It's not going to drain away any time soon
#+end_quote

But put it out on flat land and it's not going to form a lake, so much as spread out into a very thin marshland-looking thing - and that's not exactly conducive to getting the water /out/ with portals, because it wouldn't drain neatly. She just talked about the difficulty of pulling all the water out of the lake due to irregularities in the topography, and that's happening in what was already the basin of a lake.

I mean it could work, I guess, as there are a lot of unknowns in play here. But it doesn't really matter either way? My point is that Cat can can apparently do absolute positioning on her own now, and what happens with the lake here doesn't really change that either way when she's talking about dropping lakes/mountains/volcanoes from Arcadia onto her enemies.

  In fairness the reason we haven't seen it happen much is because Black taught her to avoid single points of failure from day one. Although there are two examples I can think of-Cat's plan in the war games back in Book One and the lake-dropping at the start of this book.
#+end_quote

I think a big part of the reason is that Cat tends to avoid /plans/ full stop and go for a more improvisational approach to problem solving.

Although the specific ones I was thinking of were the more recent plans from Juniper and Black against the Crusades, which had big obvious failure points that triggered nothing (even though there was explicit discussion of the need to avoid such plans right beforehand). But that's straying from the point here.

#+begin_quote
  True. Hopefully we'll get an explanation in the next few chapters.
#+end_quote

Fingers crossed. Personally my preferences run more towards getting foreshadowing and setup happening /before/ important things occur, but I'm certainly not going to say no to an explanation.
