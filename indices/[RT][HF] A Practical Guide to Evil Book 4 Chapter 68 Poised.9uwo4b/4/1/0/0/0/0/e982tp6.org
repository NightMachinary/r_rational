From what I understand The absolute positioning was a big deal to do because of the size of the gate. It was so large that is created a swamp after a few seconds, 5 iirc. They did this not by creating a traditional gate but overlaying the fae over creation, which I guess is an entirely different thing than gating.

Draining the drow lake isn't as difficult, just put one portal in a really deep spot and the other end over a natural basin in winter.

So I guess what I'm saying is that Cat can do the same thing by herself with her new control and grasp of her powers, but at a different rate than absolute positioning. The math and time required to drain a province sized lake over several days is a question of fluid dynamics that I can't answer, but in a word, absolute positioning just makes it happen near instantly by comparison.
