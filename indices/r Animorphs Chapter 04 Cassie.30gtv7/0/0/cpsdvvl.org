I think the biggest one is: Cassie might have given away the fact that she's not an Andalite after failing to kill the Yeerk possessing her mother but then going back screaming at her father.

Of course, it's possible that the Yeerks will rationalize this as "the andalite is a really really good actor who never breaks character."

But geez, even discounting this, Cassie screwed up really big this chapter because of her character flaw and lost both of her dad and a lot of strategic information as a result. I wonder how the animorphs are going to get out of this one.

Also, Rachel was really, really stupid last chapter and now the Yeerks are prepared. Yikes.
