Yeah, but I assumed by break people usually mean "fracture" or "broken but everything is still essentially in place"

I wasn't sure whether or not it was possible to snap your shinbone in half such that it's actually /bent/, and walk again. But I guess it probably is, especially if the doctors set it back in place quickly enough.
