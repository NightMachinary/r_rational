Wow! This is getting intense quickly. The Animorphs now have a difficult choice to make: Try to maintain the illusion of being Andilites and hide their numbers and identities with high risk of their families being converted soon, or take their families and flee- probably revealing their identities and putting themselves on the defensive. I wonder if they can find that magical hidden valley in this AU.
