  Seti seems more to be Championing individually but not societally powerful people...

This is intentional! I thought about if I should reply or not (half of the comments in these threads are usually done by me lol, so it may squash discussion), but I figured it's okay to do so here. At this point in the story, we don't even know what being a champion really means, and Seti picked his topic on an event that happened at the exam without thinking through what impacts they imply, and may be more emotional than logical.

Stay tuned for more :o
