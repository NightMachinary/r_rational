With floods you get fertile soil, volcanoes have that too and a lot of rock. Not sure about earthquake faults, I like to think the minerals are easy to find. None of these things happen too often and their destructiveness is inversely correlated with rarity so there aren't huge disincentives to hide.

Given Seti's description, I wouldn't be surprised if these gates promoted the growth of nature and since they rarely opened, people set up farms and cities grew from that.
