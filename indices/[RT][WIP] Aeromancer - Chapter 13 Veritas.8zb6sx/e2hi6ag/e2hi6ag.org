Nice chapter! Covered a lot of ground without being overlong.

Why do people live near primal gates? Shouldn't they be remote installations manned by Shepherds there to raise the alarm and hold the line until sufficient force can be dispatched? (Assuming the Shepherds aren't big enough to simply man all of them sufficiently to resist anything below A-rank).

Natalie seemed a little... underdeveloped? Her injunction against Cassie seemed like it happened just to give Seti the opportunity to act as a Champion. She's probably just a one-off character, so there wasn't much of a chance to develop her specifically, but it could haven't been laid out as circumstantial. If, say, Seti found it perplexing or hypocritical that Benediction vivamancers maintain a hardline stance against geas despite their highest ranked members employing them quite regularly, then Natalie could have come off as someone wanting to block Cassie's advancement in order to preserve Benediction's near monopoly on legitimate geas use, which would have given Seti some insight as to how and why society can marginalize even those he's seeking to Champion.

Instead, since Natalie seems to have only the straightforward motivation of wanting to prevent dangerous geas use, Seti seems more to be Championing individually but not societally powerful people who want to be able to act as they like despite other people's objections. Comes off more teenage Ayn Rand than defender of the neglected.
