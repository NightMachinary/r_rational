What does reasonable mean? Presumably you don't want us increasing the angular momentum of the planet and killing everyone, but what about tornados? Can you increase the angular momentums of spiraling winds heading in the direction of your enemies, amplifying them into terrifying tornados?

Or better yet, can you build yourself a zorb and just roll around (even uphill) by increasing it's angular momentum? You can literally be the boulder in an Indiana Jones movie, except you ignore gravity.
