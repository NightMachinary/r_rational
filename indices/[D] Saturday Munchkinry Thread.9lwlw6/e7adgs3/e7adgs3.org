Let's say that you're in a high fantasy universe, and you've gained an enchanted item that increases the angular momentum of anything reasonable (you, if you're wearing it, or, heck, a trebuchet if it's equipped to that). Specifically, this would square the mass constant in the angular momentum equation.

What would be a few imaginative and practical uses for such an item? In terms of personal weaponry and combat, just as a start?
