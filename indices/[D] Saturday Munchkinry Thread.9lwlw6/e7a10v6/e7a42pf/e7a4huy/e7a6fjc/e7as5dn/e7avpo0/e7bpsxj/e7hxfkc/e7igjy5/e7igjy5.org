  Seems like it comes dangerously close to allowing a smart character to wish for more wishes. What's preventing me from taking the genies place and interpreting all future wishes to be more in line with whatever my goals are?

The rules around informed consent make it /relatively/ hard to do that effectively. Malice will mostly result in less effective wishes rather than wildly creative misinterpretations. Also "An eternity of slavery" (or until someone else swaps with you at least) is a pretty high price for the amount of power it gets you.

(In case anyone was wondering, the wish counter is attached to the lamp, not per genie. You don't get more wishes just because someone new has swapped in for the previous genie)
