This:

  You may wish to take the place of the genie

And this:

#+begin_quote
  The Genie is approximately a standard Robin Williams grade genie. He's not malicious unless you piss him off.
#+end_quote

Seems like it comes dangerously close to allowing a smart character to wish for more wishes. What's preventing me from taking the genies place and interpreting all future wishes to be more in line with whatever my goals are?

Optionally you could even wish to be better at willfully misinterpreting what others are saying with one of your earlier wishes.
