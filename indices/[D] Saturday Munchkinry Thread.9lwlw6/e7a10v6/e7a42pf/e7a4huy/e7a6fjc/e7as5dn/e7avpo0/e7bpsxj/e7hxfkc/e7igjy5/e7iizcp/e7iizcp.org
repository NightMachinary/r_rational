I'm not suggesting becoming a genie just to torment whoever gets a hold of the lamp next (I have no interest in tormenting random people) but it should be possible to interpret their wishes in such a way that they align with whatever I want to achieve.

For example, suppose my ultimate goal is reverse climate change. With 3 wishes that seems hard to do given the limitations that you have provided, so instead I use my final wish to trade places with the genie. Now the next schmuck comes around and wishes for a billion dollars, I fulfill that wish by converting approximately 1 million kg of CO2 or other greenhouse gasses (or whatever I can get from the most contaminated 1 mile radius volume in the atmosphere) into 1 dollar bills.

Now, that does presuppose that I am willing to spent "an eternity of slavery" in order to accomplish my goals, but honestly depending on what the conditions are like inside the lamp, that doesn't sound too bad. I also don't think it would be /that/ hard to convince someone to take the same deal that I did (or arrange for my lamp to get into the hands of someone that will) once my goals are accomplished.
