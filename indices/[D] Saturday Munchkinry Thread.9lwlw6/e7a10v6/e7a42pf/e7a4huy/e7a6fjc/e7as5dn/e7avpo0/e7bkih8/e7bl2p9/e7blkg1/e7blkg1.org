  As was implicitly pointed out in a different comment, it doesn't even need to be ruled as composite to be invalidated: This wish would put the wisher well outside of the normal range of human variation, in a way that "I wish to be the best possible at X" typically would not.

The fact it would put you well outside the realm of normal variation in some regard doesn't actually matter, because it wouldn't put them /physically/ outside the realm of human variation which is what you specified.\\
They would be granted knowledge that it's perfectly possible for a person to have, it's just no human would ever have all that knowledge at once because they'd need to have more experience than people ever ordinarily get.

  For a more specific ruling on what that rule covers for skills, I guess something like "You can't be better overall than an implausible-but-not-inhuman level of natural talent and a lifetime of dedicated study would get you"
#+end_quote

This works but it's important to specify that /this is a new rule not implicit in the original rules you laid down/. Also it's not clear why you'd even bother to prohibit this, after all the person might be an amazingly good blacksmith but given it can't grant any /new/ knowledge I really doubt this is remotely world breaking.

  It wouldn't surprise me if there were a bunch of arbitrary categorisations in the rules in various places. The way this worked in tRoW was that the rules tended to get backfilled with overly specific patches when someone was playing silly buggers. Mostly because I thought it was funnier that way.

Right but I'm saying that this isn't actually patchable in a way that prevents people from exploiting this, unless somebody is trying the nearly /exact/ same wish as somebody else. Trying to go about formally categorizing knowledge in a way that corresponds even remotely with the concept of a "skill" is the sort of hard problem I suspect is on the level of say making AGI.
