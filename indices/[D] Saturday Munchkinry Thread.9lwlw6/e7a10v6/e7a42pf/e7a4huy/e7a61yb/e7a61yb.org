  if precommitment is a thing that has to happen, then...

Well, /in/ universe it's not, but out of universe I don't have the ability to grant wishes and the wishers will only be as intelligent as I can write them, so...

  Does rule 2's 'anyone' cover microorganisms?
#+end_quote

No it's specifically restricted to humans.

  Does rule 2's 'anyone' cover microorganisms? If not, I would wish for all harmful to humans microorganisms to be modified to not harm humans in a single change. If germ theory has not been invented, then a varient of that (ie 'the end of those malignant curses' or such) In scenario one, it is not a persistent magical effect, but rather a single change, and thus works even with rule three. In scenario two, it is essentially the same thing, if less informed. Either way, it will keep humanity less dead for a decent length of time. Advice with better phrasing would be appreciated, as this is just the general gist of things.

Hmm. I'm trying to rule out large-scale global effects. I'm not sure what the best restriction to put in place to prevent this solution is. Maybe some maximum area of effect? Say, no more than an area a couple of miles in diameter.

  One thing I didn't take advantage of was a noticeable lack of defence against 'meta' wishes in the main list of rules (eg, 'I wish that my future wishes were not affected by the rules of wishing'). You gave it a sort of acknowledgement before the list, but rule 8 only concerns items, when it could be altered to affect wishes as well. That would be my only qualm at a glance.

Yes these rules aren't intended to be a complete list so much as the "essential flavour" (when "rules of wishing" started the official number of rules was 5211, though obviously that's just flavour text and I didn't write down that many rules). In general the rules of wishing cannot be affected by wishes.
