  That wouldn't work because the volume of say viruses is absolutely miniscule. Better to just stick to a range limit (no more than a mile away from the caster) that way you can't have your area of effect be some planck-length thick (but wider where it needs to encompass viruses) thread that encopmpasses every human virus in existence.

Because the volume of effect rule specifies the diameter, not the total volume. i.e. it can't be more than a mile across in any direction.
