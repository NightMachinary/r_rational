Ah right I was just responding to an error in the comment I was replying to, but looking at the original post the diameter rule /somewhat/ prevents that.

#+begin_quote
  The total volume affected by the wish (including creation, destruction, modification) must be contained within a /contiguous region no more than about a mile in diameter/.

Since how exactly diameter is being measured isn't specified, you could for instance have the diameter be of a curving tube which wraps around the earth touching everything you care about but still not having more than a mile diameter at any portion.

Really that's an easy patch though, just specify that the wish measures the diameter from a single central point.
