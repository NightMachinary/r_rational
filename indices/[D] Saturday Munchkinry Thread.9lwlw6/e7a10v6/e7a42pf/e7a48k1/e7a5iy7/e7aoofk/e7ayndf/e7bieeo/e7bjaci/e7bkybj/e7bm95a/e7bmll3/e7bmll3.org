  Actually it's quite easy to rule this out: The characters in the setting have no concept of such,

They don't need modern concepts of AGI for this to be an exploit people would think of. For instance after trying some wishes and having them be denied, somebody would likely wish to create something which was able to satisfy the requirements they laid forth but wasn't technically alive by the standards of the wishing rules.

  Yes, this is kinda the ongoing premise/joke of these stories. Note though that because the rules list is dynamic it's generally pretty easy to rule out the obvious exploits as and when they come up.
#+end_quote

Well as your epilogue notes this sort of thing just doesn't work if you have intelligent characters around, also what counts as an obvious exploit is extremely relative. After all if I'm representative of the general level of effort of the comments you got then finding exploits in the rules you laid forth isn't even the sort of problem [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fhEPnveFhb9tmd7Pe/use-the-try-harder-luke][which is hard enough to require five minutes of serious thinking.]] Of course people who have these sorts of discussion on this subreddit are going to be fairly clever on average (at least if we're as clever as say [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]) thus tying back to the point you made in the epilogue.
