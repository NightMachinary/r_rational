I don't see any restriction to saying "I wish that you grant me whatever wish best satisfies my preferences" or something like that(even mor specific ones like what's the best way to get rich) , which should be at least as good as the best exploit people come up whith here.

Does that count as being a rules lawyer?

Also you can't be granted "knowledge" but can the wish implicitly do computation for you? I guess someone in a medieval setting would't be able to properly exploit that though.

Can you wish for a library whith books containing a lot of the most useful knowledge humanity has?. Or maybe just whith all existing books in your language(though It will be a problem if you can't read)

Otherwise wishing for a giant palace full of valuable things after wishing for peak intelligence and other things depending on the number of wishes seems a good option. Maybe ask whith a list of trustworthy people that will accept to work for you if you pay them/give them a home and were to find them (Someone in the world knows that information). Or detailed info on everyone on the world(just current people o magical effect), their desires , motivations etc, or maybe only people in the region so it's more manageable , but you can just ask for the whole thing ordered by where they are.

Once you have a few servants the risk of being betrayed starts to diminish. Get a few trustworthy mercenaries to protect yourself etc.

You can pretty much wish a palace as complicated as you want as long as it doesn't need magic to exist , it doesn't contain anything too difficult to make for a group of people of the time and fits on a mile.

Maybe you can even wish a city whith the palace as part of it(or copy an existing one whith a few changes) , and then start getting people to live in it .

Its difficult ,and there are lots of risks , but there is a path to becoming a local power there. You will have to bluff a lot at first ,and be very careful to avoid people just taking your palace.

And of course you would have to do it in a relatively inhabited place without local lords that will interfere.

If you are on the desert you can get the genie to make an oasis as part of the palace/city and also maybe make the surrounding desert fertile.

Btw gold is most likely not very valuable in the setting , if someone greedy and whith a bad grasp of economics IT's bound to already have wished for insane amounts of gold.

You should keep a wish(unless it bothers the genie too much) for emergencies ,since it allows you to do things like putting buildings in front of your enemies , teleporting you a mile away, destroying cities in such a way that does't kill anyone and making the weapons of an entire army in your range disappear.

If giving the lamp of whatever wish granting device to other people lets them also get whatever number of wishes ,you can get trustworthy people to use it for whatever the city needs , maybe things like creating rain in times of drought , making more houses , making them smarter ,charismatic and skilled in their job etc.

Basically the main uses seem to be buffing people matter creation , building things,and mind reading/ getting insane amounts of knowledge(either directly n your mind or in books depending on the circumstances and how much information you need)
