Hmm. I don't think the existing rules /quite/ imply that, but the rules definitely should imply that. I'll add some patches.

Edit: On reread, I think the rules prohibit that (the time limit), but you could implicitly do it by wishing for the outcome that maximised the chance of the desired outcome. I've now ruled that out.
