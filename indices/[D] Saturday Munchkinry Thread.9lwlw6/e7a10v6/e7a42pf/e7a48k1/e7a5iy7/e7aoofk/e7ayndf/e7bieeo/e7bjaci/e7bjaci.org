I wish to become a complete amalgam of all human competencies: to be the strongest human who has ever lived, to know everything that any human has ever known, to be the most conscientious human who has ever lived, to be the best human decision-maker who has ever lived, to be the most charming and socially-aware human who has ever lived, et cetera. You probably can't fit all of this in a human brain so it's totally okay if any excess gets put in some kind of library I get access too, but it had better be well-sorted and indexed so I can find whatever I'm looking for, and make sure that all of the most useful stuff just goes directly to my brain.

...wait a minute, I'm really overcomplicating this. Can't I just take Eliezer's advice and outright wish for "whatever the best thing you can provide me with is"?
