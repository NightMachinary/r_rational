  Even indirectly the wish may not harm anyone (ETA: The level of indirection here is bounded. You can use things given to you by wishes to harm people, and long chains of causality are fine. This is mostly a cap on things like "I wish for an anvil to appear over their head").

So, does this rule prevent harm through idiocy and ignorance? I'm thinking about what happens if people start wishing for things they don't understand, especially using celestial metaphors. Astronomical amounts of gravity and energy are fundamental with these things, but cataclysmic for us on earth.
