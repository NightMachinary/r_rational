That's a lot of significant restrictions. However, there are only probably-circumventable linguistic difficulties with personally obtaining the synthesized sum total of all knowledge and useful insights held by any human ever. There is probably a huge amount of value in that synthesis.

It's your blacksmith example, but broadened as much as possible. And there are compounding effects from the synthesis - your uber-blacksmith would be capable not of just all the things any individual historical or contemporary blacksmith could so, but also a wealth of new things only enabled by their combination.

If you can get this full synthesis done in one wish, the rest should probably be spent getting a head start on having the means to apply the knowledge. Details would be shaped by exactly what you want to accomplish.

The possibility that this wish causes problems with human biological limitations should be addressed and mitigated or circumvented if possible. At some point these mental assets and capacities butt up against physical limitations mentioned in your restrictions. If so can we circumvent them by no longer remaining human, but becoming an instance of some other class with different physical limitations? Or is that exactly what is restricted by saying "the normal range of variation for /the target/?

--------------

Another, separate point is that more understanding around what /should/ be accomplished may be just as important as the knowledge and means to enable it. It's natural to think you know what you want, but wish stories are also full of foolish desires fulfilled and regretted. The sum of all human insights into what makes people happy or capable is a great help, but can we use a wish to get any additional wisdom/knowledge on this topic?
