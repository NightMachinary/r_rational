Wish one would be the essential 'I wish to be as intelligent as the most intelligent human to ever exist' or some variation on that if the wish giver is malicious. Alternatively, 'I wish for all the knowledge of rules lawyering'. Something to that effect. I can then base future wishes on that level of intelligence, which would affect my other 2 choices, but if precommitment is a thing that has to happen, then...

Does rule 2's 'anyone' cover microorganisms? If not, I would wish for all harmful to humans microorganisms to be modified to not harm humans in a single change. If germ theory has not been invented, then a varient of that (ie 'the end of those malignant curses' or such) In scenario one, it is not a persistent magical effect, but rather a single change, and thus works even with rule three. In scenario two, it is essentially the same thing, if less informed. Either way, it will keep humanity less dead for a decent length of time. Advice with better phrasing would be appreciated, as this is just the general gist of things.

Finally, a wish to be placed in the position where I can do the most good at the most personal satisfaction. This should be relatively lofty due to my wish for high intelligence, and essentially works as a poor man's precog without the work of interpreting it, since I'll essentially be creating the future which gives me the most bang for my buck.

One thing I didn't take advantage of was a noticeable lack of defence against 'meta' wishes in the main list of rules (eg, 'I wish that my future wishes were not affected by the rules of wishing'). You gave it a sort of acknowledgement before the list, but rule 8 only concerns items, when it could be altered to affect wishes as well. That would be my only qualm at a glance.
