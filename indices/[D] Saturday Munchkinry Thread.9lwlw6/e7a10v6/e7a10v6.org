I'm currently sketching out a variant of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111][The Rules of Wishing]] (very) loosely based on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA][Twisted]] (NB: Chances of my going anywhere with this are relatively low, I'm mostly just thinking this through). As part of that I'm planning to nerf the wishes down to a bit more "mundane utility" level.

​

As in rules of wishing the restriction have a certain amount of in-build extensibility and a certain degree of sentient judgement built in. Assume anything that looks like you're trying to rules lawyer will be nerfed (e.g. no wishing for wishes, no "I wish for X and Y" composite wishes, etc). Beyond that the main restrictions are:

1. The wish may only directly affect one person and requires informed consent from that person.
2. Even indirectly the wish may not harm anyone (ETA: The level of indirection here is bounded. You can use things given to you by wishes to harm people, and long chains of causality are fine. This is mostly a cap on things like "I wish for an anvil to appear over their head").
3. The wish may not cause persistent magical effects. Once the wish has completed in "reasonable time" (not more than an hour, certainly) the result of the wish is purely mundane.
4. The wish may not grant people knowledge that has never been known by any human. However it can combine from multiple sources. e.g. you could wish to be the best, say, blacksmith in the world and you would get knowledge that was not possessed by any single blacksmith to date. You could not wish to learn how to make technology that has not yet been invented.
5. Similarly the wish may not grant an entity ~~physical~~ capabilities outside of the range of normal variation for the target. You could wish to be the strongest man who ever lived, but not for the strength of ten regular men. You could wish to become a youth in peak health, but not for immortality.
6. +The amount of stuff a wish can create is bounded to, say, the size of a large palace.+ The total volume affected by the wish (including creation, destruction, modification) must be contained within a contiguous region contained in a sphere of no more than about a mile in diameter.
7. Wishes cannot create or restore life.
8. The wishes may not grant knowledge about or otherwise affect any other magical items that may exist.

(The actual rulebook is much larger, and may be expanded in response to wishes)

You have three such wishes, and are a native in a roughly medieval tech setting. What do you do with them?

​

Additional rules added as a result of munchkinning:

1. +The area of effect of the wish may be no more than a few miles across (I can make a ruling on exactly how many is "a few" if it matters)+
2. The rules of wishing themselves cannot be affected by wishes.
3. The results of the wish may not depend on knowledge of the future. e.g. you cannot wish for something that maximizes the chance of some outcome occurring.
4. The rules may not create anything that could not in principle have been built by a small number of people subject to the "normal range of variation" rules in up to about 100 years of work and an effectively unbounded amount of unskilled labour. You cannot bootstrap this by assuming such people have access to previously wish-created items i.e. you can wish for things that have been created to an implausibly high level of engineering and craftsmanship, including the development of some new techniques, but new technology is right out.
5. The rules may not create non-living intelligences (mostly covered by the previous rule).
6. Ruling on the interaction between knowledge and "normal range of variation" rules: What is achievable for a given person is roughly "assume they are at one in 100 billion levels of natural talent and worked at this for their entire lifetime".
