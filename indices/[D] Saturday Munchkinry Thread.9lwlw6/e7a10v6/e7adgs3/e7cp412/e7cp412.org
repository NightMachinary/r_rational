You are a person who is, by your nature, driven to affect the world at large. (As many of us are.) You are also a wizard, capable of applying magic in arbitrarily flexible ways, though with limits on output which prevent you from affecting more than a cubic mile or more than a ton of matter.

A magical edict has been active for some time which forbids wizards from affecting more than their personal scope. This does not discriminate between means (e.g., you cannot do it by magic and you cannot do it by political office). The explicit exception is defending the world against external threats (aliens, shoggoths, Outsiders a-la the Dresden Files), and the implicit exception is that other people affected by you can affect more than your (or their) personal scope.

Attempts to modify or affect the Edict will guaranteeably, lethally fail. Things which violate the Edict will fail in ways that at best expend your effort for no effect.

How do you solve the problem of the Edict and change the world?
