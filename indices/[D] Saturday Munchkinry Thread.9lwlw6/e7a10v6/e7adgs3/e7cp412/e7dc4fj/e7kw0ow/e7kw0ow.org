"I am the grand wizard Lazarus! Within my domain, anything is possible. Come, all ye kings and venture capitalists, and see your wildest dreams fulfilled!"

You can run a wish-fulfillment service in exchange for favors. No limit on wishes but you have to complete the favors before your wish is granted, non-negotiable. Since you can do anything within your domain, it should be easy to provide people with concrete things that they want (your son back from the dead? ZAM! Making you the smartest person on earth? That's three favors, ZAM! A million bucks? Here, just take it as a gesture of goodwill, I've got more diamonds than I know what to do with!)

This way you can live in whatever your definition of extreme luxury is, while also tweaking world events whenever someone important comes to see you.
