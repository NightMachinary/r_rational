Can you create an external threat (or assist in opening the way)? If so, then solve it using your preferred method, that also makes you the ruler of the world. OTOH, you'd almost certainly lose, since you'd be the villain of the story.

Also, how is 'external threat' defined? The world is at threat of asteroids and gamma ray bursts at all times. If it has to be embodied, do the threats need to be coming after earth specifically, or can you just let loose as long as whatever you're doing will eventually kill some shoggoths? And if so, how does the edict know?
