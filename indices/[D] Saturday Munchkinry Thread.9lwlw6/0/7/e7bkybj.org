As others have already pointed out this limitation still lets you create machines which are intelligent and staggeringly powerful. So you're going to need to also put a limitation on not creating anything remotely intelligent. Also even once you've barred the creations of other intelligences you're going to need the power to consider any self replicating machines to be life (even though they wouldn't be technically) otherwise that creates an obvious ability for people to exploit advanced nanotech which isn't intelligent.

Of course even barring the creation of intelligence you're going to have a problem in that you can still create various physical systems which will go on to non-magically alter life or create extremely powerful life or machines.

Honestly it seems like ruling out exploits here is probably just completely impossible, because you can't predict every way the ability to manipulate matter except in certain specific ways I've disallowed will be exploitable.
