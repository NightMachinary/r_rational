  This actually requires a persistent magical effect because the rules list gets updated in response to the effect of wishers.

I don't see how that follows; even if the rules adapt to prevent "exploitation" over a certain threshold, there should be an acceptable level of comprehension that stays in bounds. Any rules lawyering knowledge that would be invalidated as a consequence of it's bestowal is necessarily invalid rules-lawyering knowledge and therefor out of scope for the wish anyway. Wish one in this case, simply guarantees the best possible human wisher is making wishes two and three on your behalf.
