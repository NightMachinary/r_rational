  You're really going to need to come up with some different way of prohibiting that because "specific skill" doesn't work. Fundamentally that's not workable because what counts as a specific/distinct skill is a fundamentally arbitrary distinction about how you want to categorize knowledge.

As was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9lwlw6/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/e7a5iy7/][implicitly pointed out in a different comment]], it doesn't even need to be ruled as composite to be invalidated: This wish would put the wisher well outside of the normal range of human variation, in a way that "I wish to be the best possible at X" typically would not.

For a more specific ruling on what that rule covers for skills, I guess something like "You can't be better overall than an implausible-but-not-inhuman level of natural talent and a lifetime of dedicated study would get you"

It wouldn't surprise me if there were a bunch of arbitrary categorisations in the rules in various places. The way this worked in tRoW was that the rules tended to get backfilled with overly specific patches when someone was playing silly buggers. Mostly because I thought it was funnier that way.
