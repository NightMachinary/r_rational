Attempting to create or assist in the creation of an external threat falls within the Edict's prohibitions against actions that affect more than personal scope.

External threats are out-of-context-problems for non-wizard society; "external" is philosophical rather than geographical. So aliens but not asteroids; we know what asteroids are.

Hmmm. Side effects of deliberately sloppy shoggoth-slaying strategies seems like it has potential.
