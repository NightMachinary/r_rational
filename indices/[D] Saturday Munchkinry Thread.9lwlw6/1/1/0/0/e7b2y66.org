You can make mechanical devices out of gears and pulleys and stuff. They already had wind/water powered flour mills, you could probably construct some sort of power hub with your perpetual motion machine inside, and have chains or gears or pumped water going out from that across a city to power other things that used gears or water power. I don't think they had a lot of gear-powered devices in the middle ages, largely due to the lack of efficiency, but if you had an infinite power source a lot of otherwise impractical devices would become useful.

If you had this device but were not a crazy smart inventor, the best thing to do would be to find some crazy smart inventor and get them to invent whatever technology they thought this device could be used for.
