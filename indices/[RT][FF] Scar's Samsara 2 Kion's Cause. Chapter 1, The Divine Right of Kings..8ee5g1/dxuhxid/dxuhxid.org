What's this? A Scar's Samsara sequel? Oh boy, tell me it's so!

I never intended for Scar's Samsara to continue, but gosh this stuff is just too much fun to write. This story picks up where the last one left off, except one generation later. It's very roughly based on The Lion Guard, which is basically The Avengers set in the Pridelands, but I don't actually expect anyone to watch that show so just jump right in and enjoy!
