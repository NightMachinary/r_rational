One of the /really/ weird things here, which I don't see covered in the paper up to where I am, is that on the one hand, cognition is inherently probabilistic, but on the other hand, admitting a probabilistic foundation for mathematics does /funny things/, like refuting the Continuum Hypothesis by ordering between naturals < measurable reals < reals.
