Fallacies are often framed as things /others/ do, so there's a tendency of fallacy labels to be misused as attacks. Biases are framed as things /we/ do. I love how each bias here is phrased with /we/ or /our/, reminding the reader that they are not immune and that the tools of rationality should be used for self-improvement.
