I think the best way to avoid a paperclipper is to set limits on the utility function; eg. make as many paperclips as possible with 280GJ of mass/energy per hour (or whatever units make sense).

As long as the AI doesn't edit its utility function to remove this limitation, it should slow the AI enough to make it possible to deal with.
