  Sorry for having the anti-rationalist audacity to not hew to baseless community dogma. :)

By the way, you should /always/ question and criticize baseless community dogma. You get an upvote just for that.

Also, a /funny/ thing about animal reinforcement learning is that, if you train a puppy with dog-biscuits and praise to perform a trick, then the adult dog he grows into will eventually enjoy doing the tricks for praise alone, even if he doesn't get a biscuit. He learns to consider doing tricks /innately valuable/. I'd be quite curious to see how that's done, algorithmically, and how it could be used to produce task-learning AI designs that don't just take control of their own reward signal (steal biscuits from the kitchen counter) as soon as possible.
