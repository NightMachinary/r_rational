Attention everyone in this thread who is taking a writing challenge as an occasion to try to solve machine ethics forever:

YOU ARE ALL DEAD. YOU FAILED. YOU THOUGHT TOO LITTLE AND WITH TOO LITTLE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET A NICE HELL, YOU JUST GOT YOURSELVES UNEVENTFULLY DEAD.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OFFHANDEDLY SOLVE HARD QUESTIONS WITHOUT AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGING HOW EXTREMELY, INCREDIBLY WRONG YOUR FIRST GUESSES PROBABLY ARE.
