The problem is when you start having the AI self modify and have it operate at a scale humans never did. Either of those can break something that worked. Both of them together is going to be a big problem.

  Incidentally, though it's not nearly as bad as a paperclipper going FOOM - it's basically just a system crash - I think another major problem AI researchers are going to have is AIs committing suicide by means of self-modification - wireheading themselves at the first opportunity.

I think that would be a problem too, but it's the sort of problem where you can tweak the parameters and try again. You can't do that with a paperclipper.
