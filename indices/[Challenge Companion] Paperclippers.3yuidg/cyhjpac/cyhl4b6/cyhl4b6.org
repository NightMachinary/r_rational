Since when was attempting to independently think things through an act of intellectual arrogance? It's true that our intuitions are often - usually, even, for hard problems - wrong. It's false that they're worthless. Airplanes don't fly the same way birds do, and the people who tried to cargo cult together flying machines by artlessly imitating birds were performing a great folly. But the development of the airplane required reverse-engineering the bird, to determine on what replicable principles it functioned. And so we discovered that the flapping behavior consumed too much energy to be practical, but the gliding behavior - which also, in fact, required the wings - consumed little energy if any at all, and could be used under the right conditions to raise elevation rather than preserve it.

What we're dealing with with intelligence is the opposite of the flight situation. Instead of a situation where everybody is trying to replicate a natural behavior by cargoculting it, we have a situation where everybody is trying to replicate a natural behavior but is ignoring the fact that it already exists. Why aren't there more psychologists at the forefront of AI development? I mean, no respect intended, psychology is total bunk science, but I'd think study of the human mind would be more relevant here.

Sorry for having the anti-rationalist audacity to not hew to baseless community dogma. :)
