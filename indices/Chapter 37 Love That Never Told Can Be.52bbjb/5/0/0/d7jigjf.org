Yep. In chapter 4 we learn that Sarah can speak names one thousand times faster than a human. In chapter 10 we learn, in detail, that magical duels (between ordinary people) aren't as cool as you'd think specifically because humans speak too slowly: (1) most names take at least three seconds to say, but firing a gun takes a tenth of that; (2) the Bulletproof Name is longer but protects you from exactly one bullet and therefore protects you from anyone who can't shoot you twice in five seconds.

It is simply an inevitability that a Sarah Michelle Gellar golem is going to show up and curb-stomp a bunch of goons holding/threatening Aaron at an opportune moment. I thought it was going to be UNSONG goons but now the Drug Lord's looking good for it. A strong industrial base without Names should make for a good curb-stomp.

Naturally, this will do nothing to stop the apocalypse.
