Thought the number of the beast was 616?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast#616]]

I guess that wasn't discovered in their world.

Edit: Why isn't Aaron suspicious that the Drug Lord didn't ask him for proof for her? The Drug Lord just asked Ana for something that would let Aaron know he had her and she just gave it? How does the Drug Lord know that that is Aaron?

If she's at the stage where she gives anything up without question then there's not much to save.

Guess it depends how it works if he's completely controlling her. What a miracle by the way that he needs both minds to get a name...

Edit 2: The title of the story should be in the title of the post.
