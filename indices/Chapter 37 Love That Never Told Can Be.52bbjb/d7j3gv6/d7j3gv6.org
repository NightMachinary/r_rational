I've kind of stopped reading for reasons unclear to myself (story jumps around too much for me or something), but I have to say I'm very very impressed by the writing speed. This guy is a machine, and puts out more chapters faster than any web serial writer I've ever seen. I don't know if it's time or efficiency, but I hope other authors also figure out how to do it.
