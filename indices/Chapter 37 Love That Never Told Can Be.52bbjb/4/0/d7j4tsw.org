Scott does 1-2 a week (all Sundays and some Wednesdays). Some others with a similar ethos in terms of always getting chapters out there:

- Wildbow, of [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], and most recently [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] does 2 or 3 releases every week with great regularity.\\
- ErraticErrata of [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] does a chapter every Wednesday with great regularity
- Mr Zoat of fanfic [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] has been posting an update every day for the past ~3 years.
