Further evidence, though I don't have a source, is that I remember Scott mentioning somewhere that the story was mostly or completely written when the first chapter was released. He also has mentioned that, given how long the story takes to unfold, he has some small regrets about not choosing a release schedule faster than ~1 chapter per week (but I don't have a source handy for this, either). And >1 chapter per week of creative fiction seems to be pushing plausibility for a psychiatrist-in-training, even one whose blog posts are notoriously lengthy.
