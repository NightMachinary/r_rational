A vampire world war couldn't have really started. Non-vegetarian vampires can't really form large groups without people like Chelsea, so anyone who wanted to stop them would have had to try to go up against an army with at most four or five people. They would lose, and I'm pretty sure everyone out there knew that. You can't have a world war without more than one organized side.

In the end, the golden coven has enough power that they could just hunt down and kill any vampires that didn't just do what they told them to. Alice alone makes any attempts futile, simply by virtue of letting the golden coven break up any attempts before they form. Globally unique precognition paired with overwhelming military power.

I do agree that there should have been a few attempts at least, even if they would have fizzled. Maybe that could have been covered in the short stories?
