I think the entire first draft was written before the first chapter was published, and he's just doing his final edit pass week-by-week.

Evidence for this is that (1) Scott had an "I won't finish [project] in 2015" prediction that he graded false, and (2) Rationalist inner-circle member Alicorn FLIPPED OUT on Twitter at the first mention of Uriel and Sohu as though she had read their entire arc already

*EDIT:* Which, it's still awesome of Scott to have done it in such a way that the updates are like clockwork. Just, I don't think his method is to write 1.306 chapters from scratch every week.
