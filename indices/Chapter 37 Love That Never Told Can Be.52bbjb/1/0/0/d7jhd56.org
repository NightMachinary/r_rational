From that time when Erica tried peyote, the Drug Lord probably knows about the SCABMOM, Aaron's love for Ana, the whale puns and how Aaron looks like (so that one of the beggars and drug dealers probably high on peyote can identify him when he enters Las Vegas, and follow him into the hotel), unless she tried peyote before Ana discovered the SCABMOM name before she met Aaron. No need to kidnap anyone. The really hard part is how he knows about the discovery of Vital Name. He probably knows that Unsong is looking for Aaron and might be making an educated guess based on the flurry of activity.
