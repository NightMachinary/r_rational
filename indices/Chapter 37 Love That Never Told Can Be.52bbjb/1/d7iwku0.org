Given that the Drug Lord already knew of Aaron's name, his location, his possession of secret names, and the SCABMOM with Ana, the ability to produce a biblical whale pun on demand doesn't provide all that much additional information.

Aaron really should have engaged in a lengthier and multidirectional exchange of puns that would have allowed him to detect anything inconsistent with Ana's individual pattern of punning.
