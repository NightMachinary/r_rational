FWIW I have the same feeling. I think you're right, the source is probably that it could be read as either

#+begin_quote
  There was no physical sensation of my body being distorted to fit through (and /to/ shrink down?) as I entered the bottle,
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  There was no physical sensation of my body being distorted to fit through (and /being/ shrunk down?) as I entered the bottle,
#+end_quote

It's a case where whether the "shrink down" part is subsequent to the "being" or the "to" makes a grammatical difference. (NB: I don't know much about grammar, so take this with a grain of salt. It's just my intuitive feeling.)

There's a slight difference in semantic content between the two possibilities as well, though nothing that makes an appreciable difference to understanding what's going on.
