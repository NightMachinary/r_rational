In-story: People who have little contact with civilization are unlikely to have developed math skills. Wizard equivalents however go to the most advanced centers of learning on the planet.

In addition, there's no guarantee that the locus thing would understand. And with a year long cast time, and the cost of failure is he death of the caster, there's not much room for experimentation.

IRL: generally, solving problems using math more advanced than what is taught in high school makes most people's eyes glaze over. We saw some trigonometry in this chapter, but I highly doubt Join will ever solve a problem using calculus.
