Those druids could have saved so much time by phrasing their question probabalistically:

"Find one of the (easiest for the caster to access) points in spacetime such that the point is a solution for argmax(λ loc -> P(restoration of druids | caster is present at loc))"

Seriously, I am dissapointed. This is so absurdly munchkinable, and pretty safe to boot since it will find you a maxima which must exist. And it doesn't even break the rules about no promises of the future, since it's probabalistically.

Edit: well "Let S be the set of points in spacetime that are solutions to argmax(λ loc -> P(restoration of druids | caster is present at loc)). Find me a member of S such that every point in S is (as hard or harder for the caster to get to)." Would be better.

Seriously, why are wizards the only ones who tend to get hard maths skills.
