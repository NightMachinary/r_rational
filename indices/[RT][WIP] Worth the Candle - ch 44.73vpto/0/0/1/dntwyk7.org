Arthur's a counterexample. I don't think we've had a one-on-one conversation between the two in flashback, but he's kind of the opposite of antagonistic in the group settings we have seen.

Then again, he's not only dead, but possibly /twice/ dead and sent to hell. If that's the price of being nice to Juniper, I understand why not many men are queueing up to be BFFs with him.
