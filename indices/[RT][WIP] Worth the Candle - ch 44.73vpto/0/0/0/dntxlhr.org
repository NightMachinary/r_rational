You're stretching a little. The bone mage might have warned that he'd sell the party out, but I wouldn't label their interactions as negative overall (and I note you subtly didn't either).

Then again, there's also a few characters you missed that continue to back up your point. Poul's female companion, who dies while still allied. The guy at the start who pushes them out of the plane. I think there were words exchanged with a male Color Riot soldier in Comfort?

What's mostly missing, I think, is an encounter with a rude or abrasive woman. Doesn't need to be a "big bad", just someone female who explicitly doesn't care much about the MC one way or the other. As is, I think Aumann's warder is the only female opponent he's faced, and she got an axe to the face before she could say a word.
