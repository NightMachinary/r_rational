I'd add Arthur to that list, and actually the rest of his gaming group was almost entirely male and they were good friends of his. Up until Arthur's death anyway. Admittedly that all happened prior to Aerb, where things have been skewed very much the other way (very possibly artificially, given what we know about the game).
