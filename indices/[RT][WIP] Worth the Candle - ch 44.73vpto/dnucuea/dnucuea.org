(I liked the last line a lot!)

A thought: Can only one Zorisad Yosivun be in progress at any one time, per locus rather than per caster? (If not, then can the caster survive unscathed if it's cancelled before the year ends and the result is delivered?)

That the caster survives if there's an answer smells like an opportunity for munchkinry--either have questions of increasing specificity/optimism staggered by a few days, with everyone up-the-ladder cancelling their casting once the first one dies, or else--using a year each time--do binary chop, working one's way inward from the most-pessimistic and most-optimistic possibilities.

Even if it were assumed at first that only a few times would be necessary, switching to a binary chop system--after the first few deaths, confirming the viability of (finding some people for) the worst-case-scenario /first/--could at least postpone the 'suggesting that it's impossible' despair. Even the time cost should be better than going down-the-ladder, plus that you could have lower-rung people working on helping while you're then searching for better options. (Even going up-the-ladder (after the first death when being too optimistic) taking a year each time would allow you to maintain full strength (-1) the whole time, until hitting the lower limit, after which you'd still be at full strength -2, with all others capable people presumably able to live 300 years without issues.)

A brief digression, as I found this mental image amusing: "All but me have died to Zorisad Yosivun in trying to find a way to evade our imminent destruction!" "Why, what's the nature of your imminent destruction?" "All of us dying one by one to Zorisad Yosivun!" (I don't suppose 'Zorisad Yosivun' is an acronym for something..?)

The 'too little land to induct new druids into the grove' matter sounds like a major issue that should have been thoroughly avoided at the start, though perhaps unavoidable with the resources at hand at the time. Other than that, it sits oddly with me that it takes more land to induct a druid than to maintain a druid, rather than there being a capacity limit whereby new druids could migrate in as previous druids died and left space free.
