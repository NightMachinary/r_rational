Depends how druids are inducted. It could be that Solace is the last survivor of the bunch of itinerant druids who traveled with the bottled locus ever since it was presumably translocated because of the Second Empire's genocide. or the locus has a limited amount of druids that can be inducted per acre and the druids, who are seeming like a rather oblivious bunch of amateur inquirers (they could've really used a rationalist druid or is that a contradiction in terms?), kept dying off without recruiting. How long has it been since the end of the Second Empire?

edit: scratch the latter, quest dialogue implies no druids can been inducted while enbottled.
