Some really sneaky foreshadowing within this chapter.

For example, the second whole (parenthetical) paragraph is about glove limits and /extradimensional/ space. The party is going to sail right on over that key [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party][party]] size limit, I suspect.

A few nice curveballs though: the anthropomorphic cranteks make the final reveal even more of a surprise.

A purple-aura person who's not a companion. :D
