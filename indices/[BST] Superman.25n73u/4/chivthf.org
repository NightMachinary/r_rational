Gather evidence and wait. Arrange different types of attacks against him (guns, fire, acid, etc.). Get him talking as much as possinle, ideally to scientists. Try to get his actions on film for quantitative analysts.

Go make friends with him if you can. Become his pal. Be someone he can confide in and ask for advice.

You will only have one chance, know it will work.
