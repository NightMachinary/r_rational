[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STxCxxWFpG8][Here]]'s a scene from Justice League Unlimited (good show) wherein Superman is tricked into destroying an entire housing complex built by LexCorp. The quality stinks, but Lex basically baited Supes into believing there was a kryptonite weapon underneath it when it was only a benign power generator.

Millions and millions of property damage completely at the fault of Supes for no good reason at all, and the /entire world/ knows it. /That/ is the sort of anti-Superman ploy Lex can pull off with ease.
