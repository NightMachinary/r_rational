I would attack his major weakness, his morality. Every week or so have a nice clever scheme were a group of people will be killed in either place a or place b he can only get to one but not both in time.

You don't attack the invulnerable man. You attack what he values, his self image, his morality etc and let his own guilt beat him down.

Superman may be invulnerable physically be he has shown himself to be, emotionally, as vulnerable as any human. Exploit it.
