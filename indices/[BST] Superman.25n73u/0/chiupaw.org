In DC 'verse, you need to figure out if Lex will stoop to using magic. Because that isn't something a lone Sups can deal with. Like. At all. Lots of good '20s era mystic stuff that would be period, too, and could be explained as more advanced alien science with a bit of twisting.

And that is only if you don't want some wild South American or Egyptian pith helmet action to have Lex procure his own honest, controllable, /Earth/ god to fight the alien menace. Maybe they are aliens, too, or of alien manufacture originally, but they are part of our cultural melting pot now. And are easy to control with the right systems administrator physical key and password- I mean, golden star head piece and mystic words of power. Ancient gods were all designed with two factor authentication, of course.

In my book, scientific magic is the easiest answer. It is a force multiplier. If one alien is on Earth, then why not more? And what is magic, but...

If not that, radiation and gravity are good plot keywords, even without the special sauce. How much hard radiation can the alien take? Can I get x-ray images of his internal structure? If so, then why can't I do more, and kill him with them? If not, guess what? I've got a van and a portable machine, and all week to hunt hidden aliens on the busy streets of the city. Now, is the Man of Steel immune to being trapped in a super-strong artificial gravity well, or looped higher space constructs? That might work if you have access to mad-level science.

Figuring out he's weirdly solar powered might be a straight shot from working on his crime fighting schedule, especially compared to other, /darker/ crime fighters just starting up in other crime riddled cities. Coughbatmancough.

If all else fails, thematically, use mind control. Not fantasy shit, but directly attacking Superman's ability to think clearly through plots that induce sleep dep, horrible scarring emotional shocks, and paranoia inducing double crosses that drive him into depression and isolation. That should buy some time, at least. Attack the mind, not the absurd, illogical body.
