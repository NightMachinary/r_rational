I'm trying to keep it to real-world science as much as possible, yes. The most Luthor can do is invent things a few years early, or make inventions that only apply to Superman (or work with his powers in some way) and then they'll always been explained as much as possible. For example, using Superman to put communications satellites into place, which would basically not have any thrusters at all, and could only relay information rather than store or process it.
