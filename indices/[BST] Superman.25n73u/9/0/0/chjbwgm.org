If you are really, truly committed to not allowing the "supernatural" or science from even the '70s, let alone speculative science at Arthur C. Clarke levels, then you simply /can not/ kill max level Superman.

It can't be done. You can't really physically slow him down. You won't even be able to get him into orbit (not that that would stop him).

He is immune to damage from and, sometimes even correct interactions with, weak and strong nuclear forces, EM forces (some even fuel his powers), and he's also immune to gravity (at least, Earth levels).

That's all you got to work with in the real-world '30s. No quark disintegration rays, no teleport guns, no "magic" amulets that turn him into a genetically accurate version of his physical body that is XX instead of XY. No chance, basically.

So that means entirely a story about Lex failing over and over again, eventually simply trying to survive what he sees as an unstoppable alien threat. This lasts until Superman gets bored and leaves, is emotionally or logically convinced to leave, or Lex finally discovers Kryptonite.

Bleak.

Personally, I'd rather see what it would mean to be smart in a world where Superman is possible, and all the things that implies about the nature of reality. It would be interesting to see how someone like Lex would use the tools that /must/, therefore, be available, in that interesting historic setting.

What would the '30s think of modern inventions that Lex might be driven to create? Could their fight jump-start a space race, a mission to the Moon, to Mars? To the stars? That is perhaps not your story, but it sounds like a good one to me. I might just write it someday.
