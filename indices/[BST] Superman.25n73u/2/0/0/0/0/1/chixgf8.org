  The powers of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics][DC Comics]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)][character]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman][Superman]] have changed since his introduction in the 1930s. Many other DC Comics characters have Superman's abilities from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton_(comics)][Kryptonian]] DNA, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superboy_(Kon-El)][Superboy]] and even [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Zod][Zod]]. The characters mentioned other than Superman have not been around since the 1930s and will not be the focus point of this article. The extent of Superman's powers peaked during the 1970s and 1980s to the point where various writers found it difficult to create suitable challenges for the character. As a result his powers were significantly reduced when his story was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)][rebooted]] by writer [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Byrne_(comics)][John Byrne]] after the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths][Crisis on Infinite Earths]]/ series. After Byrne's departure, Superman's powers were gradually increased again, although he still remains weaker than his pre-/Crisis/ incarnation.
