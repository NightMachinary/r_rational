Depending on Luthor's motivations, I see three avenues:

- Take out Superman on a social level. Genius-level smear campaign. This may or may not work depending on whether or not Superman gives a shit. However, turning the population against him, despite him doing good things, is probably not too hard. He is an all-powerful unknown, and people can very easily resort to fear. Staged atrocities attributed to him could help this along. Government involvement might as well, either directly through Luthor's contacts or swept along in the general sentiment.
- Investigate the source of Superman's powers. This will lead to two potential roads of dealing with him. Either a) an understanding of how he got his powers will provide a way to disable them (i.e. kryptonite) or b) will potentially allow them to be replicated. One way to take down a god is through another god. I don't recall whether b is possible in canon, but it seems like a path Luthor might take.

I would think that Luthor would be doing all of these, along with everything else he can think of. Dude is super smart and rich, so he has the resources to devote to the cause.
