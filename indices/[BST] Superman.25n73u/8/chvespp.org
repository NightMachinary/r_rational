  The story takes Superman more or less at the upper end of his power level - capable of destroying Metropolis in the space of minutes if he so chose.

The upper end of his power level is sneezing out galaxies in Silver Age Superman. Current edition he's bench-pressing the Earth (in a meaningful way, not just pushups).

You'll also want to nerf his superspeed because I think he can fly to the sun and back in a heartbeat.

Luthor is one of my favorite characters. I'd read this.
