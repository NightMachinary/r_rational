At minimum. A Superman who turns his mind to it is an extinction level event. A genius like Luthor would realize the risks. He's overpowered on any merely physical level. Genius level intellect is an edge, but a very narrow one. Without Kryptonite, Luthor is almost certainly outmatched.

You've given Superman a giant edge here. The world does not know about his weakness, and it isn't available to every wannabe super-villain at the local evil-R'-us. What edge are you giving Luthor to keep the story interesting, rather than the tale of a super powered alien beating up some schmuck who happens to be intelligent?
