That's a different story. But by that point, the battle with Superman is probably well on its way towards its conclusion, given that you'd need to have deduced his identity and gotten onto the farm where it's kept (or the Fortress of Solitude in Antarctica, if it's been moved there). But I don't really want to end on Lex Luthor throwing together some mad science machine to defeat Superman. It gets a little too far into the land of make believe, and requires Lex's intelligence to be informed rather than shown, since I can't really show my work with mad science. (I am open to disagreement on that point.)

See the bullet point to the side: the story is a puzzle that can be solved. Using Kryptonian super-tech seems like it would rob the story of some of that, unless it's established very early on.
