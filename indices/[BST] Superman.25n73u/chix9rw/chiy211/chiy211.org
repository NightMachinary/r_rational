Lex's greatest advantage is that Superman doesn't know about him. Luthor starts the story as a business tycoon who came up from the gutters of Suicide Slums and has enough money that he's mostly legit. He's involved in some white collar crime of course, because only an idiot plays by the rules, but that's never been Superman's area of attention.

So the story is mostly about Luthor uncovering information about Superman while being as stealthy as possible, taking into account that Superman can see through walls and eavesdrop from half a city away. As soon as Superman knows that Luthor is after him, the game is pretty much up. (Although Superman is traditionally constrained by his own moral system, Luthor certainly doesn't trust in that, and would like to avoid jail all the same.)

So in other words, I'm try to write it a bit like the opening parts of Death Note, but from only one perspective. You have the guy who is completely outclassed and has incredibly little information, and eventually he opens up a few cracks that give him leverage.
