Superman is obligated to help people, right? Like, he'll exert himself without question to save people in distress. Usually this is presented as him rescuing people in crisis, but it would also seem that Superman should be obligated to help those in need if he has a clear way to do so. Like, if Superman finds a box of polio vaccines, he should really go inoculate some at-risk an at-risk population, or at the very least deliver the box to someone else who can do that.

So: Lex needs to focus his genius on coming up with intentionally convoluted humanitarian schemes, and then openly broadcasting those schemes as widely as possible. Lex designs, say, a machine that purifies well water, but then chops up the blueprints and scatters them around the world in lead boxes, the locations of which are known only to isolated individuals, who in turn have various problems that only Superman can solve, etc. Send Superman off on overcomplicated fetch quests to keep him distracted. By broadcasting the plans widely, Lex ensures that if Superman doesn't follow the plan, the people will turn against him for not helping them out.

Now Superman is at least off of his back for a while. The next step is to expose Superman to as much high-intensity radiation as possible. (This won't be easy in the 1930s, before the advent of nuclear reactors, which is why Lex needs to buy as much time as he can.) If Lex can somehow trick Superman into ingesting a large amount of uranium over time, Superman's body becomes dangerously radioactive. Now he's poisonous, and he can't approach humans without hurting them. He's isolated. (In the comics, can Superman sense radiation? If so, I'm not sure how this'll work.)

As for how to actually murder Superman once and for all, well, I'm sure the comics contain hundreds of crazy schemes to deprive him of sunlight or throw him into a black hole or something. Coming up with something original will be hard. From a storytelling perspective, I'd say the most /interesting/ thing to do would be to have Lex investigate the mechanics of Superman's powers, especially flight, which to my knowledge have never really been explained well. A good rational fic wouldn't have Superman's powers just exist as an inexplicable black box. A good fic would actually dare to come up with a self-consistent system that allows Superman to fly. When EY was writing HPMOR, he didn't just have to imagine smarter versions of the characters, he also had to come up with his own underlying system of magic that goes beyond anything shown in canon, and your story will probably have to do something similar.

Good luck with the writing, this sounds like a story I'd love to read.
