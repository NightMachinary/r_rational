I'm going to call this a high risk plan. The absurd, illogical body can head out into space and toss a dwarf planet at you, and the only thing stopping that is a moral code instilled by some farmers in the middle of nowhere, Kansas. If that code is removed, if the mind controlling the body is damaged, it's all over.
