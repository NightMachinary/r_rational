Yeah, can't argue with that. But I'm suggesting focusing on disabling attacks, not making him doubt his moral basis or go insane. Show that his actions have consequences, that humans are fragile and he is reckless. This should be easy, as it is true. Also point out that people are flawed, and don't always line up with his moral code. And there is nothing he can do about that.

So keep him busy with minor muggings, all day every day, to the point where he can't get anything else done. When he fights a giant robot in the middle of the city (and he will), make sure the Daily Planet has a story the next day about that little kid who was crushed by rubble he didn't even notice. Bank robbery foiled? Great, but a housewife a half a block away was hit by a bullet that bounced off Supe's chest from that Tommy gun fire. She's not expected to make it, leaving behind three kids and a husband.

Also attack people he's seen with on a regular basis. Maybe Supe's best bud he's always saving, the one from the Daily Planet, is actually secretly a (gasp) socialist! And that /female/ reporter who keeps base jumping without proper safety gear? She's having premarital sex /all the time/, undermining basic American values. And instead of simply reporting the truth as it is, Supe's number one fan at the Daily Planet (the paper of note in the city) takes bribes to suppress certain stories (of course he does, you're the one paying him off). That he's also Kent's boss is an added bonus that you won't be aware of.

Make Supe's back off the big organized crime and tire him of fighting endless petty crimes. If the Earth is actually in danger, sure. Let him save it. If someone threatens the city, point the big blue Boy Scout at it and let him work off some frustration. Maybe suggest the League of Nations use him for some diplomatic missions (read, spying). I hear the new Chancellor of Germany is a bit worrying in some of his politics.

While Supe's busy in Europe, well, that death ray isn't going to build itself. Unless you make those self-constructing spider bots first. Hmm.
