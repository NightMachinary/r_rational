If I was in this Lex's place, the big issue isn't the how, but the why. There doesn't seem to be much motivation for Lex to kill superman, and all the motivation for Lex to become the poster-child for an ethical industrialization movement, like a Polymathic Henry Ford. If Superman came into the picture, recruiting him would be infinitely more preferable. I'm rather averse to the Superman generator idea, but one high-profit possibility would be keeping my own hands as ethically clean as possible, while teaching Superman how a single white-collar crime hurts thousands more than a single blue-collar crime, and encouraging him to deal with the competition.
