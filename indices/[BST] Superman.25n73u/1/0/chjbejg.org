Superman is a potential K-T extinction event waiting to happen. If he didn't have human morality and a drive to fight crime, for some reason, the Earth as we know it would be doomed. He'd be a [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][Keter class in SCP]], no question.

I see Lex as a proponent of the precautionary principle when it comes to aliens and other /unnatural/ externalities. Unless you can /prove/ they are safe, they should be controlled and contained. Lex understand his superscience inventions, so those are /obviously/ safe in this sort of analysis.

Being Superman's PR campaign manager while he fights muggers on the streets isn't actually control or containment. Wouldn't even be considered past initial analysis.

In any case, you're Lex Fucking Luthor. With your mind, you would have been ruling the entire country already, if it wasn't for the distraction of Superman. You didn't originally plan to use Superman. You don't /need/ him to meet your goals.

The world would be a far simpler place without Superman. A more controllable and /optimal/ place to plot and plan against those pitiful, stupid people who might oppose your long-term goals. Goals that do not include having a super powered nanny who wears his underwear on the outside of his clothes.

As for exploiting his strange powers, now that you know Superman-type things are /possible/, you can reproduce them later.

Safely.

With /science./

Good, rational, controllable Earth science.
