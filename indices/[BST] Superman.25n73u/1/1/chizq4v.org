Thinking about /why/.

In canon ([[http://mightygodking.com/2008/08/18/on-luthor/][more-or-less based on this]]), Lex hates Supes because he envies him. He wants to be best, and he can't be better than Superman; so he is obsessed with him.

So, if this motivation is unchanged, Lex is likely to be /very paranoid/ about other Kryptonians (like General Zod? Kara Zor-El? Inhabitants of Kandor?). I think uncovering as much as possible of Krypton's history will be very important for him, and obtaining sample of Superman's DNA will too.
