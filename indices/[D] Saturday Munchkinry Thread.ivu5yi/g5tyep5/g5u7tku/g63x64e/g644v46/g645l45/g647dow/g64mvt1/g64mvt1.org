I think that answer requires a look at the criteria for a "normal life."

That's a question that gets asked a lot in medicine. Is a normal life one with no obvious disabilities? One where you have total independence?

The answer isn't a static one. For a kid with high functioning autism, achieving a "normal life" might mean personal and financial independence, gainful employment, a wife, drivers license, etc. For a guy with a severe traumatic brain injury, achieving a return to a "normal life" might just mean being able to speak and leave the hospital.

I think, with a lot of backing resources, you could incapacitate yourself for 10 minutes every hour and still approximate a normal life, especially in modern times. You'd need to be heavily web-based, you'd need an assistant, and you probably wouldn't get to do a lot of out-and-about stuff. But there's plenty of "normal" people living that way.
