It's as close as you can get to a normal life.

If you had an assistant and incorporated those restraints into a wheelchair you could be "out and about" and maintain some level of social interaction.

There's no way I can see to maintain on-site employment, although some kind of freelance or remote work could be possible.

Anything less and, as you say, you'll kill yourself.
