A more reliable approach for shutting down cellphone-based detonators would be to have the police chief and/or mayor order the local telecom companies to turn off their cellphone towers ASAP. As long as the ferries are far from the shore, there's a good chance that other commercially-available items that could be jerry-rigged into detonators would be out of range. Things like garage door openers, RC cars or planes, key fobs and wifi over parabolic antennas are all relatively limited in effective range, especially below the deck of a ferry. A viable long-range detonator would still be possible, but it would probably require a bit more skill and knowledge than the Joker demonstrated up to that point. A fail-deadly arrangement is also still possible, though, as you've said, unlikely since it would probably be unreliable. As such, disabling cell phones is your safest initial move.

Even so, the Joker stated the ships would both be destroyed at midnight if nobody pressed their button, so it's possible that there are timers on both ships which have to be disabled. Nonetheless, if the ships don't blow up shortly after the cellphone network is shut down, it's a good sign that you're probably safe to move in and cautiously try to evacuate everyone, possibly while also towing the ferries further from the shore to reduce signal strength.
