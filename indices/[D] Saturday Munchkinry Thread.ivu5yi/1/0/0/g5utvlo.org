Shockwaves are actually more deadly through liquid so you'd have to be further away than you'd think. Check out Mark Rober's video on the topic of surviving a grenade in air vs in liquid: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4DnuQOtA8E]]

Also depending on the time of the year the water might be cold enough to give you all hypothermia which'll kill you if you don't reach land fast enough. From the coats people are wearing in the clip I'd say it's probably gonna be pretty cold.
