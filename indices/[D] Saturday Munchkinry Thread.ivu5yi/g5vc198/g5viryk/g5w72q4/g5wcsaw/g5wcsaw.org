  When the story comes back to them, what's some believable (and clever) things you might expect to see them having munchkinned?"

I actually might have discounted water too much the first time around. True it's only of limited use in temperate climate, but it might have enough strategic value to justify picking up and moving elsewhere.

On Earth, for instance, it might be a good idea to pick up and resettle somewhere in or around the Sahara. With copious water you could revitalize marginal land, allowing you to build up your power base in a sparse and inaccessible area that can be defended easily so long as you control the water supply. This takes a certain amount of initial resources and followers to pull off, but once you hit that critical number it lets you go a long way towards sidestepping continental politics in the settled countries.

Best bet, I think, would be to find some dry and inhospitable part of the Atlas mountains, since they would contain many of the resources you need, with much fewer human entanglements than the more settled lands would have.
