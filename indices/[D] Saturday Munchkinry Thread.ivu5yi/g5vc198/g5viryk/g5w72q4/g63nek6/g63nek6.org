In that case, I think you might be overlooking Cold, Acid and Wind as important options.

Cold gives you the obvious creature comforts you've noticed - cold food storage, air conditioning, fresh ice in the summer - but it's also essential to a variety of chemical and culinary processes that you'll want to take advantage of. Cold distilled cider and ice cream is all well and good, but storing strong acids and volatile chemicals in a refrigerated environment is also quite important. There's also applications for more efficient turbines (making the cold end colder is just as good as making the hot end hotter) and when trying to build something across or in a body of water - freezing the water and excavating the resultant ice is a viable alternative to sinking caissons.

Acid provides a much less explosive way way to store energy than water splitting for hydrogen. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniell_cell][Daniell cell]] for example can easily be manufactured using zinc, copper and sulfuric acid, and an analogous preparation can be done with hydrochloric or other acids. A battery pile made using these principles would be sufficient to provide the sort of steady low voltage charge required to safely operate a telegraph machine, basic electric lighting and/or a toaster oven.

Wind is your answer for transportation, naturally. Land sailing dates back as far as the sixth century in China, and if you have a magic club that can make wind happen in a direction and speed of your choosing, much of the technical difficulties involved in learning to sail on land are removed - just point the wind stick at the sail and the wagon goes forward. It's also a good way to kick off one part of the industrial revolution quite early - wind driven looms are considerably more practical when one can be certain that there will always be a steady and sufficient supply of wind whenever you want the workers to do some work.

E: It also occurs to me that fire would actually have some considerable applications in construction and (especially) in the mining of ore. It was a common practice in iron mines to deal with particularly hard rocks by building a bonfire on or near them, as to cause the rock to be softened by the heat as part of what we now know to be a chemical reaction. A hammer which does this automatically when it hits something would be a very valuable tool in the mine worker's arsenal.
