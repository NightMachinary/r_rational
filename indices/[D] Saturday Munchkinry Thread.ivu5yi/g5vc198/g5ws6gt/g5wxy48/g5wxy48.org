I clarified a bit more on the definition I was using in one of my other responses. I think the elements could work but I'm not sure about the specific application.

I'm trying to stick with munchkinning what you'd expect from a layman's idea of what an enchanted weapon can do.

I have a cultural reference to an enchanted staff with the element of wood, being like Sun Wukong's extending staff because it can grow longer or regrow if a part is chopped off. Maybe the growth could be munchkinned for leverage?

But I can't think of any cultural references to a sword that drips out metal all the time, compared to how mythology has lots of swords that are eternally on fire or Poseidon's Trident making freshwater sources all over Greece.
