You have the ability to imbue weapons with magical elemental powers, however you are also stuck in a medieval society. Your goal is to make life better for yourself and those you care about. You /can/ uplift society, but only care inasmuch as it'll benefit you personally; getting rich isn't a concern, but freeing up village labor so they can go mine aluminum to enable you to build airplane or something might be.

'Elemental weapons' has fairly strong conceptual leeway. Viable options could be a sword that is on fire, or that shoots fire when swung by a swordsman, or strikes with the fury of fire. Focus is defined at creation, so when you forge it you need to decide if an air sword will literally shoot a blade of air or just give you the speed and agility of air, but there will always be some bleed-over between effects (eg any type of fire sword will never be cold, even if you use non-flaming effects). Quality of the weapons impacts the amount and reliability of the elemental effect; so a masterwork trident you made from start to finish to solely generate water might pump out a steady 20 gal/minute +-5% flow rate at any given time, while a shoddy trident you modified afterwards might only give 1 gal/minute that releases water in fits and starts.

Assume you've got access to modern knowledge of how to make anything you'd want, but you're still stuck with the tools available. So you can make a lightning sword to power your house, but you'll need to forge copper and spin wires yourself in a medieval blacksmithery (and something to regulate voltage).

I can already think of some obvious uses to copy modern life -

- Fire to handle the heating and cooking\\
- Ice to store food
- Water for... well, water needs.\\
- Elemental Light for lights
- Lightning as a power source, once you can start producing motors\\

But what can help you short circuit the tech tree if you've got unlimited (in amount, if not flow rate) supply?

- Does unlimited electricity let you skip to aluminum immediately?\\
- How much does having <x> amount of guaranteed free water impact agriculture?\\
- Are there any clever ways to leverage things for travel or QoL?
