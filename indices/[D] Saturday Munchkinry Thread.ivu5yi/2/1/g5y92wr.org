  You /can/ uplift society, but only care inasmuch as it'll benefit you personally;

The thing is, whether you are selfish or selfless, uplifting society is one of the best ways to benefit yourself. Because even if you hoard your knowledge and use it to become the God-King of Humanity, your living standards will still be worse than a middle income family in the modern era. You won't have proper medicine, working toilets, video games, internet, phones, cars, etc.

The existence of magic helps quite a bit, in that you could probably fake up a working water system using water swords, but you will still be missing a whole ton of items on the above list. And there is definitely no way to get video games or webnovels unless you uplift.

​

So, some questions to make sure we don't accidentally kill off the planet. Is "Void" an element? Otherwise if you go around making water-producing weapons everywhere, we will risk drowning the planet and increasing gravity until humanity can't live on it. So let's hope Void element exists, and can be used to just delete mass.

Toilets, sinks, showers and baths are now easy: Water weapon above to wash, Void weapon below to disintegrate the water and everything it washed off. No Sewer systems necessary, which is an amazing benefit when you consider how many problems Sewers cause, from disease to pollution to hiding criminals to lots of work and money saved by not needing them.

If you have extremely precise control over the magic, then maybe you can even do things like enchant a weapon (a net, or whip? or bolas? ideally a blanket if that counts) with Void element such that it disintegrates anything it touches when wielded, but only non-living mass. Then you can use it to wipe yourself.

With more control, you can even use it to reduce pollution: just hang large nets in the air or the river, and enchant them with Void to delete anything that isn't pure air or pure water.

​

But mundane utilities aside, let's focus on insanely overpowered magics. Is "Time" an element? There are plenty of fiction where time magic exists, so can you enchant your weapons with Time? Specifically, you could de-age yourself and others, or send yourself back in time to fix a mistake, or just send yourself forward hundreds of years so you get back to the modern era without doing any uplifting yourself?

Or if time travel isn't possible, what about Stasis? There's plenty of stories where some demon king or other is sealed for long periods of time only to awaken much later. Can you use Stasis enchantments on a weapon to seal yourself, effectively creating a magical equivalent of a cryogenic pod?

If not, then what about "Life" as an element? Can you make weapons that heal their user or their target? Because healing is crazy overpowered, no need for any more medical systems, just Heal and Detoxify and you are back in perfect health.
