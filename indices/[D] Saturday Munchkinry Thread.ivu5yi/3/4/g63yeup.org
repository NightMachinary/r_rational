I take a short acting sedative prior to the posession window each time.

Without access to a pharmacy, a high dose of IV opioids (looking at you, heroin) at minute 58 followed by narcan administration at minute 11 would give you a decent functional window and the demon would be way too high to get anything done. All you'd need is a dealer and a dedicated friend to administer the narcan.

I'm not an anethesiologist but google says [[https://www.amboss.com/us/knowledge/Skeletal_muscle_relaxants][succinylcholine]] is a skeletal muscle relaxant with an onset of 1 minute and a duration of 5-10 minutes. If you had a trained assistant and the appropriate resources this seems perfect as you could be sedated during each potential possession with 50 minutes of uptime on the hour.
