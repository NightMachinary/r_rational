There wasn't that much inquisition going on by the 18th century generally speaking and when it comes to inquisitions throughout history they mostly took place in areas of contested religious entrenchment.

That's why the Spanish and Polish inquisitions are some of the most well known and bloody. The purpose of inquisition is to root out heretics and heathens and inquisitors not only cost the church money they also often cost the church popularity, which doesn't often matter until the aristocracy start feeling the heat.
