That primary/secondary goal seems a bit weird.

Imagine your family were strong swimmers and you had some knowledge about the expected power of the explosives. You might fulfill the primary goal but to fail the secondary by having your family dive into the water and start swimming away. By the time Joker's mics and video cameras picked up the splashes and he pushed the detonator to kill everyone still on boat, your family would be 10 meters away and underwater and survive.

Yay! Per the prompt's goals, you'd have succeeded. But you've caused the deaths of 197 people!

Why isn't the goal to save as many people as possible, regardless of their relationship to you?
