Seems unnecessarily complicated. What if the detonator is fail deadly? You cut the keep-alive signal with the cage and everything explodes. Also I have doubts most people will be able to macgyver an effective faraday cage using scrap in such a short time.

I think more effective would be to try to locate and disconnect the detonator's power source. Locate battery, cross your fingers and rip out anything connected to the terminals in one go.
