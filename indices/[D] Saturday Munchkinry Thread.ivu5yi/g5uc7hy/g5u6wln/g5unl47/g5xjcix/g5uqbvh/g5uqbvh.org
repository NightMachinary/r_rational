Get 20 people down in the engine room and pull all the detonators out of the barrels. Gather everything together and have 5 man slowly carry it up and throw the detonators and car batteries overboard.

Find someway to drain the power out of the car batteries in a quick but steady manner. Find a way to connect the batteries to the ships power system and turn on every single device that uses electricity.

I'm guessing ships probably have pumps for clearing out water in case it get's flooded, you might also be able to pump all the explosive liquid off the ship. Edit: I think the explosive might be something along the kinds of ANFO, so it's probably not liquid which can't be pumped
