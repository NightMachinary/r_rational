[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D4qvaLpHfw][You are in the last scheme of the Joker in The Dark Knight.]]

It's night. Just past the moment where it was "getting dark" to "is dark". You are in a ferry boat going out of the city after threats from the Joker. It is filled with civilians - you and your family among them - and a few military personnel, as well, of course as the ferry operators. Nearby, there is another ferry boat filled with prisoners, also taking them out of the city. The boats are moving when suddenly, the engines stop. Radio is down. In the engine room, there are ~100 barrels filled with some unknown explosive substance, ready to detonate and also a box. In the box, a detonator.

Joker's voice then comes out of the speakers. He tells you that if anyone tries to leave he will blow everyone up. He tells you that at midnight he will blow everyone up. However, each boat, he says, has the detonator to the other boat, and if one of the boats blows the other boats he will let that boat live. A Prisoner's Dilemma, except there is no option that benefits you both.

However, there are a few caveats:

- You have no reason to believe the Joker that the detonator you carry blows the other boat and not the one you're in.
- You have no reason to believe the Joker will be true to his words and spare the remaining boat.
- It is dark. Although the Joker says that if someone leaves he will blow up everyone, someone might be able to escape without been seeing by anyone observing, if they are careful. But then again, maybe he has made some sort of mechanism that will blow up the boat if some one tries to go outside. You don't know.
- You have no reason to believe Batman will stop the Joker.
- You have no reason to believe that someone on the other boat will not push the button.

You can try play the Joker's prisoner game, or you can try to get creative.

There are hundreds of people in your boat. More than 100, but less than 500, probably in the lower half of that range. Some of them might have useful knowledge for certain situations, but you shouldn't expect anything exceptional. Likewise, many of the people there have brought their stuff with them in the boat, after all, they were fleeing the city -- same things applies, there might be useful things there, but you shouldn't count on anything exceptional.

Your primary goal is simple: Ensure you and your family survives. Your secondary goal is to ensure everyone else, or, at least, the most people possible, survives.
