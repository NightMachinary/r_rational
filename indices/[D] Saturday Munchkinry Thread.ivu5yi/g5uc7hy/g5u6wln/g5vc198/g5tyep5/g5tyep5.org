Every hour, god rolls 1d100 and if you roll a 1 a spiteful demon will possess you for 10 minutes. The demon can access your memories and intelligence, and is completely rational with an utility function the same as to yours but with the sign flipped. How do you live a normal life and maintain social relations?
