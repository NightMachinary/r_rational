You don't have to present it to the world like that. I'd just say I have destructive seizures which require restraint. Sure the time thing is weird but it's plausible enough that I wouldn't consider a real-world bout of periodic siezures to be strictly impossible.

All of this requires you to have a baseline level of resources. A broke kid would probably be screwed. A trust fund baby or a guy who can bring in significant income freelancing (like a highly successful day trader?) would be able to bring the required resources to fight the issue. I mean, if I told you I'd double your salary to follow me around 12 hours a day to oversee my restraint, wouldn't you agree to it? Night time is even easier, you'd just restrain yourself until morning.

It would be weird, but I think it would be possible to make it work. I'd rather deal with this situation than, say, be a quadriplegic.
