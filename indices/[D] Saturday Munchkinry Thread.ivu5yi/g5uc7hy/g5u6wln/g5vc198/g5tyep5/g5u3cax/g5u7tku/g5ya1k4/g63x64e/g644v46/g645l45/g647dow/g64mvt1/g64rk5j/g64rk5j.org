Strong disagree. If your disability is one that is understood and accepted, you can live a "normal" life in the way that you mentioned, with assistance.

Absolutely not in this case. Nobody is going to believe you have the possibility of being possessed by actual demons at the entirely arbitrary time frame of 10 minutes out of the hour at a chance of exactly 1%.

You will find zero resources to help you.
