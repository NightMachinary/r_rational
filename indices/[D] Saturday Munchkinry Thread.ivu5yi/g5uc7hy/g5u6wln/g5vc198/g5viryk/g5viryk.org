  but you'll need to forge copper and spin wires yourself in a medieval blacksmithery
#+end_quote

The obvious starting point is that you don't have to, except for the parts necessary to make the elemental "weapons". Charcoal/coal were a significant portion of the cost to produce metal goods during that time period. As soon as you reach a point where your "weapons" can substitute for forges and smelters, you should have no problems at all recruiting craftsmen or paying for their service. From there it's a matter of teaching as quickly as you can so that they can make everything you personally aren't required to.

  Does unlimited electricity let you skip to aluminum immediately?
#+end_quote

Not immediately, since even unlimited electricity requires a lot of capital to get going. In practice, even if you could you'd still be better off aiming for modern steel. It's also extremely common once you have the tools to create it, and for most things is a superior "general purpose" metal. If you have unlimited access to medieval craftsmen, modern knowledge, and energy, it should be very simple to get something like the Bessemer process running, which lets you bootstrap to modern steel relatively quickly. Mass affordability of metal is a massive gamechanger, on par with the engine or electricity.

  How much does having <x> amount of guaranteed free water impact agriculture?
#+end_quote

Depends on where you are. Anywhere arid, then it's obviously a massive change. For most places, though, I'd bet it would be more along the lines of "nice, but your time is better spent elsewhere". In practice, the most immediate use of generating pure water is to guarantee clean water supplies during sieges. Also, a shipment during certain plague outbreaks would be a huge lifesaver before modern medicine was available.

I'm assuming this is /pure/ water, right? If not there's all sorts of potential for chemistry if you're able to get things in solution, even if it's only things that might believably found in water supplies.

  Are there any clever ways to leverage things for travel or QoL?

What "elements" are available. Is "force" a valid element? That could give you what is basically a single component airplane engine. Heck, depending on how generous the system is you could combine that with an air generating weapon for basically a reactionless spaceship.

Actually, even the elements you already mentioned give you that. Water+electricity means you've got the important parts for a perpetual hydrogen rocket. Heck, once you've gotten metallurgy and whatnot going, it's probably a lot more feasible to terraform Mars with these than it would be with modern society alone. Though even with all these advantages, it would be tough to accomplish in a single human lifetime.
