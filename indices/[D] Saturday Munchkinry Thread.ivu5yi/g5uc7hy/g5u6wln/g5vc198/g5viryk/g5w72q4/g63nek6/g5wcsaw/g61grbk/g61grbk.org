What counts as a weapon? Is that a huge limitations on the shapes you can make, or is anything you could use to bash someones skull in valid?

How does size of the weapon matter? If it scales with size, then you could make gigantic artillery pieces to produce huge amounts of energy for forges and the like for relatively little personal labor. If it doesn't matter you can make needle-sized mini swords and pile a huge amount of them in a tiny space for extremely concentrated energy.

It's worth mentioning that just the stuff mentioned so far, knowing about guns, and using the power in the /obvious/ and non-munchkin way would let you generate obscene amounts of money by selling it to the king making his armies dominate all neighbours and loot them.
