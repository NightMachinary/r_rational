Trading sources of infinite pure water for labor seems like a viable method of bootstrapping. Even if a town or city has a reliable source of water, making a portable water generator would save a crazy amount of labor in getting the water from point A to B. And then if you make enough of those water generator items, it can protect against droughts that would otherwise cripple a village. Plus, you can spray water on plants to protect against hard freezes that would otherwise cripple a harvest.

And if you're in a less advanced setting but with your modern knowledge, you could sell them as wards against disease, because they basically are. A large number of diseases are transmitted through water, and you could basically eliminate those diseases wherever you sell your water makers.
