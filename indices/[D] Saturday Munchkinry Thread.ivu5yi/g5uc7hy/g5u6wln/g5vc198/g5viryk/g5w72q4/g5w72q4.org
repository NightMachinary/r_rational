Good stuff. Thanks for the ideas

--------------

I realized I should have clarified the wording I was trying to munchkin and my goals a little better.

#+begin_quote
  Magic: Enchanting\\
  You can grant magical properties to weapons by marking them with ancient runes. Right now you only know how to give weapons elemental properties but you can learn more enchantments by studying other enchanted and magical weapons.
#+end_quote

A better way to put my original question is this: "The main character can make elemental weapons and has had this power for a couple of years. When the story comes back to them, what's some believable (and clever) things you might expect to see them having munchkinned?"

--------------

#+begin_quote
  What "elements" are available. Is "force" a valid element?
#+end_quote

Force is probably not valid.

In general, I'm interpreting it to mean that you start with the ability to enchant anything is a 'conceptually central' element according to pop culture. That is, whatever TV shows or videogames consider as elemental: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Ice, and Lightning.

Research into stuff that is sometimes considered an element is fast enough to be within the scope of the story (Light, Dark, Gravity, Vacuum), but would take long enough the main character wouldn't have enough time to munchkin them. Esoteric magical stuff is /eventually/ possible (infinite hardness, time magic, zero width weapons), but is outside the scope of the story.

  I'm assuming this is pure water, right? If not there's all sorts of potential for chemistry if you're able to get things in solution, even if it's only things that might believably found in water supplies.
#+end_quote

It's 'pure' water, but not molecularly pure. It should contain whatever you'd expect from a pure mountain spring or a snow melt.

#+begin_quote
  Water+electricity means you've got the important parts for a perpetual hydrogen rocket.
#+end_quote

That's electrolysis, right? Looking more into it, it seems like a lightning sword underwater would create a lot of hydrogen and oxygen gas from that effect. That seems like it solves a lot of the problem with the weapons being always on but having no way to store that energy.

The more I think about it, "Steel -> More Steel -> ALL THE STEEL" seems like a viable tech path. I guess I discounted how much completely ignoring input energy matters for that project.
