If I were an expert electrical engineer, I would do the following:

1. Locate the detonator on the bomb. DO NOT TOUCH IT.

2. Figure out how it's supposed to get the signal to blow. Judging by the Joker's previous devices, it's probably a jury-rigged cellphone.

3. Tell everyone on the ship to collect every single scrap of thin wire on the boat. Wire jewelry, bra underwires, unspooled cables from non-critical systems on the ship, anything at all.

4. Wrap the wire into a Faraday cage around the detonator. If possible, test that it works on someone else's cellphone before covering it.

5. Hope we found all the detonators.

However, the situation as you described does not guarantee anything I could do would work. There is too much uncertainty to make a solid plan.
