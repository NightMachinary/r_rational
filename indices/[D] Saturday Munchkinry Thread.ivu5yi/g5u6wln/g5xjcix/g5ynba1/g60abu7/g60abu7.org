I considered fail-deadly detonators, but that is unlikely if the reciever is a jury-rigged cellphone. It certainly could be modified to explode on hanging up, but given that cellphone reception on a ferry might be patchy, assuming the Joker wants his game to actually play out and not end in equipment failure, and assuming that the device is similar to the one implanted in the dude in the drunk tank earlier in the movie, it is likely to work by detecting an incoming call instead, with tamper resistance working locally.

Any bomb removal tech will tell you that any bomb designer will have planned for the "rip out the wires and pray" strat. That's pretty much guaranteed to kill everyone on the ship assuming the Joker continued to display even a fraction of the competence he did earlier in the film.
