  “God is One and His Name is One. God is One with His Name. People always say God isn't a person, but then what is He? To me, He's always been a sort of logical necessity. The necessity for everything in the cosmos to be as good as possible. Understand goodness and you understand God. Understand God and you understand His Name. Understand the Name and you can remake the world. That's the kabbalah. The rest is just commentary. Excruciating, unbearable commentary that kills everyone you love.”

The final proof of God's omnipotence is that he doesn't have to exist in order to save everyone. And in the end, it turned out that God wasn't really aware at all, 'he's' just the abstract principle that whatever is best, must exist.

All the instances of 'God' speaking were Metatron, who is just a more good aspect of our particular universe.

If we call God a conscious being who created our universe by an act of will, in Unsong *there is no God*.
