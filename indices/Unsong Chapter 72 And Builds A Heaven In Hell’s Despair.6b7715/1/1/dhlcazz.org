Yeah, this. It pretty strongly fails as a conclusion, in my opinion. It's /also/ not very strong as a chapter? Zips too fast past moments that ought to have some weight to them? Like, even if you want to show things happening very quickly, you can still linger on impact, emotion, inner monologue, etc.

Generally speaking, you want the climax to feel "worth" the words spent on it, and this was too little for me. I think it was nowhere near the high-quality-water-mark of the story overall.
