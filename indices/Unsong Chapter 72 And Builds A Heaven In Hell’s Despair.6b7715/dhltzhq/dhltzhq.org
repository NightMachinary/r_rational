Interesting effect of the morality in the story: You're morally fine with not doing anything good, since somewhere else someone would do that good for you in a different universe if you didn't. Universes only exist when they are morally good on the net; thus nothing you do can be a net bad, across the board, since you can never do something bad that has a net effect on the sum good in the universe.

Thus, striving towards whatever is best for you is morally ok, since none of your actions can produce a net moral good anyways.
