That was quite possibly the weirdest piece of fiction I have ever read. And it was sort of perfect, in that. It managed to move me, atheist of atheist, materialist of materialist, to something of a religious exultation. Insofar as the context of fiction considered I can say:

"The LORD is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him"
