Rearranging Presley gets you PSER LEY. PSER is of course Latin /passer/ meaning sparrow. (Thanks Catullus!) LEY is the hard part, but the etymology of "lye" yields Old English leag. The Modern English "league" is phonetically similar. The archaic Japanese measurement sometimes called a "league", the ri, was 2.44 miles. 244 = 144 + 100. 100 = 10^{2.} 10 is the number of God's law, so 100 is God's Law multiplied by itself. 144 is a number that means a great multitude. Therefore the name "Presley," means a "sparrow who twists a great multitude of the Law back unto itself."
