But No God is like Nogod which is like nougat. Nougat goes inside chocolate as a filling. Chocolate is sweet and can there for stand as a metaphor for goodness. The universe is good - see happiness maximizer god. There for the universe is filled with Nougat and hence God. The universe is in the shape of man and man is in the shape of the universe, so man is also filled with God.

Hence, by there being no God, there is in fact a God within each of us.
