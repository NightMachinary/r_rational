That's as far as I'm got in that actual list before I got bored. These classes are chosen primarily because they are high up in the alphabetical listing.

This is generally a bad idea because formal school is mostly useless so you should approach it mostly with the mindset of getting credentials.

You should likely know about macro picture of infectious disease - agriculture - famine triad.

You should know a thing or two about the largest non-English speaking cultures, as they will be the major vectors for the above, and also will rapidly develop new tech.

You should know basic economics - how the federal reserve works and so on.

You should know how humans impact ecology.

If you don't want to be a specialist, then do not bother with unfriendlyAI or nanotech, or meteors. Only specialists can help there.

(But dude, remember, your goal is to /actually save the world/, think carefully if majoring in "Saving the World" is actually the path to that solution.)
