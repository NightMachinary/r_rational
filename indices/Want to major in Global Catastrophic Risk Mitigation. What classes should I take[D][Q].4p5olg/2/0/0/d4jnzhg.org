  In that case maybe I should go into computer science.

It's a solid field to go into financially speaking, but you're not realistically gonna steer AI in the right direction or be meaningfully recognized as any kind of expert with an undergraduate degree in computer science.

Do you /like/ computer science? Are you especially gifted in computer science already? I feel like this is ultimately the bigger question. We're not short on humans, so do something which is in your comparative advantage.

If you want to literally design AI and AI safety protocols, what you should actually do is major in Math (applied /and/ theoretical) and/or /Computational Neuroscience/ if it's offered. You should read this to get a sense of the path: [[https://intelligence.org/research-guide/#one]]. You might want to read everything written by [[http://mindingourway.com/moving-towards-the-goal/][Nate Soares]] actually. I'd also consider just contacting MIRI now and asking for advice.

Otherwise,

These are the standard paths:

Academic: Apply technical prowess to an important problem. If you make important discoveries people listen to you. Choose Applied mathematics, engineering, computer science, or any physical, natural, or social science.

Capitalist: Make tons of money in business. Use money to solve problems. People will listen to you if you have money. (Double if you are doing products they use every day - Elon Musk, Steve Jobs). Choose an Engineering, Computer Science, or /applied/ Mathematics. Probably not basic science, although if basic science is your passion it is certainly workable.

Activist: The art of influencing /other/ people to do things. You can choose practically any field for this one, it doesn't really matter. It's a side job, not something you get paid for, but it can be very effective, and it pairs nicely with the other paths. Yudkowsky was essentially doing activism by starting Lesswrong, successfully. If you do want to credential yourself for this, consider going pre-Law. Law school is the most well worn path for elected politicians. A politician is basically a sort of activist under this schema.

Employee: Donate your money. You're inherently a contributing member in this route, the free market isn't perfect but unless you go into something particularly evil you are almost certainly helping someone and making a small impact simply by working. Going into the trades is the fastest way to make substantial amounts of money. Blue collar jobs often make better money than white collar these days. Otherwise, Engineering or Business will get you a solid job. You could also go Med/Law school route but that takes even more years. Don't be put off by the sound of the word "employee" - a doctor is an employee, for example. It doesn't make you a drone.

Bureaucrat: You can get /quite a bit/ of power by joining the Federal Reserve (if you're into econ) or affiliating with the CDC (if you're into biology), becoming a diplomat, advisor, etc. Realistically that's the sort of path you'd end up in if you tried to major in a generalized "saving the world" degree (where you studied disease and poverty and econ and all that). I might be wrong about the specifics, but there's generally a genre of advisory roles, and these sorts of people (not politicians) do the /actual/ work of managing society. You want a mix of specialization and generalization for this one, and it's probably the sort of thing people who'd major in what you are envisioning would end up doing.

I think essentially, you should decide if you primarily want to solve social coordination problems, or technical issues, or just amass sheer power. If technical issues, you need to specialize. If social coordination problems, then you can generalize and do econ and whatnot in addition to having a grasp of science and it would be acceptable to do this "saving the world" degree idea. If amass sheer power, you need to focus on money and politics. You could conceivably do /two/ of those things (a socially active academic, a socially active businessman/engineer, a socially active doctor/lawyer/etc, a tech-savvy generalist, and so on) , but probably not all three.

The effective altruism community offers coaching on this sort of thing I think.

Also, keep in mind I'm being agnostic with respect to what your passions and skills are because you haven't said. But it matters, a lot. And I'm only putting forward the obvious effective-altruist paths, there's a ton of other non-conventional paths.
