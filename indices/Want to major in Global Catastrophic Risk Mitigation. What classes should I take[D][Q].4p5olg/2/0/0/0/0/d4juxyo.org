Thank you :)

  if you genuinely believe that civilization will collapse in 4-9 *years, you should be learning something like the Primitive Technology

That's for surviving the collapse / minimizing the fallout, not preventing it.

But, yeah, if someone believes in collapse and wants to prevent it, the situation is pretty desperate and I wouldn't be sure what to advise. The possibility of collapse happening /now/ seems small enough to not devote that many resources to.

In the "chicken-little was right after all" scenario where someone has /high confidence/ in collapse but no one else believes it, I would say "what do you think you know, and why do you think you know it", and if they can give a convincing answer, then they should take that answer, figure out how to stop the collapse. The first step in "stopping the collapse" probably means locating the people who can help stop it, and explaining them the reasons. If everyone /does/ believe you then the aforementioned paths are probably (?) still the best bet for organizing society towards the solution.

Global warming is a good case of a scenario where pretty much everyone who knows anything agrees that it's a problem but civilization is too inadequate to fix it. The solution would be to rapidly plant trees as quickly as possible. Here's the world record for someone doing just that - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_GreenHands]].

So [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]], if you really think the end is very urgently nigh, then you might take a leaf out of Jaggi Vasudev's book. Or hell, even just throw yourself into engineering and computer science and math directly, skip the bs. It's not necessarily /safe/ as a life path but I certainly won't tell you not to.
