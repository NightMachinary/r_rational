In that case maybe I should go into computer science. I'm thinking I want to raise money and awareness for AGI safety research, but people aren't going to listen to me about AGI safety unless I've actually got credentials in that particular field. Even if that means I have to go to grad school and if there's only so much I can do with my degree by the time I actually graduate from grad school, at least making that my area of expertise will hopefully make it easier for me to raise money and awareness even before I graduate from grad school.

I'm still worried that I won't finish my schooling fast enough to be able to make much of any difference, though...
