I'm not sure why you keep saying that there won't be much to do with your degree after graduate school.

Do you think that existential risk will go away by the time you graduate? Then there's no point in "majoring" in X risk reduction because you expect it to have been dealt with.

Do you think there will be a civilization collapse in the time between your undergraduate degree commencement and your graduate degree commencement?

If so, will the catastrophe be averted by the addition of one unconventionally trained entry level worker in whatever agency hires you?

With all due respect, it's easy to get caught up in the dramatic rhetoric that EY uses about X-risk. But you are not acting as though you believe a civilizational collapse is imminent. To take the philosophical ideas behind Xrisk or Effective altruism seriously, your best program is one that has a clear path to monetization and in which you have some talent.

People get specific majors because there is help with job-finding. If you make your own major, you will have to convince a recruiter that your unique (and untested) skill set is more suited to the task than, say, a computer science major. Building your own narrative is important, but right after college you also need to land a job.

*edit to add: I'd suspect an undergrad version of advanced finance would be far superior to an undergrad version of advanced economics w/r/t understanding how the Fed works.
