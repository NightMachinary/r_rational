I don't know if I like computer science or not. I took an introductory database class and kinda liked it, and I took a Geographic Information Systems class and it wasn't really interesting to me. I have no interest in politics and I doubt I would have the skills for it even if I was interested in it. Problem is that if I don't get credentials related to AGI nor get a lot of money then people won't listen to me about AGI-risks, and AGI is the main GCR to focus on because it is nearer and can help deal with other GCRs.

Not sure what I should do now.
