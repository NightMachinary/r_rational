To be honest, I'm not sure if it's a good idea for me to do path 2 or not. While it would make it possible for me to directly contribute to AGI safety research, it would take a long time. I'm going to school part-time right now and I'm in my third year attending my university. I'm worried that by the time I get out of graduate school there won't be much left for me to do with my degree, if anything. If that's the case, then my time and effort might be better spent focusing on path 1.
