I don't think this subreddit is a good place for this topic. I'd suggest [[/r/ExistentialRisk]], but it doesn't seem very active. Maybe [[/r/EffectiveAltruism]], [[/r/Futurology]], or LessWrong.

As for the question itself, do you expect other students to also follow the major you design? If not, it might make sense to just design the major around what you want to do and what you can get approved, instead of worrying about what the hypothetical other students would do. If you know of specific other students who are interested in such a thing, you could consult them. If you are planning on getting other students interested in global catastrophic risk, then that's great, but I'd guess that designing a major around it and hoping people take it isn't a good way to do that, since there probably aren't any classes that are directly about GCRs anyway, even though there are a wide variety of classes that are useful for people interested in reducing GCRs. Since there are so many subjects that are relevant to GCRs, I'd suggest not worrying too much about people's specific majors and what classes they're taking when doing outreach.

As for what you should take yourself, that's also hard to answer, and largely depends on what you're interested in, since again, there are so many subjects that relate to GCRs.

If you're not already familiar with it, there appears to be a [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups#Columbus.2C_OH][LessWrong meetup group in Columbus, OH]], which may have other people at Ohio State interested in GCR, who you could consult for advice specific to the university. I'd contact them before showing up at the meetup location, because LW wiki descriptions of meetup groups are often out of date.
