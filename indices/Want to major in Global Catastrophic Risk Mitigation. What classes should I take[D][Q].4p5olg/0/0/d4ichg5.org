I'm not entirely certain, but right now I'm angling towards 1, maybe with a bit of 2 for a minor or something. Not 3 though, since I doubt I could handle politics.

I'd like to be a jack of all trades in the field of GCRM, but I also want my future work to actually make a significant beneficial impact, and if I can't do that with option 1 I am willing to focus more on option 2 instead. However, option 2 depends on being hired by an organization involved in GCRM. The main pressing GCR right now is AGI. As far as I'm aware, MIRI is the only organization that is doing AGI safety research, and I don't know if they'll have positions open or not by the time I finish my schooling. Option 1 has the best chance of being applicable to my future career, and I might or might not enjoy it more, but I wouldn't mind contributing to AGI safety research too.
