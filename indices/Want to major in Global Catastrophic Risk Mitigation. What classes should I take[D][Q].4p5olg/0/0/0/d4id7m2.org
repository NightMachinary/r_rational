Unless you do some serious self-learning and gain employment at a research institution (which is an awesome goal but a hard path), you'll need to go to graduate school. Path one would let you decide which field is for you, so you can do path two in graduate school.

If you want to self-learn, I recommend crafting your schedule with that included. For example, you'd take an intro course on computer science while in your own time working through /Learn Python the Hard Way/ or a like text. That's six hours per week of CS class, plus /x/ hours of CS self-learning. Multiply that by five, or decide to only self-learn a couple topics per semester and devote your summers to more. Also factor in time for sleep, exercise, and play. Make a calendar with all this planned beforehand, and ample room for rearranging as you find clubs, friends, and other activities that may alter your schedule.

If you haven't yet, find a Professor doing interesting research and ask to join the team. Now. Check online and send e-mails asking for who is doing what, and request via e-mail while at the same time stating you're free to meet in person. If the departments are still open, walk around and ask. If you're having difficulty deciding, you could join multiple teams, but the time commitment may prove prohibitive to maintenance of your sanity.
