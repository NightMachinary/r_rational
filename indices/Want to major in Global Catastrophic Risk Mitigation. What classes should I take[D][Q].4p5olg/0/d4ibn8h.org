To answer this, consider your goals. There are 3 most likely goals I can think of:

1) You find this an interesting area and want to be a jack of all trades in this field. In this case, you'd want a selection of courses covering a number of the areas you mention. This could be tricky because there are so many distinct fields that are related. Philosophy, varying sciences, politics, education, business, finance, and more. You can't become an expert in all of these.

2) You want to be a technical expert who can help develop solutions to one or more of these problems. In this case, I'd say you should change your plans and focus on the hard sciences specific to one particular problem. For example, chemistry and climatology to develop an otherwise-harmless chemical we can release into the atmosphere to raise our albedo and counteract global warming.

3) You want to have decision-making power to actually select and implement good ideas developed by the #2s. In this case, you either need to go into politics or become so wealthy that you can substantially influence important politicians. The selection and implementation of key ideas will have only a passing connection to their technical merits.
