A GM who thinks this through wouldn't allow this unless you can:

- prove that you have access to tools which can create the object. Or that they even exist.

- Then start rolling skill checks to see how many you can separate without a single scratch or dent, and without bending a mirror. Either event turns it back to scrap metal because you'd have to start over to make anything useful out of it. The non separated block is just a large brick worth less than the raw material.
