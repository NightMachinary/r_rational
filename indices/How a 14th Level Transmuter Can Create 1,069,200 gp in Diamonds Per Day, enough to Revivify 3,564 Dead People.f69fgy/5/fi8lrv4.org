After some thinking, I think it would be under RAW to do what you are doing. The one assumption(?) I'm making is that for the purposes of magic, it's the base price of the item that is used. Trying to actually sell those mirrors would result in a large decrease in selling price due to negative modifiers, but the base price would stay the same.
