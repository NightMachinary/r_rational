I think the bottleneck then becomes spell slots to actually cast resurrection and/or raise dead on all of the dead. It might work well to undo damage from large scale catastrophes, but day to day death is still going to be a problem. Spellcasters are usually pretty rare, especially high level ones, so keeping up with ongoing death is probably a losing proposition. Also I don't think either of those spells work on old age.
