Flooding the market isn't necessarily a factor. A spell will require "a [object] worth at least [x] gp". It doesn't really make sense for that to be any kind of market value, so that implies that magic itself can effectively act as a price floor on any reagent usable as a spell component.

Take Runescape for example. Every item in the game has a market value on the Grand Exchange, and an inherent High Alchemy value. If the Grand Exchange price ever drops too far below the High Alchemy price (less the cost of Nature Runes), then people training magic will buy it up to use High Alchemy on, driving the price back up.
