The issue though is that if value worked by some random dude being willing to buy it for that much you could just value a random drawing you scribbled in crayon at 10 million GP via calling it art and having your team mate buy it. And if that /did/ work then you wouldn't need mirrors at all, just set arbitrarily high prices for otherwise useless things then transmute them.

That said, I would agree that it should have a pretty high value, although given the difficulty in trying to sell it (because nobody is going to want to buy 100k mirrors that aren't even in real mirror form) the value should be far less then the nominal amount of so many mirrors.
