The assumption he is half making is that "true value" has nothing to do with market forces, it's like there's a god of artisans that goes, yep that's worth X gp, you can transmogrify it to an equivalent value item. That's actually a reasonable explanation for the magic - something has to be keeping track of the worth. In the sense that this is an rpg of course it is just a simplification that means a 5 gp mirror is both worth that amount for magic and sells for that amount normally.

They should be two separate currencies.

I argue that it makes more sense for the magic to work as first described and not care about the actual real life sell price
