There's a crucial leap of logic he's making here that I don't think is correct. Fabricate lets you create a single object, the big stack of mirrors. You then have a big stack of mirrors, not 108,000 individual mirrors. A big stack of mirrors isn't by itself worth 5gp * 108,000, it's some other value we don't know. You can break up the stack of mirrors into individual mirrors, but then Major Transformation wouldn't work on it since it would be 108,000 objects and the spell only works on a single object. There's no way Major Transformation is intended to transform a whole bunch of low value individual objects into a single valuable object.
