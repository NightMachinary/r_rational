"Steel" is anything from 0.022 to 2.14 wt%C, but alloys with 1-2.14% carbon aren't commonly used so they don't get another name for the category.

There's AISI 1018 steel and AISI 1030 steel (0.18% and 0.30% carbon), which are collectively known as "mild steels".

There's AISI 10130 steel and AISI 10180 steel (1.3% and 1.8% carbon, respectively) and so on, but there isn't "Super high carbon steel" or whatever.

(Why is 0.022-0.05 wt%C simultaneously "wrought iron" and "steel"? Good question.)
