re: "raw iron":

The material that is fed into (both modern and ancient) steel-making processes ("pig iron") is /very/ high in carbon. If you want Fabricate to act as a bloomery/blast furnace, then it would /produce/ carbon instead of consuming it.

--------------

Also, nomenclature of iron-carbon alloys is strange.

0-0.05 wt% C: Wrought iron

0.05-0.30 wt%C: Mild steel.

0.30-0.60 wt%C: Medium steel.

0.60-1.0 wt%C: High-carbon steel

1.0-2.14 wt%C: steel

2.14-6.7 wt%C: Cast iron

--------------

When something says it is made of "iron", that's ambiguous between wrought iron (low-carbon, highly processed, bendable, doesn't hold an edge, etc.), and cast iron (high carbon, less processing, rigid/brittle, very hard).

At least "steel" is one continuous set of alloys.
