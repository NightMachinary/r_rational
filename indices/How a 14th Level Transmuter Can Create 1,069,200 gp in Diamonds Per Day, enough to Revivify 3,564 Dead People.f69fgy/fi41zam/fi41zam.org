Re: the “flooding the market with diamonds” comment at the end: is there some sort of computer tracking system you can use in a pen-and-paper RPG campaign, to add a realistic economy to your game-world, that all your NPCs are participants in (including the ones in towns you haven't built out yet)?

I imagine you'd have to have some pretty interesting knock-on effects to make such an economy work. E.g. the amount of gold mined out of the ground in the world by all cultures/races would have to be known and tracked, and the value of gold be set by that, so that introducing a dragon hoard of gold back into circulation wouldn't throw off an economy.
