I really liked one interpretation I read of Salazar's views. He didn't hate muggleborns, he just thought that they should be taken from their parents and raised completely in the wizarding world. The main reason being because back then humans were basically living in huts in the mud, (9th century) hence the term mudblood. I believe he thought it was cruel to make them live like that, without being able to do magic to make their lives better until they turned 17 at least.

Of course this doesn't really apply with modern technology giving almost any muggle much of the same conveniences wizards have enjoyed for centuries. Ironically, with modern technology I would consider it cruel to make someone live where computers and phones didn't work for most of the year.

I can't remember exactly where I read it, but it was in a time loop story (possibly Innortal's) and I believe the context was he discovered portraits of the original founders and spoke with them.
