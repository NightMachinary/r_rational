I think Hermionie would be a fantastic rational protagonist in this story. If you haven't already, I'd recommend you read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]]. In the story, Hermionie doesn't have any specific goals other than surviving the dungeons, but the author does a fantastic job with the whole thing. Additionally, it's not unreasonable for Hermionie to be extremely mature for her age.
