Riddle founded the Knights of Walpurgis (with, at the very least, a Lestrange) when he was at Hogwarts in 1940, and the Death Eaters were already extant by the time the First Wizarding War starts in 1970. Grindlewald's machinations back during World War II are never given a proper name.

Evidence of Snape's experiences with his friends from those pensieve visions seem to imply that muggleborn prejudice was a Slytherin thing by that time as, indeed, Voldemort's reign of terror had already been in effect for a few years. The Order of the Phoenix is founded some time in the 70's with Snape as a double agent.

1980 is the year he overhears Trelawney's prophecy.
