That doesn't really fit though, because that was before the rise of the Death Eaters, and the modern 'All Slytherins are Evil' meme. Certainly Slughorn didn't seem to have an issue.

Grindelwald wasn't a Slytherin, he went to Durmstrang. And if anything, the social examination from a muggle standpoint at that time would seem to indicate that the treatment of muggleborns or magical creatures was about to spark a Civil Rights Movement (which would have been rather recent memory).
