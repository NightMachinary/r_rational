  Political Science professor

With the insight as described, go with History or Conflict Analysis professor. Political Science covers systems of government and the world of politicians rather than past movements in society and how those movements informed events or change -- the latter would fall under the purview of historians. Conflict Analysis puts an emphasis on applying historical insight to the present, which is really the training I think you're looking for in your protagonist.
