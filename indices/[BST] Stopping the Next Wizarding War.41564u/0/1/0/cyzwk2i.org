I don't want to make my protagonist so skilled that they can stand toe to toe with Lucius in their first year. They should slowly work to that level over their time at school Time travel is always ridiculously complex, so I think that it's probably best to stick with the 6 hour maximum. This could allow him to gain 25% more time to learn but not enough to make him instantly super smart and knowledgeable on world politics.
