I haven't decided exactly how intelligent I want my protagonist, but you're correct that it may be a little extreme to have them immediately see the problem. My idea is for them to simply have a normal ambition "eg something like immortality, or end all poverty with magic" and over time as he ages he notices the similarities and works to stop it.(At least to explain his knowledge of history and politics I plan to make one of his parents a political science professor who instills in him a high level understanding for his age). However I don't want him to be some kind of super-genius like harry in HPMOR. He can have a crash course level of knowledge in a few subjects but he shouldn't have the knowledge of a PHD in every subject under the sun or I wouldn't find him believable.
