  In this story I want to have a muggleborn get accepted to hogwarts, and the more they learn the more they fear that the Last wizarding war was no different than WWI, and has merely set up perfect conditions to bring about another war. Fearing what another war would be like this protagonist will join Slytherin and try to show both his fellow Slytherins and the world that ambition and evil aren't the same thing before it's to late to stop the war.
