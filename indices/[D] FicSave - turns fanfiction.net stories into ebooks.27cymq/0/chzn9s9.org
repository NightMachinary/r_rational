If you happen to be using [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] for reading or organizing ebooks on Windows (and syncing with devices, etc) there is a [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=163261][fanfic downloader plugin]] which creates .epubs that can then be converted to any number of other different software.

Pros:

- Supports lists of fanfics to do batches of them.
- Supports a ton of sites (almost all major repositories of fanfic that aren't absurdly terrible*). Includes: fanfiction.net, fimfiction.net, twisting the hellmouth, archiveofourown.org, etc. (list is huge).
- Can check for updates and download them and replace epubs etc. automatically.
- Output is very readable with TOC based on the fic's internal chaptering and formatting etc. preserved.

Cons:

- Program runs very slowly (not optimized well) so if you're doing a batch of lots and lots of fics be prepared to leave it running in background for several hours

Usage Notes:

- Good for long lists of stories, but takes a long time (set up and let go overnight if doing hundreds of stories at once).
- The checking and updating of hundreds of fics also takes a longish time.
- Never seems to have any significant processor or memory load.

*Absurdly terrible ways of storing fanfics that are widely used is mostly forum threads, e.g. stories posted only on Beast's Lair or Spacebattles etc. I haven't found a good way to get a story from a thread to .epub that doesn't involve passing through the step "copy and paste into a word processor or something similar, by hand" yet - if anyone finds something like that let me know!
