I also endorse Calibre. A minor correction, however: it's not Windows-only. I use it on Debian to manage my Nook Touch. There's also a plugin for downloading news websites on a schedule and formatting them as ebooks. I get the latest issues of LWN.net, Phoronix, Anandtech, and Al Jazeera every time I plug in my ereader.
