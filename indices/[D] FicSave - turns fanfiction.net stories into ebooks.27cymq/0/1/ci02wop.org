Another endorsement for Calibre here. Even if I didn't have an ebook reader I would still find Calibre very useful for keeping a library of documents.

For downloading just any old random web-page stuff into ebook form, I recommend the browser extension [[http://www.grabmybooks.com/][GrabMyBooks]]. It's very good for doing things like compiling a bunch of forum posts into a book, you can select just certain elements from a page to save and you can combine stuff from multiple different pages into a single book as separate chapters. Even includes images.

I've set up my installation of Calibre to automatically incorporate any documents it finds in a specific directory into my Calibre library, and I save the output from GrabMyBooks into that directory. So it's very quick and efficient for getting stuff from the web into a nicely-formatted ebook in Calibre, just a few clicks.
