In that case the null pointer exception is because Fallatehr is using "hide soul" or some skill (hide your name from the world even from gazes on your soul").

But this theory must explain how fake!Fallatehr activated the pelehr. So the prediction is that then soul magic has some range in some capacity, or he taught it to some of his minions. Or it was done earlier when they were carrying the nonanima.
