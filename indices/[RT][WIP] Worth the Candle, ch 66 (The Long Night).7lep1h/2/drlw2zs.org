The soul mage is a "deviant" elf? Assuming that's not all just affected behavior to trick people, this is solid intel. If Juniper can research what "normal" elves are like then he can hopefully get a better picture of what what kind of person the soul mage is, which could help a lot in figuring out how to handle him.

Also, and this is probably just paranoia, it seems really convenient that the member of the party who's getting the quarantine treatment is the only one that Juniper is unable to vet via soul link. Plus, because Grak is getting treated like a leper the odds are negligible that he'll reach loyalty 10 before the current crisis is dealt with. Then again the soul mage couldn't have known who they were going to leave behind at the prison via teleporter, so this is probably just a coincidence.
