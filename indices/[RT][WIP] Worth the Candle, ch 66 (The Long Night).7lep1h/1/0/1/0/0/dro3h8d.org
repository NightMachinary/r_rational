I think that makes more sense if you consider Loyalty a representation not of a linear scalar magnitude, but rather of something like negative-log Bayesian uncertainty in goal-planning where reliance on predictive modelling of the trustee is concerned.

If that's the right model, you could raise loyalty very quickly by simply deciding to not let a few of your doubts about a person affect your judgement where goal-planning is concerned (i.e. decide on actions /as if/ the trustee were perfectly reliable and honest.)

It's not really about dispelling doubts; it's just about suppressing their effects on your behavior. Mary's really good at that.
