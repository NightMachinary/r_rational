His reaction to nearly everything has been smooth. Taking what's happened so far into consideration, I'd put low odds on Val's outburst being genuine.

Why did she wait until she was going to be taken away to reveal the "truth"? Because she didn't want to join Falletehr again or was afraid he'd do something to her without the gang seeing? It would've been far easier to voice her concerns when they were speaking in confidence.

The paranoid part of me sees her saying “You have to believe me, Juniper, please!” as especially suspicious. She's actively appealing to emotion, whereas she was withdrawn and meek when her Loyalty was rising. Something like "Juniper, please don't send me with Falletehr because x,y,z" would be much more effective, assuming she still thinks like a person and isn't mentally stunted (or possessed by a more devious devil).
