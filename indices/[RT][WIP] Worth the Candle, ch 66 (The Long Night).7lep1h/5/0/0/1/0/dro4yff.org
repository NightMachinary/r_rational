That's a good point. An appeal to emotion after moving away from the "safe zone"? That's definitely evidence for possession.

Counterpoint, though - there's weak evidence from the point of view of a potential loyalty shift. We haven't seen sudden loyalty shifts cause dramatic changes in behavior before, but we've also not seen such a meteoric rise in loyalty either.

I'm still on the side of Valencia telling the truth. That's more due to a lack of trust of Falletehr than it is trust in Val at this point, but I'll toss my flag in the ground here. I'll also say that it's possible that that was a demon telling the truth in order to create discord.
