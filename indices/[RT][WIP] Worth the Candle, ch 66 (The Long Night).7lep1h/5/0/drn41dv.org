  Alright, I get that the outburst from Valencia changed nothing - but was anyone else seriously unnerved by it all the same?

Here's a thought: Why bother to do it if it changed nothing? Like, /maybe/ generic "sowing discord", but we're already not trusting Grak.

In fact, let's assume it /is/ true: what does that change? We'd know that Falletehr is untrustworthy and preferably needs to die.

Actually, perhaps what it /does/ change is that if there were some way of accessing Val's memories (for instance, perhaps giving her a soul and then using soul magic to look at the memories), then Grak's status could be verified and if compromised, then they could decide to kill Falletehr already.
