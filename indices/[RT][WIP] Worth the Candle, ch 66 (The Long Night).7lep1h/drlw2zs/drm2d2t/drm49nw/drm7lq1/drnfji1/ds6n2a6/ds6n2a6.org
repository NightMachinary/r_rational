the change to the minions only occured when joon healed them. Fallatehr in any body could have adjusted their souls hours in advance I think.

I just went back and confirmed this in chapter 62. !Fallatehr touches them on the forehead and the recoil a bit but that could all be an act in line with his already demonstrated flair for deception. I still believe that Valencia is Fallatehr either by possesion or not (no proof that she is actually a nonanima).
