They should just teleport her to an area with a thick barrier between worlds, or use wards. Bam, more reliable witness (since loyalty probably means she is more likely to tell the truth). Also possible source of intel on Falletehr.

They could also possess her with a soul/demon that they know wont lie, perhaps one from thier flask of dead. Then use that to get at all the memories.

It seems like they want to treat her like a leper and ignore here even if she is trying to tell them something. Cultural blind spot? One that Falletehr may share? But perhaps not if he saw some experimental value in her at least and he doesn't follow cultural taboos.
