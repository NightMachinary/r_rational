I will say that the one thing we can learn for sure from the incident comes from Fenn and Mary. They didn't notably react or care at all. Given how rare anima allegedly are, that's... surprising. Possibly worrying? Seems like their anima perception is ingrained, and potentially something that potentially came from plays or media - Fenn's not much of a reader. That would make it possibly inaccurate (and Valencia is in no place to correct them).

Asking Fenn or Mary about anima in general seems like a good idea.

I also don't like Falletehr's reaction. It was a bit too smooth. I vote that she's telling the truth.
