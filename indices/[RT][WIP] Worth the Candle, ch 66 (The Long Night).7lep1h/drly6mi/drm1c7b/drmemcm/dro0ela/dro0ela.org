Which brings up the thorny and awkward problem if whether loyalty actually measures true loyalty in a spectrum or whether any loyal feelings automatically bump up the arbitrary Loyalty number by x. It can even be loyalty to Joon as an asset, rather than to his person. How reliable is the number for Valencia (who can be possessed - it would be funny if the possessing devil were forced to adopt and operate under Val's loyalty numbers) or for Amaryllis (who once raised it several times with a few seconds of internal rationalization)?
