But conversely, Joon's main skill - rapid onset of basic competence in skills that take natives years to acquire - has huge benefits for Fenn to have even a little bit of it.

If he's at Level 2 in anything, she can skip years of apprenticeship....heal (if inefficiently) with bone magic, light a dark room with blood magic, see into her own soul (and his) when he gets enough skill in soul magic, etc. etc. etc.

It's one thing to say they're soul bonded and she won't lag behind, another that she gets competence in each individual skill entry. That will be extremely useful to Mary. Also, half of Fenn's ranged skill is still pretty ridiculous for Joon...I wonder if she'll be able to spread those skill points across her character sheet when she gets a bit more soul magic?
