Glad it interests you!

College initially took me down the engineering route. Did two years of that before I decided that other aspects of business were more my passion - I'd rather spec out a product than implement someone else's ideas. (I do have my name on a couple patents, too, for my day job.) I've never lost the love of how things work. All that is to say I've got a bit of a technical background.

Beyond that, I do a ton of reading and asking what-if questions that lead me from one point to another. A lot of them are technological dead ends from the book's point of view, but knowing what doesn't work is as important as knowing what might.

I've read series before that several books in just start breaking the laws of physics so much that I have to put them down, and I want to do the opposite of that here. Biology is one of my weaker areas, so when it came time to do the background research on plausible nanotechnology, it took me days or weeks, I don't remember exactly (part time, not full time). I researched neurons, learned a ton about how the brain physically works. I have the nanotechnology in my story inserted and flushed out by the cerebrospinal fluid during sleep. Why? Because I have notes that say things like: “The brain has a unique method of waste removal, known as the glymphatic system, a kind of plumbing system that washes away toxins by pumping cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) through spaces between brain cells. Interestingly, Xie and colleagues found that the glymphatic system was almost 10 times more active during sleep. In addition, they saw that cells in the brain "shrank" by 60 per cent during sleep. This contraction creates more space between the brain cells and allows CSF to wash more freely through the brain tissue.” [[https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health/article/1412641/sleeping-allows-brain-cleanse-itself-too-much-harmful][referenced article]]

Instead of me just arbitrarily saying that the nanotech goes into your brain between the brain cells and stays there forever, I try to ask the question “what would happen to the nanotech if we put it there?” Let physics guide the tech rather than arbitrarily saying that this is how things work for no apparent reason.

It's interesting to me and if a reader says, “hmm, I don't think that would work”, and pushes at it a bit, the more they look into it the more believable it seems. I'm sure I'll fail at that a lot, but we have to aspire to something.
