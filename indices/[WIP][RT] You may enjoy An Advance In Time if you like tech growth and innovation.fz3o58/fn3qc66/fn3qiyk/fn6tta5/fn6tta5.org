I rewrote the summary. What do you think?

In the year 2050, nanotech was invented that allowed humanity to do what it does best: ignore reality. Jason was a project manager at Razor, Inc. where those simulations were crafted and improved every day.\\
That is, until an accident with a power outage and a poorly-coded backup protocol saw his consciousness transferred to a server and his body in a coma for the foreseeable future.

With the corporate vultures circling around what they see as a new piece of company software, Jason ultimately found himself in one of the simulations he used to work on with a new set of objectives:

1. Survive the medieval setting

2. Build a Kingdom from scratch before ten years are up and end the scenario

3. Prove to the rest of the world, who will be watching him closely, that he's not going to be a crazy human / AI hybrid that would take over the world if given half the chance.

4. Figure out how #2 and #3 are compatible...

His modern knowledge of technology, chemistry, and physics is a huge advantage, but he wants to reinvent centuries worth of advancement in a few short years and innovate like his life depends on it. Because soon, it will.

If you enjoy kingdom-building, strategy, technological progression and big challenges, you'll likely enjoy An Advance In Time.
