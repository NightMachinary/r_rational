Haven't really read anything yet since I usually wait until stories have 200-300 pages, but I would seriously consider rewriting the summary. It told me nothing about the story except it involves someone named Jason making advances in technology, probably using nanotechnology.

I don't know what the world is like (is it modern, was he transported to the past and has to recreate technology, is he at the forefront of a singularity, etc.) Most importantly, it doesn't grab me. I think it's because it's too meta, in the sense that it's talking about what the story is about from a meta narrative perspective instead of letting us have a look from inside the world.

In any case, I'll be checking this out sometime soon considering the dearth of new rational content during the lockdown. So good luck!
