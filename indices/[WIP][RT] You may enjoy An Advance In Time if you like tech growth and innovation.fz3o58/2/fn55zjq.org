Solid prose and an interesting start. I have to admit that the company deciding that a time-compressed medieval survival adventure is a good use of AI time was a bit of a strain on suspension of disbelief, but it's justified enough that some allowances can be made in the name of a cool premise.

I'm always a sucker for industrialization, so I think I'll be watching this.
