Sorry for nitpicking (just means I like the story) . How exactly did the aliens detect the message transmission back to Earth, if it was a directional laser? I would think a message laser can't be detected unless receiver was directly in its path. On the other hand, a non directional radio transmission if strong enough could also transverse the unknown wormhole back to Sol system far more quickly than any laser, since that's only a billion km away ( assuming it didn't attenuate to noise by the time the signal reached it)
