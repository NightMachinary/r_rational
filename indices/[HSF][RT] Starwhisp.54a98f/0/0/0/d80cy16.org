I see. I thought the expansion was implied in being a r-selected species. I'll have to think through the evolutionary game theory implications. Would definitely like to see more stories in this universe, even if it makes me sad. BTW, Have you read Niven's /Mote in God's Eye/ ? One of my favorites, and quite similar in theme to your story. Worth reading.
