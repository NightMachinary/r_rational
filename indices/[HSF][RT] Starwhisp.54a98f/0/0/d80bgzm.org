The Iktotch genuinely don't care about expansion or exploration. They have a map of the network from some previous species but they haven't gone further than Tau Ceti because they only colonise new star systems when one group fissions due to civil war and strikes out for new territory. That's why it's taken them 15,000 years just to get that far.
