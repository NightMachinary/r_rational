I don't really get why they surrendered at first but then changed their minds. I mean, being conquered by others and forced to do things they don't like is already pretty normal to them, no? If anything, the only consequence of being conquered by humans is that they will have to do weird shit and have a much bigger chance of becoming independent conquerors again since humans are so dumb as to give their slaves all kinds of freedoms.

And do all the attacking forces belong to K'txl? Otherwise, what made them all suddenly cooperate to stop the humans? In fact I already find it weird that K'txl is speaking for all of the factions and is willing to send so much of her army to stop humans even though it will definitely open her up to be conquered by many more overlords.

Lastly, why was K'txl physically at the front of her expedition? I guess if you think you're alone in the universe (species wise) then being the first to get away from another planet in civil war actually makes you safer.
