I can say with very high confidence that Bavitz is not Yudowsky or AWales. Bavitz includes a conspicuously large number of Canadians in their works without actually setting the story in Canada, something that someone who is not Canadian would never do. And Yudowsky definitely isn't Canadian and I'm pretty sure AWales is not Canadian. Seriously the number of Canadians in Bavitz' stories serve no purpose except for stroking Canada's weird inferiority-complex nationalism where we want to be acknowledged but the US overwhelms almost all of our culture.
