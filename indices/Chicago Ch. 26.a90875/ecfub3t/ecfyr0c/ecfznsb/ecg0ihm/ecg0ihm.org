I don't think Wildblow has time to write so much in addition to his other works, but it's honestly much more likely. He shows a similar pattern of wanting to show off Canada, albeit much more subtly than Bavitz. In Worm, Dragon was from Newfoundland then later based in Vancouver, and Canada was specifically mentioned a couple times to be in a super-hero pact with the USA. Pact was actually set in Canada.
