I don't know why he thought people would hate the chapter, that confuses me. I wouldn't say I loved this chapter but I thought it was of the standard 8/10 quality Bavitz usually puts out.

I agree I want to know what's up with Cook. But even more I want to know what's up with the Handmaiden(who I think must be an adult too). Cook I'm guessing became friends with the empress a couple decades ago, helped run the empire, has ambitions of her own and isn't super-tied to the empress but wouldn't betray her for no reason. Probably not too deep.

But the Handmaiden is trusted with a mysterious position above DuPage or Cook and we have almost no information on her. She's a disciplinarian judging by her interaction with Clownmuffle, but I think that's the only info we have on her.
