Fargo is as depressing as TTS is optimistic. For Fargo, there is a fundamental and deadly mistrust between magical girls that fragments their society and keeps them on the brink of despair; TTS, on the other hand, dreams of a society where fundamental trust over centuries is leveraged into one of the most fascinating and well-worldbuilt TRUE utopias I've ever read in science fiction, not even just fanfiction. I love them both, but they couldn't be more different.
