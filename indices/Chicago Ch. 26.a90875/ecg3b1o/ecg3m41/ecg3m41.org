This is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][Fargo]], both are Puella Puella Madoka Magica fanfiction. If you haven't seen Madoka I heartily recommend it as well, it's a magical girl anime that has some excellent twists as you get further into the series, it's only 13 episodes plus a movie. Then the fanfictions are about cute teenage magical girls being gritty and depressed anti-heroes in America(with a large amount of Canadians characters for no particular reason as I mentioned elsewhere).
