What is so fundamentally different about her threatening people as compared to, say, Bitch standing nearby with a giant dog to threaten them? Or Tattletale with a gun, or Regent etc etc. Or just keeping them all blinded and deafened by Grue?

All I'm saying is that Skitter threatening them with bug-bites was not the one single true way they could have done crowd-control with out directly hurting someone.
