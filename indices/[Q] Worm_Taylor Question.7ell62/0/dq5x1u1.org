Taylor seems rational to you because you took her internal monologue at face value.

She's a good example of a person who desperately needs to believe that she was right justified in what she does, and so tells herself whatever she needs to to achieve that.

Her actions are not rational, but she persistently rationalizes them to herself.

Wildbow is about as clear as he can be about this while writing the story from her POV - there are times that she begins to see herself as what she is, usually when she compares herself to others, and she very quickly retreats from that, focuses on something closer at hand, and rationalizes to herself why she has to do something foolish and/or needlessly assholish because of that. That's not a one-time thing, either, it happens again and again and again throughout the story. and when she's depicted as others see her, she's pretty consistently described a lot differently than the way she sees herself - that difference is not just because nobody understands the real her, it's because she also doesn't understand herself because she's constantly talking herself into seeing herself however is convenient to her current impulses and issues.

The actual Taylor is a well-meaning but delusional hypocrite.
