Well, Taylor would certainly have been a kinder jailer to Dinah than Coil. She would not have kidnapped her from her family during relatively good times, for starters. She would not have intentionally addicted her to drugs to keep her under control. She would, as long as you didn't get her time to prepare her counter-arguments preemptively, never keep the girl if the girl begged her to be released.

Would she keep her on the drugs, though? I wouldn't be surprised at all if she would look at the poor kid suffering through withdrawal and decide it's better to wean her off slowly, and conveniently, hey, Taylor is in a great place to keep supplying her with the drugs while she gets off of them and keep her safe in the interim! Except that you can't have a stable environment around Taylor. She's always picking fights with dangerous people. Dinah might miss a dose here and there because Taylor's out fighting someone, or their supplies got destroyed in a raid or something. She might take extra when she figures out where the drugs are stashed, since she's addicted. The whole weaning off thing may never happen. It wouldn't be because Taylor's trying to hurt her, but she'd get hurt, and as long as they're still working on it, she might as well provide Taylor with all those predictions. After all, it's to help everyone.

End result, she winds up hiding out in a supervillain's bunker, serving as a causality radar, wishing she went home months ago but unable to due to a combination of fear and dependency. But you know, at least Taylor will feel kind of bad about it and feel the need to reiterate to both of them that it's really for the best.
