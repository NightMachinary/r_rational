Thanks for typing this all out. I've heard these arguments before, but I never really realized the extent of it.

I think maybe you're being a bit hard on Taylor about the Dinah thing. If I recall correctly Dinah herself started freaking out about the possibility of her parents not wanting her back, and other fears. And I think that's likely what would have lead Taylor to think "She'd be better off staying with us" if Dinah hadn't given her that probability. Also I sincerely doubt Taylor would have kept Dinah against her will. At worst she would have subtly manipulated her into also thinking that staying with the Undersiders was in her best interests... which is bad yes. But Taylor would have actually believed that (in part because she's so good at justifying things to herself).

But other than that... yeah. She made a lot of very questionable decisions for reasons that don't make any sense if her goals were altruistic.
