Dude I was in the exact same scenario as you. Hated literally every single thing that taylor did. It all felt so hypocritical and stupid and when I went to [[/r/parahumans]] to discuss this, they all /agreed/ with taylor. I was like wtf, literally thought the worm fanbase was insane.

But really, you should finish it. The world building is so ridiculously good and interesting that tho I hate taylor, I love worm.
