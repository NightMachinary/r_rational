When she surrendered to the PRT, the conversation went like this:

Taylor: I'm a criminal warlord with a list of charges pages long that literally includes treason. I'll plea out, you leave my supervillain friends alone to run their criminal empires, the local PRT Director [Tagg, who is too military-minded and uncompromising] retires, Miss Militia [well-respected cape with great integrity and ability to listen and negotiate] gets installed as new Director, and you use me as a resource to do good. If you don't agree to these terms then in a few hours my friends, who are known murderers with superpowers, will declare war on the PRT. Oh, and I'll bend on the "use my powers for good" part -- you can just send me to your hell-prison if you want.

Alexandria: I'm one of the three most powerful heroes in the world and a critical element in the frequent fights against the giant kaiju that are slowly destroying civilization. I'm not accepting your terms. I'm going to go capture or kill your friends, one by one. [does so twice, tranquilizing one target and breaking limbs of body-puppeting sociopathic rapist in the process] Okay, now that you see I can do it, here are my terms. Your friends don't get amnesty and can still be targeted by cops. I release the ones I just captured, with all necessary medical care. You get two years probation. Tagg stays in charge. Miss Militia is promoted elsewhere.

Taylor: No. and if you hurt my friends anymore I will kill you.

Alexandria: [goes out, comes back with a body bag. Taylor does not know who is in the bag]

Taylor: [suffocates Alexandria with bugs, gives Tagg a fatal number of venomous bug bites]

I'd say that was some over-the-top escalation.
