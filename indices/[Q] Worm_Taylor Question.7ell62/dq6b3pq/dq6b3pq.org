The main problem with Taylor is that she never, ever, asks for or accepts help. She could have gone to the administration every single time the Trio did anything to her, forcing them to eventually do something about it just to make her shut up and go away. Instead, she bore it for a year and a half with almost no protest. /Sophia,/ of all people, is the one to point this out. The Protectorate would have bent over backwards to have someone as powerful and versatile as her. If she'd been with them the whole time, they would have dropped Sophia in a second the moment Taylor learned who she was, just to keep her on. She completely ignored the advice of anyone around her in that regard. She fought Lung instead of calling for help. She joined the Undersiders planning to betray them without asking anyone if that was even a good idea first. She took it entirely upon herself to take down Coil and barely acknowledged the fact that it only worked because Lisa had done all of the work in the background. She turned herself in to the PRT without telling anyone on her team what she was planning. Without even coordinating with Lisa, who could have told her how to actually get what she wanted.

She takes on Scion, alone, after asking Amy to mutilate her brain. Sure, she recruited the help of literally everyone else, but she never even noticed Imp keeping her company despite having access to probably dozens of parahumans who could have identified her. The only time she accepts anyone's help is when she is literally bodyjacking the universe, and even then she only accepts that help dispassionately.

The list goes on. Taylor is allergic to even thinking about depending on others. She always keeps everything close to her chest, even and especially when that is detrimental to her. It's this attitude which makes her so desperately lonely the entire story, and she never once realizes why. If she'd put even an ounce of effort into it, she could probably have had a healthy relationship with Theo, but she couldn't see that possibility floating in front of her face because she had to face the Nine and the end of the world alone, alongside Theo. It's madness!

But it's fascinating madness, and it's so well done that we don't even notice it's happening on the first pass. She looks like she's being reasonable. Her distrust of everyone else seems justified because she always remembers the times people screwed her over and never remembers the little kindnesses. How many times does someone save her life, with her barely acknowledging it after? How many times does she sieze on betrayals great and small and use those to confirm her preconceived notions?

Too many to count.
