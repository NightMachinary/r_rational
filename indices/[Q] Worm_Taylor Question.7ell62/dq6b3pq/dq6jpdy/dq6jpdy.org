Her second relevant trait here is her ready acceptance of suffering/responsibility. She doesn't fully trust anyone and assumes she alone has to do everything.

When her mother dies she just accepts that her father is useless forever. Over years she just considers him an inanimate fixture standing in the back-ground that has to be worked around.

Did you notice that even as a motormouth, bright-eyed child she only had one single actual friend? And when she turns on her, she asks herself why that happens, but soon accepts that Emma has just one day become evil and will forever be her nemesis. No attempt to investigate, never talking to Emma's parents (as far as I can tell), never talking to her own parent. The world has just changed and Taylor will have to suffer forever.

There are more examples, but they mix together with her accepting no help. In sum, she acts as if the rest of the world were a game and she the PC. She is the only actor, she is responsible for all problems in the world, the world is often out to get her and everyone else are either obstacles or have to follow her commands.
