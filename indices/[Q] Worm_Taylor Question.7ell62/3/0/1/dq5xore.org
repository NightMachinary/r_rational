She started the fight with Lung instead of backing off - this is explicitly a suicide attempt, even. The entire thing with Alexandria happened because she had already held a city hostage and was making reform demands to the 'good guys' - she had refused to 'lose' and accept other deals a few dozen times before Alexandria even showed up. Etc, etc.

She compartmentalizes things with a vague 'moral code' justification - The entire saga with Dinah/Coil is the obvious example - and instead of taking relatively minor losses, she escalates. Rather than be a Ward, she joins the Undersiders. Instead of accepting fault for her earliest crimes and joining the heroes again, she fights against them and accepts being Coil's minion. Rather than report the Dinah situation to the heroes and working something out with Lisa, she kills him herself and becomes a full on warlord. Etc, etc.

I say all of this as an absolutely rabid Worm fan; these things are exactly why she's an interesting protagonist in the setting.
