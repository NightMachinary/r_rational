See, she gets into these situations where the only way out is to escalate, but it's her own damn fault she ends up there in the first place. She rots off Lung's crotch because she attacks alone without coordinating with anyone or going for help. She drowns Alexandria with bugs because she turned herself into the PRT as a power-play and wouldn't compromise. She shoots Aster because... Well, I'll give her that one. Things had gone to shit at that point. And the bank heist thing - she /robbed a bank with the baddies/, guys. That'd just not justifiable. She could have opted out, said she wasn't comfortable with it, whatever, and the Undersiders would have likely listened. But she didn't. Instead she /robbed a fucking bank/. In the scenario in which you find yourself doing something as obviously villainous as /robbing a bank/, you have to ask yourself - could I have forseen this? Did I seriously expect to do this with no complications? Is this worth it? Yes, no, and no, in most cases. But Taylor wanted to take out her anger on something, to feel wanted and competent.

That's why she's so dangerous. She isn't /rational/, she's /clever/ and good at /rationalizing/.
