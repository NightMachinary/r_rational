(Minor note; Aster was in the Nine's power, under Jack, and at the time they had a member who easily and willingly condemns/condemned people to eternal torture with no way of ending their suffering. Taking the shot to kill Aster was knowing that Jack could make that call to Grey Boy at /any moment/ out of his normal whimsical sadism, and was probably planning on it. Him doing that was (if I understood correctly) what Theo was expecting and was most worried about.)

(The comments in this large thread have all been very enjoyable to read! Some specific examples bear argument, but most--particularly for viewing Taylor's decision-making-process as less-than-optimal--have been very enlightening! I'm in a similar position of enough time having passed that I couldn't think of such examples when actively trying to, but when reminded of them remembering them (semi-)clearly.)
