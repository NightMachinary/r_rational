I recommend listening to the podcast We've Got WORM. They go into great detail on how she self-justifies and compartmentalizes throughout the story, and it makes it very clear how much of an unreliable narrator she is.

Arc 1: She decides to attack Lung and his gang members instead of attempting to call the Protectorate. She justifies it by thinking that it would be difficult to find a phone to do so, but there are a ton of different ways she could have gone about it (knocked on someone's door, break into an empty house, find a police officer). Her real reason for attacking them is that she came out in costume looking for a fight. Not joining the Wards in the first place is escalation.

Arc 2: Bitch attacks her with her dogs, and she immediately responds aggressively to this. It works for her, but it could have just as easily escalated further.

Arc 3: Instead of listening to Armsmaster and just telling him what she already knows, she decides to rob a bank in the hope that she'll get more information about the Undersiders. During this, she threatens hostages with black widow bites, and attacks multiple heroes by forcing bugs down their throats or beneath their eyelids.

Arc 4: Emma insults Taylor, and her response is to say something along the lines of "You don't know anything", laugh and leave school. She doesn't do this because of true self-confidence, she does it because she just robbed a bank and is still high off it.

Arc 5: Taylor punches Emma at the mall because she smiled, throws papers onto the floor during a meeting at school, leaves to go fight the ABB even though she's still recovering from a head injury and was explicitly told she doesn't have to join the fight. While fighting, she cuts out Lung's eyes, justifying it by saying that she had to put him out of the fight and that he'll heal from it anyways---even though he's already out of the fight, and he's been shown before to have really good hearing when empowered.

I could keep going for more and more arcs, but I think the point is kind of made. Even in the first five arcs, she's more violent than she needs to be, and confronts situations that she doesn't need to when she could just as easily back down and get her comeuppance later.
