I'm not arguing that she was an uber-rationalist, but she was unusually rational for a bullied teenager. Edit: her shard is also egging her on

1) Her bully was on the wards. She could have told the Protectorate about Sophia's habits, but it would be Taylor's word against Sophia's. She had know way of knowing that Sophia wasn't a well liked and respected member of the team. The second time she tried to Armsmaster he burned her, so she would've had to start with a criminal record. It became sink or swim.

2) She went hoping that she could prevent someone from getting hurt because the team did not have any powers capable of subduing a crowd without hurting them.

3) She didn't know about the girl before deciding to rob the bank. That course of action was fueled by personal guilt. She knew that turning Coil down might bring reprisal, so she was trying to release his hostage which is a step in the direction of bringing him down. By the time she decided to be a "warlord" Brockton Bay was in chaos and she was providing aid and law enforcement.
