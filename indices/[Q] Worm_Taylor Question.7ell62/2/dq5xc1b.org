  As far as I can tell, Taylor made the sort of ruthless decisions she made because she had to.
#+end_quote

Did she have to join the undersiders, and perform a high-risk high-gain gambit, rather than say just join the wards like a normal teenage hero would?

Did she have to go rob a bank, just because she wanted to get an even juicier bit of information?

Did she have to become a warlord just to save a kidnapped girl, which wouldn't have been kidnapped if she hadn't gone to rob a bank?
