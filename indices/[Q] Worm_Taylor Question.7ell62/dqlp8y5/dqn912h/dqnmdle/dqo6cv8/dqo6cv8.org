Weren't most (possibly all?) of the people she killed done so in self defense or because they were an active threat to BB? Even so, at this point in the story, I don't think Taylor had killed /that/ many people. Though I could be wrong there, for certain.

Taylor did have chances, yes. But she didn't want to compromise and risk both her friends and the people in her territory. BB's administration had demonstrably failed them, particularly after the Leviathan attack (not really blaming them since, ya know, /water kaiju in a fucking bay/) so she wasn't inclined to trust them.

The deal was certainly reasonable. But Tagg had demonstrated that he was a massive asshole. And Alexandria were threatening (and seemingly carrying out) her friends with death. I think Taylor's actions in that context were emotionally charged, hasty and somewhat self serving. But I wouldn't call them irrational.

P.S Any chance you recall what chapter that took place in? If not, that's fine, I'll track it down myself. Was just curious because this discussion has made me want to re-read that particular exchange.
