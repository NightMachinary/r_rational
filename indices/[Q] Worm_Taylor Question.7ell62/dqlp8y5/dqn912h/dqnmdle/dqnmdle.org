  can you reasonably be expected to think "Maybe they're bluffing and that's some unrelated mook in the bag" as opposed to thinking "Oh fuck, she killed one of the only people that accepted me."

Taylor had three chances to take what was, frankly, a very reasonable deal. She had killed lots of people, committed huge numbers of well-documented crimes, and Alexandria was telling her "no prison time, only two years of probation." Taylor's choice was "kill one of the literally most important people in the world" or "give up on a set of demands that I have admitted are unlikely to be granted."

Seriously, how is this remotely defensible?
