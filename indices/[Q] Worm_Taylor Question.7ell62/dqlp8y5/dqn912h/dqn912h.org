Rationally speaking, taking out Alexandria was a move Taylor shouldn't have taken because of her importance to the world, true. But if someone tells you they will capture/kill your friends and then returns with a body bag, can you reasonably be expected to think "Maybe they're bluffing and that's some unrelated mook in the bag" as opposed to thinking "Oh fuck, she killed one of the only people that accepted me."

Especially considering that, right before that, she went out and brought back two targets that you knew (or as good as knew) were said friends she threatened?
