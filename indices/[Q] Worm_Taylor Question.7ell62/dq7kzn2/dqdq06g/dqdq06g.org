That's really over-dramatic and also not what literary criticism is about at all.

The characters being discussed aren't real people. Pointing out character flaws as a step of critically analyzing a novel shouldn't make anyone feel superior to them. The actual reason people dissect characters on a deeper level than the superficial is because it enhances their enjoyment of the novel.

  Talking about how superior you are to a person or character that others dare to admire is a very popular pasttime on the Internet, and it seems to propagate virulently and drive out admiration.

I think you're bringing external baggage into a situation where it isn't relevant.
