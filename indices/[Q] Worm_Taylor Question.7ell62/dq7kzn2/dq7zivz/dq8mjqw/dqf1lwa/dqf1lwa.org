  If you look at the contemporaneous comments on the chapters as they were posted, did the readers work out much wiser solutions than Taylor took, on average? I'd rather bet against it.
#+end_quote

Alright, you're on. I will go to the chapter where Lung first appears, which I think most people critical of Taylor would mark as her first really irrational move, and look through the comments to see what people thought. When I get back, I'll report on my findings.

--------------

There are 21 comments in total, including replies.

Of those, I count 8 whose comments seem to imply that they are reading the story for the first time.

I count two comments which seem to accept her course of action at face value:

#+begin_quote
  As well, I really enjoyed the fact that Worm didn't really know what she was getting herself into. Even with online research, sometimes the bad guy might have a super power you just don't know about.
#+end_quote

To me this seems to indicate that this reader isn't considering about not fighting as an option.

#+begin_quote
  This chapter works as a great way to compel the protagonist to action, giving her a clear enemy, a compelling reason to fight him despite her reserved and cautious nature, and establishing the danger of the situation.
#+end_quote

This person seems to consider what's happened so far to be "a compelling reason to fight".

And I count two comments suggesting that she is unprepared for this fight and unlikely to succeed:

#+begin_quote
  Taylor sounds really precocious. If Lung's beaten whole teams of heroes, then why does she, a neophyte, suppose that she can take him down?

  So, she can just start fighting crime without any formal training? You'd think there would be some kind of training program for aspiring heroes.
#+end_quote

Now, obviously this is an admittedly minuscule sample size, and the test should probably be repeated for a few other key scenes, such as when Taylor tells Armsmaster that she's going undercover. But even so, half of the people who commented on her decision to fight Lung pointed out that it was a bad idea. Nobody chose to offer suggestions of alternate choices she could have made, which is unsurprising given the small number of comments in early chapters, but it wouldn't be hard to think of some alternatives once the decision to not fight Lung has been made. Despite the fact that I have an information advantage over the character due to knowing what happens further in the story, I don't think it's impossible for her to have considered using her bugs to get someone's attention as a means of calling for help.

--------------

After writing the above, I went back to check the comments on the next chapter, where the fight actually begins, and found this comment:

#+begin_quote
  Decided to go back and re-read this. Gee Taylor if you can't make a phone call, why not have lightning bugs spell out “Lung Here” in the sky? What do you mean this isn't the Silver Age?
#+end_quote

Granted, that is an admitted reread, but it further demonstrates that I'm not being particularly clever by thinking of this. It is very much something anyone could come up with, and is a much better solution to the problem. The reason Taylor didn't think of it is that she didn't make any honest effort to try thinking of alternatives to fighting. At most, she thought of calling for help and then dismissed it almost immediately. This is something that people reading along with her story were at least in some cases aware of, even while limited to working with the same amount of information as Taylor.

Whatever her merits as a character, despite her courage and determination, despite even the creativity and intelligence that she demonstrates at other times, she is a profoundly flawed character and one of the most glaring of those flaws is that she's very prone to rationalization rather than rationalism. She makes very bad decisions frequently, and she doubles down on those decisions rather than admit defeat, because she consistently convinces herself that what she's doing is right rather than honestly considering whether or not she's in the right. She is not an especially rational person, nor was she ever intended to be. She is an emotionally vulnerable, emotionally unstable young woman with no relevant training that would allow her to make good decisions in the situations she chooses to involve herself in. It is not a criticism of the quality of the character to point this out, nor is it an attempt to seem superior by bringing low a well respected character. Her decision making skills are not something she is well respected for, and criticizing them does not undermine the things she is respected for.
