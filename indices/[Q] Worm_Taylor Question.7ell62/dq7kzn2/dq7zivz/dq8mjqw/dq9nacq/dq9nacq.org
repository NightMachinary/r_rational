a) The discussion is not about saying that the posters would do much better than Taylor in her situation.

b) The discussed actions are not something specialized she trained for (eg Being A Quarterback), but something she does as an untrained amateur. Discussing alternatives as fellow amateurs is not Monday-morning quarterbacking.

c) Several posters considered these alternatives when the chapters were new. I do not see how Hindsight bias is important there, especially as some of the proposed alternative actions might easily have had worse consequences for Taylor than what she actually did. (eg complaining about the Trio more regularly and going to what we now know are corrupt authorities.)
