I'm not sure whom you are arguing against because it is not me.

I never said that people would or would not do "better" than Taylor. In fact I directly said in a) that this is not what the discussion is about.

I do not agree with your distinction between "distinctly irrational" and "normal". Taylor is an emotional traumatized teenager going through several extreme situations. In her circumstances, acting "distinctly irrational" may be considered normal in my opinion. The the brand and degree of irrationality depends, of course, on the person. Though, again, I'm not sure why you bring that up since I do not think I ever claimed that Taylor was either before this post.

Similarly, "she's particularly irrational" is a flaw. Also not something I have ever claimed, though apparently we both agree that she does act irrationally.
