... I do not know about normal, but my very first impulse on hearing about Taylors power was "So it is a story about someone being a hero in a non-combat way?".. I was rather disappointed in where it went instead, because frankly, bug control has insane espionage and utility potential, while only working on a super powered battlefield as a weapon because the author is loading the dice hard.

Anyone with area effect attacks or just.. decent armor.. should have hard countered her into irrelevance even without knowing about her. Once she became infamous, and people still showed up on battlefields vulnerable to her stick, my suspense of disbelief just broke.

That does not mean she is not a world changer. She is a walking panopticon with added large scale fabrication ability and agricultural applications. Why, exactly, is she under the impression hitting people onna head is how she, in particular can make the world better?
