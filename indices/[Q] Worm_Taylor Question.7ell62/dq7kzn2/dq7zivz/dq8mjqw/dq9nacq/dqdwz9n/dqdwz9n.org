If normal people wouldn't do much better than Taylor, then it's odd to characterize Taylor as "a well-meaning but delusional hypocrite" for her actions, as the top comment in this thread does. Then we're talking about her being /normal/, rather than distinctly irrational -- and I definitely think she's often portrayed as distinctly irrational.

If you back down from "she's particularly irrational" to "she has flaws", then that sounds like a motte-and-bailey sort of argument.
