That's harsh. "Explain how an entire category of opinions is baseless because the people having these opinions have cognitive/psychological biases that are below me" is also a popular status game on the Internet.

I don't think you're status blind. I think you see status differently, and you have little regard for how most people attribute status, but aside from that you play status games too. You've used the "people disagree with me because they're limited by their perception of status" card before, for one thing.

Aside from that, I thought that some of Taylor's decisions were weird or suboptimal during my first readthrough, mostly in the early story. Namely, trying to go undercover in a criminal group without government backing (especially after a government agent explained to her why this was a stupid idea), staying on that course after she learned there was a powerful thinker in said group, and going back to that group after she basically got a pardon from the authorities.

Maybe I would have made the same mistakes in that situation; I would probably have made other mistakes. And she has in-character reasons for doing those things (distrust for authority, etc). But I definitely noticed these things on my first reading, so it's not just hindsight bias. Also, Wildbow has talked about Taylor character's before as being self-deceiving and semi-suicidal and stuff on occasion, so that's another data point.
