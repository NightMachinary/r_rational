It's amazing how you can contribute nothing of substance except to brag about how you're immune to cognitive bias and then accuse everyone else of trying to seem superior. This is far below the standard of discourse usually found around here. Are you new?

If so, there are some lovely links in the sidebar you should check out, to learn more about the study and application of rationality. I especially recommend the writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky.
