It's weird to me that you hear "Taylor is flawed" as "I am superior to Taylor". As one of those people who thinks that Taylor is flawed in some specific ways (prone to seeking violent solutions, self-deceiving, distrustful of authority, hypocritical, semi-suicidal, though these do change over the course of the work), what I'm trying to express when I say those things is my understanding of her character as revealed by her thoughts and actions throughout the work. This isn't me trying to put a character down, it's me trying to understand a character.

My model of Taylor has her containing flaws; I think that this model gives the most meaning to the work in terms of what it might be trying to say, and fits the available evidence better than a model where she is consistently acting out of necessity and optimizing for her situations without bias.

Or perhaps this is just a question of what we're calling a flaw? Maybe you see all the same motivating factors behind what Taylor does (bullying, abusive authority figures, etc.) and think to yourself, "Taylor is properly calibrated to the world she finds herself in, regardless of where these parts of her personality come from"?
