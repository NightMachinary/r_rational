  Also, Wildbow has talked about Taylor character's before as being self-deceiving and semi-suicidal and stuff on occasion, so that's another data point.

I know that people like to talk about death of the author /a lot/, but this seems like one of those areas where, when we have an argument over how to model a character and their behavior, we can look to the author and get some insight into the model they used to generate those thoughts and behavior. Here are a few pieces of WoG, mostly pulled from the wiki page:

  <@Wildbow> She compartmentalizes things, but she's very prone to having her perspective skew like crazy.

    Taylor isn't suicidal but would have dropped out of school.
  #+end_quote

  Depends on your definition of suicidal. I've fairly sure I've dropped WoG (That's noted in the archives) that states Taylor would not live in a lot of AUs because she was liable to tailspin into self destruction (the thought 'I want to die' not crossing her mind even as she put herself into dangerous situations) in a lot of scenarios where she didn't have the same outside influence.

That said, one of the fun things about analysis is that you can read whatever you want into the work, regardless of what the author intended when they wrote it, and I don't want to take that away from anyone.
