I meant that due to Taylor's age and the fact that she has had some contact with administration that was meant to generally look out for the well being of those they administer to while completely failing in that regard (in this case, the administration of her school and its handling of her situation) I could easily see why she would be inclined to distrust administrative systems in general. Specifically administrations that claim to only try and protect people while failing at doing just that.

Of course, this isn't exactly rational as one bad administration isn't evidence of them all being bad but I can see why due to her age, her experience with her school's administration and her experience with the Undersiders (both in seeing that people on the "other" side aren't simply evil and that administrations like the government fail hard, such as with Brian's situation with Aisha, Lisa's (Tattletale) situation with her family, Rachel's (Bitch) situation with the overall government (specifically the foster care situation) ) that Taylor would have an innate distrust of administration. Which is then exacerbated by her experience with Brockton Bay's particularly bad administrative system such as her dealings with Armsmaster, Piggot and then Piggot's replacement (can't recall his name)

I'm not saying that Taylor stayed with her street gang specifically because she felt as if it was the best way to combat said bad administration. But I can see why she's more than inclined to distrust the administration and rely on the street gang that's demonstrated that it has her back time and again.
