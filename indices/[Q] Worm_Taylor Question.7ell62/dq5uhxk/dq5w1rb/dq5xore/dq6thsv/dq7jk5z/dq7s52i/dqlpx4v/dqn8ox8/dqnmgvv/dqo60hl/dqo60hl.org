I don't think she necessarily knew how OP Tattletale's power was. She had some inkling but Lisa's power scale isn't even really known by the viewers until she breaks it down for Taylor later on. And by that point, Lisa had already filled the best friend slot.

And I can definitely agree that Taylor rationalized her way into staying with the Undersiders to some degree. Someone that lonely and emotionally damaged would obviously latch on to the first people to give a fuck while not necessarily realizing that's what she was doing. Although I do think Armsmaster rubbing her the wrong way (especially considering her stated distrust of authority) had a lot to do with it as well. Not necessarily blaming Armsmaster for it but cause and effect you know?

Overall her decision to stay with them wasn't that smart but I could see an intelligent person at her level (with no LE training or anything even close to it) thinking that her plan was the way to do the most good. It doesn't help that she was practically suicidal at this point so didn't really care to factor in the risks to herself.
