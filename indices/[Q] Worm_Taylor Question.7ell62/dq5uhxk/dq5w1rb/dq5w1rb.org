I don't recall her having that much choice in the matter though (although I'm not saying you're wrong; I'm saying I don't recall it)

Here are some of the escalation examples off the top of my head (these are not in any particular order):

- Lung - Rots crotch off (since you know, it's /Lung/ and all she has are bugs)

- Alexandria - Drowns with bugs (well, Alexandria deliberately deceived her into thinking she was killing her friends, the reason why escapes me, but considering there was no way to otherwise harm/incapacitate her, I don't see what choice she had)

- Aster - Shoots the kid (Can't fully remember her reasoning here but all signs did point to Aster being what allowed Jack to end the world, especially considering Scion had been an unequivocal (if silent and inefficient) force for good for decades at this point. I doubt Taylor could even conceive of Scion as a threat; he was like a force of nature more than a thing that could be controlled by Jack)

- Bank heist situation - Black widow threat/hitting Amy (Taylor did this to avoid casualties as best she could, IIRC. This was at the time when she was still planning to turn the Undersiders over thanks to Armsmaster's shitty, vague advice)

I can't think of any more right now (though I'm sure they're a lot more) but in those situations listed, I can see why Taylor logically made the choices she did. Learning how to lose is all well and good when what you have to lose isn't close to comparatively worth the cost you incur to win but in these situations, a cursory cost-benefit analysis seems to check out.
