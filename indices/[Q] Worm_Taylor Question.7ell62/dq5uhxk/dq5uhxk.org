Pretty much every Taylor escalation is an example of the HPMOR 'you need to learn how to lose' lesson. She always escalates instead, which has long term consequences - both socially (her struggles with the heroes) and directly - her shard/passenger feeds on the escalation, encourages more, until she loses a part of herself to it. Which is almost the scariest and most direct example of value drift possible.

If the spectres of Cauldron/Contessa/Zion weren't around to retroactively justify it, she'd be in a much worse spot in life as a result of it all, I'd think. Alexandria or someone would have just ended the little feudal lord thing they had going, and that'd be it.
