That is the magic of Wildbow's writing. All of his characters are assholes, but they're assholes you can love, feel sorry for and absolutely hate, all at the same time.

If you think that Worm is bad, don't read Twig. (I'm saying that facetiously, of course. Go read Twig.) The characters in Twig are, in my opinion, far stronger and better written than the characters in Worm or Pact. You'll go straight from hating Sy, to loving Sy, to feeling bad for him, to feeling REALLY bad for him, just to go back to hating him. It's a fucking rollercoaster, and I honestly wouldn't have it any other way.
