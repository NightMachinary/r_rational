I see what you mean. I personally didn't like those elements either or how [[#s][taylor]]

But personally, it was the other capes that I found very interesting. Like Jack Slash, Eidolon, Scion I really liked. The variety of powers was interesting.

But the actual semantics of the world? Not as realistic as people make worm out to be. 1000x times more realistic than comics, but still puts superhero's (and fucking taylor) on a higher pedestal than they should be.
