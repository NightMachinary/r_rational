What do you like so much about the world building? For me, it turned me off more, because I didn't feel it made sense. Especially now that I have read spoilers, the explanation for much of it is just "It was a Cauldron plot."

"We need more parahumans." → Replace death penalty with caging.

"We think Feudalism is the way to go." → Introduce medieval three-strikes rule to justice system.

"Only parahumans can help against Scion." → Globally induce learned helplessness of muggles when fighting parahumans.
