This is not a good answer as it is now. It provides no examples. When does she compare herself to others and shrink back? What moves did she make that were assholish that weren't justified?

I think your analysis is spot on, but I've read so much fanfic, I can't remember which events happened in Canon and which didn't. The OP hasn't read the serial in two years. Your point would be much stronger with examples.
