Love this answer.

It's also important to note that pointing out flaws in Taylor's character, is NOT an attack on the work itself.

I actually think Worm is more interesting precisely /because/ Taylor's a very flawed protagonist. But regardless, it's important not to get defensive, or see criticisms of her choices as insults to a work you enjoy.

(not saying OP's doing that here, but many people /were/ doing that in the original thread, and I see in constantly on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]] )
