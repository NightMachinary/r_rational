Right off the bat, her decision to take on Lung herself is not rational. She tells herself that she has to do it because otherwise he'd kill kids, but she has no way of knowing how long she has before he reaches his target, has no way of stopping him on her own, and quickly dismisses the idea of getting help, when the fight then accidentally goes on to signal both the undersiders and the protectorate, who come and win it for her. It's also a good example of her fixating on something and using it to talk herself out of doing something sane. ("He'll kill kids! I don't have a phone, so I can't call anyone! Improvising a way to put down a flaming regenerator, the limits of whose powers I have no idea about, all by myself, has got to be way more doable than improvising a way to call someone who knows how to fight him!")

She went out looking for a superhero fight and she talked herself into the first one she found even though it was a terrible idea, because she pretended that the alternatives did not exist. The most likely outcome is that she dies before saving anyone, but because she's ambivalent about living without superheroing at this point, she invents a sense of desperation to justify the course of action she wants to take anyway.

Her follow up of "I'm going to join villains... as an untrained undercover agent. And commit bank robberies" is pretty much her just latching on to the first kids of vaguely her age that are nice to her. She wants to hang out with them and have friends, and so she invents a reason to do so. Someone who actually has experience, without even knowing the details, lays it out to her that having any real emotional connection with the people you're going undercover with is exactly what you do not want at all in an undercover agent because it makes it likely they can't do their job, and that real agents have handlers to oversee them just for things like this and that it'd be better for her to just join up officially now. She ignores all that, and her reason is basically because the guy who told her was rude. Even when the risk of being turned to the enemy is brought up, she ignores it and goes to get turned to the enemy, because ultimately she wants to be turned as the enemy has gotten an emotional hook into her already, she just doesn't want to admit it. The entire undercover operation is a flimsy pretense, which is why when her cover is blown publicly, she decides it's more worth her time to openly join the group she was pretending to pretend to join rather than actually join the protectorate now that even the people in it she respects has heard her story and has reason to believe it, and her rationalization there is, again, that people were mean to her and that must mean the whole thing is rotten. (The fact that the whole thing is kind of rotten is irrelevant, especially since she leaves to go serve the even-more-rotten branch of the same conspiracy.)

Actually, on the subject of people who are mean to her - she repeatedly uses the fact that the powers-that-be harbor Emma, a girl who psychologically tormented her at every turn because making her feel worse makes her feel better, and Sofia, a girl who physically assaulted her repeatedly because she has a power that messes with her ability to relate to humans in a healthy way, as an explanation for why the authorities are terrible people and she can't work with them.

So, instead she works with the undersiders, where her best friends are Sarah/Lisa, a girl who psychologically torments pretty much anyone and everyone who stands against her and meets her face to face, because making them feel helpless and stupid makes her feel powerful and smart, and Rachel, a girl who repeatedly physically assaults people with the help of monstrous trained animals because she has a power that messes with her ability to relate to humans in a healthy way. And this way she gets to work with a bunch of additional rapists and murderers and people who kidnap and drug out children under a guy who tortures his own subordinates for fun as long as they don't learn about it (because it happens in a timeline he'll discard).

Oh, and that drugged out child? After Taylor goes to all that trouble to rescue her, justifying a litany of sins with the warm fuzzies of getting the poor girl back to her family, she starts thinking about how actually, it would be better for both of them if she kept the girl - now that she doesn't need to bleeding heart story to justify her actions, pragmatic self-interest and a story about how it's better for the person she's going to keep as a tool to be kept as a tool by her takes over. It takes the precog seeing exactly where this is going and pre-calling her out on it to guilt her into sticking to the original plan, and she spends much of the rest of the time kicking herself for sticking to her original plan, because keeping the girl would have been the smart thing to do. (Of course, she'd never have been willing to undertake everything it took to get to this point if she was telling herself about how she'd imprison poor Dinah herself for the greater good from the get go, even though that's what she turns to within minutes once it's close enough at hand that all the other stupid, selfish, unnecessarily cruel things have already been done with the justification of saving Dinah from almost the exact same fate.)

This isn't even a tenth of a percent of the examples, even. Actually, that podcast on worm, "We've got worm" seems to do a pretty good job of drawing attention to it when Taylor does this, and when wildbow specifically draws attention to it using other viewpoints and Taylor visibly shrinking back from admitting it, so if you want it in long form, there's dozens of hours of examples there.
