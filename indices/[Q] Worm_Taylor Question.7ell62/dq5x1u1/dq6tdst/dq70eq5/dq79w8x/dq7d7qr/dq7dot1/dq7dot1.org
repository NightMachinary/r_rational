I can't say all that isn't possible.

Though I think it more likely that Taylor would try to detox her off the drugs than keep supplying her with them. The only thing that stopped her from doing that in cannon was Dinah herself giving a prediction that stopping that way without going through heavy withdraw would make her more likely to relapse.

Taylor was never a fan of drugs, so I doubt she'd be an enabler even in this situation.

Everything else about constantly exposing her to a dangerous situation while acting as if that were the best possible choice for everyone involved sounds exactly like something she'd do though.
