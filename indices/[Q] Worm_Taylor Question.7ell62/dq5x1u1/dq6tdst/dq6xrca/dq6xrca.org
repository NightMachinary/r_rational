Krixwell's liveblog is only up to arc 8, but he does point out a few rationalizations from that period of time:

  “He'll heal,” I pointed out, “Eventually.”

  “You blinded someone who was helpless to fight back. That's kind of fucked up.”

  I couldn't say much to that. Fucked up or not, it had been necessary. I couldn't have dealt with it if I'd known we left him there and he got back to business as usual by the end of the day. I'd stopped him, best as I was able.

Lung was already on the ground, defeated by this point - carving out his eyes was excessive, especially because she knew the most it would do is stall his recovery.

  But, strange as it sounded, I would feel worse about handing their information to the Protectorate if this sort of negativity was what I was leaving behind when I did it. I knew it made no sense, but I wanted to be able to tell myself I'd had one successful set of friendships, before I severed ties for the sake of doing the right thing.

Justification for staying with the Undersiders when she'd already had the information to turn them in.

#+begin_quote
  I felt good. Better than I'd felt for a long, long while. Admittedly, there were painful stabs of conscience when I thought too much about the fact that I'd actually participated in a felony, or the way I'd terrorized the hostages. Could I be blamed if I went out of my way not to dwell on it?

Quotes that I couldn't find from his blog and can't be bothered to find in the text itself: she hurts both Velocity and Clockblocker and promised to make it up to them later, as justification. She resolves to write her letter to Miss Militia instead of Armsmaster because she thinks Armsmaster will be tough to convince, but this is really just one step towards not writing the letter at all. She starts using tactics of excessive force, /inspired by Lung and Bakuda/ because she needs to establish her authority over the criminals in her territory. She stays with the Undersiders well past saving Dinah because she feels like it, etc.
