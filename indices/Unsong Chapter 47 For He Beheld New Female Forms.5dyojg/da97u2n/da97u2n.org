I googled "bible 7:14" and got the following verses (It's probably Isiah, although it /is/ his second meeting of the day):

Isiah 7:14:

#+begin_quote
  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
#+end_quote

2 Chronicles 7:14

#+begin_quote
  if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
