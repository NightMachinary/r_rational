I started writing one, which was meant to be a companion piece to Metropolitan Man. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to write all the things that I want to write, and I don't have a good grasp on the actual /plot/; the opening chapter is about what changes Clark from wanting to be a reporter from wanting to be an effective altruist, and the subsequent chapters take place some five years later when Man of Steel Incorporated is selling contracts for his time in order to make the most money (which then gets funneled into the most reliably effective interventions).

Possible plots that might develop from that:

- Superman is using virtually all his time in order to do the most good, at the expense of his mental and social well-being, which he's been pushing to the breaking point because so much depends on him, and "the plot" descends from that.
- Some bad actor (potentially Lex Luthor) gets within Man of Steel Incorporated's decision loop, either to extract value from Superman, to sabotage him, or something else, ideally with parallels to the ways in which capitalism can undermine concerted efforts to do good.

The problem is, I don't particularly like the idea of Superman facing metahuman threats or other aliens, I like the idea of him facing coordination problems, immoral businessmen and politicians, and perverse incentives. There's a bit in what I've written that gets to the heart of what I find most compelling about 'rational' Superman, which is that airlines will pay him to go check on an airliner that's lost signal, which is almost always a false alarm, utterly unheroic, but dictated as necessary by the insurance companies due to the enormous cost that would be incurred from an aircraft actually crashing. So Superman spends his time checking in on aircraft, fixing undersea cables, lifting satellites, etc., all while feeling unfulfilled by any of it. There's an inherent tension between 'doing the most good' and 'feeling satisfied by do-gooding', because these are different things.

(Saying this here because there's almost no chance that I'll actually finish writing it, and hopefully someone can make something of the ideas.)
