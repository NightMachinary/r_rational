Going through the wall is a reasonably decent kind of thinking, though. If the kryptonite is in the doorway, making another doorway is a decent solution. Even the fic recognizes that it's not the *only* solution, but ultimately, Superman merely fell victim to overconfidence, and in a fairly believable way. He didn't know that Lex had learned how to make more kryptonite, so he probably didn't view a lead lined room as posing any reasonable threat.

Making her drop the ball would not necessarily make going through the doorway safe. If he were vulnerable in that close of proximity to it, it would be reasonable to suppose that Lex had positioned additional traps there to capitalize on that.
