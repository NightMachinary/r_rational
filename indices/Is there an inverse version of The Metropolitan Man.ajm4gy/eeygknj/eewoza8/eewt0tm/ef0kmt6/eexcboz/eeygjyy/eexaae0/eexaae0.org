Too strong? I disagree. Almost any character can be compelling and challenged if you show them dealing with the things they are not good at.

The problem is that most people write about powerful characters by either giving them problems they can easily solve or they take away their powers and give them a problem they could have solved if only they had their powers.

A rational story would be fine if someone sat down and went about it intelligently.

Edited for clarity (I did not intend to sound negative towards the original poster)
