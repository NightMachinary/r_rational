But the more power you give a character, the harder you make it to yourself to write something compelling. It's not that there couldn't be a good superman story, it's that it's hard to write one.

I've been cringing hard watching three seasons of Supergirl and I'm now at fifth season of Smallville. It's just so dumb, how they don't just use their superspeed to just beat pretty much all opposition in a fight before they can do anything.
