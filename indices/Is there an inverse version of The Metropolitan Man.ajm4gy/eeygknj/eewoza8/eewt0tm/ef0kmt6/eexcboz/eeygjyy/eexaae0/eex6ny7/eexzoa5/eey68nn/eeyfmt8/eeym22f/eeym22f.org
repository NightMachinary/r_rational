He had time and power enough to dive through a lead-lined wall.

Surely he had enough to take a body-width step to either the left or the right. Or to jump over her and the kryptonite. Or to inflict enough pain/damage to her hand to make her drop the baseball. Or to interpose Lex between them, at an angle to direct the ball into a corner. Or the desk, or the chair.

Yes, having the kryptonite near would have weakened him, slowed him. But all he needed to do was clear the room - once out, the shielded nature of the room itself would protect him - and he would have been safe. The wall just seems like a strange option to take when there's an open door as an available choice, if he retains enough power to go /through a wall/.
