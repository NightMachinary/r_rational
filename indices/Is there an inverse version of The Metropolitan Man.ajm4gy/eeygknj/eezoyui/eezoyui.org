These themes are similar to what I've been starting to explore in The Maker's Ark and beyond in the Doc Future series, for Flicker and the Volunteer: How do they deal with things like a whole society that for three generations has internalized the idea that 'Nothing /really/ bad will happen because the Volunteer will stop it'--and he has to stop because of injuries that won't heal if he doesn't. Interesting stuff.
