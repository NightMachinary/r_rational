As weird as it may seem to you, I actually do think people would be put off by being explicitly reminded repeatedly that they lived in a world where Superman could kill them, or worse, at any time, if he thinks they're Bad. A typical person has no way of knowing where Supes will draw the line, and furthermore has no guarantee that the line won't shift.

Hell, especially if it's an explicitly economic line, a lot of people currently below it /really wanna be above it/ and are trying hard to do so. I /guess/ Clark could just kill anyone whose bank account hits enough digits, but that sure doesn't sound like a way to get an abundance of willing cooperation.

Incidentally, there's a scene (I think in “Injustice”?) where Supes is arguing a version of this with the Flash, re: direct rather than economic violence.
