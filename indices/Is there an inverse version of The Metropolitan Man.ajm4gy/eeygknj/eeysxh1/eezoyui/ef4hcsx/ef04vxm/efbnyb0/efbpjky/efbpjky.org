I watched the first season of the CW show, and thought about how I would have done it differently. Aside from that ...

The thing that I like about DC is that everything is so much more /mythological/ than in Marvel. Superman isn't one story, it's a character that's been involved in a hundred retellings, different every time, and the way that all these Supermen can kind of meld together as a coherent whole, or split apart from each other is what's most compelling.

Unfortunately, that's not really a strength that extends to Supergirl, who doesn't have as firm an identity to play with. Even if she did ...

Well, if I were writing Supergirl, there were two primary approaches. The first would be as a simple gender swap, with almost nothing changing in the story because of it (love interest is the only one that has to change, usually, and maybe not even then if you're set in the modern day). That's typically the approach that I favor when seeking out media, but not necessarily when writing. Supergirl the entity has her own history and struggles, so it's not /really/ a genderswap, but I don't really find her surrounding characters/villains that are unique to her compelling, nor the 'trapped in Superman's shadow' stuff.

The second approach is to in some way make it about gender, with varying levels of subtlety. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I'm quite equipped to handle that, not in the way that I would want to read someone else handle it. Like, I would want to read a sequel to Metropolitan Man, or even a genderswap version of it, where Kara Zor-el comes down to Earth and there are these issues of sexualization and gender norms that are touched on in some way ... but I wouldn't want to write it, and if I read it, it would need to be dealt with in less of a dropping anvils way. (Mind you, I would love the same thing with Superman.)
