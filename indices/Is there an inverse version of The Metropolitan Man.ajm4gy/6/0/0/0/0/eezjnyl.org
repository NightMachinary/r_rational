I didnt say anyone was more or less creative than anyone else. It isnt my place to decide that and I don't care all that much about where I stand compared to others, I just work at being creative myself...and I also disagree that there is usually a good reason for people not writing something a particular way.

There is usually a reason or reasons, but that doesnt mean they are automatically good ones (though plenty are) and sometimes the reason is people didnt think of it at the time.

For instance, Superman is usually written in certain ways because his stories do not sell as well when written in other ways. They also have other characters that fulfill certain types of stories, so there is no need to write Superman stories outside his general tropes as long as his stories continue to sell. Those are good enough reasons for his writers (and fairly compelling!), but are not terribly relevant for this discussion.
