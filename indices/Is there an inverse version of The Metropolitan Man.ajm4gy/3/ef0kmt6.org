I feel like Strong Female Protagonist fits the bill here, in a way - its not the character of superman, but a young woman with the "superman-package" of powers (flight, invincibility, super strength) who tries to figure out a way to improve the world after realizing that "beating up bad guys" is not the optimal approach. There are other elements in there, but this is a major theme.
