Many, many people do live in a world where they can be killed, or worse, at any time, if the american 'security' apparatus decides they're Bad. A typical person has no way of knowing where the CIA will draw the line, and furthermore has no guarantee that the line won't shift.

On the other hand, revolutionary!Superman's line isn't an economic line, it's a class line, and it's perfectly clear. Most people have no hope whatsoever of ascending to the ruling class, the handful of petit-bourgeoisie aspirants you're talking about are just better deceived and will need to be reeducated in any situation where we survive the next hundred years.
