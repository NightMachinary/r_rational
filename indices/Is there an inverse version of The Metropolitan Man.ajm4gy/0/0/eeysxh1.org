It seems like him engaging in any kind of money-raising venture would be pointless. Couldn't he single-handedly kickstart the asteroid-mining industry and produce enough mineral wealth to overwhelm the entire world economy overnight?

Just thinking as I type here, any rationalist superman story where he doesn't have villains or similar roadblocks is essentially going to turn into a project management fantasy- how to get the most utility out of a single human being, with typical human needs but virtually no physical limits + the ability to fly? If I were Superman in this case I'd immediately try to come up with a committee or something with absolute authority govern my time on the assumption that doing it myself would be less optimal, and probably self-destructive as I wouldn't take time to rest. But how would it be selected, what kind of tensions would it cause- what can you do without creating a dependency on your existence after you're dead?

Superman's concept of "Doing good" would probably be so far removed from any ordinary human standard that it doesn't really look recognizable to us. Instead of running insurance claims, I'm thinking "Repositioning the earth to solve global climate change" or "Subsidizing the construction of the first extra-earth colony with nearly free/un-weight-restricted space launches." Humanity's primary problem would stop being... well, any of the current existential threats, actually- it'd just switch to "Making more supermen" and then ultimately "Policing the supermen we have created."
