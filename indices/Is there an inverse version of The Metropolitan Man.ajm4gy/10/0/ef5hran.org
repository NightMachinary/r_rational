  Lex is supposed to be a supergenius

That is, honestly speaking, a small part of his character. Little more than an excuse as for why Superman doesn't effortlessly defeat him.

The far more important, and prominent, parts of who Lex is are his narcissism, psychopathy, and large inferiority complex. The comics clearly show that the man has legit, serious mental illnesses.

The Metropolitan Man is a good story, but the main character is Lex Luthor in name only.
