I could fill up a 10k character limit with nothing but Pratchett quotes, /and still not be done/ so I will simply choose my favourite of his:

#+begin_quote
  /HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE./
#+end_quote

(Death, in Terry Pratchett's Hogfather)
