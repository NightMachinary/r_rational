I want to ask anyone with better knowledge of physics, but is there any technology that you can envision with the potential to wipe out an entire solar system/galaxy? This is intended as a doomsday weapon in a futuristic story built on hard science fiction.

There are a lot of possibilities I can come up with, but all of them involve technology bordering on the fantastical.
