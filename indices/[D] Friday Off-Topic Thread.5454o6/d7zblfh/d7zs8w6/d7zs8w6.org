In terms of a single event, I can't come up with anything easy to wipe out a galaxy. Galaxies are far too large and far too sparse to be easily dealt with using the sort of energies we can manage.

You could cause a lot of havoc if you collided two galaxies together. It's my understanding that this would lead to lots of new star creation. There might be other effects as well, but I don't know enough to say. As mentioned, galaxies are sparse enough that there won't even be many direct collisions of stars when two galaxies interact.

You would be able to do a lot of damage if you [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet][fed a large star to a spinning supermassive black hole]]. That creates a jet of highly energetic matter along the axis of rotation, which may be enough to wipe out things in its path.

The caveat there is that it's subluminal matter, and we're about 26,500 light years away from the galactic centre. If you had a way of creating a black hole closer to your target you might be able to make it happen in a reasonable time, but if you could do that you should just create black holes near your target.

Really, the only thing I can think of that's plausibly efficient (i.e. low requirements, high effect) is some sort of grey goo scenario. Nanobots convert planets and stars into more nanobots which self-assemble into ships which fly off to other systems. Would probably take a very long time and could probably be easily stopped by the victims if they had forewarning (e.g. from seeing the stars die).

Killing a solar system is by comparison easy.
