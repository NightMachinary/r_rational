The first barrier for me would be the speed of light. You can't really instantly destroy a galaxy since it takes anything a couple million years to traverse the entire thing. Solar systems are much more doable, though. Triggering a supernova in the vicinity would be my first guess, but that would also take a couple hundred years to take effect anyway.
