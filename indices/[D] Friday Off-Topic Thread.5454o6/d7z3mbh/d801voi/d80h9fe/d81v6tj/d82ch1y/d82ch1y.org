  Will there be opportunity for specialized, non-level-related training? For instance, if you wanted to train a pokemon to be faster or better at dodging than its counterparts.

Certainly! The idea is that EVs are trained by actually using the stat they're based on rather than canon's awkward cannibal-essence idea. Specialized training will need to be introduced somehow; I haven't designed the specifics on that yet, but there will be /some/ mechanic for focusing on things like dodging that would otherwise only be trained by, well, not getting hit by things that are aimed at you. Something to do with the gyms, perhaps?

  It's mentioned that training against other pokemon improves moves more quickly than when used in the absence of a target. Would it be possible for a trainer to use themselves as the target for a less-than-lethal move to improve their pokemon more quickly without battling?

lol, I can see it now.

"That was a really promising run, what happened?"

"Well, I couldn't find any good targets to train his crit on, so I told him to practice slash on me."

"...you idiot."

I mean, hey, a target's a target. It might be funny to include that for the lulz, but hopefully there are other, more sensible options available, such as, y'know, setting your pokemon on each other instead. This may be another area that gyms come in handy, too.

  The sliding scale of psychics concept is valid, I think, but it should be on a per-pokemon basis, not typal -- Riolu and Lucario would be significantly stronger psychics than a Machop, given that Lucario can learn Psychic, and Riolu has access to Protect, a move which I can only type out as Psychic (in spite of being normal in canon).

The sliding scale thing was something I was toying with to see if there was any useful information that could be had by modeling it, but I'm not sure I'll do anything with it at this point. I may change my mind once (if) I get to the point of making players psychic.

Also remember that things like that are assuming a mythical, 100% typed creature, which by and large probably won't exist (though there's probably some pokemon somewhere I'm missing that would only make sense as being "pure" typed). Lucario could be modeled as 20% Normal, 50% Fighting, 20% Steel, and 10% Psychic, for instance (or something like that; I'm not as familiar with pokemon from gen III and beyond).
