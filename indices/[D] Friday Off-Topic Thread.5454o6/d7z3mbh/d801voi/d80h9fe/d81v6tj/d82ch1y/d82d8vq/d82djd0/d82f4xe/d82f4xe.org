While using offensive moves /in general/ on humans would definitely be a renegade thing to do, I can see plenty of exceptions in sufficiently extreme circumstances, and more broad ones for non-offensive moves, though I'm unsure of how the world would handle them... and it's out of the confines of your game for the most part. Questions like use of pokemon in self defense (is it justifiable if someone pulls a knife on you to order your pokemon to attack them? What about a gun?), or water gun to slow someone falling, telekinesis for the same or a myriad of other uses -- a sufficiently skilled psychic in a mind link with a human might very well be of aid to a surgeon, for instance, or to augment their own psychic ability in therapy.

Fighting-type Aura-based moves would probably have medical use too, though a little more ambiguous as to how and how well. It would definitely have use in identifying people and of metaphysical use in that regard, based on the movie involving Lucario, though.
