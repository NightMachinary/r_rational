  Given the rather more complicated math behind type advantages, will there be any tools given to players to calculate that?
#+end_quote

This is a tough question. On the one hand, I want this to be a rational title, and you can't make rational decisions without reliable or semireliable information.

On the other hand, I don't want it to be as immediately a simple calculation as it is in canon. The way I will probably handle this is by the pokedex giving the player vague data--at least, until the player has upgraded its capabilities, but even then I don't want there to be too obvious a winner in every case just by looking at it. I want the player to have to evaluate the individuals involved--this one /seems/ to kick harder, but that one /seems/ to run faster.

When it comes to types this will be further compounded by Weakness/Resistance being IVs. Sure, this pokemon might be 50% Fire, but it's got a higher-than-average set of resistances with only slightly augmented weaknesses. The types will be broad-strokes, of course; you'll still want a Blastoise to counter their Charizard, but getting the feel for the individuals involved will be as important, if not more important than the particular type spread their species have.

  Your goal is for there to be multiple options to make progress; does this include there being multiple "goal" or "win" conditions to the game, or will it be open ended (for instance, either Red or Blue's approach to Pokemon from OoS)?
#+end_quote

I haven't given as much thought to the win condition--I probably should, heh. The way I see it, this is a game first and foremost about being a Trainer, but how do you measure the end goal of being a trainer? I'm not sure, and I'll have to give it some thought.

What I /do/ know, though, is that it will (in it's perfect state which I may or may not attain to) permit the player to choose the path that is most appealing to them. Some trainers are Champions, some are Breeders, some are pubstomping Battlers, some are Rangers, some are Coordinators, some are Gym Leaders, some are Legendary Hunters, some are Professors, some are Researchers, some are Vigilantes, some are Renegades.

I guess the answer is yes, I want it to be open-ended. Being Champion is probably the easiest and most traditional end-goal to start with, though.

  What sort of interaction can be expected with NPCs?
#+end_quote

Off the top of my head, there are two kinds of NPC I want to have for version one (not counting your typical shopkeeper/busybody town NPCs, which are fairly bland and not much more than walking sign posts). I have this idea of a Ranger system in my head that closely matches how OoS handles it: there is a network that pokedexes tap into that list nearby marked threats, distress calls, ranger stations, and general warnings. You would have a faction standing with the Rangers that goes up when you help trainers in distress, goes down when you go all Renegade, and may go up or down if you call them for help, depending on how stupid the threat was.

The other major type would of course be battlers, of which the Gyms would be the primary source of them. I like the idea of having an always-open training area in the gyms that you can access if you've impressed the denizens enough, as well as the city-ran trainer halls. I want fights between the player and NPCs to be controlled situations, more interesting in some ways due to the fact that you just don't know what they've trained their top-tier Rattata to do, but in other ways less interesting (they're not going to gang up on you 5 v 1, for example).

At any rate, though, I expect the wild pokemon interactions to take up most of the game's time and focus.

#+begin_quote
  What about with wild pokemon? With the latter, you mentioned that a temperament of 500 would be "zen" -- would this allow non-violent interaction with a wild pokemon? What would that amount to? (Feeding them, offering to let them join you without fighting them, etc.?)
#+end_quote

Y'know, I hadn't thought about that, but hell, it makes sense to me (this is why I post these; [[/r/rational]] is a veritable gold mine of ideas). The pokeball mechanics will be straight lifted from OoS, so I see no reason why you couldn't just walk up to a calm pokemon, feed it some stuff, lock on, toss, and boom, captured. I don't hold to the anime idea that pokemon understand humans in some weird metaphysical way, so I'm not sure how you'd convince one to just join you out of the blue, but I like the general sentiment. Consider it stolen.

For most interactions, though, you'd be able to see the pokemon on the overworld wandering around, and their temperament and your actions will determine whether they attack you or run away. You can very easily find yourself in over your head if you try to just walk into a herd of tauros, but maybe you can scare most of the herd away and ensnare one in the web trap you had your pokemon weave. Or sing them all to sleep. Or rock slide the nearby cliff into the herd and hope you find one that was only 80% crushed to death. Or maybe you just pull out your One Punch Hitmonchan and see how many of them you can sucker punch before you need to teleport out.

  Given the degree of detail given to pokemon, are there going to be pokemon with human-rivalling intelligence (Mewtwo, psychic types, the Lucario line, legendaries, etc. seem the most likely to have such)?
#+end_quote

The current scope is limited to the original 151 + maybe gen II, so Mewtwo is about the only one that I think would be human-like. I haven't thought so far ahead as to how I will handle him specifically, but I smell an interesting quest line possibility...

I hold to the OoS idea that Alakazam has about the same intelligence as a four-year-old, and keeping pokemon for the most part limited to the intelligence of animals. For one, I don't want to have to go and implement serious AI for human-intelligent pokemon to work, and second the idea just doesn't appeal to me, for some reason I should probably identify.

I would however love to lift OoS' system of legendaries being this unstoppable storm-force that are more forces of nature than anything, if I can get it to work well.

  Man this sounds so cool, I'm giddy.
#+end_quote

Heh, glad this is well-received! I'll be making weekly posts in these off-topic threads with my progress, so stay tuned. If you think of anything amazing that needs to be included, drop me a line on here or on the [[/r/rational]] Discord server; I'm always in the market for more neat feature ideas.
