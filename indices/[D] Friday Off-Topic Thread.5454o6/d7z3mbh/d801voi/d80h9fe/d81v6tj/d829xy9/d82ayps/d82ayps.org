The scope is noted, but still rather exciting -- as pokemon additions strike me as something that could be rather modular. You'd need the basics of where they're located at, what sorts of trainers might have them, and their stats, etc., but that stuff can be outsourced if you would like once you have the basic system down.

I really like that you're going with a Dwarf Fortress-style system for a lot of things, and it could help a LOT in adding things. DF is spaghetti code at its root, but its modularity is incredible and could be used to make just about anything: buildings, trainers, caves, you name it.

Something worth noting is that while it hasn't been explored very much in OoS (and while this would be a rather... discomforting thought for some given its implications), it's possible that pokemon and humans evolved from the same ancestors, and as such, that some of the more humanoid pokemon evolved a similar intellect.

I love the idea of impressing pokemon in non-combat ways to get them to join you, though. For instance, finding a colony of psychic types and, as a psychic trainer yourself, impressing them that way. Or helping one out that had gotten injured, or whatever else is appropriate.

By the way, while you were typing up that response I read your past design document entries and added more questions.
