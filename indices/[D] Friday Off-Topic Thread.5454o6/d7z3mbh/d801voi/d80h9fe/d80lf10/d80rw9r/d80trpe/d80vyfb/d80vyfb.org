  the emergent properties idea of type interactions
#+end_quote

Yeah, I should have read your post more carefully before writing a novel on why I think steel should resist fire, but once I had realized your position it seemed a shame to let a good rant go to waste.

#+begin_quote
  Fans of the canon series probably won't like it (I tend to get negative scores on my posts in [[/r/pokemon]] suggesting type interaction changes that are too "extreme" in attempts to make them more realistic/balanced)
#+end_quote

That's a shame. Can't bode well for this project's wider acceptance, either, but perhaps that's more a boon than bust, considering I'd rather not be C&D'd.

#+begin_quote
  Yep, been looking at it a bit while editing the next podcast episode.
#+end_quote

Glad it works! Be sure to let me know if any of the various user interface decisions feel too weird, or if there's any features you'd like to see.

#+begin_quote
  I see you removed immunities, was it for realism or balance?
#+end_quote

Realism. Ghost was the only immunity that was reasonably plausible, the rest being more or less for flavor or balance reasons. Once I eliminated the others I figured I'd try and get rid of that one, too, and came across a solution I liked.

Also the idea of hitting someone else and they just sit there and wait for the dust to settle while being /completely/ unaffected is very...anime.

Any pre-emptive balance decisions I make are likely to never see the light of day, so I try not to make /too/ many decisions for that reason, and try to focus on playability, realism, and flexibility in how I design the system as a whole.

Also, I see you're on the Discord server; it might be easier to do the back-and-forth there, if you'd prefer.
