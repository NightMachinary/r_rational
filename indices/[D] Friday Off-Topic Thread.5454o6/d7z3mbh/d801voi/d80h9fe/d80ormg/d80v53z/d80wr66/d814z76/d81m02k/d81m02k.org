I pieced together what I think might be a reasonable stat spread for [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/zxb5ucz1tb3nwrc/With%20Machop.dex?dl=0][Machop]], under the assumption that it is a Pokemon naturally tough and strong (for a juvenile Pokemon) with a tendency to spend free time exercising and training itself. Since there's still little in the way of baselines (I basically had to extrapolate from Rattata), I'd be happy if you could look at this thoroughly so I can be confident in having a second baseline.

As a side note, I tried to save Machop's stats as the smaller .pkmn file through the 'export' button, but the file never appeared. No error message, as if it had worked, but the file never showed up. So I had to save the entire Pokedex to save Machop's stats.
