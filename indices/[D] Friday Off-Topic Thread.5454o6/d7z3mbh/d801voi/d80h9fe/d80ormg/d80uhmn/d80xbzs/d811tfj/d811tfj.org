Yeah Ketura's model looks really good, I was just pointing out that time constraints make grinding and backtracking much less beneficial.

For example, when all it takes to heal up your pokemon is some real-life time to run back and forth to a pokemon center, it's the optimal decision in terms of game advantage. When in-game time costs in-game resources, now the time spent traveling back and forth isn't necessarily better than just stocking up on some potions and using the in the field.
