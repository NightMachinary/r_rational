I'm almost worried, though, that making it money and time dependent would only make it /grindier./ I mean, if I have to go and get a Pokemon-related job to earn money for food and shelter, I'm not being told not to grind, I'm being told to spice up my grinding with menial tasks. The alternatives ketura outlined below, I think, if they can be made to work and are balanced, would properly curtail the urge to get ahead by grinding.
