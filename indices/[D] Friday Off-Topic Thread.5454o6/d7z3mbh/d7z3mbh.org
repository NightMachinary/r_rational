Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool:

Iterations continued on the graph. The gif I have this week is kind of boring but shows off a neat feature: the example pokemon graphs are no longer hard-coded. The user can define how many they would like to show based on performance and readability issues:

It's not shown, but you can also define the minimum gap between curves to prevent overlap. Currently the pool of example pokemon is still hard-coded, but I have plans to spin this off into a config file.

I added a settings tab for all the fiddly bits that I was hard-coding into things, including some options to disable animations for the graph to improve performance if needed.

The Bulbapedia download was improved; you can now indicate a range to download (rather than all 721), with options to overwrite or integrate if you already have some pokemon defined locally.

It occured to me that I'm going to need a way to determine how many tiles a pokemon takes up. I think I'm going to add a setting for each pokemon that indicates whether size increase is more influenced by height (onix) or weight (snorlax), with a % modifier for each. Height and weight growth may need to be added as well.

Goals this week are to produce some documentation with pictures so people who can't run it can see what it looks like, add the stuff I speculated about above, and otherwise get the species tab finished so I can actually work on moves.
