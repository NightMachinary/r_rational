Does anyone else think mainstream fiction is becoming more rational? The Martian and Breaking Bad are some of the most acclaimed stories in recent memory and I think they both qualify as rational. Other examples are less clear cut, but I still think they represent a trend towards the criteria we associate with rational and rationalist fiction.

Zootopia has intelligent characters and detailed worldbuilding, Limitless is a detective show about solving mysteries through munchkinism while dealing with a conspiracy of munchkins, and the Marvel films like are now deconstructing and reconstructing themselves by exploring the implications of the Avengers' actions and motivations.

Combine that with critics and fans alike complaining about issues that rational fiction was specifically designed to avoid, and I think our community has a huge opportunity for growth if we play our cards right. Rationality is no longer a niche idea, it's what the people want to see. Can anybody think of other examples outside this subreddit?
