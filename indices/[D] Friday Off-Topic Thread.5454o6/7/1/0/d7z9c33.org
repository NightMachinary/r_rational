It's very hard for a non-rationalist to write a rationalist because of how small and tightly knit our community is. One of the main things about HPMOR that turned me onto rationality was how different the way Harry thought from the way I did. He's probably still the most accessible rationalist character for newcomers since the story acknowledges how different he is, has his uniqueness be both an asset and a hindrance to his life, and establishes that just because he is very intelligent does not mean he's right.
