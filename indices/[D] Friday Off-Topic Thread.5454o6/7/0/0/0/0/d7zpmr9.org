For me it becomes a lot less enjoyable to watch a series if all my favorite characters die leaving behind the ones whose stories I'm not that interested in. I had the same problem with Death Note, Game of Thrones, and Telltale's The Walking Dead. Sure, the deaths provide drama. But once the drama is over there has to be something else driving the story.
