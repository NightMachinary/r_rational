That's helpful as a story element, sure, but it really reduces the impetus to keep reading a story. The great thing about sequels is that the author has already established their cast and setting, so they can move straight to the plot. In a work that had previously focused on a main charachter, that means the author needs to go straight back to the drawing board and flesh out a side charachter.

That can lead to good results, of course (the series I'm thinking of had a spinoff I enjoyed, because the side-charachter-to-MC switch was done well) but still slows down the story.
