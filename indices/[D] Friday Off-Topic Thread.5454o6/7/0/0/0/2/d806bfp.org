I used to feel this way, I didn't even mind Wash's death in Serenity, but when I discovered the medium of comic books I realized just how unsatisfying character death can be when it isn't properly built up. That's why resurrection is so common in comics, the fans keep demanding bad stories be fixed.

I had seen so many stories that did pull it off that I thought character death was a good thing for a story until I had it explained to me that when a character dies, all their story potential dies with them. If you end a character arc without a satisfying conclusion, that hurts your story.

With comics in particular, death is counterintuitive. The series is meant to keep going until people stop reading, so authors need to utilize all the story potential they can get. Killing off characters denies the creator and audience all the plot and character development that could've happened because of them.
