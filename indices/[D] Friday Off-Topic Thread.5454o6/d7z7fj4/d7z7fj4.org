My father has been in declining health for some time, due to a terminal disease. Over the past couple of days, he quickly went from a fully functional adult to someone who cannot live on his own, intermittently confused and lost. I suppose that any good father is a hero in the eyes of his son, and Dad was a hero to me. Mentally, he was a giant; educated in literature, science, and business, he was a voracious reader and could speak at length on any topic. He had books in German, French, and English on his bookshelf. I always had a certain awe for him, of his philosophy and his art and his books in foreign languages filled with poetry and literature. He had recordings of poetry read aloud by professionals on vinyl records, classical music, singing in Farsi, and fine art hanging on his walls. He loved poetry, as I suppose most Persians do. His favorite poem was The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot.

Dad was born in Iran, and moved to France as a boy when my family fled bad conditions there. He went to Germany for college, studying geophysics. ("Why geophysics?" I asked. He replied: "Well, I started in physics, but I didn't like all the math needed for quantum mechanics. Geophysics had the same requirements, but with geology instead.") After he graduated, he ended up moving to America to seek his fortune, and perhaps more education. ("Why move to America? Why not work in geophysics?" I asked. He replied: "Geophysics means you need to work looking for oil in the desert or drilling ice cores in Antarctica. No pretty women there. I met some American foreign exchange students one year, and they were very pretty, so I knew where I wanted to move.")

He came to America, and he was able to find a job in construction work. He had some experience, since he had started his degree in Germany studying engineering before changing to physics. Part of the curriculum for engineers at the Technische Hochschule in Koln was spending a summer working on a construction project as a worker (mostly digging ditches), so he knew what to do. What he didn't know, however, was who to eat lunch with. There were two lunch groups, the whites and the blacks. As a Persian, he didn't fit in either group. He ended up sitting with the blacks. ("Why the blacks?" I asked. He replied: "I didn't know who to sit with. Looking at the two groups, the whites looked gloomy, but the blacks were laughing, smiling, and telling jokes, so I sat with them.") This explains all the black friends he has, I suppose.

Eventually, Dad and his girlfriend decided to move across the country from Philadelphia to Berkeley, California. He'd bought a Chevy Corvair for $200, they put everything he owned in it, and together, they set out across the country. That car, "unsafe at any speed," probably wasn't the best choice for a cross-country vehicle, but it was cheap and pretty. Somewhere in the midwest, partway through the trip, the car broke down, and they took it to a mechanic. He replaced a part and they were able to start the car again.

"Will this car make it to California?" Dad asked. He knew there would be mountains to cross to get there, but didn't have money for a better car.

"Yeah," drawled the mechanic, "but don't /push/ the motherfucker."

For the rest of the trip, any time Dad went too fast, Bev would say, "Don't push the motherfucker," and he'd ease off the gas.

In Berkeley, he attended the University of California and got a degree in comparative literature (easy, for a man who spoke Farsi, French, German, and English fluently), then attended the business school. He fell in love with the city and decided to stay there and never move away. This was only the beginning of his life, in a way, and all the stories that remain would be too many to write here. He worked in startups, pitching ideas and trying to get companies off the ground. There was a successful one designing RFID tags for cattle. Another selling CDs containing medical information (think WebMD but before the internet was huge). He fell in love, got married, had a kid (my brother), before things fell apart. Then, he did it again, and I was born. A lucky child, to have such a father. He would drive, every weekend, from Berkeley to Palo Alto to pick me up and and take care of me for a couple days before returning me to Mom's place on Sunday. He did this every weekend for over a decade, so I could have the schooling afforded me by my mother's Palo Alto residence, and still see my father every week. Eventually, he became a real estate agent and eased into a comfortable semi-retirement.

He lived a vibrant life of adventure and love and intellectual curiosity. He's smart, even now. There was no gradual decline of mental abilities, because of his intelligence. Dad might get temporarily confused in conversation or while doing a task, but he would figure out instantly what was going on from context until he remembered. He'd run into a problem pressed on him by his declining alertness and he'd find a way around it with habits and patterns and ability to solve problems on the fly. And eventually, finally, when it became too much for him to route around with his intelligence, it all collapsed at once. No gradual decline of mental ability, just a sudden inability of his cleverness to overcome his handicaps, laying bare everything that he's lost up until this point.
