I'm sorry for you and your family. My dad is another persian immigrant, came to the US to learn engineering and flee the theocracy, built himself and his architecture business up from nothing. He's had some failing health issues recently too. It's hard seeing someone who has always been so strong, so helpless.

Give your dad an extra hug when you next see him. I'm sure he appreciates having a son who loves and admires him so much.
