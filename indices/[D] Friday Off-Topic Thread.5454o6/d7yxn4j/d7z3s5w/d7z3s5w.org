I saved some quotes from when I read The Book of Five Rings(1645) by the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. Great book about strategy and the philosophy of a warrior.

- Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world
- Today is victory over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men.
- Do not sleep under a roof. Carry no money or food. Go alone to places frightening to the common brand of men. Become a criminal of purpose. Be put in jail, and extricate yourself by your own wisdom.
- It is difficult to realize the true Way just through sword-fencing. Know the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things.
- To know ten thousand things, know one well
- There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.
- The important thing in strategy is to suppress the enemy's useful actions but allow his useless actions
- All man are the same except for their belief in their own selves, regardless of what others may think of them
