There's always the old standby of murder mystery. They both have abilities that are useful for gathering information, but limited in their scope. You could have them investigate the crime and try to prevent it from happening, but because of the gaps in their knowledge they are suspicious of each other and maybe even themselves. It may not be easy to write, but it's a tried and true conflict starter.
