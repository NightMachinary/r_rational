I've been doing a lot of thinking about a conflict for my time-travel story and I have two different time-travel abilities for my two protagonists. I'm fine with a problem that requires them to work together or a problem where they are in direct conflict, but I'm having trouble thinking of a genuinely interesting problem for them to be involved in. I'm hoping for an ideological conflict or something that can get the reader questioning which side is actually in the right; a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVersusGood][Good vs Good]] battle.

Does anyone have any suggestions? If there were any tropes you ever wanted to see in a time-travel story, now's the time to speak up! Here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53ns0s/rational_nanowrimo/][thread]] that describes the time powers if you are interested.
