A lot of singularity scenarios kind of look like this, in that both friendly and unfriendly GAI have strong incentives to turn most matter into computronium, like a cosmic level lightspeed grey goo event.\\
From an outside perspective this would look like the galaxy was being destroyed, though there would potentially be some weird things visible as the computronium gives of IR.
