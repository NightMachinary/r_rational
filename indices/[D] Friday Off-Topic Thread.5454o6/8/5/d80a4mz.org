Other than gray-goo scenarios the most destructive thing I can imagine is an Antimatter supernova. I.E. imagine a huge star syster, possibly even binary/cluster, about to go supernova, only they are all made of Antimatter, so when their (anti)matter interact with matter in the rest of the galaxy.. you get a couple of extra supernova-level events.
