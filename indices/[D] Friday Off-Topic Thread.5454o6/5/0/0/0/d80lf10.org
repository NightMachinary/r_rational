I love a lot of this, and I think we could hash out the typing interactions more if you want. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Fire is less effective against Steel than it is against Rock, and Poison is super-effective against Psychic (since someone who relies on mental concentration has a hard time doing so while vomiting), etc.
#+end_quote

To me, Fire is strong against Steel because inside all that metal are still biological organs. Different, maybe, from what we're used to, but still susceptible to heat. When you heat up a metal skin, it's very painful. When you heat up a rocky skin, it barely feels it.

As for poison and psychic, what I would say instead is that psychic should RESIST poison but NOT be super effective against it. Because psychics posses the ability to cleanse themselves of foreign bodies, and can telekenetically stop acid and poison needles and whatnot from hitting them (much easier than doing so to stop rocks thrown at them, though this could potentially be an argument against grass moves too). If you'd rather have that be demonstrated through actual attacks and defensive moves, and just want to keep things as a "this is what happen when X substance meets Y substance," that makes sense.

And I agree that Psychic shouldn't be super effective against poison. It's probably the type interaction that makes the least sense in the games. I can rationalize Ground 2x vs Poison better than I can Psychic 2x vs Poison.
