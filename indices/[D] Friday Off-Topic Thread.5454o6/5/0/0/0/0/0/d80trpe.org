  While I think just about everyone thinks like this, I'm not sure it stands up to scrutiny. You know what else has organs beneath the exterior? Normal types. Yet for some reason they don't have this mystical weakness to fire that steel has, and you'd think it would hurt worse, since a Normal type's skin presumably has more nerve endings than one that has literal metal plating.

Ah, see, this is where the emergent properties idea of type interactions comes in. Yes, a Normal type should be hurt worse by a flamethrower than a steel type, but the normal type is going to flinch and dodge away from fire much quicker than the steel type, who in most cases is going to just sit there and take it. For the fast steel types like skarmory, just make the composition of their metal something like titanium or magnesium, which are highly flammable.

But you're right that if you can make the properties of the types better reflected by other game mechanics, like being able to dodge or deflect better, that's the path that's much more realistic/easier to rationalize. Rationalizing the type interactions as presented in the game world requires turning to alternate explanations besides "Substance X hits Substance Y," but making a really complex game allows you to explore them in a lot of different ways.

Fans of the canon series probably won't like it (I tend to get negative scores on my posts in [[/r/pokemon]] suggesting type interaction changes that are too "extreme" in attempts to make them more realistic/balanced), but I'd love to play a game with more realistic interactions.

  I'd love to. Are you on windows and able to run the data tool?

Yep, been looking at it a bit while editing the next podcast episode. This

"wtf are faries what is this twinkerbell bullshit"

Made me laugh :)

I see you removed immunities, was it for realism or balance?
