  To me, Fire is strong against Steel because inside all that metal are still biological organs. Different, maybe, from what we're used to, but still susceptible to heat. When you heat up a metal skin, it's very painful. When you heat up a rocky skin, it barely feels it.

While I think just about everyone thinks like this, I'm not sure it stands up to scrutiny. You know what else has organs beneath the exterior? Normal types. Yet for some reason they don't have this mystical weakness to fire that steel has, and you'd think it would hurt /worse/, since a Normal type's skin presumably has more nerve endings than one that has literal metal plating.

Would it hurt to have a smouldering red-hot plate of metal that is your skin? Yes. You know what hurts more? Not having skin because it's all been vaporized, oh and your liver's on fire.

Magma is made up of a bunch of different kinds of melted rocks and minerals, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma][has temperatures ranging]] from about 700 °C to 1300 °C

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron][Iron has a melting point]] of 1538 °C.

I mean, we make pure metal by /burning all of the rocks out of it/. I just can't see why stone would magically resist fire better than metal would.

(Sorry if this got a bit heated (pun intended), I just think this is a major case of...whatever the non-statistics version of Simpson's Paradox is.)

However, I've got a few interesting plans for the Steel type. The idea is, when you hit it with enough fire attacks, it starts to heat up, (and /the steel type begins to deal bonus fire damage with contact attacks/, mwa ha ha). You can then start dealing super-effective attacks by then hitting it with water or ice, rapidly cooling it and dealing damage proportional to the temperature decrease, which will also decrease its defense and resistances for the duration of that fight.

Also, what's that? Your skin is made up of a superconductive layer that covers your entire body? It's a shame we don't have portable trained bioelectric generators that ohwaitwhat.

  If you'd rather have that be demonstrated through actual attacks and defensive moves, and just want to keep things as a "this is what happen when X substance meets Y substance," that makes sense.

That's the idea. I don't want to bake the idea of dodging into the abstraction as I'd prefer that part actually be part of the game. All of my type percentages are assuming "this is how much it hurts assuming a successful, solid hit". If through sheer chance a Tauros and an Alakazam both get hit with a faceful of acid, which one is more able to keep up their defenses?

The Alakazam should have an easier time keeping the acid out in the first place, but once it's hit, I can't imagine it's easy to continue deflecting incoming projectiles with one's brain when that same brain is screaming MY FACE. WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY FACE.

  I think we could hash out the typing interactions more if you want.

I'd love to. Are you on windows and able to [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6516469/Bills%20PC/Bills_PC_Release_2016-09-24.zip][run the data tool]]? It has all of the type definitions I have so far, though it's pretty much just a first pass and definitely needs to be rebalanced and revised. If not, I have a JSON file that I could probably convert to a spreadsheet
