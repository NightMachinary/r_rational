  The scope is noted, but still rather exciting -- as pokemon additions strike me as something that could be rather modular. You'd need the basics of where they're located at, what sorts of trainers might have them, and their stats, etc., but that stuff can be outsourced if you would like once you have the basic system down.

  I really like that you're going with a Dwarf Fortress-style system for a lot of things, and it could help a LOT in adding things. DF is spaghetti code at its root, but its modularity is incredible and could be used to make just about anything: buildings, trainers, caves, you name it.

Yup, I just feel like this is the best possible way to go about it. I want to spend most of my time working on the procedural generation, the mechanics, and the game systems. Already other people are offering to help design the specific pokemon, and the map system will be similarly customizable. Once I drop the project in the future, I can only hope I've gotten it to the point where others can mod or expand it simply by making new *.map or *.pkmn files, letting the game live on for as long as there are people willing to tend to it.

  Something worth noting is that while it hasn't been explored very much in OoS (and while this would be a rather... discomforting thought for some given its implications), it's possible that pokemon and humans evolved from the same ancestors, and as such, that some of the more humanoid pokemon evolved a similar intellect.

/shrugs/ I don't have much of a story that I'm looking to tell, nor philosophical ideas that I want to explore. I'm more in it for the complex, interconnected system building, myself.

  I love the idea of impressing pokemon in non-combat ways to get them to join you, though. For instance, finding a colony of psychic types and, as a psychic trainer yourself, impressing them that way. Or helping one out that had gotten injured, or whatever else is appropriate.

Awesome ideas. The player being psychic or dark is something I want to include, but definitely won't be in the earliest incarnations.

  By the way, while you were typing up that response I read your past design document entries and added more questions.

I'll go respond to that, then.
