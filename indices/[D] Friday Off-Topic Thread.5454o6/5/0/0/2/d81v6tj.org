Holy crap this sounds stars-in-my-eyes-/amazing/. Few questions:

Given the rather more complicated math behind type advantages, will there be any tools given to players to calculate that?

Your goal is for there to be multiple options to make progress; does this include there being multiple "goal" or "win" conditions to the game, or will it be open ended (for instance, either Red or Blue's approach to Pokemon from OoS)?

What sort of interaction can be expected with NPCs? What about with wild pokemon? With the latter, you mentioned that a temperament of 500 would be "zen" -- would this allow non-violent interaction with a wild pokemon? What would that amount to? (Feeding them, offering to let them join you without fighting them, etc.?)

Given the degree of detail given to pokemon, are there going to be pokemon with human-rivalling intelligence (Mewtwo, psychic types, the Lucario line, legendaries, etc. seem the most likely to have such)?

Man this sounds so cool, I'm giddy.

edit: Some more questions because aaaaaaaaa.

Will there be opportunity for specialized, non-level-related training? For instance, if you wanted to train a pokemon to be faster or better at dodging than its counterparts.

It's mentioned that training against other pokemon improves moves more quickly than when used in the absence of a target. Would it be possible for a trainer to use themselves as the target for a less-than-lethal move to improve their pokemon more quickly without battling?

The sliding scale of psychics concept is valid, I think, but it should be on a per-pokemon basis, not typal -- Riolu and Lucario would be significantly stronger psychics than a Machop, given that Lucario can learn Psychic, and Riolu has access to Protect, a move which I can only type out as Psychic (in spite of being normal in canon).
