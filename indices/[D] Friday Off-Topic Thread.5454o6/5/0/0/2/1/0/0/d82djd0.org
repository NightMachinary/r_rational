I suppose nonlethal moves would makes sense--wait, isn't training pokemon to use their moves on humans an explicitly Renegade thing to do in OoS? Well in that case it /has/ to go in, once Renegadeness is a thing, anyway.

  Following the crow example, it could also lead to pokemon of an area knowing a person to be "good" by whatever measure they use and defending them. Fun, dynamic stories could develop as a result of that, though it's probably a bit out of the scope of your immediate thoughts toward the game.

Hmm, this /might/ be possible by giving herds and nests an opinion of trainers that is modified whenever a pokemon that belongs to the herd or nest has its "faction standing" increased by the player, modified by the individual's intelligence stat (how much it understands an altruistic action). I like it, it uses the INT stat for one more thing, which is nice.

(It occurs to me that the design doc might not have a current list of stats, of which INT is a relatively recent addition, so I don't know if you were aware it was a thing or not. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Co3cS6p_5h6HGs3tzjbJRRbUFd-vI2njVGjYyz8jwE4/edit#heading=h.1ugqpqwylq1p][The Bill's PC Documentation]] has a section detailing the current stats in use.)

I'll throw it on the list of things to consider once I put groups of pokemon in. I don't see a simple way for that to cross species barriers, off the top of my head, but there might not be many common actions that affect more than one herd/group at a time, anyway.

Thanks for the input! Keep it comin.
