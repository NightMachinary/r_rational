Hahah, well, I was more thinking stuff like what you'd call Telekinetic Grip with regards to training moves.

  shrugs I don't have much of a story that I'm looking to tell, nor philosophical ideas that I want to explore. I'm more in it for the complex, interconnected system building, myself.

Oh yeah, I totally understand that. That was more in reference to the intellect of humanoid species of pokemon. While most species are probably fairly intelligent by real world standards for animals, I feel they would be most likely to comprehend complex commands.

Pokemon intelligence could be of use in certain areas of the game: for instance, in how likely they are to understand motivations (I'm reminded of a story of a person who set two groups of crows to war with each other by being nice to one and mean to the other), and how likely they are to appreciate non-combative approaches, or attempting to heal them, or whatnot.

Following the crow example, it could also lead to pokemon of an area knowing a person to be "good" by whatever measure they use and defending them. Fun, dynamic stories could develop as a result of that, though it's probably a bit out of the scope of your immediate thoughts toward the game.
