One thing I've noticed from when I play fan games is that attempts to make the game harder lead to two habits I wind up in that I don't really like. The first is the clear 'grind until every challenge is easy' urge. Grinding costs nothing except monotony and it gives you the tools to easily beat any challenge, which sounds good until you realize that you're left with hours of tedium and an unchallenging game if you follow the urge. I don't feel this urge in the main series because, by and large, there's no need for grinding. I don't know how possible it would be, but I feel that the game would be better if the urge to grind was counterbalanced by other incentives/disincentives or even taken out of the equation somehow.

The other urge I fall into, I've noticed, is when routes are packed full of challenging trainers that I can still beat, I often feel the need to go all the way back to the Pokemon Center, to not be disadvantaged for the next fight. It's depressingly common, and my reaction these days to a faux-endurance challenge is more negative than positive. Again, this isn't much of a concern in the main series where challenge is a minimum, but I think it's a topic worth investigating, if there's a way to make a segment like that where I have no choice but to stick it through or if such segments should be avoided entirely.

Design talking points aside, this looks like a mountain and a half of work to get through, especially where you would have to create new values like the Pokemon body part metrics. I doubt I'm in any position to be much help deep in the code, but if there's some legwork to the tune of hundreds of Pokemon to do or some part of the design you want another opinion on, I'd be honoured to help out in my spare time.
