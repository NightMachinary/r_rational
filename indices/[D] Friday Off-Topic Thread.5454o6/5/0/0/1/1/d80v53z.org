I abhor grinding.

"What did you do today?"

"I pressed a button repeatedly until my monitor told me I had pressed it enough times and I was allowed to now go do things I actually wanted to do."

  I don't know how possible it would be, but I feel that the game would be better if the urge to grind was counterbalanced by other incentives/disincentives or even taken out of the equation somehow.

Rest assured, my goal is to make a series of small, interesting events that are chained together into a bunch of larger, interesting events. If the player wants to grind I won't stop him, but I don't want there to ever be a wall that they are not /permitted/ to go by until their team is a certain strength. If they want to go forward, then go forward, and if you get your ass kicked, well, maybe go search for another area that you can handle, or /just stick to the road/.

If you're having trouble with a badge, go searching deep into the jungle to find a rare pokemon that would help you beat it! Or go find a guy that can teach your pokemon Ice Beam! Or go earn enough money to buy the TM! Or skip the badge entirely and come back later! Or, /if you're absolutely set on it/, spend time grinding the gym's training area before finally eking out a win. But that should be your absolute last-ditch option, intentionally made the most boring!

  The other urge I fall into, I've noticed, is when routes are packed full of challenging trainers that I can still beat, I often feel the need to go all the way back to the Pokemon Center, to not be disadvantaged for the next fight.

Trainer fights will be different in this incarnation. I'm not sure I like the whole "we made eye contact WE ARE DUTY BOUND TO FIGHT" thing, so it will more likely be NPCs that you can talk to and offer to battle. I also expect that there will be relatively fewer trainers way out in the sticks, and more of them right in or near town, so if nothing else you'd have a shorter trip on your hands.

Trainer fights and wild battles will have a difference in effort, though. Origin of Species had the characters being very careful to not actually harm the opponent's pokemon, and I aim to have a similar system. Something more like "1v1, first to half HP loses" sort of thing, with serious penalties for then intentionally punting your opponent into the stratosphere.

Anyway, I have no intention of having trainer mazes that you have dodge or fight your way through; I intend for most of the game and most of the interesting challenges to be fighting wild pokemon. Here's the pokemon I want to capture; he's surrounded on that side by a cliff that I can use for Rock Slide, but he's also got five or six friends close to him, and how can I drive them away without losing my quarry? Etc.

  I doubt I'm in any position to be much help deep in the code, but if there's some legwork to the tune of hundreds of Pokemon to do or some part of the design you want another opinion on, I'd be honoured to help out in my spare time.

It's targeted to Windows only, sadly, and won't work in Wine or what have you, but it's pretty much at the point that pokemon can be designed and defined. I'm really only adding features to help make that job easier at this point, as it actually works quite well. Give it a shot and let me know what you think; there's a link to the documentation in the settings tab.
