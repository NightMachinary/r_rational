I've taken a look, and it certainly seems like I should give the completely new stats (constitution, resistance, temperament) a good deal of thought before trying to decide how stat spreads should look for various Pokemon. As for the interface itself, it looks pretty solid for having everything I need to pay attention to laid out in efficient organization.

A couple quick questions, though. In the Anatomy section, I see things like HP and HP+ for the stats of each body part. Should I conclude that if a stat is present the functioning of the body part affects the stat itself, and that a + assigns extra significance?

Also, I'm lacking a bit of perspective about the stat values. Mewtwo's better stats are well above 500 and his lesser stats are well below 500, so is 500 meant to be above average but not exceptionally powerful, as in, what a decent Pokemon like, say, Scyther, could be at with its physical attack?

And, just to see if I understand it right, Intelligence deals with the Pokemon's ability to understand complex orders, Constitution deals with the Pokemon's internal stability, or how good their body is at keeping them healthy, Accuracy and Evasion are just modifiers on hit chance, Initiative is what speed used to be (priority and turn order, etc.) while Speed is now movement speed, Critical is a modifier on critical hit rate, Respect is the Pokemon's opinion of trainers as a general rule, Loyalty is the Pokemon's willingness to follow orders, Temperament is a modifier on the behaviour of the Pokemon, and is Weakness about keeping external effects (like cold) from having an affect on it, as is it inverse, where more Weakness makes it easier to affect?

I think I'll take a stab at making a stat spread for one of the Pokemon after I've given the stats a little more thought and hear back from you. This looks interesting.
