Exercise is one of the few things that semi-reliably seems to help. If you find it difficult to summon up the willpower to go for a run or walk, experiment around with "energetic" music. You may well discover there's something out there that just /compels/ you to physical activity. Alternatively, mentally cast the exercise as a form of procrastination from coding.
