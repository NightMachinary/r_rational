I'm looking for advice on productivity and depression, and since I have most of the same mental quirks as most of you, I thought I'd ask here. Here are a few details:

I've been playing around with a couple different antidepressants over the past several months, and recently, my doctor had me try bupropion, which is sort of helping to improve my mood a little, but not putting me in a state where I'm able to get things done. In general, I've already tried the stuff before the “Get Serious” section on SSC's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/][Things that Sometimes Help if You're Depressed]] page, such as thyroid/anemia tests, CBT with a counselor, etc.

My biggest problem is that being depressed means that I don't have much willpower to spend on things. When I was a student, I could reliably get 40+ hours of solid work done a week. Now, it feels like I have little enough energy that, on most days, I have to choose between writing an hour of code, going out to socialize, exercising, or cooking something decently healthy. Perhaps having a job would help boost my self-esteem and thereby raise my productivity, but that seems like a chicken-and-egg problem, as the whole point of being productive is so I can have a job, or otherwise make enough money to give some to EA causes.

/help/? Please and thank you <3

ETA: It seems like writing code takes tons more effort than other productive things, like doing e.g. linear algebra or statistics problems from a bachelor's level math class, or mundane productive things like cleaning and self-care. Maybe this is a bad sign?
