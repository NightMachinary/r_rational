I commissioned a piece of music for Marked for Death, and it was recently finished. Amusingly, in spite of not knowing the main character was earth-element, the musician behind it named the piece [[https://literal-lapin.tumblr.com/post/150661943661/commissioned-by-cariyaga-even-though-i-dont][Landslide]]. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out in spite of its being at a slower tempo than I expected.
