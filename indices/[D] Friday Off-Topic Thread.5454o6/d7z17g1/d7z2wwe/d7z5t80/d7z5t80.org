Well, /most/ of the principles are, but there are a few things "truly" rational fiction do that make for unsatisfying narrative. For example, Wildbow dice rolling for fatalities during worm is rational in the sense that it allows probability, rather than plot armor, to dictate who dies, but many of us would probably have dropped the series if the wrong charachters had died.
