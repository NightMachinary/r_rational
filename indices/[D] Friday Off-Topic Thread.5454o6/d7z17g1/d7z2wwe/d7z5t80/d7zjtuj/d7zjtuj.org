I can't imagine stopping a story just because a character died. Now, if the consequences or aftermath of the death weren't handled well, that would be one thing, but loss of beloved characters is where so much meat in compelling stories are found.

Then again, Deathnote did become far less enjoyable for me after a certain plot point halfway through... Though that's just becaus the follow up "replacement" wasn't as entertaining.
