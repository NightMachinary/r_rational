I also recall hearing that, if the main character was set to die, she would have been classified as a decoy protagonist, and the perspective would shift to someone suitably different. It would be like a completely different story, but the plot could still be told, to one degree or another.

He even had the scene planned, if she did die. The only difference between that and canon is that no one would show up to help her.
