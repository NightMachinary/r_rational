Ahh. I can see how ending a series that way can be a bit of a downer, especially if it's not handled well.

In the series I'm thinking of, it really kicks everything into a new mode. The protagonist spent years and book after book fighting to save his city, gaining allies, training others, learning to be the strongest and toughest and smartest he could be, and becomes the de facto leader of the city's good guys/defenders... thus painting a mark on his back, and getting sniped at the end of a book.

The subsequent one details how everyone reacted, and how they basically all stepped up to take up his mantle, and continue his work and legacy as best they could, even though none of them individually was as strong as him. It was very bittersweet and inspiring.
