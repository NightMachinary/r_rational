Thanks a lot for reaching out, asking help takes a lot of effort and helpes others in your situation. It's too late here for the long answer I want to write, so I'll come back tomorrow and will add more parts.

For now know that you are not alone and that things gets better. Those are not empty words.

Yoi can check the replies to my first reddit comment, my problem different but they helped me a lot. At the end the big question for everyone is: "how can I be happy?"

So, check this again tomorrow, and feel free to PM me.
