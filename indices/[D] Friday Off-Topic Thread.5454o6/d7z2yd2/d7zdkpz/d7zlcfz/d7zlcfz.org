Thanks <3

Seriously, though, I think I have enough energy to do a couple hours of self-care that I wouldn't have done otherwise now that you were nice to me.

I've read the responses to your first post, as well as a few things by rationalists on depression in other places. For reasons of attention/willpower-conservation, I think I'm going to try to replace around 1/3 to 1/2 of my diet with some sort of meal replacement product (I've tried MealSquares and Soylent, and liked both).

It seems like getting out of depression with limited available mental resources is quite amenable to munckinry :)
