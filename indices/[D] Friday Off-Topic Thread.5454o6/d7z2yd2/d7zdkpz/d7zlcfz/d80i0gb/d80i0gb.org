I'm really happy to have made your day better! One of my suggestion was exactly to cut down on your present objectives to keep only a few of really urgent/important, and leave the rest in a temporal stasis. So good idea with MealSquares and Soylent. It's funny I was considering them too this week for time saving reasons.

Now, I have zero qualifications on the medical side of depression and I'll leave that to professionals, but some personal experience with lack of motivation. Below some disconnected ideas:

If you have close friends/familiars you trust I would reach out, explain the situation and ask for help and support.

Whithout thinking about what you /should/ do, what is the single biggest obstacle you have now from happyness or that would permit you to unlock more motivation?

You can consider yourself playing a Real Life MMORPG, if it can help, where you have to gain new skills, get better physical stats and deal with a low starting mana pool (your motivation).

I would suggest to put finding a job in maximum priority (important *and* urgent) if any of these points applies:

- Your savings are getting low
- You are living in a toxic environment and need a way out (I would consider moving to a different city too)
- You need to gain economic independency

At this level of priority you don't care much about what time of job you're gonna do, you are in emergency mode and you have to get out of it fast. You'll then have time to search better openings. It really helps to ask already employed friends to send your CV to their company's HR. HR asks always for reccomended person anyway, so everybody wins.

If you are not in emergency mode then finding a job is important but not urgent. Consider that EA suggests that the best philantropy is to focus on growing your career capital until you are 30. Or in more poetic terms, it's okay if you start saving the world one person at a time, and if that person is you.

If as I understood you are a programmer you shouldn't have much problems finding a job in the area you prefer, and as an english speaker you are literally searched all over the world. If part of your depression comes to feeling caged, consider that you would be welcomed everywhere.

Programming takes a lot of processing power, as you are always problem solving and reasoning high level. It's normal that cleaning or self-care takes much less brain power, or even feels refreshing. You could reach out to find communities dedicated to a manual/physical activity of your choice, to have a change of pace and feel a sense of accomplishment that fuel you forward to the next accomplishment and so on. This is also a moment of the year when acting associations are searching for new members, and it helps in a lot of ways, so I would give a shot to that.

So, consider this a blurt from the heart and sorry for confusing/typos bits. Don't feel bad or egoistic if you focus on your well being for the moment. Find one or two things to work on and concentrate on them with all your resources. When you will have get them to a good point you will add other two and so on.
