I'm just reading through it now. A few small things: I think the Pokémon names should be capitalized, like Arbok. Also, I think it could do with a few more read throughs because of typos.

But overall, I'm quite enjoying it. I'd encourage you to think more about why things are the way they are in the Pokémon world. You'll get that a lot in this subreddit.
