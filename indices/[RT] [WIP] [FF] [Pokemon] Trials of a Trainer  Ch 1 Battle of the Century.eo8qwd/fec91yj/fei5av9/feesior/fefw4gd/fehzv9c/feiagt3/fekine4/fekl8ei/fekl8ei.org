I'm glad you enjoyed it. I wanted to try and mash together a bunch of different concepts/headcanons/ideas from different fics I've read over the years. Im a little surprised it fit together so nicely.

  I hope to find out more about the brink. Am I right to say that it takes place in a future history of our world?

Yup! You're right. It takes place in a post-post-apocolypse world where civilization was torn down completely and repeatedly over the millennia by pok√©mon coming through the Brink. Which there will be explored more later on in the story.

  Gotta say, was sad to see that Red didn't start with Pikachu but I understand the motive.

I wrestled with this decision a lot, including debating about adding a Pikachu later on in the story, but I was afraid it might be too similar to Game of Champions if I did that. So I decided to go a different route.
