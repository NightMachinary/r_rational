Ok, I've finally read all the chapters. Just wanted to encourage you to keep up the momentum. I do indeed get a good Game of Champions vibe from it. I like the relationship between Mimey and Red. I hope to find out more about the brink. Am I right to say that it takes place in a future history of our world? Gotta say, was sad to see that Red didn't start with Pikachu but I understand the motive.
