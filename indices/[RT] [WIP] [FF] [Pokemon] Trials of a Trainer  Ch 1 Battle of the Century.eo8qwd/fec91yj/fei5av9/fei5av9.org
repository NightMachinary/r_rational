Here's a bunch of pokemon headcannons I have:

â€‹

- It was mentioned that in the ancient past people made pokeballs out of berries which implies that they can be low tech. Some pokemon when they evolve shrink to a small sphere then expand in their new shape (does that actually happen? In some of the 3d games atleast?). So people would first launch a blowdart filled with a berry essence that would put the target unwittingly into a evolution state, since the conditions aren't right it'd just "evolve" into the same form, if it wasn't interrupted by someone putting a specially made container around the sphere that prevents the pokemon from rexpanding. The container would probably have an inner coating to keep the pokemon stable, perhaps another berry mixture? Carved everstone? Mirrors? This technology has of course advanced immensely, with advances such a signal projector instead of a dart, lucid dreaming with a psychically connected programable sim and stuff like that.
- The reason that many pokemon's calls and thus names are so appropriate is that the modern common language can be traced back in part to people imitating pokemon calls to refer to something similar to the pokemon, much like why writing looks sorta like the unown.
- Nobody actually knows what's up with the unown, least of all the unown themselves.
- The reason moves are limited in number is that pokemon need to grow new organs to use many of them like mini evolutions. This is why skitty can use thunder attacks.
- The language used in pokemon is mostly translated exept for that the words "evolution" and "metamorphosis" which are swapped.
- lamarckian metamorphosis works for pokemon which allows speciation to happen much faster.
- Pokemon fossils aren't fossilized like we understand it, they can put themselves in stasis and ended up buried. They've been in stasis so long they usually need a special machine to wake them up again.
- Humans in pokemon aren't quite the same mentality to us, they have an instinctive suitability to leadership.
- Pokemon are as varied mentally as they are physically and smarter/dumber isn't enough to sum it up, for example metagross is difficult to communicate with due to the difference in perspective, durants are about as smart as actual ants though have something of a hive mind and several rock types have no sense of time, waiting for a day as easily as a century.
- A population of rotom possessing the same things and deciding to stick with them permanently is the source of many modern modern pokemon types like klink.
- The golurk line is a case of this being done intentionally. Before civilization rotom possessed ore formations, this incidentally is the source of the metagross line.
- There are more rotom like pokemon of different types and preferred host items though they are rather strange, unpredictable and difficult to study, only rotom is civil enough to have a proper designation.
- A great many modern pokemon come from a sort of organic rotom in the far past, this is also why many pokemon are humanoid, some tribe wandering into a group of these pokemon or making a mistake while trying to train them.
- The definition of pokemon is an aura based lifeform, there are still non aura based lifeforms around but other than humans and most plants the biggest are about the size of a large bug, in this geographic area anyway.
- The first pokemon is considered to be deoxys which made or caused to be made mew. These created a great civilization but due to their high energy needs there are only a few left in the known world living near major energy concentrations. The legendaries are their own things but it's believed every group has their own unique origins.
- The true nature of Arceus and thus the world as a whole is unknown, the few interviews people have managed to get with the entity itself have clarified nothing though the answers it gave remain fascinating and people have spent years pondering the conceptual labyrinths stored in the psychic recordings.
- The civilization consisting of these region-states consists of a large series of islands but is hardly worldwide, there are many strange and glorious places if you go far enough.
- Battling is the traditional and most widely used test of a trainer but it's far from the only one and one that many argue is lacking, there are other formal and important circuits for the traveling trainer such as people competing to train the best team of Pokemon chefs or construction workers.
- There are many training principles and philosophies, for example especially among the higher tier trainer of more intelligent pokemon there is a belief that the trainer doesn't have a place in a battle and should stick to, well, training. Another is the trading culture where instead of carefully building single team to last a lifetime and every situation pokemon are rapidly shuffled around a group of trainers as circumstances dictate, these trainers are often looked down upon by more mainstream trainers but this is generally unfair to this legitimate practice. Frequently traded pokemon should be given far more leeway and independence than ones in more permanent positions for social and psychological reasons.
- Although the porygon pokedexes are destined to be a specialist tool there are designs with special rotom compatibility for general use, however due to the fact that rotom are almost universally unsuited to the role, which requires a mindset somewhere between secretary and clerk it seems unlikely to catch on majorly. The possibly of accidentally having them use the expensive and fragile piece of hardware to fight is another drawback.
- The achievement of creating the porygon line is an impressive achievement but if you look deeper it's creation is perhaps the single most important accomplishment ever. Porygon is a purely aura based pokemon and does not necessarily have a distinct physical form or location. Although it was built using the same basic principles and to be compatible with systems like pokeballs it is the only pokemon that can't be traced to the same origin as the rest, it is being argued that it shouldn't be classified as a pokemon at all. Porygon and porygon2 have very large yet very simple minds arguably not truly intelligent or even alive. PorygonZ however is most certainly both though not in a way even it's creators entirely understand.
- There are many pokemon with no designation or place in the training system, for example ones that have never been caught or studied, truly sessile ones, or ones that can't be trained.
- It's not uncommon for a high tier team to have several trainers, even outnumbering the pokemon, for example tactician, battle director, nutritionist, researcher, publicist and of course the trainer.
