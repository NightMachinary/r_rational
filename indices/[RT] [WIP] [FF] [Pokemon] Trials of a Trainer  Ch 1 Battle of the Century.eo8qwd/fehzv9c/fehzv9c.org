I've read 3 chapters now and I'm really getting into it. I hope you keep going with it. I'm enjoying the twists you did to the canon story line as they make more sense, and I'm digging the Pok√©dex entries too. Keep up the good work. I think you're striking a good tone, just keep to the world building! The characters seem to be getting established in their individuality, which is great.
