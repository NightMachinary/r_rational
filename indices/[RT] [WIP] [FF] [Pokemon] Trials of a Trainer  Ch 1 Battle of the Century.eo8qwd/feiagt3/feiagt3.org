Typo thread?

Chapter 3 (I only thought about pointing these out during this Chapter. I might go back and revisit the older ones later if you don't mind?)

"Special designation is given to those trainers that have beat members of the Elite Four. *Fourth ring* has defeated one member; third ring has defeated two members; second ring has defeated three members; and *fourth ring* has defeated all four members."

Fourth ring appears twice. From the context, I'm guessing the second should be "First ring"

"The Youngster Act became dead in the water the instant *Aconite* ratified it"

Isn't Lance the Grand Champion at this point, and as such the one who'd ratify it?

"we never *+had ran+*"

Past perfect. If the To Have verb is in the past, the main verb (To run in this case) needs to be in the present.

"*+Padding+* paws echoed"

Padded

"Nevertheless, it doesn't *+whether+* you have Oak or Ketchum as your last name

It doesn't matter. Or keep whether and remove the "it doesn't"

"battling techniques*+,+* and species biology"

No need for a comma if you're following with "and (last part of the sentence). Actually, take this one with a grain of salt, I might be wrong.

*Other minor nitpicks*

A number of lines end in commas instead of periods. I do believe that even in the occasions where you end a line, followed by some minor narration and return to the same line, there is no comma you just don't use a period. Like here;

*"That is true,"* Davis nodded. "But we are starting..."

Inconsistent accenting in Pok√©mon. Sometimes it shows with the accent, sometimes it doesn't. I believe that for convenience sake, writers who aren't from a language that usually accent words just don't bother with it and no one sees problems;

Every letter in an acronym followed by a period. This is one is technically correct I think, but there is no strict ruling saying so. And actually, there is a push for using what is more aesthetically pleasing, meaning cutting the periods. Which also makes it more convenient for writers (coincidence, I'm sure).
