This is a little different than Internet fiction. You'd need to convince a studio to give you a television budget to make a show about people doing math for a half hour in order to buy a house to sell it for more, and hold the kind of people who would watch a house flipping show for hours of a lazy afternoon. Plenty of people make money being rational house flippers and plenty of people crash with burn, but to make a show novel and also about minimizing risk is a tough task. More so selling it to a production house, since the name of the game is manufactured conflict and easy compromises that will float attention for advertisers.
