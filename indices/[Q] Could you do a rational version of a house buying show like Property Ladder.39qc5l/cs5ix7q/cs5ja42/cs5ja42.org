The TV shows aren't fiction, but a story about them would be fictional. Not that I'd object to writing Harry Potter and the Methods of House Flipping where Harry Potter desperately tries to flip his wealth into enough money to save Hermione.

I could, but I live in an area that wouldn't give great margins, and I have a stable career, and I lack effective DIY skills. Success in this sort of thing requires either good DIY skills or good contractors (or both) good skill at getting mortgages, good finances, a lot of properties in your area that are undervalued or such. I don't really have that skillset so it'd be a risky proposition at the moment. This is true for many of those on the shows.
