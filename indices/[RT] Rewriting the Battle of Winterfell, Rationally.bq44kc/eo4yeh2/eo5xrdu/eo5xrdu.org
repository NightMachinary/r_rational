I always figured he turned children into WWs instead of adults because he doesn't have control over them like he does with the zombies, so he has to raise them from a young age to ensure loyalty. Otherwise, I don't know why he wouldn't just turn adults. Assuming that theory is wrong, even if he could turn Bran and control him, wouldn't it be smarter to just kidnap him? What does the NK's presence accomplish that a thousand zombies couldn't?

I wish we knew what the NK's range for controlling and raising the dead was, he might've been able to just wait them out until their people started to starve or he could pick off the weak in their sleep with zombie [insert small but potentially lethal animals] and raise them to do the same. It kind of seems like the NK was in a hurry for no apparent reason, the weather alone would have depleted the living's forces considerably.
