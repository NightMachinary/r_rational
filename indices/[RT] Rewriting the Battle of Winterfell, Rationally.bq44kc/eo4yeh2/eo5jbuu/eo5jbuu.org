  A rational NK could have just flown around Winterfell during the night, headed south, and just spent a while razing cities to the ground and bringing back the dead as even more fodder for his army.

If he did that there'd be no corpses for him to raise, it's established that burned corpses can't be raised. So he wouldn't want to actually use his dragon to just toast everybody. And if the dragon killed through non-fire means, it'll have to get up close and personal, /and/ be far away from zombie support and the support of his night walkers. If his dragon got shot by a ballista he'd fall and wind up alone deep in enemy territory.
