I guess there's no point in just arming our living dragon to the teeth with Valerian steel /obsidian if their scales are /that/ good, seeing as they're not strong enough to break little metal chains...it would be like two turtles trying to kill each other, except without any of the little fleshy bits.

If the eye is the only weak spot, I guess Bran can warg into a little mosquito or something and get the eye.

However...the scales /aren't/ that strong, are they? If they are, how did the night king kill the living dragon /with a spear/? (And we know that Valerian steel is an effective counter to ice blades, unless this is some sort of rock-paper-scissors magic deal and Valerian steel is strong against ice spears but weak against undead dragon scales, while live dragons are weak against ice spears).
