One way to give the NK a reason for going after Bran is that there's a scene where Bran used his greenseer abilities to disrupt the NKs control of the wights, possibly even (temporarily) subvert them. I feel like it'd add more urgency to the NK wanting to take down Bran + needing to be close enough as to be at risk
