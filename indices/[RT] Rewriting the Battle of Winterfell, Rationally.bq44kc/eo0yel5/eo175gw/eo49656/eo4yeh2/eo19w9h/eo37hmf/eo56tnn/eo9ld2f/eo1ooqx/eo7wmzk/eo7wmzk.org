Sorry, this kinda falls apart for me at the very beginning. Why would Cersei, the way we know her to be, do that? Yes, Cersei's actions are short-sighted and spiteful. But Cersei /is/ short-sighted and spiteful. That's her whole personality, basically. She thinks herself cunning but ultimately she's never able to have the big picture, she can scheme but not lay down a strategy, and that's her undoing time and time again. A story being rational should not mean every character being rational. Also because at that point if the Night King was fully rational /too/... well. Good riddance, humanity.
