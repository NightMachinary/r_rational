hmm, interesting. I wanted to both make the story rationalist, and make it cinematic.

In my version the Night King has to be in a hurry, Bran can constantly direct the dragons to drop bombs on him and his white walkers (as seen in the first segment of my plot), and his white walkers need to be around or else the dragons will make quick work of his zombies (meaning he and his white walkers can't just hole up somewhere).

I was working this morning on coming up with the rest of how I would like to see Season 8 play out. Basically, in my version, the Night King is trying to set things up so that the rest of the characters set out to destroy themselves (Cersei, Daenerys, Jon) to make things easier for himself, and he is able to reincarnate from other white walkers (this is me pulling artistic license here) so his objective in the battle of Winterfell is to convincingly get his current body killed. So he can't make it too easy on the defenders, but he can't also be entirely away.

I don't like the idea of Bran being the Night Walker. That has a lot of problems, too, such as how the Night Walker possesses him (not a power the Night Walker is supposed to have).
