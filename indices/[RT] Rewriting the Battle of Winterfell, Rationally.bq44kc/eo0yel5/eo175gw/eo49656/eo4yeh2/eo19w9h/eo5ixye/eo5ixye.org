Good point on the impersonating a zombie difficulty, in my revised script (not here) I have the night king moving his minions and spotting Arya when Arya (while in the crowd of zombies) doesn't move the very instant the minions do.

  Also, Bran needs to be warging into people

It's already explained in the show that Bran can't possess people (except the insane, in the case of Hodor). In my revised plot I have Bran directing Daernys and directing the Scorpion crews (to aim at the night walkers) with ravens.

Thanks!
