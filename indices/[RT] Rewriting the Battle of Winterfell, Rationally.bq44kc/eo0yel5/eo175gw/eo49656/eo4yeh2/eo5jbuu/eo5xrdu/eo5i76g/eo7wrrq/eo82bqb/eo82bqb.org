yeah we do need a lot more information about the Night King. I was just brainstorming reasons for the NK to have to take risks. As it is, we still have no real idea what the White Walkers really are, or how their biology works, or even the extent of their magic - White Walkers seem to be made of ice, and presumably produce no body heat; and yet a White Walker was able to deliver a human baby, wrapped only in a blanket, all the way to their meeting place deep in the tundra, without the baby freezing to death halfway there? There's so much we don't know about the White Walkers that I hope the books explain, or at the very least touch upon.
