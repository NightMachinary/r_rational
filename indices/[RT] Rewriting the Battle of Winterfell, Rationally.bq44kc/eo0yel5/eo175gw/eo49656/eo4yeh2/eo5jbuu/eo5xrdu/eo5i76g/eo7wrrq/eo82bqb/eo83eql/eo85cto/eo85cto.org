We know where they come from, but what actually are they? Do they think? The Night King seemed to show emotion; do the other White Walkers have independent minds, or are they a hive-mind? Do they have a culture? They wear clothes, so clearly they can make stuff, and that seems indicative of culture - why wear clothes when nothing can harm anyway, and the few things that do instantly pierce your clothes, except for cultural reasons? How do they raise the Whitewalker babies we see the NK create? Do they even have to raise them? Do they have a language? How exactly does their ability to raise the dead work? Do they cause winter, or do they only invade during winter? Are they alive? If so, what do they eat? Are they solar powered? Somehow powered by magic? Do they have to sleep? And tons of stuff like that.

Essentially, we know where the come from. But we don't really know anything about how they work, and that's what I meant by not knowing what they 'really are'.
