Dragons are incredibly hard to hit in flight, and dragon fire in the show has been shown to have an incredible amount of kinetic force behind them. Simply flying around a city and focusing on blowing up structures so that towers and buildings collapse on people would yield a significant amount of non-burnt dead. But even if that wouldn't work, he easily could have flown around the southern countryside at night slaughtering smallfolk (who, without valyrian steel or dragonglass, would be powerless to stop him). He could amass a decent force this way, and then attack towns and cities the normal 'zombie zerg rush way'. The last episode shows us that a single dragon can easily solo a city, and only Kings Landing has Scorpions. And even then, there's nothing saying that the NK couldn't just pull a Scorpion bolt out of his dragon and raise it again, if the structural damage wasn't to severe. Hiding from his horde in a castle would be completely impossible, unless you have your own dragons to defend you, and any survivors fleeing the flames would run right into his zombies But essentially the point I was trying to make is that, given the situation we get in season 8, a rational NK is basically unbeatable. The fact that he has a dragon, is completely immune to harm from anything but valyrian steel and dragonglass, can mass raise the dead, and already has White Walker Generals that can control their own thralls, means that, if he plays his cards right, he really can't lose.

The only way the good guys have any chance of winning is if the Night King has a very strong reason to attack Winterfell personally. Otherwise a smart NK just has a few of his generals attack Winterfell, and flies south by night to start another horde, in a land where there are no dragons to fight him, and nobody knows how to hurt him. But from your other reply I can see that you already like my Bran idea xD
