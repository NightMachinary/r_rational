The linked video also stresses how ineffectually the castle was used in the episode. You improved on that, it seems, but I expect he'd still complain about the underutilization of archers and the castle for maneuvering. One specific tactic suggested was to position the infantry around, not in front, and attempt to lure the Whites into circling the castle to be softened up by arrow-fire. However, if that had been executed effectively, it would have made the episode kinda drag and limit the opportunity to show the other defenses being of use.

I like your more effective use of dragons. I almost want to say the barrel of daggers should have been a barrel of flechettes, but that would imply someone had bothered planning for how to launch obsidian attacks from dragonback, and why would they bother developing a weapon specifically for that when they already have a dragon and daggers? Barrel of daggers is already pretty effective. The only downside would be if the handles outweigh the blades, since that seems like it would reduce the number of daggers that would actually do the necessary damage to neutralize Whites. But I'm just quibbling over the precise shape of the fragments, when the tactic overall is sound.
