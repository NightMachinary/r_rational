The NK has been seen downing a dragon with a javelin throw. And if he downs it, he adds it to his forces. What's a few hundred mindless undead lost compared to /that/? If he gets all three dragons, the world is his. The enemy sending the dragons right into my maw would be /exactly what I want/, if I were in him.
