Why all the cleverness? The defenders of Winterfell have such a massive advantage in the fight its almost obscene.

In Season 6, it is established that Bran can warg into people in the past when he possesses Hodor and sets him up to hold the door against the wights and save Bran later on in life. I'll accept that maybe Bran has to be nearby to the victim or the victim in question must be susceptible to being possessed in the first place, so perhaps Bran could not just possess the Night King before he was undead and was only a child and have him commit suicide, but Bran is still the most powerful being in Planetos. All Bran needs to do is to simply warg back into an animal or human in the past near his old self in a timeline he dislikes and explain to him the exact repercussions of a certain action his past self takes, presumably collapsing the current timeline and allowing past Bran to make a more prudent choice. In theory, Bran could simply test thousands or more actions, strategies, etc, until he finishes the battle in a timeline wherein the Night King loses.

Hell, he could probably have Theon shoot an obsidian-tipped arrow from the castle walls and, over hundreds of timelines, refine the exact angle, force, time and location to shoot it at to dink the Night King in the forehead and allay the siege with one simple flick of a bow.
