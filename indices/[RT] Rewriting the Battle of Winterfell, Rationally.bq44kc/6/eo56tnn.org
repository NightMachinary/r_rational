Are we minmaxing here or going for a cinematic story?

I actually wonder why the Night King attacks Winterfell at all. He is not in a hurry. He could just lay siege and wait for them to starve or freeze. Creating zombies in the crypt is a nice trick to devastate moral during the siege, but maybe he would have to be too close.

In terms of cinematic story, I think [[http://www.sirlin.net/posts/game-of-thrones-predictions-from-a-game-designer][David Sirlin has the best retelling]]. It also includes Arya killing Jon.
