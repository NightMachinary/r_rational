  In my version the Night King has to be in a hurry, Bran can constantly direct the dragons to drop bombs on him and his white walkers (as seen in the first segment of my plot), and his white walkers need to be around or else the dragons will make quick work of his zombies (meaning he and his white walkers can't just hole up somewhere).

Now, idk if this is actually the case, but I was under the impression that his WWs were autonomous generals with there own zombie forces. Is there any reason for them not to separate? Could the NK and his undead dragon with endless stamina not just lead the other dragons on an endless goose chase? Maybe he could take a WW with him too to throw spears off the back of his dragon. While this is happening, the rest of his WWs could just attack Winterfell or King's Landing.
