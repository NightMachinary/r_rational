I think in order to do a rationalist rewrite of this battle we'd need a stronger understanding of how the NK's powers actually work, something that Bran could conceivably tell us about if he observed past battles that the NK took part in and how he reacted/approached certain situations.

I like the idea with Arya but I don't think impersonating a white walker is feasible. On one side I think she needs to remove the face of someone in order to become them so she'd need a white walkers face, but they crumple into ice when they die so this might not be possible. On the other hand, I think the show gives decent evidence to the fact that the NK can see through the eye's of his zombies but can't control them, or see through them, all simultaneously, instead, he can give broad orders to groups of them telepathically. This might make impersonating a zombie possible since doing a search through his entire army to find one that he can't see through would be pretty hard without something like a mental look-up table and a decent search algorithm, realistically it probably shouldn't be something that crosses his mind in the first place unless he happens to spot the one acting abnormal. His white walkers, though, are few in number, distinct in appearance, communicate in some way that isn't the common tongue, and would be easy to keep tabs on (something the other white walkers could help with as well).

I like the idea of the NK wanting Bran for his strategic value but, honestly, he should want him dead just as much, since, without Bran, enemy forces would have little to no chance of locating the NK who could then just hide as far away as possible and safely direct his army. Also, Bran needs to be warging into people (or fucking toucans, maybe other wargers could allow bird to bird communication, are any left?) in order to direct his forces if he wants to stay competitive with the NK's abilities, otherwise the strike teams and dragons sent to kill the NK will have a rough time actually finding him if he isn't stationary.

Cersei probably should have sent scorpions since, if they won but the scorpions were destroyed in the process she would look good for helping (giving her some political leverage), if they won and the scorpions weren't destroyed she could have left her soldiers with standing orders to kill the remaining dragons and/or any other key assets, and if they didn't win she would be fucked either way.

Overall, I much prefer your version to the travesty that was actually shown. The better use of Milasandre, Greyscale, the dragons' ability to airdrop stuff, and the lord of light are all far more satisfying.
