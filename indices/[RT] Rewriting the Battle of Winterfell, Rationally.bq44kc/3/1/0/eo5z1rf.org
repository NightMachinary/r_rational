I kind of assuming that, from the way all his generals died when the NK died, the WWs are kind of a vague hive-mind. They are all obviously linked to him in a major way, given they all cease to exist once he's dead, so I thought it wouldn't be a major leap to assume they are all at least somewhat under his control. As for why the NK would need to do it personally; in the scene I mentioned, the NK was shown having to physically walk up, and touch the human child in order to turn them into a WW. It would however, be easier to just kidnap Bran, unless somehow the NK doesn't have enough fine control over his zombies to do that efficiently/safely. But that's making even more assumptions. We do need a lot more information, because you are right; the NK had absolutely no reason to be in a hurry. Put a rational actor in the NKs shoes at the start of season 8, and everyone on Westeros dies within the decade. We need more information on the specific weaknesses of the WWs that might have motivated them to chose a straight up battle instead of a war of attrition they were guaranteed to win, but that probably means waiting until either the books, or the prequel series comes out.
