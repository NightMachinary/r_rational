There's actually another reason to give the NK a reason to personally go after Bran. I'm actually baffled it wasn't used in the show, because as far as I can remember it only took place in the show, and hasn't been shown in the books, so it might actually have been something DnD came up with together.

In one of the earlier seasons, we had a great scene where the NK seemingly turned one of Craster's baby boy sacrifices into a new White Walker. This established that, at the very least, the NK was capable of turning humans into White Walkers with a touch.

Given that Bran has spent the past 7 years amassing more and more mystic power, it would be perfectly rational for the NK to want to recruit Bran into his army, by turning him into a white walker. Having a White Walker general with all of Bran's established powers (controlling animals, controlling people, clairvoyance, an unlimited ability to see and even kind of influence the past and a vague, implied ability to see at least some of the future) could essentially be a win condition for the NK, and would provide him with a strong incentive to want to get within touching range of Bran. It would even make sense for the NK to be aware of the Three Eyed Raven and his powers, given that the NK was a creation of the Children of the Forest, and it would have been perfect if it was the weakening of the old Three Eyed Raven, as well as the decline of the few remaining Children of the Forest, to be the reason the NK suddenly became capable of waging his war on the living.

Other than that, I really don't think Arya would be able to impersonate a White Walker. From what we've seen of their biology, and how they shatter after death, it seems impossible. And honestly, without somehow buffing Bran or making him an irresistible, instant-win target, I don't see how the living could ever possibly win once rational NK has a dragon.

If the NK was rational, there would never have been a siege of Winterfell, Bran be damned. Last episode we saw just how effective a dragon is at taking cities and mass destruction. Dragons are already incredibly hard to hit, and an undead dragon would be even tankier, making any hits that landed even less. A rational NK could have just flown around Winterfell during the night, headed south, and just spent a while razing cities to the ground and bringing back the dead as even more fodder for his army. If a rational NK is going to be defeated, there has to be a reason for him to take risks; a target he can't risk killing the normal way.

The NK wanting to turn Bran, I think, could very easily provide that reason, and could be a springboard from which a rational strategy could be planned.
