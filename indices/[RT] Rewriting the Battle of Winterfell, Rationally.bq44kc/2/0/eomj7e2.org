Pretty good video. There are so many problems with that battle, none of it made any sense.

Other points not broached in the video:

- the living troops are dispersed like they are preparing to march, not fight. They should be densely packed into literal walls of soldiers. The word "sergeant" comes from french "serre-gens" which literally means "squeeze people", because they were employed to keep pikemen squeezed together contiguously. That density is necessary in order to break charges and physically prevent enemies from passing through their lines.

- beyond the issue of absent shields, hardly anyone even wears a helmet (save for Grey Worm) ! And the armor is overall shown as little more effective than papier mâché which is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIUrd7d1Q][utterly ridiculous]].

But then I'm sure there are half a million articles and videos pointing out all those and more already.
