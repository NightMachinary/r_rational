Ya, I figured humans or toucans would be the most convenient options and I wasn't sure if his ability to control humans might have gotten a buff when he became the three-eyed raven, but it doesn't really matter, there's a ton of ways to create methods of communication with even a single bird (tactile or audible morse code, flight patterns, probably other stuff I haven't thought of). Although, the show leads me to believe that Bran can't multitask (he controls a flock of ravens and flies them in formation, but I don't think we've seen him perform separate tasks in separate areas) so scouting with birds in one area while relaying information with birds in other areas may not be in the cards for him. His ability to coordinate the human forces is probably less powerful than the NK.

I think something may need to be said about zombie giants using their massive bows to take down dragons or just snipe people from range, they're basically highly mobile scorpions. Throwing other zombies over the walls or past enemy lines could be fairly useful as well.

Just remembered animals can be made into zombies too, so zombie birds for recon, mammoths (could've sworn I saw these at some point), bears, etc. should all be tools at the NK's disposal.
