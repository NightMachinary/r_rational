While I certainly feel that your solution is more rational than the episode it still focuses on creating scenes that the audience find appealing, at the cost of optimizing the chances of winning on both sides. Now, if the natural laws in the GoT universe(which we know are different than ours due to magic) then you could potentially justify it or the characters didn't have winning as their first priority.

I am toying with this idea of a setting in which there is a symbiotic relationship between the world and the author in the sense that the author in fact observes the world and it's characters rather than dictating it and the worlds continual existence depends on the author devoting mental energy towards sustaining that world. If a few individuals(namely the main characters) knew about this interaction it might be rational for them to create narratively appealing scenes, at the cost of other elements of their utility function, to appeal to an audience in order to keep the author continually interested in the world.

In such an instance it would be easy to justify a number of choices both in your version and the cinematic version.
