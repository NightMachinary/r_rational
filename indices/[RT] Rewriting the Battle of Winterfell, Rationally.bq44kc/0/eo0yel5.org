if I'm Cersei I would never send scorpions north. One undead dragon versus two alive ones? I would absolutely send a contingent whose only job is to scout and a meagre force to justify them allowing the scouts to ride on horse.

Also would scorpions even do anything? There's no dragonglass bolts nor time enough to make it. Might even have to be Valyrian steel.

I'm not sure this is even rational. Seems more like you're trying to write a good show. It doesn't seem like you gave the Night King any equivalent boost? If he's aware of Bran and knows that Bran knows what he knows then he should be acting differently.
