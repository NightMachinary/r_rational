I honestly didnt like this book very much. It felt like a point by point rebuttal of the LOTR trying to prove there was some moral ambiguity. Unfortunately, Tolkien wrote LOTR so there wasnt any moral ambiguity in the story itself. This is deeply covered in his letters, the Silmarillion, and his other writings.

While the story is excellently written, and the author is good at providing an occasional self-referential nod that is similar to Pratchett and Adams, I couldnt find myself enjoying the story in the context of Middle Earth. It was too much of a contrast against the original story that originated it, especially regarding character motivations and portrayals.

I felt a much better follow up on the Middle Earth saga was that Silmarils in the Fourth Age story that was posted here several months back.

Edit: found the story it was the fifth age not the fourth [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/26/a-history-of-the-silmarils-in-the-fifth-age/]]
