I read this a few years ago and enjoyed it. The author assumes the role of an historian from the world of the lord of the rings writing hundreds of years after the events of the trilogy. The trilogy is treated as heroic epics passed, and edited, through the ages. This book is set during the same period as the ring wars and written based off the notes and diaries of a Mordor field medic.

The book is interesting on its own virtues and even more interesting in the context of the lord of the rings trilogy. It is interesting to see a progressive and industrializing Mordor with education and public works and compare it to the dread land of orcs, goblins, and black magic. This explores the change of ancient legends and the trend of the winners editing the history books when they are written after the war. I highly recommend the book.
