On the one hand, I'm kind of skeptical that whatever the answer turns out to be is something that the community could be reasonably expected to guess. My guess points heavily towards "gazemaize is fucking with us".

On the other hand, the exact same thing was true for the "touch the actual screen with chocolate" riddle, and yet someone guessed it on chapter two, so I don't know. People who follow this fic are /really/ creative.
