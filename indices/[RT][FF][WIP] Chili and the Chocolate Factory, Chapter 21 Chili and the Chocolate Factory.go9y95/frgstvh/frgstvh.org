I laughed with delight at the Final Exam. It's been too long. And of course, they're Still ^{In} ^{The} ^{Abstraction} ^{Room}.

Reading over the text to see what its definition of "correct" is, we encounter the Correct Person, in chapter 7. The Correct Person's two statements are that an unfinished painting is bad (so we know they're on our side) and that all the winners love something more than anyone else in the entire world. This wasn't Bucket's winning criteria, but it was probably part of the GAG's winning criteria, so it does seem important.

​

Also potentially important: Bucket tells the children that if they're confused about whether something is made of chocolate, it is. The pickle might be made of chocolate.

​

This doesn't feel quite right, but it seems like the pickle wants something like unfulfilled desire (the engine of narrative, after all). Mahuika vapes, rather than wants to vape, so she's not quite right. The others have maybe fulfilled their desires already: JUROR truncated himself in the service of art, Keerthi was true to herself, Tide learned that her parents valued love above their academic pursuits, Lim listened to Chopin. Chili wants to be loved, which is why he's the true answer to the formula. Hogan didn't count because he'd probably gotten to eat chocolate, living in a chocolate factory. Or because he'd finally gotten his hands on some chocolate when he touched the chocolate pickle.
