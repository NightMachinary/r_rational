  "Keerthi," said Mr. Bucket. "Your parents were crying. I am not sure what got them because my cameras stopped working. I only have the audio. You are a smart puzzle solver! Listen with me."

  Mr. Bucket took off his head and threw it in the air. It floated and began to play the sound of a man and a woman shrieking together. Something could be heard dripping.

  Keerthi burst into tears and buried her head into her knees, her hands over her ears.

  "If someone told you that you were going to have to die, and they gave you a choice to either burn to death or drown to death, which would you pick?"

  Nobody answered.

  "Why aren't you answering?" asked Mr. Bucket.

  "We assume that you are going to burn us to death or drown us to death if we do," said Tide.

  "I promise that I won't if you all answer," said Mr. Bucket. "What do you say! Who is for the burning? Raise your hands."

  Lim and Mahuika raised their hands.

  ".... you two! Why did you pick the drowning?"

  "Ocean's embrace would be a peaceful exit," said Tide.

  "The moths," said Keerthi.
