These are coming out faster than I can even write in-depth comments about them. Holy crap!

We have to start by talking about Teavee's home, because he specifically calls out that the individual items in his home are things from the Dahl/gazemaize universe:

#+begin_quote
  "A miniscule number of minds inside the world are designated as characters, and these are the only minds that can be abstracted. I am a character, and so are both of you. Minds who are not characters are real and have experiences in the same manner as us, and they can be affected by abstraction caused by others, but they cannot be salted or brined to be abstracted themselves. Most minds are not characters. Characters often have pivotal moments in their lives, which the GAG takes and forms into a coherent story to be experienced by those watching the pickle. Everything in this home is related to these pivotal moments."
#+end_quote

I take this to mean that every story written by Roald Dahl exists within the GAG (street pickle, road dill, pretty sure this is the right track) so as backup here's all the items tracked down from Mike Teavee's apartment:

#+begin_quote
  There was a silver coat-rack, home to several silk umbrellas like the one the man had given her.
#+end_quote

These are the umbrellas from [[https://www.roalddahlfans.com/dahls-work/short-stories/the-umbrella-man/][The Umbrella Man]].

#+begin_quote
  Six paintings hung on the wall, four of women. The smallest painting of the four, a woman brushing her hair, had been drawn on a canvas material Marama struggled to identify. It was strangely wrinkled.
#+end_quote

Edit: thanks [[/u/Makin-]] , I think these are indeed Chaim Soutine's paintings from Skin.

#+begin_quote
  Hundreds of small glass jars stood on tall shelves. They were all empty.
#+end_quote

These are [[https://i.imgur.com/r2D6Mxx.png][the jars the BFG uses for dreams]].

#+begin_quote
  A large empty cage with animal skeletons and taxidermies inside of it, all posed. There was a small newt, a parrot, dozens of snakes and tortoises and pheasants, two Muggle-Wump monkeys, and an old fox.
#+end_quote

The newt is from Matilda, the parrot is from The Landlady, the snakes are from The Snake Catcher, the tortoises are from Esio Trot, and the pheasants are from Danny, the Champion of the World. The Muggle-Wumps appear in The Enormous Crocodile, The Twits, and The Giraffe and Pelly and Me. The fox, of course, is the Fantastic Mr. Fox (which seems to confirm that Fantasticer Mr. Fox is not his secret identity.)

#+begin_quote
  On top of a broken commode, there was a piece of chalk, an old shiny piece of paper with faded text, many expired chocolate bars, a deck of playing cards, and a fishbowl with a small green crystal inside of it. It was glowing.
#+end_quote

The broken commode is from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson%27s_Pleasure_(short_story][Parson's Pleasure]], the chalk is from Matilda again, the old shiny piece of paper is probably a golden ticket, the expired chocolate bars are from Mike Teavee's lifetime supply of chocolate. I'm not sure where the playing cards or the fishbowl are from, but the green crystal is a crocodile tongue from James and the Giant Peach. Edit: playing cards are Henry Sugar again of course, thanks [[/u/MowTom_]] !

This is a real Steinbeck book. I haven't read it, not sure what the deal is there or why some pages are missing. Edit: Matilda reference again! Thanks [[/u/AnthropicSynchrotron]].

An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Soutine][actual guy]] apparently. His work is referenced in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_(short_story][Skin]]. The painting from Skin is the weird wrinkled painting Mike has (a woman brushing her hair on a strange canvas material.)

#+end_quote

Reference to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minpins][The Minpins]], and the tortoise sex stuff I thought was Rhyme Stew but while it's got sex stuff and a version of The Tortoise and the Hare, it's not a /sexual/ version of Tortoise and the Hare so I'm not sure. Edit: apparently there's more sex stuff in Esio Trot than I picked up from the summaries, thanks [[/u/The_Wadapan]] !

Phew, so, yeah, that's a lot of Dahl references. Like 23 Dahl references at least right there.

Lines from last chapter that I can't let go by without comment--

#+begin_quote
  "My body did not know it had grown," said Michael. "It kept trying to grow as if I was what he was before the stretching. I thought it was fun, at the time. Being tall, getting taller by the day. But the aches started, and my body began to fail... by sixteen I could no longer bend my knees. I have not sat once in all that time. It would kill me. My body has not left this locker in years."
#+end_quote

This is some Junji Ito shit.

#+begin_quote
  "I want to know why I vape," said Mahuika, epexegetically.
#+end_quote

Epexegetically is my new favorite Dahloneologism. Edit: it's a real word what the fuck

/inhale/

Chapter 21!

The Champion of the World is Danny, from Danny, the Champion of the World. He must have been a pretty good shot to have been taking out all those Knids.

#+begin_quote
  Demons! They were crawling out of the ocean, giant red pigeons with four heads and wings made from scissors and mouths shoot out flaming moths!
#+end_quote

The mouse in the wheelchair has to be Bruno or the narrator from The Witches (or their descendants, or just someone else who got mouseified?)

*Edit: Ok I just learned what the power of the woman with [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Finger][the magic finger]] is, it lets you swap arbitrary features between creatures. The Witch stole that power so I guess she's giving up on running the Presidency to build a kaiju instead. Phew, and that's just what's going on in the background.*

#+begin_quote
  It escalated! It all escalated!

This has to be an elevator/escalator thing. Or something. Hmmm.

I wonder where Hogan comes from.

JUROR gets his own wham line and I'm so so happy.

#+begin_quote
  Mr. Bucket smiled and reached into his hat. It was a bullet.

  Chili watched him bite it.

  "One of my delicious Bullet Biters," said Mr. Bucket. "They have a delicious peanut butter flavor, and triple the cyanide of any other..."

  Mr. Bucket's mouth began to foam. His eyes rolled back and he fell.
#+end_quote

Callback to Bucket saying he'd bite a more delicious bullet, also seemingly putting a bullet in theories that Bucket was a clone or the factory embodied or what have you. (Unless he's not really dead!)

Ok so this chapter wasn't as heavy on Dahl references but gosh fuck was it heavy on... *udge *tion pickleverse lore.

Speculation about the answer:

Ok, the answer is going to have to follow Dahl logic. We know that if Mahuika had Teavee or Bucket's powers of abstraction, translation and execution, she could abstract the minds of all the remaining characters in the world, then translate and execute them into a paradise post-reality.

However, she's Mahuika. She vapes. She'll do other stuff but keep in mind that doing her homework is at the very outside of what she's capable of. She's not going to be able to abstract, translate and execute even a single mind, much less convince the GAG that implementing Heaven is a good idea.

No. She's going to need to do something outrageously punny and stupid which is absolutely and inarguably correct.

Ruling out:

- Eat the pickle (the world's about to end by itself anyway)

- Tickle the pickle (naughty rhymes alone don't go quite far enough)

- Vape the pickle (What?)

Possible contenders:

- Kick the pickle (we know Mahuika is good enough at kicking to blow up a potato after three and a half months) once it's outside the Vinegar Solution, Lim can maybe abstract and change the messaging of the pickle? (too complicated, but I like that it takes advantage of Lim's mental abilities.)

- Truncate the pickle, rendering it a pick, or pi

Musings:

Mahuika is and always has been a gag character, and canonically is a GAG character designed to be the ultimate GAG character. Mahuika vapes, and is one-dimensional, and /this is important to this pop quiz./

Anyway wow. In closing, bravo and holy shit.

Edit: the solution might involve Mahuika immigrating to Wonkaland. Now that Bucket is dead can Chili authorize reopening of immigration? If not, Chili's citizenship might still be part of the answer. Wait, are they even technically in Wonkaland? They have to be, right?

Edit: does Mr. Gun's shoes turning into chocolate mean the Chococlipper is finally loose?

Edit2: they have Bucket's corpse and the story seems to want them all to die. Maybe they should all... kick the Bucket?
