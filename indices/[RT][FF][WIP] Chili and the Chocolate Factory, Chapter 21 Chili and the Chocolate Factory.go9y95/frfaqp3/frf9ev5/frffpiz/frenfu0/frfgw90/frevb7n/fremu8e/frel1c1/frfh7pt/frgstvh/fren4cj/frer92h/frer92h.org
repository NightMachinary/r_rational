I really should've seen this ending in a pop quiz coming.

Can someone explain why pickles?

The succession of GAG versions, from actions -> characters -> worldbuilding, seems like it should be some sort of meta-commentary on this community (or similar), since I think mainstream literary critique would've put characters at the highest level, not worldbuilding. Is there something that a better machine should produce, according to those tastes? Proactivity, munchkinry, transhumanist rants?

Edit: I forgot to mention due to mystery hype, but that English or American breakfast joke was really something else.
