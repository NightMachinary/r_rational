This is the perfect way to end a rationalist fanfic... I'm almost attempted to give an incomplete answer so the story will be incomplete for the sake of trunc

...but on the other hand I want to see the epic pun based ending (I'm pretty sure the concise explanation stipulation means everything will be wrapped up in one liner pun... but on the other hand we had the chocolate and Wonka vision answe to the puzzle fakeout in the earlier chapters so I don't trust it to be that straightforward.). The authors note asks for it to be in the form of a review, and fanfiction.net permits multiple anonymous reviews, so as long as I don't overwhelm gazemaize with reviews I can spam all the puns. As an added bonus gazemaize will get a small fraction closer to the number of reviews they actually deserve.
