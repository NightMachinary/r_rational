New theory: I think it might be important to work out Mahuika's timeline. She started vaping when she was five. What year was that, and what else happened that year? If we answer those questions, we might figure out why she started vaping.

Edit: Mahuika is 17 years old now. So she started vaping about 12 years ago. Which is... +2024+ 2022, I think? Bucket says that Wonka died in 2005, "almost thirty years ago".

I wish there was a way I could search the whole story, instead of going chapter by chapter.
