the "tortoise-rrelated sexual escapades" goof is a reference to Esio Trot, where a bloke seduces some woman by kidnapping her tortoise multiple times and gaslighting her

(very impressed at all the short story references you found, as I never got around to reading any of those! I'm pretty sure the paintings will be from one of those, unless there's some minor beat in the children's books I'm forgetting)

for the purposes of the final exam, however, I'd be very surprised if the solution relied on Dahl deeplore - the Mike chapter in particular is just taking the opportunity to check off basically every bit of Dahl-related source material, pointedly in a way that isn't fundamental to the story. Your suggestions for solutions are all great for widening the possibility space though, definitely worth submitting as reviews!
