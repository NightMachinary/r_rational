Oh, I didn't mean those items were necessary to the puzzle, just that the importance of the items in the lives of the characters they belonged to has some effect on the GAG which I think will be necessary in the solution. That is to say, we're at a pivotal moment and the magic this moment needs has something in common with umbrellas and crocodile tongues.

It doesn't have to be a Dahl /reference/, it just has to be the kind of joke Dahl would make, like how the President keeps getting the Wong number when he tries to call the Chinese premier in /Great Glass Elevator/ (that bit was indeed really racist in the original book, but its moon logic is exactly what I'm talking about here.)
