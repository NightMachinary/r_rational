  Now, from Chapter 5, immediately after the genie reveals the existence of the pickle:

  "In your opinion, what is the most important thing I could possibly know?"Cleo received a vision of someone who knew the difference between desert and dessert.

  Bucket owns a chocolate factory (dessert). He believes everything that happens is deserved (desert). If the genie is right, and that this is the most important thing, then the answer has gotta lie here somewhere.
