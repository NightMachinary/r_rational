  Marama had tried that too, as had everyone in the family. It didn't work. It was impossible to direct her to take any action that would create true autonomy or interfere with her vaping. Extended or complicated commands didn't work either. Each order was only good for several hours.

If we give her an order, we will have to understand why it works. Damn. I was hoping we could do something like "vape and don't stop vaping," which would require the world continue to exist.
