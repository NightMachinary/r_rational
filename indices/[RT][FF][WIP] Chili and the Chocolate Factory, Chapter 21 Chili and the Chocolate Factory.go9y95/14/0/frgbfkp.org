  Who made Mahuika vape?
#+end_quote

Charlie says it wasn't him, and Charlie seems to have seen fit never to /lie/, preferring to mislead (even in outright deceptive ways, like a device with a button which is not "used" by pressing the button.) In the literal sense, we know it was Villemain, the babysitter, who provided the vapes to the Jewel family. Villemain might be key. I can't find anything when I search Villemain with Roald Dahl, and the real Villemain was a French politician. Who is she and why is she such a good babysitter? She's not the grand high witch unless the grand high witch found a way to turn back into a humanoid and not to need to wear a mask anymore.

When you take the word "villain," cut it in half, and put "me" in there backwards, you get Villemain. Food for thought.

  How did Bucket turn into vinegar outside the abstraction room? Are they still in it?

I took this to be because they're in the domain of the GAG beyond Minusland, out in the territory where Science is Wrong and there is no lava or heat, just salt and vinegar. That doesn't mean you're wrong, but it's consistent with what we know so far.
