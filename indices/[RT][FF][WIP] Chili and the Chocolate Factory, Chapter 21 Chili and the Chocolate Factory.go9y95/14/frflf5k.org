The problem with trying to solve this for me is that when I go back and look for clues, and can't tell whether what I'm reading is a clue or a Dahl reference I don't get. It would be nice if the author clarified whether or not the solution requires Dahl background knowledge.

What was that Happiness Central stuff about? Y'know, the rival vape-juice maker. Did that ever got resolved?

I'm piecing something together. You guys might have already got it. From chapter 16:

"We make bombs and jeans and pollution! If we make it, with only two exceptions, we make it the best! Better than everyone else!"

"I vape," said Mahuika. "Yes," [Bucket] admitted. "Vapes and..."He shook his head. "It does not matter!

So I think the other product is One Dimensional Characters. Maybe? Hang on...

Edit: If you look at each of the flavors Mahuika vapes in the factory, is there a pattern?

Sarsparilla, Sardines, Chlorine, probably others...

Edit: Chapter 21. It seems to me that Chili's real first name (we know it isn't really chili from the contract scene) is Charlie. That seems to be what Wonka is implying when he says "Chili, this was always Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!"

/Stuff I haven't figured out which might be crucial to the solution or maybe is just something that was resolved but I didn't notice:/

Chili's birth name

Why the Hogan Sacrifice failed (edit: charlie thinks it was because he wasn't a contest winner like Mahuika is.)

Why did Bucket need to turn into vinegar to see if the pickle would except Mahuika as fuel?

Why does the pickle want a one dimensional character?

Who made Mahuika vape? (this is probably *really* important, tomorrow I'm going to look for more clues about it)

How did Bucket turn into vinegar outside the abstraction room? Are they still in it?

*If so then that's the solution*.

Edit:

/More questions/

Why does the pickle need the one dimensional character to be a contest winner? Does the pickle actually want that, or does Charlie just think it does?
