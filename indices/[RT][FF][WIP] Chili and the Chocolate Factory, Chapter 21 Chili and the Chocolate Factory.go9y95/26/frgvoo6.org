My two cents:

- Mahuika is also the name of a fire goddess. This ties in with her vaping, but maybe also with being in the middle of the earth?

- Charlie tried to /desert/ the world and got his /just dessert/

- I think the pickle is Roald Dahl (after all, Charlie said they were /going Solo/ in the last chapter) and the offering needs a main character to work. I.e. the whole world is a metaphor for Roald Dahls creative process and will only continue existing if there is a character having a worthy story. This is why a formula is needed (like the heroes journey or similar).

Since Roald Dahl is known for having pure hearted children in his stories, Mahuika does not qualify. While she is uncomplicated enough to be written about she is not suitable as a main character, because she vapes.

Also, since Mahuika is vaping Chlorine and vinegar consists of acetic acid, we could produce Chloroacetic acids, which in turn can create RNA? (no idea if this is true, just googling a lot)

Edit: And RNA is rather one dimensional :D might be a stretch though
