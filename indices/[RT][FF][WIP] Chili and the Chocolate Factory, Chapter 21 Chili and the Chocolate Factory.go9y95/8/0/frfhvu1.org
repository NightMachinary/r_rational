one thing i've not noticed anyone (??) here say is how uncharacteristic this all seems, the children all unceremoniously came back from the dead, the VIPs are here, chili learnt The Power Of Love at the last second, everyone fights dramatically against the BBEG, it all feels dangerously surreal. the HPMOR final exam parody doesn't stretch my belief of what a 'normal' Chili chapter would have as much, but it still adds on a little to the suspicion.

makinporing said he thinks it's a fake chapter meant to troll us, and it lines up with my observations pretty well.
