I am not sure that we'll figure out the correct answer (if one exists), and I have no doubt that gazemaize will delete the entire story if a good answer is not given, so I've made an epub copy of the story and am in the process of saving the web pages on the Wayback Machine.

EDIT: Here's a [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-i0Efy6wfpNwXuIbe2mupdUZsC2K_Bnf][link to the epub]], on google drive.
