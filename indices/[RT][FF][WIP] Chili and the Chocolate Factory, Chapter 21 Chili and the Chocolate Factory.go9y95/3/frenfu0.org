I submitted the first thing that came to mind:

#+begin_quote
  Mahuika: Vape and use the vinegar solution to abstract and tell the pickle to stop.

  This will work because the pickle wants a one-dimensional character, and Mahuika was selected using the formula - the problem was just that it was Bucket who talked to the pickle in abstraction, which confused it.

Is this the right answer? Who knows.

Now, from Chapter 5, immediately after the genie reveals the existence of the pickle:

#+begin_quote
  "In your opinion, what is the most important thing I could possibly know?"

  Cleo received a vision of someone who knew the difference between desert and dessert.
#+end_quote

Bucket owns a chocolate factory (dessert). He believes everything that happens is deserved (desert). If the genie is right, and that this is the most important thing, then the answer has gotta lie here somewhere.

Other possibilities:

- This is Chilli and the Chocolate Factory, and Chilli initially wanted all the participants to die. Is the solution to die holding the pickle (the one fact about the character being that they are dead), a la Oul's egg?
- The vape pen is chlorine-flavored. Do we have a source of sodium with which to make salt?
- Offer Mr. Bucket to the pickle. He was chosen using the formula, there's only one fact about him that Chetan mentions (he's a bad person), and he's made of dessert.
