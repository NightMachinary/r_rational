Basically, it's like D&D but instead of each player controlling a character, all the players jointly control a single character. This is usually done via voting. The character interacts with the rest of the world as written by the author, but character sheet generation and certain key decisions are up to the players. It's usually expected that the author use some kind of RPG system as a base to provide a framework for character generation and actions. Compared to D&D, there's a lot more storytelling and characterization coming from the author/DM/Quest Master, and much reduced RP by the player(s).
