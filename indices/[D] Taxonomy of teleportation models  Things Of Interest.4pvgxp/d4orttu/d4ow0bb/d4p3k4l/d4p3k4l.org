I'm afraid I don't quite understand what you're saying here. The list I gave is meant to be a list of the things not preserved by destructive teleportation; you're saying that one of those things is... "continuum"? Without any context, that's just a word, and I don't know what to make of it. If possible, I'd appreciate some clarification.
