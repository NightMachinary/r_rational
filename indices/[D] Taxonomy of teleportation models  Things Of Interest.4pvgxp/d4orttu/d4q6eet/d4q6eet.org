One of the issues that gets brought up outside this sort of rationalist arena has to do with souls./Purely as a thought-experiment/, let us suppose hypothetically that identity resides in some "nonphysical" entity that has escaped our detection. Immediately we find that exactly the same problem exists regarding destructive teleportation. While the conventional stance is certainly "you died; therefore your soul departed; therefore what arrived at point B is just a copy", one could just as easily argue "your soul is the important part; it is not tied to the body; so barring experimental signs of degeneration we can presume it transmigrated".

The point of this is that questions of reductionism would seem to be a red herring, since reductionist and nonreductionist hypotheses lead to equally equivocal results. In short, a new approach is needed.
