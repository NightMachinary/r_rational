The legal ownership implications of identity are important because they demonstrate that identity has real-world implications, and that this is not a navel-gazing p-zombies-style issue. Our system of defining identity is not robust to copying-style teleportation if it simply holds copies to be the same individual as the original and therefore cannot distinguish between multiple copies of the same individual. Some patch would need to be developed, like copies being considered separate individuals and people being teleported willing everything to the first copy produced, with random assignment in the case of indeterminate timing - but if we acknowledge the individuals are separate, who would sign on?
