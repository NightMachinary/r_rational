I am the one who started said argument, so I'm obviously on your side here, but I suspect some people might find "98% of my atoms are replaced gradually over the course of a year" and "100% of my atoms are replaced simultaneously all at once" to be a false equivalency. I don't think this objection is defensible, but I would still anticipate hearing it.
