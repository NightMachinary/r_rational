To me it looks like you made a well-formulated argument as for why constituting out of an assuredly different... 'hardware'/'unit'/'vessel' (in lack of better terms) should not be considered as having died. While your arguments are quite good, you focus too much on the axiom that the copy is identical. Any such reconstruction is bound to introduce slight errors if the technology existed in reality. Why I bring this up is not because it disproves your arguments (if it did, it would just be the kind of stuff you want to flip the bird at), because it really doesn't. I bring this up because you are not far from addressing this issue with your existing arguments.

Even when not focusing on the specific particles, a body that is different to a lesser degree should still be considered identical in the perspective of human identity. If the change was major, such as changing ones fitness, then sure there would be a debate to be held. But for example slightly elevated iron-levels in the blood? I would argue that you don't become a different person just because you eat (and as has been mentioned before, lets ignore the fact you gained new memories and say you ate something in a fraction of a second without realizing), so minor errors to the vessel should be tolerable on this topic.

However, that was just an aside to what I actually wanted to address. And this is a proper flaw in your argumentation. What you are trying to argue is that just because you still exist, you can't have died. However, let me give you a hypothetical:

#+begin_quote
  You enter the teleporter, get scanned and subsequently reconstructed elsewhere. However! The destruction of the... 'original' somehow went wrong. Now there are two of you in existence. Is it really not murder just because you would still exist? And following the same reasoning, is it really not murder when the automated destruction works?
#+end_quote

I would argue that no, it is in fact murder. What is happening is that a sentient being, albeit one which is identical to another, is removed from existence. One that would continue to exist had it not been destroyed. The question should not be whether it is murder or not, but rather whether such murder is moral or not.

I would argue that yes, it is moral. Rather, not killing the copy would just create too many complications (shoutout to [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]] s comment about legal complications to ownership), be they legal, moral, logistic, or simply the fact that the person wanted to /teleport/ and still finds themselves at the source, probably trying again and again making the mess bigger.

In a similar fashion, how would one consider teleportation where the scan itself destroys the subject simply from it being a necessity for it to function? There will never be a copy killed after the teleportation which could have been given the right to live on (and this is the important difference), so my intuitive answer would be that no, its not murder.

However, if one considers the fact that there is a brief moment of time in-between the scan and the reconstruction (or even between the moment you die and the end of the scan, so 'you' don't even exist in its memory banks all of this period of time) where the subject simply does not exist due to being obliterated by the teleporter, is it not a fact that for at least a period of time it murdered you? Is what it is doing not effectively actually killing you and subsequently resurrecting you, except at another location. Again, morally I don't see any issues with such a murder (only a concept of souls would really make it a possible issue).

But what if the teleporter malfunctions and doesn't resurrect you until a significant amount of time later? Is it about as morally wrong as a cab-driver arbitrarily deciding on forcing you on a 1-hour trip around town (without taxing you extra)? Or is there bigger moral implications in ceasing to exist for a significant period of time? What if it is significant enough to not be a mere inconvenience and rather something like decades?
