I really dislike the sleep analogy. It's a /really bad/ analogy while you sleep the brain doesn't cease to function. Signals go arround and do their biologically programmed thing, consciousness is suspended not terminated.

I see any process which could allow the continuity of existence of the original ad muder-copying. Could ,in hypothetical not practice, you be copied and still continue your existence? If yes and you get killed, well you get killed.

I find that believing that subjective experience could continue after the interruption of the process that enables it a body-mind dualism kind of thought. Something i don't subscibe to.

Now, i think the only honest answer is "we don't know enough" ; if/when faced with something that mah ne an existential threat if it's avoidable i would suggest to avoid it.
