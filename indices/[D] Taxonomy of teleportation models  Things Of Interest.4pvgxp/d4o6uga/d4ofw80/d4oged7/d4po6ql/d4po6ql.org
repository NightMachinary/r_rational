  My answer is that /you/ experience two different lives, because there's two /you's/ now. You are something that can be copied, and your assumption of death only makes sense if you presume that you're, well, special in some way. That you behave differently then any other turing machine.

And in the scan-and-destroy teleporter, one of those two /you/s is destroyed (presumably instantly, before it can produce any memories, but nonetheless destroyed).

That is, I think, why it is reasonable to describe it as "essentially murder". Because if you take away that destructive step, then there would be an extra person, alive and well and walking around. (The fact that you've /also/ created an exact clone does not prevent the destruction part from being murder).
