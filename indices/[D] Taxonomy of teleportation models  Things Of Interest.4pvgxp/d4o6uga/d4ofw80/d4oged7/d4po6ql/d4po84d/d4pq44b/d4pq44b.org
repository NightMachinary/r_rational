True.

Imagine for a moment that I have a piece of paper, showing - say - a blueprint. I make a photocopy, then I tear up the original. Once again, no information is destroyed, yet I have still torn up a piece of paper.

The copy ensures that the information continues to exist. It does not prevent the destruction of the original paper.
