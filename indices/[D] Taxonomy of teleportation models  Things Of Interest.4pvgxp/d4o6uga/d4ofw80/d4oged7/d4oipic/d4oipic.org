  Not really any ELI5, but you might consider reading over [[http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23]] .

Thank you for that link, it was an interesting read. I do understand that there's no magical intentionality floating around that privileges me as "the original" if I were to be duplicated. In the hypothetical that someone offers me money to swap out a sentimental object of mine with a truly identical copy, I'd take the money because I understand the objects history is just colour.

  The obvious argument is that you already go to sleep

If I have a weird definition of something, it might be here. I don't mind my conscious experience being interrupted, that's fine. But by virtue of my mind being run on a physical brain that's still there in the morning, I expect to continue my subjective experience after I wake up and that seems to be the case. I don't expect to continue my subjective experience if my brain is duplicated elsewhere and then this one I'm using right now is destroyed.

  Now, we shut down the process that is you. Are you dead? Is that horribly different from sleeping? Is it horribly different from getting crygenically frozen?
#+end_quote

No, I'm okay with my process being suspended. Subjectively, I imagine it would be like normal unconsciousness.

  Now, we start you back up. But we start you back up twice, from the same data, on two different computers. Which one of you is the original?
#+end_quote

Being original is just colour, and I really am okay with not worrying about that.

  You are something that can be copied, and your assumption of death only makes sense if you presume that you're, well, special in some way. That you behave differently then any other turing machine.

This is the exact point where I get lost. Let me voice my confusion with the simplest example I can think of: suppose I get teleported by a scan, duplicate and destroy type teleporter. Then suppose that everything worked except the "destroy" part. How would you persuade me to kill myself after that malfunction, and why? If you can't, then how is deciding to step into that kind of teleporter /ever/ a good idea / not murder?
