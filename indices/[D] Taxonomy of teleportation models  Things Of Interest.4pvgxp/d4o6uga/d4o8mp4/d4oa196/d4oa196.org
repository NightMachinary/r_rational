LW doesn't have to do anything with it.

For me, at least, it's a non-issue as long as 1) the teleporter is guaranteed to make a copy indistunguishable from the original and 2) the original gets destroyed once the copy is made.

This is because I perceive exact copies of the same consciousness to be the same person up to the moment when their experience start to diverge; and death as a human concept\illusion.

So as long as there aren't different instances of the same person to create a resource scarcity problem for them (e.g. who'll be staying with their family and who'll be leaving) and to cause stress to the people that know them, it shouldn't be considered a problem at all.
