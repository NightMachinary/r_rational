Splicing yourself through another solid object wouldn't cause a nuclear explosion, but I do think it would produce an enormous amount of heat. Bonds between atoms are on the order of hundreds of kJ/mol - I'm not sure exactly what happens if a new atom suddenly materialises between two carbon atoms in a protein, but it's got to produce a sizeable amount of energy. Enough to cook a person, perhaps?
