Not really any ELI5, but you might consider reading over [[http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23]] .

The obvious argument is that you already go to sleep. You could, if you stretch the situation a bit, consider that death in the same way you consider copying someone to be death. You don't continue consciousness.

You have a weird definition of something, somewhere, I think. A hypothetical that needs to get [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/][dissolved]].

So imagine that you're a digital entity. You've had your organic brain copied into a computer, in a safe way that you consider to be kosher.

Now, we shut down the process that is /you/. Are you dead? Is that horribly different from sleeping? Is it horribly different from getting crygenically frozen?

Now, we start you back up. But we start you back up twice, from the same data, on two different computers. Which one of you is the original?

The idea of "original" doesn't really make sense when you're dealing with software. My answer is that /you/ experience two different lives, because there's two /you's/ now. You are something that can be copied, and your assumption of death only makes sense if you presume that you're, well, special in some way. That you behave differently then any other turing machine.
