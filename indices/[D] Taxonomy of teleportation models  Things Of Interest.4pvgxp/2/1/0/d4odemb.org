Fine. Sam doesn't buy into the quantum-mechanical reductionist philosophy as espoused by, e.g., Eliezer (and many, many others---this was hardly a brand-new idea of his) regarding this debate. But “*/unquestionably/*”? He's going to dismiss the mere /possibility/ of disagreement on this issue?

Sam's entitled to his opinion. But he's not entitled to /my/ opinion, too.
