That's a bit harsh, isn't it? It's hardly accepted just because Eliezer said it was so. Really, the viewpoint is just a direct consequence of treating the mind as something fully determined by the hardware it runs on. Quantum mechanics is only relevant to the discussion as a counterargument to one of the more bizarre positions, which attempts to tie identity to individual atoms making up the body, as far as I can see, and that can be dealt with without resorting to quantum mechanics anyway. Calling a fairly mainstream reductionist view 'LW dogma, justified by Eliezer waving his hands and saying "quantum mechanics" in a mystical voice' is pretty ridiculous. In fact, it makes the whole comment look more like bait for defensive LW folks, rather than a statement of honest disagreement.
