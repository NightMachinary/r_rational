Okay, so there's a big debate going on in the comments here about whether destructive teleportation counts as murder. I'm going to weigh in and, if not settle the debate, at least get everyone on the same page (hopefully). So, here we go:

The main thrust of this debate (as I see it) is that some people are convinced destructive teleportation results in subjective death, whereas others disagree. So let's take a look at what sort of reasons one might have to take this stance (that destructive teleportation == death).

It seems to me that this position basically boils down to a very simple assertion: that there are certain things that are essential to your identity (fairly uncontroversial), and that destructive teleportation fails to preserve one or more of these things (somewhat more controversial). But what are these things? Well, there have been a bunch of philosophical debates on what constitutes identity, and I don't want to retread that ground, but luckily we don't have to: since we're just talking about the question of whether teleportation preserves identity (and not what identity is as a whole), all we have to do is look at what teleportation does /not/ preserve and ask ourselves if one of the things it doesn't preserve is central to identity. So, what does teleportation not preserve about you?

1. It doesn't preserve your physical location (it'd be kind of dumb if it did, since that would remove the whole point of teleporting).
2. It doesn't preserve the particles making up your body.

And... that's it. So far as I can tell, those two things (your physical location, and the identity of the particles in your body) are the /only/ things about you that destructive, "scan-and-reconstruct" teleportation fails to keep the same. So with that out of way, the obvious next question is: is your identity tied to one of those things? If the answer is "no", then clearly destructive teleportation does /not/ fail to preserve your identity, and it cannot be considered death. If the answer is "yes", then scanning someone through a destructive teleporter should rightly be considered murder.

Well, first off, I imagine most people would be hard-pressed to argue that physical /location/ is a key ingredient to identity; if I walk down to the Starbucks across the street, am I a different person? Probably not. (Some people might argue that I formed new memories in the process of doing so, so technically I /would/ be a different person. My response to these people would be to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/bwp/please_dont_fight_the_hypothetical/][flip them the bird]].)

So that leaves us with the other thing that destructive teleportation fails to preserve: the particles making up your body. There are a number of ways to reply to this, not least of which is the fact that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qx/timeless_identity/][at the most fundamental level, there seems to be no such thing as "distinct particles"]]. But even if you don't accept this (although you should!), it's common knowledge that [[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,936455,00.html][98% of the atoms in your body get replaced by new atoms every... single... year]]. If you consider yourself the same person as you were last year, then you shouldn't have any problem with destructive teleportation. (People who don't consider themselves the same person as they were last year because they made a New Year's Resolution or something get the finger again.)

So it seems we've reached a conclusion. Unless I missed something in my list of things that teleportation does not preserve (quite a short list, all things considered, so maybe I have), or else you have a perverse theory of identity that relies somehow on physical location and/or identity of particles (and also you reject quantum mechanics), /destructive teleportation is not death/. This seems like a fairly airtight conclusion to me. Anyone want to try and poke holes in it? I welcome arguments.
