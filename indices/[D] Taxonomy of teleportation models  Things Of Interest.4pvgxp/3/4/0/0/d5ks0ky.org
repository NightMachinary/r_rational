I believe he means "continuity", though technically that's your point #2.

I'm reminded of the story of the carpenter who killed his neighbor with a hammer and buried him in his back yard. It was his father's hammer, so he continued to use it. Years later the handle on the hammer broke, so the carpenter had the handle replaced with the same kind of handle. Then a few years later, the head of the hammer cracked, so he had that replaced with the same kind of head. Then one night he's working with that hammer, exactly 10 years after he killed his neighbor, and the zombie form of his neighbor crashes through the door and says, "That's the hammer that you killed me with!" Is the zombie correct?

You're arguing that the zombie is correct. Many people don't agree.
