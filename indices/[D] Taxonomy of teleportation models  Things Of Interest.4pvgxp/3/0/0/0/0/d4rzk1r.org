I know this is a bit late but our bones are actually replaced quite frequently as the body breaks down parts and then replaces them effectively regulating bone mass. It is actually why astronauts suffer sever bone loss as the "weightlessness" causes the "useless" calcium to be reabsorbed into the blood to either be reused elsewhere or removed from the body. This process occurs because we are constantly replacing old "dead" or damaged cells through out our body including our bones. Though once again I would agree we are not tied to our individual cells as we are constantly changing and adapting

The only form of teleportation that is somewhat realistic is quantum entanglement where two particles can interact with each other regardless of distance. However this model at least as it has been tested theoretically and more recently in laboratory experiments where scientists have teleported a individual particles states from lab to lab, this teleportation still requires information exchange at the speed of light thus doesn't solve any FTL problems and more over the link can easily be broken due to interaction with other particles thus explaining why it is only really feasible on the scale of atoms.
