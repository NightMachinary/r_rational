  I know this is a bit late but our bones are actually replaced quite frequently as the body breaks down parts and then replaces them effectively regulating bone mass. It is actually why astronauts suffer sever bone loss as the "weightlessness" causes the "useless" calcium to be reabsorbed into the blood to either be reused elsewhere or removed from the body.

...huh. I did not know that, but when you put it that way, it meshes well with my poor existing knowledge of biology and therefore seems plausible.

  The only form of teleportation that is somewhat realistic is quantum entanglement where two particles can interact with each other regardless of distance. However this model at least as it has been tested theoretically and more recently in laboratory experiments where scientists have teleported a individual particles states from lab to lab, this teleportation still requires information exchange at the speed of light thus doesn't solve any FTL problems and more over the link can easily be broken due to interaction with other particles thus explaining why it is only really feasible on the scale of atoms.

I'm pretty sure that's a case of reading a particle's state at one location and impressing that state on a particle at another location. So, even if the feasibility problems are solved on a multiple-atom scale, it's still different particles on either end.
