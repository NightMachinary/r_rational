  with a 2% retainment rate, sooner or later you're going to lose all the atoms in your body (around once every 16 years on average)

I'm not sure that that holds. It seems to implicitly assume that the molecules that stay or vanish are chosen at random.

But consider the skull. My skull is unquestionably a part of me; but, though I'm not a biologist, I would be very surprised if parts of the solid bone were somehow being continually replaced.

Saying "98% of my atoms are replaced over the course of the year" does not contradict the possible statement that (say) "1% of my atoms are never replaced".

(Mind you, I don't really tie my identity to my skull.)
