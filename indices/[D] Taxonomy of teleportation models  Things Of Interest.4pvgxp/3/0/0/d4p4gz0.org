First off, thanks for bringing up a new objection, even if you don't think it's very defensible; engaging with counterarguments is important in my opinion. That being said, I do agree with you: I don't think the objection is very defensible either.

The way I see it, either you have a conception of identity tied to your atoms or you don't. If you do, I fail to see how the passage of time would play a role: with a 2% retainment rate, sooner or later you're going to lose all the atoms in your body (around once every 16 years on average)--and once that happens, you're not "you" anymore, regardless of how much time passed during the intervening period. In other words, unless I'm missing something, there should be no difference between gradually losing all the atoms in your body, and losing all of them at once, at least in most particle-based theories of identity.

The only theory of identity I could see in which the objection you brought up could possibly play a role is one in which your "identity" slowly "spreads" from your old atoms to your new atoms, kind of like an infection, so that by the end of the year, the new atoms are as much "you" as your old atoms were. In this case, personal continuity is maintained over the course of a normal life, but if you go through a "scan-and-reconstruct" teleporter, there are no old "you" atoms to "infect" the new ones. Gradual changes would be legitimately different from abrupt changes in this case, and thus the objection you brought up would be valid under this theory of identity.

However, despite it working out in this particular case, this particular theory of identity I just described strikes me as inelegant and /ad hoc/ (not to mention ill-motivated), and I would be extremely surprised if anyone seriously held /that/ as their theory of identity. If anyone here /does/ subscribe to the theory I just described, please let me know; I have a few questions I'd like to ask you...

*EDIT:* There's also the quantum-mechanical argument I [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qx/timeless_identity/][linked to]] in my original comment, which just invalidates the whole affair, so yeah.
