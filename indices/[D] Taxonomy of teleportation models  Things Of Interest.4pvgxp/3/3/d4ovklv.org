For me, the critical point is that, assuming the most convenient form of the technology, after the initial scan, there is no technical problem with producing multiple copies of the original person. In that case, which copy inherits the original's identity? If the answer is "all of them", it's not a very useful concept of identity, and it seems like the only alternative is "none of them, the original was destroyed".
