Things like housing deeds are tied to your legal identity, which is not necessarily the same as your philosophical identity. Anybody with a similar enough appearance and some of your memories and possessions could take over your legal identity, even without complete cloning.

Philosophical identity is an important concept for certain issues, chiefly moral ones. In practice, the concept is never actually used; all we have are heuristic substitutes, as it is impossible to prove even to yourself that your philosophical identity is consistent let alone to prove it to somebody who does not have your memories and consciousness.

When you add cloning to the equation, philosophical identity is a rooted tree. Branches diverge from their common node, perhaps iteratively. If you also include overwriting brain states then it's a directed acyclic graph.

I think the /Dollhouse/-style brain overwrite system is actually quite an illuminating thought experiment when it comes to philosphical identity, even more so than cloning.

Questions on that topic:

1. If brain A is overwritten by brain B, does brain A inherit the philosophical identity of brain B?
2. What if you upload your brain to a blank slate, e.g. a brain-dead clone body, a robot, or a data-stream?
3. If your current brain is overwritten by a copy of your brain from ten years ago, are you still current!you? If not, are you ten-years-ago!you, or are you a new thing entirely?
4. What if it isn't ten years ago, but ten seconds? Ten yoctoseconds (10âˆ’23 seconds)? One Planck time?
5. More generally, what is the smallest externally enforced brain change that you would consider a break in your identity?
6. How does that magnitude compare to a neutrino passing through your brain, a concussion, or anaesthesia?
7. Can you state with reasonable certainty that you have never experienced any external brain alteration that exceeds your threshold?

The only theory of identity that I've encountered that gives what I consider satisfying answers is that continuity of identity is an illusion.
