Philosophically speaking? Both. I agree there's certainly some logistical issues here, of course, as well as legal and ethical, but philosophy-wise I'm not seeing much of a problem here. More generally, I feel there's a difference between questions of what /is/ and questions of what should be /done/ about it; your question seems to fall into the latter category, whereas I'm primarily concerned with the former.
