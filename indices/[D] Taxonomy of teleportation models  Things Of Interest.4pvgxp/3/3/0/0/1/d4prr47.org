You buy a house. Due to a clerical error, the house was double sold, and both transactions occurred at the same time. "More people instances have a claim to a house than there are instances of the house" is a problem in general. This is a reason why one would probably want the teleporter to disintegrate-however many mes I want to exist, it is unlikely that it is the exact number of times I've teleported. And if too many mes exist there are logistic issues.
