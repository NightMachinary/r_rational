That's almost the Terry Pratchett version of libertarianism: "It's totally voluntary. It's only a coincidence that I will smash your stuff with huge rocks if you don't pay, and that I refer to myself as royalty."

Admittedly, it goes with everyone's Trollestia headcanon, but yeah, this whole thing is obnoxiously right-wing.

For one thing, everyone knows the sun ought to be owned and controlled via a commons trust staffed by trained unicorns, and anypony caught referring to themselves as superior to others by race, tribe, or innate magic should be taken out and shot from a party cannon.

Fucking right-wing capitalist bullcrap, man.
