It's a very libertarien setting...

  Princess Celestia collected no taxes. It just so happened that the ponies of Equestria were wise and thoughtful enough to see that Canterlot needed a certain amount of funds to provide for the defense and support of Equestria. Any pony was free not to pay.

  Nevertheless, Princess Celestia worried that the ponies who chose not to donate were unaware of the good things she could do for Equestria, and so she invariably paid them a visit to those who didn't contribute to her fund in order to advertise the quality of her product. Ponies are very proud of their immaculately well-tended gardens, so Princess Celestia would strengthen and focus the sun's rays on the grass and flowers, making them grown tall and green. Then she would summon clouds as bright and fluffy as bunnies and heavy as flying boulders. With a burst of light from her horn a monsoon the exact size and shape of the holdout's garden would crash down. When it was over, the garden bloomed like Eden on the morning of creation. Finally, Princess Celestia called actual flying boulders bigger than herself from nearby, which sometimes meant from miles away. She used them to add her own touch of feng shui to the garden.
