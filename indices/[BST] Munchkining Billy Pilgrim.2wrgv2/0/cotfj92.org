I'd, whilst in the future, memorize a list of major natural disasters and as soon as I got a chance say them in front of something that was recording/ a large gathering of people. Try to prove my time travelling powers and say they need to have someone with me with a recorder at all times in case I time travel to there. I'll appear insane of course till things I said start coming true.

I'd try and work out what scientific advances appeared to be easy to transmit and research e.g. "Germanium is an excellent material to use in transistors if you dope it with 6% arsenic" and then say it again at some point along with some future predictions. Try to boost science. My long term goal would be to accelerate science enough that they could get me out of the time loop somehow.
