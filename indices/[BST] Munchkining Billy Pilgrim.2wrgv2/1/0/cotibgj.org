If you can't change the future that can be worked around. For example suppose you read in a book that the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake and killed 131 people.

You can then go to the past, prove your future knowledge, and tell them exactly what you book you'll later read has to contain.

You could actually munchkin the time lock power. Once you have influence over the people get them to show you videos of positive events that have happened over the years to lock those in place.
