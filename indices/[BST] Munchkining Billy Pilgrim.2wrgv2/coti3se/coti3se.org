It's a whole lot harder to munchkin than you might think, because the timeline is static - once you've seen something happen, you have no way of changing it. This is explicit in his conversations with the Tralfamadorians.

So you only really get one shot at each slice of time, and you're taking those slices of time out of order. Furthermore, you know causality well enough that things seen in future time slices can't be contradicted by things seen in past time slices, or vice versa. And you don't start out knowing what segment of time you're in when you make the transition.

I suppose that my grand strategy would be the same as [[/u/Nepene]], I just think that it would be less likely to work.

I would probably carry a notebook with me which tells the date, time, and major incidents that I should be aware of. That cuts down on the confusion inherent in being unstuck from time. There's probably some better scheme for coordinating information with selves, but I can't think of one right now, especially given the time period.
