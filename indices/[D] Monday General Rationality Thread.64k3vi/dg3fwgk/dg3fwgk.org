So! I've "finished" my supernatural romance story. (Note: Finished means that there's no new scenes to write, TONs of editing still needs to be done - I'll give it 2 months or so before it's finished for real). Needless to say I'm feeling pretty awesome right now.

I'd like to thank this subreddit and especially [[/u/ccc_037]] for encouraging me to write it and for providing me with so much help and support along the way (even if the support was the ability to shout in the void by posting a comment that never got a reply, it was still very helpful!).

It's at ~50,000 words, 13 chapters over about 110 pages.

Here's my beeminder page for it, which was probably also instrumental in ensuring I stayed on the wagon so to speak: [[http://www.beeminder.com/mad/redandwilliam][www.beeminder.com/mad/redandwilliam]]

I would recommend beeminder to anyone who has goals and wants to make sure they stick to them.
