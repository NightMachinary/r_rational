I'd say give Mark Z. Danielewski a try. His most popular book, by far, is House of Leaves. There's a lot happening in that book, but my best summary of it is that it is a very nontraditional take on a haunted house story.

Danielewski plays with how to arrange text on the page in ways that most authors would never approach, and he is always finding ways to incorporate this into the themes of the book as well as the moods of the scenes. Some find it pretentious and overwrought, but I thought it was an excellent book.

If you have read House of Leaves, give volume 1 of his latest project a shot. It's called the Familiar, and while I'll be honest and say that plot is not a priority in this book in any way, he captures mood like no other.

Even if it's the kind of thing where you read a few chapters of it and end up hating it and never reading it again, Danielewski is someone who should be experienced at least once.

And just to be clear, it has to be in print. Even if he did make his own work available on eReader formats, a LOT would be lost in the translation.
