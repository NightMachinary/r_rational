  Ehh, people can like the beast but not want to sex him up.
#+end_quote

Yes, and?

  Beast definitely has more going for him in the personality department than sex appeal.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how that's relevant to this conversation. We're talking about what I would do if I were the Beast, not what sex appeal canon-Beast has or doesn't have.

  Your description sounds more like serial monogamy, but without making certain types of commitments (cohabitation, bank accounts), or perhaps just "dating around".
#+end_quote

Well it's not monogamy because I'm seeing more than one woman. "Dating around" is pretty close to the truth, actually, although it can imply that eventually I'm looking to settle down (I'm not.) Mostly I chose that term because I identified as a PUA at the time I came up with it.
