As a Bachelor's of Software Engineering student, I'd say the best way to learn web dev or any other form of development is to avoid formal programs and /just do it/ (not that I didn't appreciate/enjoy my program, woo class of 2017!). Pick something to work on and just do it, making sure you look up and learn from resources like Stack Overflow as you run into things you don't understand.

Check out a list like [[https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas][this]] for inspiration.
