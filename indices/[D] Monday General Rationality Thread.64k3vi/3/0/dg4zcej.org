  In related matters, how does someone improve their social skills, specifically reading other people's feelings and feeling "the flow" in groups?

Well, the first step is to actually try, and to keep making the effort. Most socially awkward people shoot themselves in the foot by refusing to admit that their social problems are solvable, and by basking in how awesome they are because they don't care about other people's concerns. It sounds like you're pretty okay on that point, though.
