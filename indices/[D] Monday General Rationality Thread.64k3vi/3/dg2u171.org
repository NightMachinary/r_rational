Anyone know something shorter and less move-to-San-Francisco than [[https://www.appacademy.io/][this]] for learning web development? I've probably just about found a new job (finally), but I really do feel like holy shit, I've waaaaay missed out on /most/ of the job market by not learning web.

In related matters, I have to emotionally balance the costs and benefits of my current job options. These are, basically:

- Working in things I like

- Staying in this metro area with my wife

- Industry versus academia

My one standing job offer is a research assistantship, which requires moving away from wife, to do things I really like in academia. I've got an on-site this week with an industrial R&D company I always wanted to work for, but they also require moving even further away. I could get an interview come through for another move-away-for-interesting-work option.

The prospect of actually, physically separating tends to bring both of us to tears and depression. This might be the year to do it, though, since wife is going to be in a new role that will take almost all of her time, in exchange for not enough money.

In related matters, how does someone improve their social skills, specifically reading other people's feelings and feeling "the flow" in groups? Actually, especially that latter one. I'm pretty ok at reading people one-on-one. I'm just worried that my lifelong mal-socialization keeps getting in my way.
