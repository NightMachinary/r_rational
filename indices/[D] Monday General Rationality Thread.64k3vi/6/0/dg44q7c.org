Problem is, it's hard to have evidence for something like that because it's so far outside our experience.

Two schools of thought are essentially:

- A: UFAI will have /super powers/, it will be above us the way we are above ants, you cannot begin to anticipate it

- B: Come on, it'll still be a thing in a box, we can turn it off, we have the button. We are nowhere close to being able to create that super powered AI, we can only make some that are good at Go and are pretty good at telling the difference between a dog and a cat. Like seriously, you are off the deep end to believe what you believe, group A

School of thought B has been likened by the WaitButWhy guy to a spider that says that if its pet human starts getting too big for its britches that they'll starve the human to death by not giving them webs to catch food in, not conceiving that humans might be able to get foods in ways other than webs.

School of thought A is probably likened to the Heaven's Gate cult or something I guess?
