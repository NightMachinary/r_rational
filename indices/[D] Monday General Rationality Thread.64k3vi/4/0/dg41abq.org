I'm not sure about munchkining the situation (being the Beast doesn't really give you any obvious advantages), but I know how I'd go about breaking the curse.

The big mistake the Beast made was holing up in his castle. He never went outside, never interacted with anybody. But his "curse" is that he looks different. That's it. Okay, the horns on the live-action version are a little weird, but he isn't deformed. He isn't cursed with coprolalia or bipolar disorder or anything that would affect his social skills as far as I can tell. This is hugely important.

So here's how I'd play it: I'd just show up in town one day and strike up conversations with anybody and everybody. Talk about the weather. Ask how the crops are doing. Make it a point to purchase my food from the market and do my best to make every interaction a positive one. (Which raises the question: where /was/ he getting his food from, anyways?) Act like I have every right to be there in public, /because I do/. Make sure I show up in town at least once a week. Do my best to keep myself from getting distraught when I inevitably fuck up.

Then, once the townspeople have at least a moderately positive impression of me, I'd need to come up with some reason for people to come around to the castle. I suppose that would depend on what needs the village has. I might also want to throw a festival celebrating something or other, but IRL I don't have much experience throwing parties, so I'd probably play that by ear.

Finally, once I have all the groundwork laid, once I'm generally regarded with favor and it's not unusual for people to be seen heading to my castle, I'd probably do my best to sleep with any woman who A) I find attractive, and B) finds me attractive enough to sleep with. IME, it's much easier to transition from a sexual relationship to a romantic/friendly one than it is to transition from friendship to a romantic/sexual relationship. The first steps were just so that the women's social value wouldn't take a hit from being seen associating with me. If it's totally natural to be seen hanging out with me, and lots of people in the village think I'm all right, then there's nothing wrong with heading to my castle so I can show her that cool thing that's totally innocent and not sexual in any way, right?

At this point, I have at least one woman who is into me, who I am into. If I want, I can probably break the curse by just settling down. Or, I could continue /not/ settling down and instead continue with my non-monogamy, though that tends to limit the length of the relationships. It really depends on what I'm after and how I feel. I've got options.
