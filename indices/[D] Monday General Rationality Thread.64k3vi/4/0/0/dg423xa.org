It's an excellent strategy, but I think you'd have to avoid the sex part: we're in 1700s France after all, and even if we assume that the average peasant girl wasn't really all about preserving her delicate virginity, you're still a monster. Better to have someone love you for your personality than attempt to get them to bed a beast.
