  It's an excellent strategy, but I think you'd have to avoid the sex part: we're in 1700s France after all, and even if we assume that the average peasant girl wasn't really all about preserving her delicate virginity, you're still a monster.

Which is why I start with the massive rebranding campaign. Try to keep up.

  Better to have someone love you for your personality than attempt to get them to bed a beast.

I hear the words you're saying but they're not making any sense to me at all.

  I know you probably meant in 1700s France/breaking the curse, but I'll just leave my polycule diagram here as a counter-example just in case. (I'm Carp in the diagram)

Yuck. Traditional poly relationships are way too much drama for me. I do something I like to call Pickup Artist Polyamory. I don't talk about one woman to another, I don't go on dates with more than one at a time, I don't move in with any of them or share bank accounts or discuss our future, and I change the subject with a wink and a smile if they ask about any other women I see.

EDIT: And yes, that really is less drama than the more traditional approaches. It helps that I'd rather put the relationship on hold and do my own thing than accept verbal attacks from my partner in any way, shape, or form.
