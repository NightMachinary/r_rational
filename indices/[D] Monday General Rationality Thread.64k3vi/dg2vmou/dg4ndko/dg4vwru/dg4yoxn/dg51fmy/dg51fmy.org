Hmm... you do make a great point, but working within your analogy I feel like general education is more like lifting weights and fitness training. It's something that isn't as fun as the sport you want to play, but doing it really pays off.

If you take that biology 101 class that you weren't interested in and learn the core principles, then you're not going to think that living things are essentially magic in your daily life and that pays off when you have to make medical and health decisions. If you learn chem 101, you're not going to fall for "spooky scary chemical names" fearmongering, because you know everything's a chemical. Econ 101 teaches opportunity cost, comparative advantage and marginal thinking which no joke changed the way I thought about the world. I know that introductory courses barely scratch the surface of a subject, but they do contain very important ideas.

You might think chem is a garbage course if you're trying to learn computer science, but that's kind of the whole point. You'd never learn chem if left to your own devices, and you'd be a less educated, less informed person because of it. There are big decisions in your daily life that hinge on things you might never bother to learn. Do you support GMO? Vaccinations? How do you choose what to eat if you'd like to be healthy? Do you go with modern or alternative medicine? Should you sign up for cryogenics? Do you support locally produced food? How do you decide whether that weird event that happened was supernatural, or some other factor? There are a million things you have to decide, and if you leave yourself uneducated you're completely flying blind. Your choices are no better than a conglomeration of gut instinct and whatever values your family raised you with. You'll do worse than random chance, and you won't be able to see how your life /could/ have been better if you had invested in yourself by learning "boring things".

Usually general education gives you math, the sciences, social studies, and language arts. I'm not sure you can take away any of those and still come away a well rounded, informed person.
