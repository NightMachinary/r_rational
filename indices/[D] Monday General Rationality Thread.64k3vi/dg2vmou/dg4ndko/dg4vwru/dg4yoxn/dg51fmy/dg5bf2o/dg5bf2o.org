I think we don't actually disagree on many points, so I'll just make a few claims and build up from there. You can tell me if I'm assuming things in error.

1) Most people are not super self-motivated to the point where they can go and self-study things on their own.

2) When people self-study something, they tend to get more out of it, be it because of autonomy and other things.

3) Getting to the general level of competence where you need to understand the world may or may not require a broad understanding prior to developing this curiosity about the world.

There also seem to be a few assumptions we're operating off, and I agree with some of them:

1) Because many people aren't good at operating off self-motivation, it's important to set up structures such that they still get some of the benefit of education.

2) If we want people to do well in the world, this requires a general understanding about lots of things in the world.

(Here, I'm unsure if the best place to do this is during compulsory education; most people might not remember it. But if we wait until later on, then it might be too late. Maybe we could find ways to catalyze learners so they become self-motivated earlier?)

Anway, I think this boils down to me trying to make a statement about general learning theory, "To get better at X, you should do lots of X, rather than things merely tangentially related to X,", while you're making a statement about how "Knowing about how lots of things in the world work is necessary to operate well and make good decisions", which i don't disagree with.

Is that roughly about right?
