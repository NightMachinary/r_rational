I agree with you in principle, but I completely disagree that a system like that would have the benefits you're after in practice.

  where what we learn is neither determined by necessity nor by interest/curiosity

I can't see this as a bad thing. It's like saying that you should throw out the practice drills where you run between cones, because running between cones isn't a fundamental part of soccer. The point of learning subjects you're not necessarily interested in is to either train certain mental skills, or to make sure that you do have some basic facts that you might not end up learning anywhere else. If you don't have either school or an educated family that teaches you, how are you going to get far enough in a subject (take math for example) to start seeing the practical uses for it? How are you going to know which subjects are useful to you before studying them? I had no idea that economics would be useful to me until I learned it. Having a curriculum that includes "boring things" helps you avoid the unknown unknowns.

  Get rid of school and a lot of kids will probably stop learning to hate learning.

The unfortunate reality is, when left to their own devices most people will just stop learning entirely. From my experience, people think "common sense" is enough to get by on. Why let people get by with the bare minimum of whatever sparks their curiousity? What you've created then is a population that's even /more/ susceptible to harmful pseudo-scientific nonsense.
