  In any case, are people more likely to learn if you try to force them to? Or will they just regurgitate the teacher's password? How many of the skills or knowledge that you learned in school do you still remember? And of the things you still remember, how much of it is things that were uninteresting or unuseful enough that you did not think it was worth it for you to learn it in the first place?

  I bet if there was something you were forced to learn even if you didn't want to, and it wasn't something useful or necessary, then you probably won't remember what it was later. The things you remember are the things you learned willingly or that you still find useful now.

Conceded. To be fair, I /definitely/ don't think the current education system is perfect or even close to perfect. I just think it's better than leaving people to their own devices, because I know too many people that don't value education and would learn absolutely nothing if given the choice. I also will admit that not everything I learned is useful now, and that I've forgotten some of it. However, I do feel like the general principles stuck with me and that they were valuable.

I agree with what you said as an ideal, too. Suppose that we get universal basic income, and every parent is both educated and invested in educating their children in an engaging way. In that case, school would be a horrible idea and you'd have a hard time selling it to anyone. It's just, the situation we have now kind of makes school necessary. Parents have to work, and a lot of them simply aren't educated enough or invested in education enough to help their children become independent learners. So if we got rid of school without changing anything else, we'd be much worse off. That's basically the argument I was making. Also that there is value in learning things you may not be interested in, because you're forced to make a lot of choices in life and being uninformed when you make them leads to having a worse life than you might have otherwise.
