>I can't see this as a bad thing. It's like saying that you should throw out the practice drills where you run between cones, because running between cones isn't a fundamental part of soccer. The point of learning subjects you're not necessarily interested in is to either train certain mental skills, or to make sure that you do have some basic facts that you might not end up learning anywhere else. If you don't have either school or an educated family that teaches you, how are you going to get far enough in a subject (take math for example) to start seeing the practical uses for it? How are you going to know which subjects are useful to you before studying them? I had no idea that economics would be useful to me until I learned it. Having a curriculum that includes "boring things" helps you avoid the unknown unknowns.

Maybe I should have said useful/necessary instead of just necessary. That would have been more clear.

In any case, are people more likely to learn if you try to force them to? Or will they just regurgitate the teacher's password? How many of the skills or knowledge that you learned in school do you still remember? And of the things you still remember, how much of it is things that were uninteresting or unuseful enough that you did not think it was worth it for you to learn it in the first place?

I bet if there was something you were forced to learn even if you didn't want to, and it wasn't something useful or necessary, then you probably won't remember what it was later. The things you remember are the things you learned willingly or that you still find useful now.
