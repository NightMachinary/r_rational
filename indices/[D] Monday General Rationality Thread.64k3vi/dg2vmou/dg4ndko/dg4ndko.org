...Maybe we should do away with the whole conception of a particular place where most of our education takes place, where what we learn is neither determined by necessity nor by interest/curiosity, but instead by authorities who are more interested in making their school look good than in actually teaching well.

Instead of school, maybe we should just make learning a bigger part of everyday life. School teaches kids to think of learning and thinking as boring and difficult. People don't usually go to class because they want to, but rather because they have to. Get rid of school and a lot of kids will probably stop learning to hate learning. Instead of having majors and degrees, just let people learn whatever they want or need to know, and let them keep track of their educational progress by actually demonstrating that they have the knowledge or skills in actual situations like internships or volunteer work or games or whatever. When applying for a job, they could just send their resume without worrying about educational certification because their qualifications will be automatically implied by the stuff on their resume.
