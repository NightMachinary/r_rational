While I agree that humans are not at all standardized, I think there are clearly better and worse teaching methods. Compare [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzcTgrxMzZk][video 1]] with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE37G6zVkFY][video 2]]. Obviously, video 1 is more for college level students while video 2 could be a high school to college level lecture, but I don't think I even need to say which one would be a more valuable teaching aid.
