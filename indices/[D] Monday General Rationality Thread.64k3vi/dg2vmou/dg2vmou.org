A little while back I asked people for their thoughts on reforming education in the Off-Topic thread.

I finally finished the post on competition, reform, and metrics in education! It's on Medium [[https://medium.com/@owenshen/the-ancient-god-who-rules-high-school-e0645b100ae6][here]].

(I've linked to it on LW and a few other places, so if you're wondering it's the one about Moloch and competition.)
