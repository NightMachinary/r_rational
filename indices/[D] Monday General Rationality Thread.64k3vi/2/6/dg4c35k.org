I'm not sure what you mean by non-standard, so I'm going to recommend the nuttiest thing I'm reading right now, [[http://www.sluggy.com/nvg][Sluggy Freelance]]. It's a online comic strip that's been running for about twenty years and the best description I have for it is Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey meets Seinfeld.

It's a about a bunch of people who're kind of assholes that rarely learn anything and go on a bunch of gonzo adventures where /anything/ can happen. It's a comedy, first and foremost, but the Myth Arc is actually pretty convoluted and makes a surprising amount of sense.

It's still comfort food entertainment, but there's just so many laughs and insane stories that it has become my my favorite comfort food. Don't expect deep themes or complex characters, expect pure entertainment that consistently delivers on its promise to be "nifty".
