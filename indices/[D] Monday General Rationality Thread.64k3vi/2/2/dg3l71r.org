SF: /Dolphin Island/ and /The Deep Range/ by Arthur C Clarke - both classics. Anything by Greg Egan or Vernor Vinge. /Perilous Waif/ by E Brown is popcorn SF with unusually good (and recent! ewar, nanotech, AI...) worldbuilding.

Fantasy: Diane Duane's /Young Wizards/ series will make you want to be a better person. Brandon Sanderson is unbelievably prolific and very good with magic systems; plus some free online stuff which is great.

Ursula K LeGuin is probably underappreciated - try /The Dispossessed/, then /A Wizard of EarthSea/ and then /The Left Hand of Darkness/ if you liked it.

Any more than that and I'd need a (general) description of the genres and authors you read or like.
