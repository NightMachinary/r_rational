I'm currently reading the two-book /A Dirge for Prester John/ series by Catherynne M. Valente. You know the bizarre marginalia that medieval monks would sometimes draw in the margins of illuminated manuscripts? Creatures with faces on their chests and jousting animals, and so on? This series is essentially a novelization of that, with a generous helping of other semi-obscure medieval mythology, and a little bit of Jorge Borges. Good characters and great florid prose, though a bit light on plot.

Speaking of Borges, if you haven't already read his short story collections, I recommend them highly- he told some very clever and surreal stories in a very poetic way.

Italo Calvino also wrote some good experimental stuff, like /Invisible Cities/, which is a travelogue of surreal cities.

If you're in the mood for non-standard sci-fi, one of the most unusual I know of is an obscure author named R. A. Lafferty, who wrote some wildly imaginative and experimental stories with a unique style of prose that reads almost like Mark Twain, or like someone telling Native American folk stories. I'd recommend his anthologies.

Stanislaw Lem also experimented a lot with the genre. /A Perfect Vacuum/, for instance, is a series of reviews of future books.
