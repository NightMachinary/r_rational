Regarding solution 1: Yes, realistic views are always helpful, but people need to have some reason to believe that they are or are not in the top 1%. Keep the Dunning-Kruger effect in mind. There's a risk that more competent individuals will compete less because they more fully understand the scope of what they don't know, and thus believe they are not as competent. Realistic views may not be very helpful and could even be harmful if students are not given enough comparative data to see where they stand, and that's tricky if you don't have a good metric to allow students to see their standing.

Solution 2: Good point, and I think changing social norms/customs is easier than you realize.

Solution 3: I'm actually very much in favor of standardization in education. I think it should be feasible, for example, to create educational videos with amazing lecturers and visual explanations and then try slight variations between the versions which are given to different classrooms and schools. Subsequent test scores could be used to determine if there was a statistically significant benefit in any of the versions. The same could be done with textbooks, homework assignments, and educational games.

With this standardized evidence-based incrementally-improving approach, you could find the teaching methods and audiovisual learning aids which work best for most people. You could also use regression analysis to work out which approaches work best with which demographics and tailor the content to the demographics represented by the school.

I do think good teachers are crucial, but I think their role should be aimed more towards augmenting standardized teaching materials with the ability to answer students' questions and fill in any unexpected gaps in prerequisite knowledge.

Solution 4: Good point regarding having teachers both grade students and teach them. I can see how there's potential for that to cause challenging interpersonal relationships which inhibit learning. It's certainly worth a try to see if splitting up the roles of grading and teaching might improve outcomes.

The only other thing I would add is that I think our testing methodology obviously needs to change substantially to distinguish genuine knowledge and intelligence from good test-preparation. Without more accurate tests, it's challenging to get useful data. Unfortunately, I'm not sure of any good way to do that in a cost-effective way. Any thoughts?
