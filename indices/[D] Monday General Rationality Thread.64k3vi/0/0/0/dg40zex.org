Standardization in education works as soon as we can standardize humans. What makes us individuals also makes "one size fits all" solutions suboptimal (for the individual) in many cases.

The ultimate school would have teachers that get to know each pupil and figure out how to stimulate them to perform optimally. The manpower, training and experience needed to achieve that is economically unfeasible until we replace teachers with AIs.

Perhaps a middle road is to give teachers a "toolbag" of standardized teaching and diagnostics methods, and train them to figure out which tools work best for each student.
