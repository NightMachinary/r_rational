I can't figure out how to make a medium account on mobile, so I'll put my plan here(I graduated from a private Jewish high school last year,if that helps with my frame of reference) : Two parts: Shrink and specialize. Part 1) Shrink: one of the classic ways to avoid the prisoner's dilemma is to make sure everyone knows what everyone else will do, which allows effective precommitment. Shrinking school and class sizes(as well as taking tests from a curve to a raw system) should change the incentives of students into a PvE rather than PvP contest at least in part. 2: Specialize: Schools, starting from high school onwards, should be more vocational. This solves a lot of the goodhart problem, since much of the reason for the existence of standardized metrics is to let unqualified evaluators evaluate. Compare SATs to APs and, further on, APs to Olympiads for an example. (PM me to continue the discussion, if you'd like?)
