  Maybe we should do away with the whole conception of a particular place where most of our education takes place...

I'm all in favor of expanding people's ability to self-teach, but there are limits if you don't have fairly educated people around you to answer questions. There are also safety concerns when it comes to exclusively teaching yourself in order to pick up the skills to do certain jobs. For example, imagine yourself growing up in a household with two parents who never went to college and trying to teach yourself everything you'd need to know to work as a cardiothoracic surgeon, or an aerospace engineer. Considering the prior probability of how unlikely it is that you could succeed at this, there's almost no test we could give you that would give us a high degree of confidence that you've learned enough to avoid killing people in either of those professions.

Even something comparatively simple like learning to become an electrician, or to speak a foreign language can be immensely challenging if you do not have someone to teach you. In general, you can probably learn about 90% of what you might need to know from books and videos alone, but there's still going to be a significant number of gaps where a knowledgeable teacher can spot your mistakes and answer your questions.

With better self-teaching materials, many of these problems may eventually be resolved, but it seems like schools are a necessary evil for now.
