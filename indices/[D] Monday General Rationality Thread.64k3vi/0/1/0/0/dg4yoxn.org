  The point of learning subjects you're not necessarily interested in is to either train certain mental skills, or to make sure that you do have some basic facts that you might not end up learning anywhere else.

I think this is somewhat true, but if you really want to learn something, you should always try doing the thing that is closest to the thing you want to learn.

EX: If you want to play good Ultimate Frisbee, play a lot of Ultimate Frisbee. /Then/, if you realize that you need additional distance, practice throwing frisbees for distance. But don't immediately start throwing frisbees for the goal of getting better at playing Ultimate.
