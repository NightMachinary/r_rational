Yes, you were right about it being a black hole, and you make some further interesting speculations 8-).

A few notes: A black hole with a mass of 10^{8} kg has a lifetime of 2.67 years, and 10^{11} kg gives 2.67 billion years (life goes up with the cube of mass). A 4 * 10^{12} kg black hole would have a lifetime in the trillions of years, give off about 10 Megawatts of Hawking radiation, and have an event horizon about the size of an atomic nucleus (event horizon radius is linear in mass). Europa has a mass of 4.8 * 10^{22} kg.
