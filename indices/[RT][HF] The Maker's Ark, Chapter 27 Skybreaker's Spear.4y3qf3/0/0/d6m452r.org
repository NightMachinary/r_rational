Not sure if I should be crowing "[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4umbqg/rthf_the_makers_ark_chapter_26_early_warning/d5s200e][Called it!]]" or if I should accuse myself of shotgunning. I will honestly say Black hole was my main theory, but I did not express that very well, because I didn't think Flicker would keep one, and I still don't know how she'll keep one small enough to use from evaporating, or how it is useful [[#s][possible spoiler]]

So I'm now going to hand-wave that there's no life on Europa for my head-cannon, because there won't be after Flicker condenses it into a black hole.

ooh I just. . . [[#s][realized/remembered from HSF]]
