"You're going to kill me because I'm existential threat after I just offered to use my power to collaborate with you in remaking the whole system of human existence to make it existential threat proof? What the hell, Lex? Do you have some kind of chronic villainy disorder that subconsciously urges you to crush anything more powerful than you and which you cloak in false rationality?

"Did you know you talk to yourself a lot? Your thoughts, your observations, a lot of them you subvocalize just loud enough for me to hear. Sometimes it almost seems like you're narrating a story or something.

"Do you remember thinking about how you should build up investments in arms makers because Europe is starting to look like a big war is coming? Do you remember thinking about how certain physics books and articles you have read lead you to speculate on the possibility of super powerful bombs derived from the energy released when an atom is split? Put these two items together. Conjure an existential threat with them. Maybe it won't happen this war. Maybe not even the next. But how many wars will it be until the war which ends all wars? And how long until the technology becomes so small and cheap that any organization will have the means to blow up a city?

"Consider other threats. Consider asteroids colliding with the planet. Consider other super powerful beings that my existence means may also exist, even other less friendly refugees from my homeworld. Consider for a moment what /other/ existential threats I might be able to prevent.

"They don't outweigh the threat I pose, do they? None of them seem to you so likely to end all human life so completely, so quickly.

"Then forget your fear for a moment and consider the benefits. Huge amounts of rare metals in amazingly pure form from asteroids I can soft land in strategic areas (I flew out and took a look at em before coming this meeting. Platinum, iron, all kinds of good stuff out there.). The ability to change the face of the earth enough to water any desert, flatten any mountain, remake the world to best fit the most people in the best conditions.

The ability to hollow asteroids out and make cans full of sky, and transport humans to live in them. Turns out Venus is a bit hot and acidic. I could blow off half of Venus' atmosphere in a days work and then spend a few weeks to drop thousands of comets on it. Turns out Mars is a bit cold and dry. Did you know I could warm Mars up just by looking hard at it for a while? And also drop thousands of comets on it. Free launching of space vehicles. Humanity spread out enough that one moments rage can't kill it.

"Still not enough? Think about my spaceship. Do you think you might have more success producing interstellar drives from it with my help? Or do you think you'll get further with an inert hunk of metal that won't listen to you, that you are even now carving pieces off of to use as weapons like some kind of cave man draining the gas from a car so he can throw it on the person that could help him learn to make more cars.

"Does the possibility of colonizing the stars in your lifetime, of mankind spreading out where nothing, not even I, can end them, not outweigh the threat I /could/ pose? I've looked down on this planet from space, and do you know what it looks like? It looks green and blue and fragile. And the places where people live look like a dirty brown stain, like rot spreading across the face a of blue marble that is smaller than you can imagine. I'm not offering to fight crime in one little city and stop the occasional disaster, I'm offering to save the human race from choking to death in its own waste, killing each other en mass in atomic wars before it can ever lift its head to the stars."
