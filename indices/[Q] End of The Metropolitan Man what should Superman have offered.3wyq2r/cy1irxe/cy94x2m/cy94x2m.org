  You're going to kill me because I'm existential threat after I just offered to use my power to collaborate with you in remaking the whole system of human existence to make it existential threat proof? What the hell, Lex? Do you have some kind of chronic villainy disorder that subconsciously urges you to crush anything more powerful than you and which you cloak in false rationality?

I felt the ending of the story just got illogically dark n edgy for the purposes of having a Bad End. Which means there's nothing Superman could've said that would've convinced Lex, who was already rather irrational.
