  not sure /Metropolitan Man/ ever reveals what Superman learned from his ship either
#+end_quote

/Metropolitan Man/ had a section on the young Superman learning about Krypton/Kryptonians from the ship's projection of his father. I don't recall anything else. I think that makes it more plausible for the strategy to work, since its reasonable to assume the ship wouldn't activate that for someone who isn't Superman (or would safeguard information if it did) and there's no mention of any other way to interface with the computer. I suppose there's the possibility of physically accessing it, and while that's likely well beyond the capabilities of Lex Luthor (at least within that time frame) I'm unsure if Superman would think its unlikely.
