Not something I would be happy about, but maybe good if I deeply cared (at that time) about humanity more than my future self: propose a killswitch.

Perhaps something which exposes a deadly amount of otherwise-lead-shielded kryptonite when triggered, surgically implanted while rendered weak as an ordinary human. The conditions are trickier--best (given human reaction times) would be some sort of ('absolutely trustworthy') brain-scanning AI that can take really-fast action the moment Superman's likelihood of future humanity-threatening action passes a certain threshold.

--Hmm, 2015 technology makes it harder. Instead of a brain-scanning AI, have to effectively chain trustworthy humans to Superman 24/7, two people briefly connected at once when one has to sleep, death following immediately if there isn't at least one authorised connection. Biometrics complex enough that Superman couldn't fake them without the preparations being noticed would be necessary. Accidental triggering of the killswitch at some point would be almost certain, but some good could be done before then.

In any case, my line of thinking is focused on the 'without endangering humanity' requirement which is the main thing which occupies Lex's attention--the /potential/ existential threat, given that Superman's motivations could change over time. A proposed solution to Lex thus has to render Superman physically incapable of posing a threat to humanity, one way or another.

Ah, another approach/permutation that I almost forgot to mention is to keep Superman in weak-ordinary-human state at all times, with the aforementioned implanted killswitch; unleashing of Superman only possible with several combined authorisations (like a two-key superweapon unleashing system), and again somehow having someone strapped to him at all times who can mentally trigger the killswitch and otherwise automatically have it triggered if that person is rendered unconscious (or otherwise unable to trigger it at will--to explicitly state, this is to try to limit the time Superman potentially has available to destroy the world before being stopped).

Hmm, given(/to bypass) the 2015 technological limitation, maybe 'keep at human-level' (with implanted killswitch set, for the moment, to automatically activate if ever above human-level) until enough time passes to develop a better technological collar, at which part begin the limited use of Superman for specific tasks.

Of course, if before then humanity is about to be destroyed due to an outside threat, Superman can be unleashed even without any guarantee, in order to get even a sliver of hope. Particularly for that reason, make sure that Superman's human-level life is kept pleasant, with enjoyable challenge and variety, and with particular care taken towards keeping him psychologically healthy. The lack of thought speed-up (decreasing potential rate-of-change-of-personality/-morality) should be helpful in that regard, as should the lack of super-hearing (since he wouldn't be forced to hear the pleas for help from everywhere that can't all be answered, even if abstractly--like us--he knows they must be taking place).

Oh, and there's of course the parallel route of 'while at human-level, do lots and lots of research on him over the years and find out to make humans less breakable' (and/or even just 'find out more interesting things about how the universe words, humanity helped in that regard').
