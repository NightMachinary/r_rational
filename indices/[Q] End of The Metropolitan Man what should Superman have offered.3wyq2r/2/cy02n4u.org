The fact that Superman exists means that:

1. Life is probably common in the universe.
2. The laws of physics are dramatically demonstrated to be incomplete.
3. There is life in the universe that is inherently physics-breaking.

Luthor is in the position of someone with a probably-friendly superintelligence in a box, who has to assume there are other similarly capable superintelligences out there that are /more likely/ existential threats than the one he's dealing with. Killing Superman under the assumption that it ended the threat from super-beings is just plain bad planning.
