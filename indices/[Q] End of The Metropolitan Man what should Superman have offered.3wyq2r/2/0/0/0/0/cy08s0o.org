  Is that really true? I'm legitimately asking, because I thought there was some way to place probabilities. Let's say that you're pulling plastic balls from a container that you think only has blue balls. Ten thousand times in a row, you pull out a blue ball. The probability you put on pulling out a red ball isn't 0, but it approaches it.

Assumptions.

There are no superhumans who have visited the earth. There could be many. They could have used mind technology to wipe memories. They could be beings from mythology, who have massively slowed down cultural development with their random cruelties. They could be well known, but covered up by the government.

A 'red ball' being drawn is an isolated event. What if the presence of a superweapon draws others? What if it triggers others to be empowed? What if the ship has backups in place?

Those assumptions make his decision extremely risky.

It's like if you are wandering down london and then you see someone waving a wooden wand and summoning up water from nothingness.

I mean, yes, you could assume that because you've never seen magic before then this is a once in a 10000 event that will never be repeated, but evidence of events which are radically against the standard models you have should call into question your current models of the world. More research is required before you have any certainty about probability.
