In this scenario I am assuming the water summoning is fairly unambiguously not possible according to what you know about physics, as with superman, not sleight of hand as with Penn and Teller.

Of course, Penn and Teller should tell you something. If you assume that it's impossible for someone to, somehow, guess what you're thinking and move objects in ways you think are impossible, then you're probably wrong and seeing the show should suggest to you that it probably happens more often than you think.
