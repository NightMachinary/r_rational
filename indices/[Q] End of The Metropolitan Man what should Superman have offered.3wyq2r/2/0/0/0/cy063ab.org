Is that really true? I'm legitimately asking, because I thought there was some way to place probabilities. Let's say that you're pulling plastic balls from a container that you think only has blue balls. Ten thousand times in a row, you pull out a blue ball. The probability you put on pulling out a red ball isn't 0, but it approaches it.

Then one day you pull out a red ball.

I think you can still calculate a probability for what color the next ball is going to be, with the odds of a red ball being adjusted up quite a bit and a fair amount of uncertainty. I'm not sure exactly /how/ you make that calculation, but I think that you could make it. (I'd probably be a better Bayesian if I could tell you.)
