Here's what you know:

1. There may have been one or more clusters of superbeings arriving on Earth in X BC. You don't know what X is. You don't know what the clustering was. They didn't destroy the Earth but if they did appear they were seen by observers as existential threats.
2. You have Superman.

You have one verifiable data point, and unreliable data that superbeings show up in clusters.
