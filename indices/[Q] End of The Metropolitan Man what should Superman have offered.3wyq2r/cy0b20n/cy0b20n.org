I understand why you wanted me dead. It was not a matter of fear - mere fear would not overcome your basic compassion for others. You did it because you trusted the numbers, and even a 1% chance that I would wind up destroying humanity was too horrible to allow. That kind of mind why I offered you a partnership, a moment ago, when I thought that I could do with you what I wished.

But it seems that your analysis of the numbers has been quite narrow. How thoroughly did you consider the other side of the cost-benefit analysis?

You now know that there are beings in this universe that can destroy humanity. Have you thought about what will put humanity in the best position to survive its next encounter with one of those beings? What resources you would hope to have on your side?

And the threats to humanity do not only come from outside of this planet. Even if you were not busy reverse-engineering the technology that had brought me here, people are well on their way to developing new and dangerous technologies. My understanding is that the many facilities with lead shielding that you have been building were not merely a ploy to block my sight, and that you are hard at work on developing one of those technologies. It is only a matter of time before some portion of humanity becomes capable of destroying the whole, and it is not clear what checks will exist on that power.

And that is still only considering the negative side of the ledger - what harms I might cause, what harms I might prevent. Surely you also care about improving humanity's lot - that is why you are so eager to pursue such technological research. Have you also estimated that odds that the future of humanity might be twice as great as it would have been, with Superman on your side? You have seen what I have done with Metropolis, and in the future I will have minds like yours helping to guide my actions towards something much bigger. Or what about the odds that humanity might be a hundred times as great, or a hundred thousand, with the help of a member of a spacefaring race?

I won't bother asking you how you feel about these prospects - the question is, what do your numbers say?
