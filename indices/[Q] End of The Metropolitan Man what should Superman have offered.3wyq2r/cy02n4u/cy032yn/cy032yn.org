As a slight defense of Lex Luthor, it's not that killing Superman represents an end to the threat from superbeings, it's that killing Superman represents an end to /that particular superbeing/. Given the length of human history and the dearth of superbeings until the present day of the 1930s, while the first point about life being common is a given, it's not /that/ common given that this is the first instance of superbeing-contact in ~10,000 years, assuming that the myths of our ancestors still remain untrue (though given Superman, we have to adjust out priors a bit there).

By analogy, if you have an AI in a box and can't prove it's friendly, it's defensible to kill it (or freeze it) and start working /really really hard/ on making an AI that's /provably friendly/ given that you now have some measure of how easy it is to make a super-intelligent general purpose AI.
