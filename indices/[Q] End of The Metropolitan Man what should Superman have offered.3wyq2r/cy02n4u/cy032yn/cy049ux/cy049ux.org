I don't think that analogy holds here, since Superman wasn't created by Luthor or a fellow member of Luthor's species; the foundation of knowledge to go from creating an AI of unknown friendliness (Superman) to creating a provably friendly AI (New-Superbeing) is what makes the analogized scenario possible, and that knowledge is years beyond Luthor's, and even our time, if we take the interrogator's option of modernizing the setting.
