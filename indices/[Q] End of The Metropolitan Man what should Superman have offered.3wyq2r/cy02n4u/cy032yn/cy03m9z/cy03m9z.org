He doesn't have enough datapoints to determine how likely it is that another superbeing is going to arrive. Superman could be the first of a new generation of demigods.

I do grant one point in his favor: the story is set well before the topic of dealing with superbeings became quasi-respectable. So he's missing a lot of 20-20 hindsight.

Anyway, as proxy for superman, that's my argument. getting rid of Superman doesn't make the risk go away, it just makes it harder to respond to another risk source. And, if another superbeing shows up, has the potential of increasing the risk.
