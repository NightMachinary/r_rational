The big question is dependency. If aliens are random and fixed, you have 1% per century. However, if you assume aliens have a silimar tech curve, than you may have to ignore samples before their first capability. That gives you a very high range of uncertainty, especially for something that could potentially have an exponential growth rate as aliens progress along the tech curve.

Or more bluntly, one apparently anomoulous sample makes it really hard to pick a model with any confidence.
