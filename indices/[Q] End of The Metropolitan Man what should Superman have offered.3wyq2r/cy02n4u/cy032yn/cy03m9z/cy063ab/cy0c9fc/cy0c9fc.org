Another analogy that might apply equally well:

You've walked home from work every day for weeks and weeks, with no problems whatsoever. Then one day you're walking home and you get hit by a raindrop.

What are the odds that you're going to get hit by another raindrop before you manage to finish the trip home?

There's no way to know just from sheer probability alone. You need to /understand/ what is going on in order to make predictions. You can do that by waiting for more raindrops or red balls to come along, giving you more of a basis for making a model of when they appear, or you could study the raindrop you have on hand and try to figure out where it came from to see if you can predict future raindrops without necessarily having to observe them first.

Superman could be the first raindrop of an entire storm. You've caught him safely in a glass, but I'd hesitate to discard him at this point without figuring out more about him. That would be Superman's best bargaining chip - offering information and cooperation in studying him.
