Part of the problem is that there are scenes that were scrapped in rewrites or cut entirely. For example, there was this:

  He touched the metal skin of the ship with his bare hands. He would have been more careful with it if it hadn't been sitting in a storm cellar for the past twenty years and then taken by truck to him. It was cool to the touch, and the metal didn't seem all that extraordinary, despite its origins. The markings that adorned the ship didn't seem to have a different texture to them. Lex's hand moved towards the circle near the center of the ship, feeling for some panel that could be pushed aside to reveal the ship's inner workings. As soon as his fingers crossed into the circle, the world melted away.

  Lex froze in place. He was no longer standing in the basement laboratory, but instead somewhere with a warm, gentle breeze. The floor was a warm pink, and reflective enough that Lex could see his own stunned expression in it. He stood up slowly and cautiously. Obviously he had triggered something, but the nature of it was far from clear. He looked down and tapped his foot against the ground. It didn't sound like the concrete he had been standing on. If this was an illusion, it was the most comprehensive one that Lex could possibly imagine. The air even smelled different.

  He stepped forward, half expecting his legs to bump into the spaceship he'd been standing in front of. When nothing stopped him, Lex continued on. He was in a circular room with a large dome. Lex strode towards the balcony, trying to keep his cool, but his sense of calm evaporated as soon as he was able to take in the full vision before him.

  He was in a city made a glass. Spires reached towards the sky, and people in robes walked around in the streets. Between the buildings and sometimes sprouting out the sides of them were plants whose leaves were shades of purple and blue. As Lex watched, a flock of small gleaming ships flew past, each carrying a single person inside.

  “Before you lies the planet Krypton at the height of its power,” said a male voice.

  Lex turned around. Behind him was a man in the same white robes as the people down in the streets. He had a beard shot through with grey and a kindly smile. His words, Lex noted, had been in English.

  “Who are you?” asked Lex.

  “I am the shade of Jor-El, father of Kal-El,” said the man.

  “Where am I?” asked Lex.

  “You stand before the spacecraft of my son, in a time and place unknown to me,” said Jor-El. “Fear not, for what you see before you is only an illusion.”

  Lex's mind was racing. Interstellar travel was one thing, but this was something else altogether. Lex had seen various plans for spaceships that could cross the stars, and in fact had drawn some up himself. It wasn't possible with any current technologies, but an interstellar craft could be launched within half a century if humanity put their full might behind the project. Superman's arrival implied that there were faster ways to cross the cosmos than Lex knew, but it was still within the realm of things that were known to be possible. To create an illusion like this though, with not just sights and sounds like a movie but smells and physical sensation as well, all without any seeming apparatus would take a technology far beyond what Lex had imagined.

  “Can I leave?” asked Lex.

  “Of course,” nodded Jor-El.

  Lex had a moment of disorientation as his body seemed to snap back into the position it had been in before. He was standing over the ship with his arm outstretched and a slight cramp in his legs. He stood up slowly and looked around the workshop. If the alien ship had the capacity to produce an illusion that convincing, there was no way to know for certain that what he was seeing was real, but he shrugged off the thought quickly; his actions would be the same either way. He sat down in a metal chair, far away from the spaceship, and thought.

  The spaceship was active. It was a terrifying thought for any number of reasons. He'd let the spaceship sit in the lead mine for two full days, hoping that if Superman could sense it he would simply reclaim it. It wasn't out of the question that it had a beacon of some kind in it, but with a mind of its own he could only hope that it had no way to signal its owner. Furthermore, that mind could itself be a threat. If it could strangle out Lex's senses so completely, it could surely kill him. Lex had simply gotten lucky.

After a year and a half it's a little hard to remember whether any of that actually went in the final version or not. There's a version of /Metropolitan Man/ where Lois gets kidnapped, there's one where there's a tour of an underground lead-lined bunker, there's Deadshot showing up with a sniper rifle with a kryptonite bullet, Lex Luthor getting a flat tire and Superman stopping to help him out ... I don't know, it's hard to separate out what actually happened from what was written but cut.
