I'd offer up a bigger existential threat and make him call my bluff. I'm not sure quite what the best lie would be, but something like:

- I've set an asteroid on a collision course for Earth which only I can stop.
- There are other superhumans from Krypton on course to reach Earth who will destroy it if they find that I'm gone.
- There are other superhumans from Krypton /on Earth right now/ who will destroy it if I am destroyed.

There's a definite question of credibility here and since Lex has the Kryptonian ship, it's unclear how much information he really has access to (and it's been awhile since I've read it, but I'm not sure /Metropolitan Man/ ever reveals what Superman learned from his ship either).

That's the gist of it though. If Lex's guiding principle is really that there's an existential threat, you offer him a bigger one and he's forced to take the lesser of two evils.

(This is a pretty popular AI-box strategy, by the way.)
