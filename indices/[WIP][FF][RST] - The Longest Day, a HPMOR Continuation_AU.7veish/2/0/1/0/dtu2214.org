The idea with the random noise is that if you had a hypothetical decoding algorithm that was tailor-made specifically to extract meaning from that random noise, you could extract meaning.

For example, the random string FGGXRBOPS could mean "Hi there" so long as your algorithm for decoding involved F=H, G=I (unless preceded by a G in which case It means a blank space), X=T, R=H, B=E, P=R, S=E.

Now expand that premise to the source code of a massive reality simulator. Of course the practical problem is that you're just offloading the complexity from your physical sample onto your decoding algorithm.

The point of that particular thought experiment is to illustrate that a physical representation of a particular simulation is unnecessary for that simulation to run.
