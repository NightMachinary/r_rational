That's the one. One of Moravec's most mind-blowing speculative essays. If I recall correctly, I could follow his logic up to a point, then it seems to veer into wishful thinking. Also rememeber being puzzled about this: while I can see a simulation appearing to be like random noise, I cannot see how any old random noise could encode a simulation.
