Very fun beginning; I'll be watching this! Having not read /Orders of Magnitude/, I have no idea what world Hermione's found herself in, but I'm intrigued. Meanwhile, I love Harry getting the shock of his life in finding Rarity to actually be sapient, and I hope this'll help him learn epistemic humility.

Unfortunately, if we go by canon, [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/100][Professor Quirrell drank Twilight's blood a few weeks ago]]. I hope you're not going to just ignore that, but I'm curious to find out whether she didn't quite die, or whether Discord is going to /MESS WITH TIME/.
