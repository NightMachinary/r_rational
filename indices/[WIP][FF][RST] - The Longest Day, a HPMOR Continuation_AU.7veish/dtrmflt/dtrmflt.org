After finishing [[http://www.2pih.com][Orders of Magnitude]], I had the itch to continue writing something a bit more light-hearted.

My daughter is in the full-on My Little Pony stage of her life, and so over the past year or so I've passively consumed seven seasons worth of TV shows, four movies, eight or nine graphic novels, a handful of junior novelizations, and probably more than that. I find myself impressed by its commitment to world-building, and of course, I appreciate the near constant stream of winks and nods to the parents, especially in the graphic novels.

Given that a certain pair of unicorns make a guest appearance in HPMOR, I thought it would be amusing to write a crossover of the two worlds.

My goal with this is for familiarity with My Little Pony to *not* be a pre-requisite for enjoying this. Those who aren't familiar with the series may find themselves as bewildered as Harry, but the plot should stand alone, same thing with the humor and tone.

Criticism both positive and negative is appreciated, and I hope you enjoy!
