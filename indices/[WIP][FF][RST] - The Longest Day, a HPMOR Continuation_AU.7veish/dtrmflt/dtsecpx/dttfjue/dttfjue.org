I consider it to be a ratfic, at least as much as possible given the fact that it's a collision of two worlds where physics-defying Magic is possible and at least one world where death is already a solved problem.

Thematically, I plan to explore what I felt were two of the larger themes of HPMOR: 1. rationality clashing with the fantastic and 2. The impact of such a clash on interpersonal relationships.

I expect the tone will match the early chapters of HPMOR when Harry was still experimenting with the rules of Magic.
