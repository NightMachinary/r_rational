Hermione's situation so far is unique to this story. The added bit about Tirr inna Noc was an in-universe excerpt from "Significant Digits" by [[/u/mrphaethon]] , but as mentioned in the text, the characters of the HPMOR-verse are not unanimously convinced of the veracity of the tome.

And yes, Twilight has definitely been attacked and mortally wounded by Quirrel. The rest of the girls are on a rescue mission (much like Harry, in a way).
