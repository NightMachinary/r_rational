In the few examples I've seen these questions answered reasonably well, the kids were more or less prodigies who had grown up living with/working with people who were experts in the field.

And even still the professors were more or less having them gather information by collecting pokemon as a means of giving them experience and simply for the sake of collecting raw data. The kids go to the professors and other experts for help usually, not the other way around. Though the kids still have interesting insights into how the world works on their own.

If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: Origin of Species]] I'd definitely check it out for the world building aspects of the story.
