If you're making this a rational/rationalist fic, it's missing a few things to really hook people I think. This being a rough outline means none of the things I'm bringing up are deal breakers. Just some things you should think about and maybe highlight more in your summary if you want to attract people who like rational fiction (Or at least me in particular... since I don't speak for everyone).

1) The idea of becoming "The Pokemon Champion" isn't really interesting on its own. You have to justify why a rational person would want to become the champion. What can be done with the postion? What are the perks of it? Are there any responsibilities? Why does the MC have this goal?

2) What exactly is a secret mafia of animal abusers? I'm assuming they're using pokemon in unethical ways for financial gain. Like excessive forced labor in poor living conditions. Or illegal gambling rings where pokemon fight to the death. Again, I want to know the motives behind what they're doing, even if it's just a broad overview. Otherwise it just sounds like they're evil for the sake of being evil.

3) This last one may not actually be a valid point depending on where you're taking the plot. But on the off chance that you have Professor Ply ask Orange for for help in investigating who is stealing his research, then you'll want to make sure you have justifications for this. Assuming Ply is a grown man and Orange is a kid, you'll need to have answers to the questions of "Why is a Pokemon Professor asking a kid with no experience for help with this situation?" "What abilities/qualifications does Orange have that would help in this kind of investigation?" "How did Orange gain those abilities at such a young age?"

But you can easily sidestep this issue by simply not having Ply ask Orange to help out with the research theft issue, unless he stumbles across it in his travels or something of that nature.

So to reiterate you've got the basic outline of a story that can potentially be interesting, but there's really not enough information here to say whether it will be or not. Nothing you've stated is necessarily "unrational" but without more details the story just seems like a normal pokemon fan fic set in a new region.

Maybe you already have a lot of the answers to these questions fleshed out in your mind, but if not I'd advise you to give all this some thought before you start writing. Good luck working on your story!
