Nah more it was more a subversion (in the good way) of these kids being even more competent than adults when it comes to taking down serious issues to their country or region and such. That's why I bumped up the protagonists age up so he's a couple years older than all the protagonists when they start and he constantly fails and almost dies multiple times. Instead of ya know an 11 year old taking down an entire criminal organization by himself. Then having another kid finish them off a short while later. It's through repeated failures and multiple training styles that Orange actually finds his way. But thank you *very much* for your input very appreciated.

Edit: holy shit that plot point sounds great as fuck
