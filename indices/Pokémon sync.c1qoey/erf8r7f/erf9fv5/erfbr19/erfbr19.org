  I didn't quit the story I just wanted to post the 4th part of it online to see if the battle bond gimmick would actually be a good idea.

Oh. Well if the gimmick is all you wanted advice on, you should have just asked for that. It's probably one of the best directions you could take that element of the story, simply because the source material is so deeply steeped in "Power of Friendship" shonen-ness. Examining that methodically and scientifically is an interesting premise for bringing a more rational look to the classic Pokemon Adventure.

It also makes an interesting counterpoint to the villain group you've suggested that practices animal abuse. It will be hard to play it straight, but I think the less of a joke you make it, the funnier it will be to the reader: hundreds of man-hours, years of work, who knows how much money all spent in getting a spy into the most prestigious research facility in the region to steal the results of the famous professor's work, and what is this secret that they've come back with after so great an investment of time and resources? Well it seems that Professor Ply has finally proven empirically that treating your Pokemon kindly and not abusing them makes them better at fighting.

That part of it is actually pretty good. I just don't think it will carry it if that's the only part of the formula you change.

Edit: Actually, I think Team Force trying to change their internal organizational culture, dealing with internal conflict that would cause is a way more interesting story prompt than whatever Orange is up to. Violence against their Pokemon is firstly what defines them as an organization, without that what is even the point of being a member of Team Force if you aren't going to act like it?

And all those gangsters who have told themselves for years that they beat their Poochyena to make it fight better when it's really just because they're violent people who need an outlet for their aggression, do you think they'll just admit they were wrong and stop? No, they'll find some way to blame anyone but themselves. The minute someone says "the boss went soft and he's just lying to us", they'll latch on to that story with both hands and never let it go. They'll form splinter groups, and suddenly instead of one gang with a stranglehold over the region's underworld, you instead have a gang war. People will die over this.

And what about new members? Part of the point of petty, unprofitable, but socially heinous crimes like animal abuse being part of organized crime is as an initiation of sorts. How do we know we can trust the new guy? If the new guy doesn't have to abuse his Pokemon, then he's innocent of any crimes, and if we get busted by the cops, he'll sing like a Chatot knowing he'll get off smelling like a Roselia. No, we'll just have to have him do something else instead. Maybe the new initiation can just be violence against someone else's Pokemon, we'll have the new kid kill some other trainer's team of Rattatas. Or just kick the shit out of some random civilian, like gangsters do. Either way, showing them the true power of friendship has led directly to a sudden spike in the rate of violent crime across the region, good job.
