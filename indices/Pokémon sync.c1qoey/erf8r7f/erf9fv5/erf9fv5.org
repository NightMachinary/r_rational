Touch√©. Originally it was this whole story about this 13 y/o boy (still named Orange) and his journey to the top of being this weak nervous wreck of a kid to a competent almost veteran trainer by the time he was 16 mainly focusing on him going through the gym leaders, league competitions, and league champions. Trying, failing, almost quitting and dying by trying to help to defeat the organizations in each region but getting told he was too young and inexperienced and just a kid to include himself in adult matters. I didn't quit the story I just wanted to post the 4th part of it online to see if the battle bond gimmick would actually be a good idea. But I get what you mean for me it's more about the execution of it all.
