Stop me if you've heard this one:

#+begin_quote
  You play as a child of indeterminate gender named [Color] who has just recently [turned ten/arrived from parts unknown] in [small town], which happens to be within easy walking distance from a Pokemon Lab, where Professor [tree] does his work, specifically specializing in [gimmick]. By lucky coincidence, you happen to meet this professor, who mostly unprompted offers you the opportunity to help him in his research by finding a bunch of animals for him to look at. By way of compensation, he offers you a pet attack animal of your very own and maybe some technological gizmo if you're lucky. Also, you want to beat the Pokemon League and defeat some tangentially related criminal organization.

It's not even a good MadLib, there isn't enough variability for even that. You haven't yet written anything that hasn't already been written... what are we on now like 8 times over?

I'm not saying that you're uncreative, but I am saying that this so far demonstrates no creativity. If you have some unique ideas, then you have to tell us what they are if you want useful feedback. What are you doing differently?
