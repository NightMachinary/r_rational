"Stealing credit for research" is a little weird. Labs are expensive. And real-world research communities are fairly tight knit.

Maybe I could break into CERN/some bio lab. And maybe I could steal data. But if I sent it to a journal as "my" work, the senior editor is almost certainly going to just call my PI and ask what's up.

You could steal work has has some application, and then sell it to someone who wants the knowledge as a trade secret.
