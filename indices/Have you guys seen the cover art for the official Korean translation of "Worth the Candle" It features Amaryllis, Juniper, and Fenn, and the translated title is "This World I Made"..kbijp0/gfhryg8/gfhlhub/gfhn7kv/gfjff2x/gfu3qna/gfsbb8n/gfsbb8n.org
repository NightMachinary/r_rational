This really feels full circle... the Gamer, a Korean webtoon, was/is a major milestone in the development of the LitRPG genre and established a lot of the trope that WtC subverts, deconstructs, and reconstructs. I am pretty sure lots of RPG-mechanics settings (in which game mechanics are literally part of the world m) predate it but I think the Gamer is one of the first works in which the RPG mechanics was a unique ability of the main character.
