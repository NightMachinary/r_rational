It's not just their extremely predatory contracts which strips any right over an author's work, it's also that they have no oversight when it comes to whether or not a work belongs to the person submitting it. You can plagiarize a story and submit it to Qidan as if it's yours, and Qidan will do absolutely nothing to enforce copy-right despite evidence to the contrary.

It may be confusing since I'm saying author/translator as if they're the same. Part of the reason is because they treat the two essentially identically.

I'm just going to end it here, because looking up the details on what Qidan's actions is making me very angry and I'm done with feeling like that today.
