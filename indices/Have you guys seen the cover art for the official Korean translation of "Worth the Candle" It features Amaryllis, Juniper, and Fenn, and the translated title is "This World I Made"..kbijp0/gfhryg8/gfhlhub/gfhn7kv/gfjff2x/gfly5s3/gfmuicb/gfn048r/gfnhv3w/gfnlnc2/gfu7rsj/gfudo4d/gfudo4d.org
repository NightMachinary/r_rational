I did already say “they did screw over fan translators (at least some of which were probably legal at the time)” for that reason. I'm not pro-Qidan. But I do think it's silly to view it as as black and white as most people do; Qidan is /mostly/ legal, with occasional stolen material, displacing a /mostly/ illegal community, that occasionally got permission from the authors.
