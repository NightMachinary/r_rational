Kind of weird to call out Qidan here, given they're a major driver of the move /away/ from the behaviour you're objecting to, translation without permission or compensation of the original author.

Not that the controversy around Qidan isn't at least somewhat justified, as they did screw over fan translators (at least some of which were probably legal at the time) but just that it doesn't really fit the argument you made.
