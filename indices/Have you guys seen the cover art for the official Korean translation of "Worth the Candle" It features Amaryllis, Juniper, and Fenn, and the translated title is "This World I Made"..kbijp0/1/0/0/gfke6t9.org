It's authorized, yes. I get a check every quarter for my share of whatever it earns, but otherwise don't pay attention to it whatsoever, mostly because I don't speak Korean and it has virtually no impact on the original (aside from the fact that English-speaking fans seem to find its existence funny/curious). I consider it a pretty sweet deal, because it generates passive income for me at virtually no cost.
