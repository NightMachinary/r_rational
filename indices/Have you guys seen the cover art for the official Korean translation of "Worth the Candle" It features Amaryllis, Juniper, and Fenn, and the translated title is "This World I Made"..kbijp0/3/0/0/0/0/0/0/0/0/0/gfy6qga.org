#+begin_quote
  Qidian has lied in press releases to manipulate the public, and hired fake accounts to sway public opinion.
#+end_quote

Could you be specific?

#+begin_quote
  They've bought out translation companies and forced new licenses on the translators while keeping details on the license under NDA.
#+end_quote

That's just an acquihire, there's nothing particularly shady about that.

#+begin_quote
  Qidian pays authors and translators pittances, as low as $5 per chapter.
#+end_quote

Nobody is forced to work for Qidan, so this isn't exactly evil. If translators weren't willing to take Qidan's prices they'd work for competitors instead. Earnings depend on popularity.

#+begin_quote
  Qidian has even used machine translation and still paywalled the garbage content at the same price, which is tremendously unfair to the authors.
#+end_quote

I don't understand your angle here.
