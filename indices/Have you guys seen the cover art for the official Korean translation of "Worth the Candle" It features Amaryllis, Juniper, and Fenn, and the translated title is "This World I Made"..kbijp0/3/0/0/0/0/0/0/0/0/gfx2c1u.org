True, my bad. I'll list other things Qidian has done then. Qidian has lied in press releases to manipulate the public, and hired fake accounts to sway public opinion.

They've bought out translation companies and forced new licenses on the translators while keeping details on the license under NDA. Qidian pays authors and translators pittances, as low as $5 per chapter.

Qidian has even used machine translation and still paywalled the garbage content at the same price, which is tremendously unfair to the authors.

It's pretty black and white, Qidian is unethical, predatory, anti-consumer, and anti-translator, and anti-author. The vast majority of Qidian profits go to the company owners, so the increased paywalling and prices can't even be justified as paying the author for their work.
