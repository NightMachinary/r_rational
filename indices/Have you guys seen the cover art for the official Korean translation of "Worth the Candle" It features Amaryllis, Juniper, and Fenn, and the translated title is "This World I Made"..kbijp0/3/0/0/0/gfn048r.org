I have seen some complaints about translator contracts (eg. translator relinquishes rights on content to Qidan, non-disparagement, etc.), but the complaints along those lines never held much water to me, as that all seems about what one would expect for contract work. It's a shame nuance gets lost so easily on the internet.
