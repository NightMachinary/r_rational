Oh geez! That cover art makes it look like the book is going to be another trashy wish-fulfillment harem packed light novel. I'd love to be able to read the ridiculous comments that people are writing about their reactions when they see it's completely different.

But I really hope they got AlexanderWale's permission for this. Because charging money to read each chapter when the original is posted for free? Not cool.

EDIT: Oh good, he gave permission for this. I thought it might have been plagiarized-translations, because I'm so used to scummy behavior of translation sites. Specifically Qidan.
