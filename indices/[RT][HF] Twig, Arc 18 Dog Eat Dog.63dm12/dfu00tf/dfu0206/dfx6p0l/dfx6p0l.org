I am never smart/observant enough to come up with these kind of theories (true or false) when reading, but I must say the beauty of the construction always amazes me, because on the one hand of course it makes perfect sense and on the other hand there's even money you missed the mark by a mile. But if you didn't and this is true, I'll appreciate the reveal even more knowing the clues were actually real and could be picked up by someone not in the know.

Thanks.
