In case it would be interesting to anyone: I have two large distinct [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/WildMassGuessing][WMGs]] about Twig's plot:

1. The possibility of collaboration between Fray and Hayle. Basically, I speculate that they started to conspire against the Crown since before the first Arc, and ignited the civil war to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningBothSides][Run Both Sides]] of it, acquiring power and influence to topple the Crown.

2. About the Crown's ultimate endgame. In short, kill everyone in the world except highest-ranking Nobles and the most competent professors. Use experiments to produce everything necessary, without pesky ineffective humans getting in the way. Link: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5s2anq/a_twig_endgame_speculation/][{1}]].

I'm reasonably confident about the second one (~70%), less so about the first: it feels very shaky, but not completely out-there (~30%?).
