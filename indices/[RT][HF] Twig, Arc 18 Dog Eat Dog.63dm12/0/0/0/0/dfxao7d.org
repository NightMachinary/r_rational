  I am never smart/observant enough to come up with these kind of theories (true or false) when reading
#+end_quote

I used to think the same. I think Twig is a special case.

It's a regularly-updating web serial. As opposed to complete books, it /forces/ me to digest every chapter: read it, then skim through a few times, think about what it reveals.

Lately, I've been active in each chapter's discussion, which probably amplified the effect: I told people what I caught or found interesting, read their thoughts, discussed it. (While the clue-hunting there is much lower than was in, say, HPMOR discussions, it's still a factor.) Because of all that, story's plot, worldbuilding information, etc., were and always are fresh on my mind. I make connections between events of the story faster and easier.

I most certainly wouldn't have came up with either theory if I started reading Twig when it was finished. I wouldn't have /stopped to think/, just read on, read on, from the start to the end.

I believe one of the rational fiction writers (I think it was Yudkowsky?) stated this as a probelm they encountered. Even if you tell the reader to stop and think, they /won't/, they'll just continue reading. They had to just-about yell at the readers to do that, repeating the same clue multiple times in the hope that someone would notice it at least once.

In case of these kinds of large-scale theories, you have to keep in mind many characters and significant events on top of paying attention, which is easy to do if you've spent weeks regularly reading and talking about them, but much harder if you sat down and read the book in three days.

Or maybe it's nothing that complicated, and simply I acquired experience arguing with people in the comments. Who knows.

  But if you didn't and this is true, I'll appreciate the reveal even more knowing the clues were actually real and could be picked up by someone not in the know
#+end_quote

Oh yes. That feeling increases tenfold if /you/ figured out the reveal yourself, then was vindicated. I even made a bet on my second theory!

  [R]eading a story goes by much faster than writing it. If you have not called upon your readers explicitly to halt and pay attention, they are already reading the next sentence. Even if you /do/ explicitly ask them to pay attention, they are already reading the next sentence. If you have your character think, “Hm... there's something funny about that story, I should stop and think about that?” guess what your reader does next? That's right, your reader goes on to read the next sentence immediately, to see what the character thinks about it.

Substitute 'sentence' with 'chapter'. It would stay true.
