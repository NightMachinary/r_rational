I'm looking for commentary on two types of (hopefully) /sufficiently alien/ aliens - mostly tell me if you think they could plausibly evolve their stated characteristics.

The first I call metallants for lack of a better name. They're highly social, motile critters that talk and coordinate with weak radio pulses (each strain has its own wavelength). They live in very high temperature and high pressure (comparable to Venus), solid or fluid (I have not decided yet), environments, they have limited endothermy by oxydizing liquid metals on one hand, and controlling their radiative emission on the other. They do cooperative stigmergic ecoresolution of problems by tagging resources and locations with small bladelets of metal (just like those antitheft tags commonly used in retail) that convey some number of bits of information when pulsed with the right radiowave. They dig and mine, mostly. They reproduce by collaboratively nano-assembling together extra-parts they grow and shed over time for that specific purpose.

The second is a space tentacle / starfish, which grows in microgravity by eating off chondrites found in asteroid belts, in space vacuum. It's basically a near-sentient elongated blob of gel and low-pressure gas bubbles, reinforced with tendrils of carbon fibers or buckytubes (and maybe graphene membrane forming tanks or shells ?) that also serve as solar panels and possibly heat and current accumulators. It dissolves useful substances from whatever it is attached to, then either tethers directly to something else nearby (it can elongate for tens or hundreds of kilometers), or barring a suitable target it spins its rock up before launching itself - absorbing the angular momentum to convert it into centrifugal acceleration, much like a yo-yo de-spin system. It can reproduce by splitting in the middle, typically if lost in space too long, in order to launch both halves away from each other and onto new orbits. It lithobrakes on arrival thanks to its high viscosity and extreme (composite) tensile resistance.
