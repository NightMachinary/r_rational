  What about rings around gas giants?

Like the rings of Saturn? Yeah that's more realistic and could work.

Asteroids are tiny with about 1 to 2 million asteroids that manage to be above 1 kilometer in size in the entire solar system. There are millions to ten million of other asteroids that fall under the kilometer size boundary. If the asteroid was at the size of billions of tons, then it would likely qualify as a small planet in its own right. Your aliens are traveling unimaginably large distances to just find a rock that is in all likelihood smaller than the alien themselves.
