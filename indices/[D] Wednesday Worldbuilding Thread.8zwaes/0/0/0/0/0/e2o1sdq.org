I wasn't really considering the tiny rocks, just the mega-ton ones (tens of meters in radius, and above) that would allow some measure of further spreading of the space starfish thing. Duly noted, and I will keep the occurrence of this alien to the rings around gas giants and not much else. It could be a significant space hazard for spaceships traveling in the vicinity. Maybe a gravity-bound variant could evolve if it hits a sizeable planet, with or without atmosphere.

As an aside, the material is mostly needed for it to grow in biomass but maybe not for survival, as it is otherwise solar-powered and could hibernate over unimaginably long distances and possibly durations. I wonder if a collision event could send some flying on an interstellar travel ? If it's conductive enough and in tether form it could push on magnetospheres for steering, too. I haven't yet decided what senses and cognitive abilities it has and whether it calculates its next "hops".

Thanks for having taken the time to look at it !
