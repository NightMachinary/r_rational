I think the self repair idea will have a similar problem to reproduction as if they can regrow an organ in the wrong place they can regrow it in the right place and not have to also evolve a surrogate for advanced surgery to move it to the right place.

However thinking on it a bit more, they could work something like angler fish where instead of growing extra limbs they grow extra gentals which they trade among themselves. Combined with external gestation (i think theres a frog that does that) you'd get many of the same behaviors. Such as of the metallants coming together to exchange body parts and removing partially developed young growing on their bodies from themselves to reproduce.

I do like the idea that there are several genetic lines and they frankenstein parts from those line into a meta-organism with advantages from all the lines as a sort of extreme mutualism between closely related species crossing the line into being one really complex species. However it strikes me as cool but impractical.
