That's not quite what I meant, markings are for locating resources, coordinate activity, indicate what is going on or maybe skew preferences of the ants coming nearby. It is not so much meant to tag "this is mine" as I would expect the concept to be meaningless here, but more as "this spot is dangerously cold", "this waypoint connects to route A", "this is good grade of ore", "place elements for assembly X here" and so on. Different strains having different frequencies so they would ignore other strains' tags and impeded each other's efforts whenever they run into each other (providing incentives to develop more active countermeasures).

Within eusocial insect colonies there are slackers, but AFAIK there are no saboteurs. Same-strain metallants would be addressing several tasks in parallel, and divide resources among them by the weight the various stigmergic markers across would have on the population. I'd expect that they would disregard a marking only to replace it with a stronger one.
