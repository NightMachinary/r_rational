Thanks for rescuing my concept :)

#+begin_quote
  Let us say that there is a strain A and a strain B; and that, for whatever reason, strain B is slightly better at handling cold temperatures that strain A.
#+end_quote

Then depending on the degree of control the ants have over the budding process, strain B could be preferentially produced over strain A in response to colder environments. This would justify evolving the polymorphism mentioned above, and also gradually improving the species itself. Also of note: the tag could be directly advertising the temperature, and each ant have their own tolerance to cold.

I started off actual ants' scent tracks, for the tag concept. They would have a limited lifetime and be refreshed by the ants passing by, so moving another strain's tags would have limited use. Naturally-occurring changes in the environment would mandate such time limit and refresh anyway.

  you need exactly one Mother creature
#+end_quote

But then how does the mother undergo generational change ? Some Lamarckian mechanism ? I was hoping to work around that limitation by having a collective reproduction scheme, where the agents would be mostly interchangeable and more agents mean linearly faster repro rate. The baseline would incorporate fitter models over time so evolution is possible, and if the "ants" are agglomerate of individual "parts" that can be replaced at the cost of some assembly effort, then there is some way for Lamarckian change accumulation over time. Unwanted "parts" would undergo apoptosis if they don't get assembled back up for too long ?
