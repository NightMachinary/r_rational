  They would have a limited lifetime and be refreshed by the ants passing by, so moving another strain's tags would have limited use.

That depends. If the signs are moved close to where Strain A is passing in any case, will they refresh the signs despite the signs now being in the wrong place?

  But then how does the mother undergo generational change ?
#+end_quote

This, I'll admit is a bit of a sticking point.

Options include:

- The 'mother' is not actually a single creature at all, but rather some sort of machine or mechanism (like a cloning bank). Separate parts an be updated or fixed and then replaced. Downside: requires intelligent 'drones'.

- When the 'mother' dies, her last few eggs miss out on a crucial hormone that would turn them into more drones and develop into new Mothers instead. They then compete for the right of being the sole Mother and laying the next generation of eggs. Downside: Introduces competition, albeit brief. (But an idea - the competition could be purely chemical, with the proto-Mothers each trying to use their own hormone glands to reduce the egg-laying abilities of the others, turning them into more mere non-egg-laying drones, so there's never competition to the /death/, as such)
