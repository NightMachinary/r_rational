  Right - but at some point on that path the distinction between each strain fades.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. Let us say that there is a strain A and a strain B; and that, for whatever reason, strain B is /slightly/ better at handling cold temperatures that strain A. So, places that strain A has marked as dangerously cold, strain B can often mine from quite happily. Thus, if strain B figures out strain A's mark for 'dangerously cold', they can use that sign on their own mining operations, to prevent strain A from taking their ore. (If A encrypts their markers, then B can steal genuine A cold-markers and move then to B's mining operations).

And it doesn't take that much of an evolutionary leap to do either. Evolutionary systems /cheat/, it's practically one of their defining features; they're not playing to your rules, they're playing to the world, and they /will/ exploit inconsistencies in any ruleset suggested.

  You can probably guess what I'm trying to get at: a not-quite-sentient species for whom the concept of rivalry is alien.
#+end_quote

A system that evolves traditionally is not what you want here, then; evolution has rivalry for scarce resources at its very /heart/. Now, if you want a species that cannot understand rivalry, that is I think possible with a slight tweak; you need exactly /one/ Mother creature. Only /one/ source of new creatures, new eggs, new generations. And all the rest maintain and take care of this /single/ point of failure for their entire species; and are selected based on their ability to help their siblings take care of the Mother creature. Once you have that, then suddenly the only competing that they do is to compete to be the best team players, and be better noticed by the Mother/Queen...

But the difficulty then is that you do have a species with a truly single point of failure.
