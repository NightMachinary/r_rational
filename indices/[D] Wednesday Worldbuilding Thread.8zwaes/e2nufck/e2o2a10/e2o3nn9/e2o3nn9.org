  You can't just create angular momentum out of nowhere.

They'd create it by acting as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel][momentum wheels]]. Once the useable mass is transferred from the rock to the starfish it would have a respectable mass ratio against it, so by elongating and 'muscling' itself around, the rock would spin the other way. They don't even have to launch themselves whole, but just whip out the far half of their tentacle as a kind of missile. In fact it would make more sense that it would keep sending "drones" around while the root part of it stays behind and further settles in the rock.

  I don't think the second could be. Life as we know it needs liquids to support chemical reactions, and liquids aren't stable in extremely low pressures like unconfined microgravity.

Good point. I'd have to look at the hydrocarbons, like those on Titan. Maybe polymerizing some of them can give off a viscous fluid that stays put in vacuum.

Basically, I was trying to imagine a lifeform that could have evolved entirely in microgravity and in vacuum conditions, so having it start off on a planet with atmosphere would ruin it.
