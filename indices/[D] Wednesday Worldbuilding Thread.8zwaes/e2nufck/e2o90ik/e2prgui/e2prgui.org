  I expect reproduction by budding would be more plausible. Assembling a new life from out of parts of several parents would be an added layer of complexity and it's evolutionary advantage isn't particularly clear.

Good point. Could they have evolved this particular trait as a beneficial survival trait, like if they could repair themselves back from crushed / ripped parts ?

Another way would be if they were initially reproducing by budding, and then evolved some form of differenciation or polymorphism (that is seen in ants too, like with the warrior/worker distinction or more advanced stuff like with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant][honeypot ants]]). From there different versions could have started "sticking together" for a push back to versatility, or if the complementary set of features had some synergistic advantage. They would probably modify their set of parts intentionally in response to changes in environment. It would also mean that each part is really a distinct metallant, so it boils down to basic budding + further assembly.

As for the chemistry, silanes can replace carbon chains for complex molecule assemblies (readily bonding with metals), siloxanes are stable to very high temperatures, I'd also have to check but I recall that mixtures of silane and fluorocarbon elements are also possible ; some silicones, pure disulfur and sulfuric acid might replace water for fluids, at high temperatures and pressures. Maybe also lead and tin, as chain elements and fluids, too. I'd have to think up some way to form oxygen-resistant membranes with that stuff, and devise what process (geothermal rather than solar-powered) would reduce metals back after such "fauna" would oxydize them. Highly speculative stuff.

  If it were me I'd put them in a recently formed star system in one of those "alcohol nebulae", where the proto-planetary bodies haven't all clumped up into planets yet and the gas clouds everything is made from are richer in organic molecules making them more common.

Good suggestion, thanks !
