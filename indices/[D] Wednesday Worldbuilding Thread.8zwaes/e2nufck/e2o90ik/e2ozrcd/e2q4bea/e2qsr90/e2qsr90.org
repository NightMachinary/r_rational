First of all, age != success.

Second of all, your /pinky finger/ is more complex than Pando. Think about all of the delicate macroscopic machinery it has to balance (nerves, blood, tendons, bone, skin, muscles, hair, cartilidge, nails, etc) and then remember that there are at least a dozen other systems as complex, and that could kill you if they're slightly deformed. Trees don't care about any of that. Roots, leaves, branche's and they're good to go, as long as the right tissue types are approximately next to each other.
