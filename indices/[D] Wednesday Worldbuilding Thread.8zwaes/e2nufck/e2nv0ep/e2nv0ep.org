  chondrites found in asteroid belts

I have no idea how realistic evolving either of these two creatures are, but I sincerely doubt that any life more complex than bacteria can ever be found in the asteroid belt. The reason why is because of how spread out the asteroids are. Those scenes in movies where spaceships have to frantically dodge balls of rock are complete fabrications. The average distance between the rocks is *600,000 miles!* To put it in perspective, the diameter of Earth? That's slightly below 8,000 miles. I don't care what the starfish aliens are eating on the asteroids, they should be starving to death before they ever reach their second asteroid.
