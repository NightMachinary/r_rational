How do they spin up rocks without some form of thrust mechanism, and if they have said mechanism, why would they not use that directly instead of spinning up tons of rock? You can't just create angular momentum out of nowhere.

I agree with the other poster that having the second alien live in the rings of a gas giant makes a lot more sense, because everything is very close together, and there's lots of ice that could be used. Although depending on the distance from the sun, having enough energy to support a complex mind would be an issue. Human brains use up a *lot* of calories, so you would need some way of using less.

Are these aliens artificially created or naturally evolved? The first type might be plausibly natural, maybe, but I don't think the second could be. Life as we know it needs liquids to support chemical reactions, and liquids aren't stable in extremely low pressures like unconfined microgravity. They would have to start out on a world with enough gravity to support an atmosphere and some liquids, and then escape the gravity well and survive in a radically different environment. I don't think it's plausible, because the vast majority of Earth life simply dies in a vacuum, and only a few species can survive through going into hibernation, mostly microorganisms. The radiation outside of an atmosphere just makes it harder.
