I find the metallant reproductive system unlikely. If they can grow the parts then I expect reproduction by budding would be more plausible. Assembling a new life from out of parts of several parents would be an added layer of complexity and it's evolutionary advantage isn't particularly clear. Essentially every individual wold be the equivalent of a genetic chimera with several distinct lineages, which would make having an immune system very difficult, and would not provide the trait mixing benefits of sexual reproduction. Also I don't know how plausable the chemistry needed for them to exist actually is. They don't seem like they'd be able to be made of carbon and non-carbon based biochemistry is as far as I know purely speculative (it theoretically should work but would be different enough that a complex system like biology would be affected in any number of unpredictable ways) not something that's ever been confirmed possible by experiment or observation.

Short version, I think the metalants should reproduce by budding (unless you have a narrative need for them to do the assembly thing) but are otherwise fine if a bit likely to someday get caught out by science marches on.

On Asteroid-dwelling tentacle monsters. I think they would need an environment unlike any that exists in our solar system. They'd need the rock density of something like Sarurn's rings but to not be constantly bombarded by radiation like the rings of Sarurn are. They'd also need lots of organic molecules that exist in out solar system but aren't concentrated in asteroids.

If it were me I'd put them in a recently formed star system in one of those "aclhohol nebulae", where the proto-planetary bodies haven't all clumped up into planets yet and the gas clouds everything is made from are richer in organic molecules making them more common.
