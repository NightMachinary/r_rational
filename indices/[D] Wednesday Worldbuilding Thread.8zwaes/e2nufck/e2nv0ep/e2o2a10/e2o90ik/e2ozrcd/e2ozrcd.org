Something that should be pointed out is that complex life /requires/ sexual reproduction of some kind, where millions of potential lifeforms get culled, as otherwise the species will fall off the knifes edge of genetic viability. (Humans do this through millions of sperm and thousands of eggs competing to be the one to actually implant) Some lizards become parthenogenic, but they quickly die off on geological timescales.
