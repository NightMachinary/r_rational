  They do cooperative stigmergic ecoresolution of problems by tagging resources and locations with small bladelets of metal (just like those antitheft tags commonly used in retail) that convey some number of bits of information when pulsed with the right radiowave.

So creature A marks this thing as "mine!" Creature B observes this mark and...

(a) Honours it or

(b) cheats, removing the marker and taking the stuff for itself?

In any evolutionary system, you'll eventually (and probably fairly quickly) find a creature B that takes option (b), at least some of the time. The ecosystem either needs to have some way to punish such behaviour for creature B, or creature B will bemore successful (because it has more resources) and quickly outbreed creature A; in a few generations, then, all the creatures will steal at least some of the time.
