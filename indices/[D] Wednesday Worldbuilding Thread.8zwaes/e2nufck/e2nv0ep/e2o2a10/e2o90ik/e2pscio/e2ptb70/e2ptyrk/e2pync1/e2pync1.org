  there's a distinct evolutionary advantage in not ignoring another colony's tags

Right - but at some point on that path the distinction between each strain fades. The ants are not meant to have much in the way of individual goals and utility or self-awareness. Once they take into account the content of a tag it becomes just as much part of "their" tags, and they start cooperating with the strain that laid the tag as if they were the same.

But in this case, your second scenario (deception) becomes adversely beneficial. It could be blocked by having a consistency check / digital cryptographic signature, per strain, in the tags ; or full encryption, to block your first scenario (parasitism). But that would take quite the evolutionary leap to fit a whole strain through against many rivals.

Alternatively, what if there is only one strain to begin with ?

You can probably guess what I'm trying to get at: a not-quite-sentient species for whom the concept of rivalry is alien. That implies there would be rewards for strategies that are win-win across a given strain or the entire species, but none (or penalties) for win-lose strategies. I'm not sure that is even possible. Maybe if they have to maintain the environment's ambient temperature in a narrow range, or some other condition that would act as required commons ?

At a higher level there has to be a way for whichever specific ants among the strain that are fitter to succeed better than the less-fit, in order for the species to have plausibly evolved up to that point. That means developing new strains and some form of measure of utility for each. And that is also a form of rivalry (competing for fitness, and ultimately for existence), already. So, a non-starter...

Oh well, they will be more interesting and dynamic, with the added complexity of adverse strategies and balancing of competition/cooperation, and strain-wars.
