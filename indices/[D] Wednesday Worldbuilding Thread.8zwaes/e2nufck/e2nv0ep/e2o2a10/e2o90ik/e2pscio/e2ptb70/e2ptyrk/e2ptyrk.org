Ohhhhhhh, they're /warning/ signs, not anti-theft tags!

Apologies. Misunderstood that. In that case, I put it to you that there's a distinct evolutionary advantage in /not/ ignoring another colony's tags - after all, what is dangerously cold to colony A is also dangerously cold to colony B, and if A is going to be nice enough to spend energy signposting that then B can gain a relative advantage by reading A's signs (and maybe even swipe the nice ore that A marked as a good grade). On the flip side, that in turn gives A a means to affect the movements of B - if A marks a 'good grade' of ore, then B steals it, then perhaps A can swipe the mined-and-refined ore from B's storage rooms (by marking B's storage room as 'dangerously cold' to keep B's defenders away).

Either way round, though, there's a clear and certain competitive advantage to be had in the ability to read another strain's tags; so I would expect that capability to quickly emerge in these species.
