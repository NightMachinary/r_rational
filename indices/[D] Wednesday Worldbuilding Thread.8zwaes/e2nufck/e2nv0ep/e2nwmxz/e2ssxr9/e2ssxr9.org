I agree on the fact that it'd be hard for any creature to evolve in that environment to begin with. But could we give it a little leeway if we assumed that the belt was created by a planet being destroyed? It's a bit of a stretch, but in that case, some existing lifeforms with some really lucky adaptations could survive in the wreckage, and then further adapt with time. For example, I wonder about what would happen to Earth's tardigrades...
