Good point. What about rings around gas giants ? Also, I fully expect one large tentacle, having fed off billions of tons of material from a single rock, to split many many times after that, before just one of the exponentially-many fragments eventually makes it somewhere else, and all of the others starve to death. It's a crapshoot of a way to seed around.
