What if Harry creates the dementors? They are the system which copies a person's soul so they can be given an immortal body in the future.

As to why they create a sense of unease and visions of death it could be an unavoidable part of their design. Or a warning system. "This is what you will avoid".

Why the true patrons destroys them: if people believe they are immortal or have succeeded in obtaining immortality the dementors switch off and disappear.
