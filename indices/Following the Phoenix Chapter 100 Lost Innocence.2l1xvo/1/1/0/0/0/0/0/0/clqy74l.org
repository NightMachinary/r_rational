/shrug/ I don't think it really solves the fermi paradox anyway. 'Cause if you find a way around heat death, then it's pretty dang moral to send out self-replicating probes and such to find every other sentient lifeform within your light cone (or beyond if FTL is possible somehow) and tell them how to do it as well.

But that doesn't mean it's not worth a try anyway, once you've got the time and the tech.
