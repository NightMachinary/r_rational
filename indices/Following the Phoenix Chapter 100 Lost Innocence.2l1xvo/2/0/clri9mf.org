I'm inclined to agree, but I would also say that this story branch places him in situations in which he cannot gain in any way from exercising his parental irrationality. I mean.. There is a war on. However brief it may end up, the whole situation with the Dementors can rightfully be viewed as war, with billions of lives at stake. Harry is one of the few people who can prevail in this war. Until the situation is thoroughly remedied, anyone at all could die -- including the people capable of casting True Patroni.

That is an extremely sobering situation -- I wouldn't expect anyone to act as normal.
