But if you "defeat" entropy, how will you compute anything? You need an arrow of time to have any notion of a causal universe in which a world happens one instant after another?

I mean, if you gave me the base code of the universe, I could probably come up with something else because I was /designing from scratch/ a universe in which the life-forms won't run down and die, but inside /this/ universe I don't think we can actually do much about entropy except try to find more and more negentropy somewhere and use our existing resources as sustainably as we can.
