I had to drop back in time and reread the previous chapter to understand what was going on with the various rooms, but I finally got it. Clever plan; Bones is one smart lady. Also, I keep wanting to hear her say "Damnit, Albus, I'm a cop, not a botanist!" (Or whatever.)

I liked how you had Cedric's success at the TPC inspire Padma. I wonder if that sort of inspiration is an effect of the spell, or was that all her? Either way is great, but I rather like the idea that it was all her.

Harry's great realization about how maybe past deaths could be averted took me by surprise. I mean...duh. If your goal is to destroy Death then how could that NOT include retroactive resurrections?
