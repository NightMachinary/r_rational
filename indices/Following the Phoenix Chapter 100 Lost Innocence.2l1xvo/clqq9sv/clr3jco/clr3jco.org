  Harry's great realization about how maybe past deaths could be averted took me by surprise. I mean...duh. If your goal is to destroy Death then how could that NOT include retroactive resurrections?

In HPMOR-cannon, Harry only really gets that idea when [[#s][HPMoR]] . I think most people who plan to overcome death think of getting around aging and disease, and maybe backing everyone up in computers - going back in time and getting back every person who ever died is a few factors of impossibility greater.
