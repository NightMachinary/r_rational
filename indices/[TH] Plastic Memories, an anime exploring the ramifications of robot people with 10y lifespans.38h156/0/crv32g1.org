Can't say i agree, from the few episodes i watched(3) it was mostly a springboard to explore random lovcom situations with occasionally not really explored mentions to all kinds of things that could be important and interesting but are displayed in an extremely shallow fashion just to a. create forced emotional connection b. seem deeper then it actually is.

Also plenty of sloppy writing in general
