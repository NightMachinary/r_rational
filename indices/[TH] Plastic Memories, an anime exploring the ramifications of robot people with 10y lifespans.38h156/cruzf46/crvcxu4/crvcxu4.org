My guess is that the line comes from the translation from Japanese: where the word translated as "soul" doesn't mean quite the same thing as "soul" in English. For example there's /kokoro/ which is sort of like heart in the figurative sense, or /seishin/ which is more like mind. Note that I haven't seen the anime as it is not available here, so this is all guesswork.
