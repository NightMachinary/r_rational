You can tell that the writers are using the premise as a springboard to explore the human condition, not just as window dressing.

My only real complaint so far (after 8 episodes) is that the writers included a line of dialogue early-on which declares that part of the manufacturing process is to give the androids "artificial souls." This is especially frustrating given that in-universe, despite the fact that they *literally have souls*, there's /still/ a large fraction of the population (can't tell if it's a majority or not) that doesn't consider them people. My advice: just ignore that line; I'm pretty confident they just went back and threw it in after the fact because they lost some of their nerve.
