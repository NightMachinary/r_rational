Solar energy: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley--Queisser_limit]]

Max strenght of C materials would probably diamond. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus]]

For nanotechnical energy storage limits, Neal stevenson in "diamand age" uses "one nanotech hand granade has more energy than a consumer gas tank" - dont know how hard that one is.

As for light production, you can of course have basically any frequency in the available visible spectrum, without stepping on anyones toes.

Superconductors, science is not yet done and records get broken every year. Progress is still slow, my bet is on there being room-temperature supraconductors.

Rare elements, you have again pretty much full freedom. Uranium/thorium etc are interesting for easy energy density, but if you have nanotech/superconductors you would use fusion most of the time.
