Well, I've played around with some carbon in one of my original fiction works. This stuff was seriously considered, but I certainly wouldn't say it's all rational.

If I'm remembering my math right, carbon nanotube twisted fibers can create muscles that are 200 times stronger than human muscle in cross section.

The character that I created was human, with an AI presence within his body that basically forced him into trans-humanism, not entirely against his will, but not without a lot of irritation and misgivings over time.

Before he started being able to reprogram matter using Handwavium, The AI had replaced his bones with layers of graphene bound together with carbon nanotubes. Artificial spider silk was used to create subdermal armor. His muscles were threaded with twisted carbon nanotubes. The armor he wore was layers of graphene, bound together with carbon nanotubes, and padded between graphene layers with silk.

His body generates a hyper oxygenated chemical which is roughly as energetic as jet fuel. This is what the AI in him uses for energy to power the nanites which are basically replacing most of the mitochondrial functions. It generates a LOT of heat when he goes beyond human normal exertion levels.

To deal with the heat of extreme exertion, the armor is covered with a matting of nanofiber hairs designed to create an absurd amount of surface area to wick heat. The armor is not worn like normal armor. There are carbon fiber straps that are drawn through the skin and attached to the bones and the armor by the AI, creating a nearly unbreakable connection to his skeleton, and a supplemental path for heat to leave the body. He has a blood cooler which is supplemental to the armor which ties into the major blood vessels of the chest. The higher his blood pressure gets, the more expanded the blood cooler gets, unrolling down his back like a cartoon red carpet, exposing more and more supplemental cooling surface area.

Needless to say, he has a pretty severe weakness to heat. The same armor that keeps him from cooking himself can kill him quickly if he's set on fire and can't very quickly deal with the fire.

If you want to use a bit of that, fine. I'm sure that at least parts of it won't be rationally justifiable, but I suspect that some parts of it might be useful.
