Could someone check my math?

Cleveland gets just over 2200 hours of sunlight per year. Sunlight contains around 1300 watts per square meter. If we're using sugarcane metabolism with 10% efficiency, then multiplying that out seems to suggest that a square meter of collecting surface provides a squinch over 1 gigajoule per year.

A baseline human metabolism needs about 2000 kilocalories per day, which multiplies out to about 3.06 gigajoules per year.

I'm at least 10% confident that I've made a mistake there - that even with genetically tweaked sugarcane biochemistry, you'd need a lot more than 3 square meters to provide the energy needs of a baseline human's metabolism. (And that isn't even getting into enhanced metabolisms, yet.) Am I missing a few layers of inefficiencies, did I mix up which version of calories to use, or blunder in some other way?
