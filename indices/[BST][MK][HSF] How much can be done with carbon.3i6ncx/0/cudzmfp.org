Organic photovoltaics aren't going to work well without transition metal ions. Most biology uses transition metal ions to handle all the fiddly ionization stuff. They're order of magnitudes better at that sort of stuff than carbon.

They'd probably use organic cells, doped wit a small amount of transition metal ions. The best of them have shown around 10% efficiency.

Which matches stuff here.

Fat is already pretty close to the physical limits of storage efficiency, which is just alkane chains stacked together in long lines. If you want better you need to go nuclear, so need more than carbon.

You can have some pretty tough armor, tougher than steel.

You can probably have circuits as good or slightly better than ours with carbon nanotubes, with advanced enough technology, or diamond.

Organic superconductors aren't as good as ones you can get with more exotic mixes.

On elements you need.

Indium is a big one, it's excellent for making transparant conductive layers. It's not usually used in biology.

On health risks, carbon nanotubes are seriously toxic, like asbestos. Little knives of carbon that can tear apart lungs. You'll need a better repair system for the lungs and skin. Calorie requirements will likely be notably increased. If they're injured they'll be a serious health hazard for those around.

They can make many glow in the dark chemicals, which they did by taking a fluorescent protein and mutation it. These could be used to alter bioluminescent lights.
