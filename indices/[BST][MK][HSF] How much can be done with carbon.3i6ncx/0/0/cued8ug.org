  They'd probably use organic cells, doped wit a small amount of transition metal ions. The best of them have shown around 10% efficiency.

I hadn't realized that sugarcane could reach such a high efficiency compared to other crop plants. I may use a version of its biochemistry as the standard energy-gathering method, with organic photovoltaics as an option when transition elements can be acquired in enough quantity.

  Fat is already pretty close to the physical limits of storage efficiency

Close, but a few tables in that article suggest some possibilities with slightly higher densities - diesel and gasoline, or some of the poly-whatsit plastics. Due to some of the obvious complications, if I do use them they may have to be segregated into external organisms/devices, or at least specialized body cavities, which may provide some useful additional colour for the hive.

I had to dig up a different article to get the actual name of the transparent spheres (N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected diphenylalanine), but I'm willing to adopt the substance wholesale.

  Organic superconductors aren't as good as ones you can get with more exotic mixes.

True; I think I'm going to drop the idea, and stick with room-temperature computing.

  On health risks, carbon nanotubes are seriously toxic, like asbestos. Little knives of carbon that can tear apart lungs. You'll need a better repair system for the lungs and skin.

That ties in quite well with my existing plans for the colony to be an ideal environment for its members, but requiring protective gear for outsiders to come visit. (My initial plan was simply for jumpsuits which flashed at the right wavelengths and in the right patterns to avoid triggering instinctive defensive behaviours.)

  They can make many glow in the dark chemicals, which they did by taking a fluorescent protein and mutation it. These could be used to alter bioluminescent lights.

As the saying goes, "Excellent". I now get to do a bit more digging on ECFP.
