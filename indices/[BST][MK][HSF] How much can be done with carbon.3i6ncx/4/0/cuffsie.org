Hrm. [[http://www.arcticsun-llc.com/resources/renewable-101/solar-energy/][Cleveland gets about 4.07 kWh/m2 per day]]

A kWh = 3,600,000 Joules

a Joule = 0.000239005736 kilocalories

A kWh = 860.4206496 kilocalories

A human needs 2000 kilocalories per day

A human needs 2.324 kWh per day

Assume 10% efficiency

A human then needs 23.24 kWh per day

A human needs 5.71 m^{2} of Cleveland average annual solar energy at 10% efficiency to meet caloric needs.

5.71m^{2} is a lot more than 3m^{2,} but probably still a lot less than you were expecting.

It can be difficult to really grasp the concept, but most animals are quite efficient if they aren't exerting themselves heavily and are in good condition. Michael Phelps at his peak ate 12,000+ calories a day to allow him to train.

We rarely need to accommodate temperature differentials in excess of a few degrees from our core body temperature. We have no processes in the body that I am aware of which require phase changes in any matter. Hundreds of millions of years of evolution have made our cellular processes quite efficient, even if we as a species have only been around for a pittance of that time.
