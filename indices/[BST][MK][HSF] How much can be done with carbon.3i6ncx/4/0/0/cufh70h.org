  5.71m2 is a lot more than 3m2, but probably still a lot less than you were expecting.

Earlier today, my guess at my potential mistake was that the '2200 hours of sunlight per year' figure I used didn't take into account inefficiencies from the angle the sun was shining at, and I Fermi-estimated that that roughly doubled the surface area needed. 6 m^{2} per human seems to be close enough to the ballpark of 5.71 that I think we're on the right track, and I can start scaling up the figures to deal with cyber-driders, soldier castes, and other such anatomies.
