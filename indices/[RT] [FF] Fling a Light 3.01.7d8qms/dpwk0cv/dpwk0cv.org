So why didn't Taylor immediately portal away when she was released and stayed to talk to her torturer?

Also, please explain Alexandria's reasoning here. Is she confident that she has successfully broken/intimidated Taylor beyond any thought of resistance? Does she believe Taylor is going to just accept needs-of-many/needs-of-few spiel when she is the one sacrificed and in such a disproportional way too?

I presume Alexandria's goal is to have reliable long term access to Taylor's powers, and not just blindly enforcing her authority, and I can't see any way for all this to make sense. Taylor is powerful enough that you either have to convince her to cooperate nicely, or mind control her permanently, because otherwise she can escape beyond your reach the moment you look away.

Unless Contessa, of course. Please let it not be Contessa.
