I assume whatever she believes now "everyone will take me seriously once I defeat this endbringer on my own" isn't on top of the list.

  Taylor is going to just accept needs-of-many/needs-of-few spiel when she is the one sacrificed and in such a disproportional way too?

They had her run rescue missions. Admittedly, plus points for irony if Taylor Hebert turns out to be the character who complains of forcing people to cooperate under duress when innocent lives are at stake but if they can't play mind games well enough to make a lonely teenagers think "She only hurts me because she loves me" I'd consider that implausible as well.

  Taylor is powerful enough that you either have to convince her to cooperate nicely, or mind control her permanently, because otherwise she can escape beyond your reach the moment you look away.

She's slightly more powerful than Vista was. Slightly less than Labyrinth was after they figured out the portal trick. So she's going to swear eternal vengeance on Alexandria and the Protectorate? Accord still works for Cauldron.
