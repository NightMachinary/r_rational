Last I checked Alexandria's goal wasn't to save the Wormverse. It was keeping enough capes alive on earth Bet so that on the day Scion turns he exhausts himself fighting a single world and only destroys 95% of the rest.

Besides it's not like PRT directors would agree to anything other than "administering harsh discipline to a teen cape that broke rank and put herself at unacceptable risk of Simurgh influence." And on the flip side no supervillain is going to start skipping endbringer fights because a dumb teen got scolded without visible injury or having her identity revealed.

It's like beating a kid with a phonebook so as not to leave visible bruises. They aren't there to see her collapse in the aftermath and so nobody is going to challenge Alexandria on this given she's gotten away with similar before.
