You know what Taylor needs? A pair of clones. Each Endbringer fight, they could just rock-paper-scissors to see which of them gets to fight the Endbringer, which focuses on civilian evacuations, and which stays out of the fight altogether (just in case).

With corporate backing, Taylor could probably leverage an impressive amount of money to throw at such a project. Maybe Blasto + Cranial could do it? Then, to make sure no hidden commands have been implemented, Taylor could pay for a Thinker consultation or something. The Taylors would have to deal with personality drift if multiple instances survive long-term, but it's not like that's an insurmountable problem.

It really is too bad Blasto is a villain.
