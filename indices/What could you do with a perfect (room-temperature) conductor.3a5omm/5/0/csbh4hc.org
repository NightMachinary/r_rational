I've seen this concept in fiction but don't keep up with material science to know if the idea of something with a k^{th} of 1 is a physically possible thing. (Or is it 0? Anywho a perfect thermal conductor.)

Is there any science behind this idea? I'd say it seems to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics, but I don't get much past the Bohr model in most of my assumptions without using pen and paper.
