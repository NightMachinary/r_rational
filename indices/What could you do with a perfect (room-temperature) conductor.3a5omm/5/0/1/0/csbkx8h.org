Temperature is an measurement of average molecular energy passed on by Brownian motion and changes come from energetic regions of lower entropy transferring (i want to say thats high enthalpy but i think that might be another characteristic and not the same thing) to areas of lower energy causing increases in entropy. Thermal conductivity of a substance comes from a combination of a molecules mass and its freedom to move (cause collisions) and I can't see how something would "freely" accept and transmit heat without some artificial negentropy pump.

Edit: unless temperature were being transmitted by some other means: See AUgSphere's post below and then if you think physics is fun take a wiki walk starting with "Superfluids"
