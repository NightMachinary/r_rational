I've never heard any science about it and wouldn't be surprised if it didn't exist, even as a theoretical substance.

I don't see why it would violate any thermodynamic laws though. I imagine it as having 0 specific heat capacity too, so it doesn't have a temperature for most purposes, it only acts to equalize the temperatures of everything touching it.
