Oooh. .. thank you. I'm reading "amazingly high thermal conduction" postulated based on a percentage of the fluid being in one quantum state and reacting as a unit.

Wow! Something that might be a real macroscale quantum effect. . . (this second sound thermal waves thingy). I've got a a lawn to mow and one or two dozen OCR papers to real today, but if anybody knows a good survey level physics paper on the quantum state characteristic, effects , and validating experimentation, then I'd much appreciate it.
