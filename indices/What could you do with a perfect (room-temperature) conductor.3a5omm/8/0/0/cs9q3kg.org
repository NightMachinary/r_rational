Superconductors share the property of having no resistance.

The property held by perfect conductors and not by superconductors is constant magnetic flux.

The difference between the two is that superconductors will expel all magnetic flux when they become superconductive, and then permanently have zero magnetic flux inside the material. The field inside perfect conductors never changes.
