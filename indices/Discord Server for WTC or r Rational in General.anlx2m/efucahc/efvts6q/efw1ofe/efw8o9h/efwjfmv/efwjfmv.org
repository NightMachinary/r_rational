Expressing dispreference without articulating even the slightest actual objection makes for pretty poor communication. I /personally/ prefer reddit to Discord, in part because asynchronous communication allows for better development of thoughts and the inclusion of citations, and I'd prefer just one communication channel to keep track of (since there's inevitable duplication of discussion), but I /am/ curious to know what other objections people have.
