There is, as has been linked, an [[/r/rational]] discord server. I have to say, however, I didn't feel it was that much related. There's none of the built-in focus on fiction, and the resulting all-purpose discussion forum tends more towards all the other subjects the rationalsphere might feel like discussing. Beyond that, the place is supposedly drenched in internal politics.

The alexanderwales discord is, best as I can tell, much closer to being this subreddit in discord form, in terms of content, tone and focus.
