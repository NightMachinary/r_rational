I was a bit taken back too, as we've had Rumena built up as such a badass, but in retrospect I think it's fair. Cat did not penetrate deep into the Empire Ever Dark, and when she emerged it was not with the bulk of drow, just those on hand. Since it was made explicit that sigils get tougher as you go further inward, it makes sense to me that there are numerous sigils and mighty we haven't heard of who would put the drow we've seen to shame---and there's no real reason they would have been specifically named in the last book, since they weren't the ones to initially emerge with Cat. I imagine that just as everyone else in Rumena's city formerd into a cabal to keep him from running rampant, various powerful sigils in Vesena's areas similarly formed a cabal for mutual protection.

I think this chapter more about showing how strong the Dead King is. Because of how the Drow were built up last book, I'd started to get the impression that the drow were really going to tip the scale here and change the whole nature of the war. But here we're shown a devastatingly powerful group of drow suffering heavily once the Dead King has had a chance to adapt to them.
