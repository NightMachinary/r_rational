Narratively kinda a weird chapter.

The first half was telling us about how great Vesena was. To the extent I was wondering why they hadn't steamrolled the rest of the drow, if they were the only ones who still had meaningful tactics and these special seige engines, and and why we haven't heard about these super badass soldiers before. But then they spent the second half of it being absolutely slaughtered.

Feels like a weird worf effect situation where they are bigged up only to fail showing how scary the dead kings army is, which was already pretty well established.

In universe, the shift is partially explained by the recognition from Cat that although they had the appearance of a true army it was only skin deep, and they reverted to the same bad tactics as the other sigils when push comes to shove. But I'm still not sure how much of the original positive description was accurate, and how they are meant to fit in with the relative strength of the other drow.
