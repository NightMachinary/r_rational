  Feels like a weird worf effect situation where they are bigged up only to fail showing how scary the dead kings army is, which was already pretty well established.

Another in-universe explanation is that the Sisters want to convey both that the current relative equilibrium on the southern front is mostly the Dead King going for attrition rather than overwhelming wave of undead vulnerable to Named, and that the troops that would otherwise be waiting to stamp down the breakthroughs in Procer can't be faced by the human armies alone. They picked something Rumena has already assessed to be a showcase of how Neshamah can exploit the vulnerabilities in an opposing force he's had a couple of years to study: sure, the Revenant is the same one a young Named like Blade of Mercy fought close enough to think that he killed her, but the whole point of the buildup is that the reserves they'll have to fight through are deeper than it seems from Cleves.
