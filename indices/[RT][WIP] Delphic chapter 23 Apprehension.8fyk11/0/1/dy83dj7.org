I found the doc and the country he was in were really interesting, and i'm interested to know more about him and his colleagues as well as what he wants in return for helping "hector" out. Other than that it was pretty good all around, I liked the competence of the heroes, the only thing that was missing imo was an overarching storyline, I feel like their needs to be something bigger than just hector solving cases of the week.
