This is the last regular chapter of Book 1. The working title for Book 2 is /Delphic Incorporated/.

Next Monday, there will be two posts: an epilogue entitled "Group Loyalty" and a prologue for Book 2, tentatively entitled "Now Hiring." Both will be third-person from perspectives other than Hector. (You should recognize the format as shamelessly stolen from better web serials.)

I am still looking for any feedback I can get to help decide the best direction for Book 2. If you have any comments about where you feel the story was weakest, what you liked best, or which characters or events could use more exploration, please share.

And, as always, if you are enjoying the story, [[http://topwebfiction.com/vote.php?for=delphic][vote on Top Web Fiction]] so that more readers find it. Thanks!
