Chiming in with a few others - I really liked this and want it to continue, despite the lessened commenting rate compared to some of the larger stories.

I hope that isn't taken as a negative sign, if anything, I think it's more likely to just be an effect of there being less "mysteries to try and decrypt" and more "what's going to happen next!?" (At least that's the case for me.)

One thing that I do think might be interesting to explore a bit more in the next book would be a bit more exploration of the characters themselves; thinking back, the first book didn't feel like it had much major character development, since all of the main players were already established in their lives and it really just showcased them dealing with the situations they encountered. It felt very realistic, so from a rational perspective, that's not a major complaint, but story-wise, it's something that might feel more engaging.

One way to help with that might be an interlude or flashback of some sort showing Delphic either learning to grow into his powers the way we see him use them now (might feel a bit anticlimactic, since we know the endpoint already) or more likely, showing how he learned/got into his programming/hacking skills, since his powers don't really imply "good at computers" despite him showing levels of hypercompetence at that. (For reference, I've been a programmer for 10+ years, and even with his powers, I'm not certain that I'd be able to recreate some of his feats, though I also haven't focused specifically on /hacking/ programming for that amount of time, so that's not to say it's impossible.)

I would likely only go that path if you have a level of actual understanding of those things, though, or at least a few references that can sanity check it so that you don't end up with hollywood hacking.
