While it might not be a problem in book form or binge reading... In serial form, I found it difficult to remember what power various supers have. I wasn't clear why Spinner was being brought in, although skipping back a few chapters to refresh myself made it obvious, and it also becomes obvious if you just keep reading. It's hard to re-introduce that sort of info without it sounding artificial or repetitive, but it might be worth trying, even if just adding a clause "something something already written about Spinner/, to employ his tracking powers/" around the first time he's mentioned.
