So:

1. Zach went through the gate and this imaginary copy universe happened?

2. So Zorian isn't the real Zorian but a copy of the real one. So while he got the brand on him he isn't really Zorian. So when this ends this Zorian will end.

I think the Spiders figured that out and they didn't want to tell him that because he wouldn't have as much incentive to keep doing stuff. I think the memory packet will reveal that info.

As for what Red Robe has been up to? That part has me stumped unless he is simply trying to delay Zach figuring things out until the time runs out on the time loop.
