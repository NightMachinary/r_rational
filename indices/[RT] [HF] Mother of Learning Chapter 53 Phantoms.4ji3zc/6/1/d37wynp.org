I like your theory that the spiders didn't want to tell Zorian that only one market can leave the loop (probably Zach) because Zorian might lose motivation to improve and uncover the secrets.

However this also feels like a major perma-death flag for Zach.

RR is most likely figuring out how to supplant Zach as the main Branded One, so he can be the only one to reap he benefits of the loop.
