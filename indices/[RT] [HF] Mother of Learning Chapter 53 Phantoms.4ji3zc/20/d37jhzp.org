So let me get this straight. The gate is not malfunctioning in one way (3 travelers instead of 1) but actually in two ways? Considering that other guy spent 11 lifetimes in there. Lifetimes. Not month times. And he wasn't ageing while in there. I mean a month is a bit low on data to really check on the whole aging thing, but oh well, I guess we'd have learned it were it true anyways.
