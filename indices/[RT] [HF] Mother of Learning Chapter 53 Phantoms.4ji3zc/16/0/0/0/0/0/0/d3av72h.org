Thanks for the great story. It's become a once every three weeks highlight of my weekend.

I've got a couple minor mana questions:

1. Does Zach's "232 magic missiles" comment include the efficiency gains, like Zorian's current 35, or is it as Zorian assumes, and 232 is his magnitude of magic reserves.

2. What's Zorian's current rate of mana regeneration like? I know it varies based on location (mana well existence and rank), does the rate of assimilating ambient mana also vary on based current/maximum reserves he has? For example if he's completely expended his mana and is at 0/20 or has only used a portion and is at 15/20.
