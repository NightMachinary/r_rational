So...lifetime growth is expected to be about quadruple the starting reserves. That would give Zorian a lifetime peak of 32. After about 4 years or so, he could cast 35 magic missiles. Let's say he's reached 20, plus efficiency gains. So that means efficiency gives him close to double. Which suggests that Zach has reached somewhere around 150ish, plus efficiency. Putting his natural reserves a little under 40. Give or take. Somewhat less than the 60 that Zorian assumed. Still abnormally high.

Of course, the 20 figure is a guess. If we assumed that Zorian's reserves were actually, say, 16, then Zach's might be around 100, suggesting natural reserves of 25. Much closer to normal human range.
