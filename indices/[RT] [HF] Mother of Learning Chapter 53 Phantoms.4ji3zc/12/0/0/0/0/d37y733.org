I don't think so, we're already over 90 restarts in, and still one arc to go. But consider this: 1+0+3 = *4*; In chapter 34 Zorian got killed by an Eyebeast, which is described in "Compendium of Dungeon Denizens, volume *four*". If we convert letters to numbers we get 14+15+2+15+4+25=75; There are seven Aranean webs near Cyoria, and the primordial summoning requires five shifter children. That can't be a coincidence! Both Aranea and Eyebeasts live BELOW the ground. The nearby Aranean webs are obviously in league with Eyebeasts and the Cult of the dragon BELOW!
