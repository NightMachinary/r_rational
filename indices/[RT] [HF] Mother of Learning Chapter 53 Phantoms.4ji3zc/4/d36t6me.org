Interesting.

Good news: If everything's a copy, then the normal flow of time won't be influenced even by seeming-permadeath.

Bad news: Can someone leave who hasn't entered? Do the memories and soul abilities get passed to the outside the same way they're passed to the beginning, or are Zorian and Zach going to have to mindwipe and smuggle copies of themselves into the true Branded One's mind in order to get out of there? (And there's the underlying question of what happened to Zach in the first place--a deliberate attempt to set him up as a worthy rival, a foil for testing which could never return to the normal timeline on its own?)

...unless two different groups tried to control who entered before the whole thing started, then if only one enters multiplicity after that has to be pretty much deliberate--though there's Zorian's case too, so incompetency can't be completely ruled out.
