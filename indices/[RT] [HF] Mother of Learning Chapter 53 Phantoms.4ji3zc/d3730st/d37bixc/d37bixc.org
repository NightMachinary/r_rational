RR is Zach's guardian. While pillaging House Noveda he learned how to trigger the Sovereign Bloodline. He activated the loop, then immediately takes the memory packet from Zach while he is asleep. Having the instruction manual lets him kick people out.

The purpose of the invasion is both to divert Zach and regularly coax him to a known location where he can enlist Quatach-Ichl to subdue him and update the packet. In resets Zach doesn't fight the invasion RR remembers nothing. Even if Zach bugs out for years though he maintains the memory packet at the start so he doesn't need to worry about the packet decaying.

So he only has access to his own/Zach's memories and a slight ability to plant compulsions, explaining why he hasn't been seen much now Zach is avoiding Cyoria. He only remembers the planning he does while Zach is asleep, so needs to be super cautious. In the next loops however he will have access to whatever Zorian tells him about the markers, so will be making a play to steal Zorians/Zachs.
