I didn't mean to imply he can take all Zachs knowledge in every loop, just focused reads for specific information like we saw in Soulkill. Memory reading with structured magic is hard, and RR had no reason to suspect Zach had learned more in the few hours since he last trawled his memories, so it makes sense he didn't know the very next loop.

I think he has known since then, but sees no reason to confront Zorian and risk damaging his marker when he can simply wait for Zach to make contact.
