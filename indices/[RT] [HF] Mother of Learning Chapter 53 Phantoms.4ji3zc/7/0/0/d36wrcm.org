I see your point. It's difficult to judge what normal power growth is for a young mage, so it could be that Zorian isn't growing exceptionally fast (at least compared to Zach). The only real way to tell would be to objectively know if Zorian is more or less that one-fourth as powerful as Zach, considering that Zach has had four times the training time. What's more, we still don't know how Zach is with mana-sensing skills; for all the reasons that Zorian didn't encounter them until a teacher knew about the loops, Zach might be underdeveloped in that area.
