It's really interesting to me how Zorian and Zach differ skill-wise. It's obvious that Zach is at least as skilled at Zorian in any given subject, but I think that Zorian is improving more quickly. Considering Zach has been inside the loop for twenty years or so (IIRC), the fact that Zorian can match him on so many levels is testament to Zorian's growth rate.
