Yeah no problem. If it's not too much trouble, could I have a look at your code? Completely out of curiosity, you have my word that I'll never create a post with it. It's interesting to see how different people approach the same problem. At one stage I was going to create a Reddit bot study group which once a week gave a problem or desired bot, and everyone shared how they would write it and gave feedback. Nothing ever came of the idea though.

If you're okay with it, please send me a PM.

Oh and thanks for reminding me there was a new MoL chapter. I didn't realise until I got your page.
