The spirit implied that he was beaten by the Branded in the past, causing it to fall. Also, egg-smashing was involved. I guess that's one possible reason to be pissed off. On the other hand he seemed rather calm at the prospect of dying in a month.

The gods' inaction is what really bothers me here. From a perspective of any good or neutral aligned deity this repeated simulation would be considered the worst atrocity possible. It's s spiritual genocide (so, worse than physical one) that is repeated over and over and over. I can't imagine all gods turning a blind eye to it unanimously. And the gods should've been active during the 1st time loops.

As for RR his attacks don't need to affect anything in the real world. It could be just a way to add instructions to the constructor "do not replicate this and this". Simple and efficient. The only problem here is that it implies RR as the loop operator. So what purpose does Zach have in that case?
