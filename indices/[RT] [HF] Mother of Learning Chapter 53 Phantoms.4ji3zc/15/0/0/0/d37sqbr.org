I think that's why the spirit is so pissed off. They're created copies of the souls of real people, doomed to never exist outside of it. "Fade away into the void" is the way the spirit phrased it, so it's not exactly the same soul destruction that's said to be impossible. This alternate dimension could also be considered to be outside the purview of the gods. I imagine that RR's attacks deleted the master copy of the souls that were used to create the aranea and mercenaries anew in each restart.
