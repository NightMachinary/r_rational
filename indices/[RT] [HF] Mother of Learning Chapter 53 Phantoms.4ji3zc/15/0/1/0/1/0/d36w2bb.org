Ah, that's because it made the loop end. If it was just a simulation, why wouldn't the loop carry on with it? And obviously not everything is/can be simulated, because there's no summoned demons and the church can't contact their gods/angels.

So I think the Primordial summoning ritual was too effective, and that it really did punch a hole into its pocket dimension.
