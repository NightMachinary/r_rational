It (He of the Flowing Flesh) goes back to its weird pocket prison dimension thing almost immediately? It never fully entered the time loop dimension. It would be amusing if it lost its arm-like appendage due to the events in 52, but I doubt it. I'm imagining that its dimension is not linked to the normal flow of time either. If it is, I'm probably wrong about that being the actual Primordial.
