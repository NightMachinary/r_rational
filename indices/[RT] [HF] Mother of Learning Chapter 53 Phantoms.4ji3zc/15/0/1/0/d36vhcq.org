Because the Primoridal wasn't part of this "simulated world", the summoning really did punch a hole between this false world and the Primordial's actual pocket dimension prison. It only lasted for a few seconds. This false world isn't an illusion, if that's what you're thinking, it's an instant from the original world made real, and given a month's worth of time to play out. It's more of a splinter/alternate dimension. It's not the Primordial itself, it's the linking of these dimensions, there's a cost to repair time loop dimension, as well as an energy that drained out from that hole while it was open.

I imagine that the Primordial summoning is usually sabotaged by RR to prevent it from succeeding, but the last loop's time table was too far advanced.
