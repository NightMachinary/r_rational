Hey, I got it almost perfectly: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4d88fl/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_51_out_of_control/d1oo3v3]]

I added to it in 52, since I think connecting the Primordial's prison pocket dimension to theirs can destabilize the loop as well, causing another restart. In fact, a successful Primordial Summoning probably causes a massive drain on the loop's maintaining energy. They should probably try to stop that from happening anymore, unless they really want to end the loop early, which might screw over Red Robe's plans, but would also screw over Zorian, and possibly even Zach, depending on the progression of RR's plans.
