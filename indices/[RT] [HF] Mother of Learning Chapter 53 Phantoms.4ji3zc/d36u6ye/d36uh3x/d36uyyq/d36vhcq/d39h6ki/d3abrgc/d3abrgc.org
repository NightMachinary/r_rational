Wait.

That's the entire plot. That's why everything is happening. The darn lich is trying to kill off the primordial permanently. And it will cost it and it's nation about nothing. Plan invasion, with a contingency step of checking if the primordial still exists. Fire timeloop. If the summoning /ever/ succeeds inside the loop the primordial ceases to exist. In any remaining loops - and in the base time line, the initial divination now tests negative, and you go home. Victorious without ever fighting.
