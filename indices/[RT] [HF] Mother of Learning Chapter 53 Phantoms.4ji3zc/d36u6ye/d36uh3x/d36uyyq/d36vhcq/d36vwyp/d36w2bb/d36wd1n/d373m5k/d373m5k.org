It might be a being of Zorian's world... but it's also an incredibly powerful immortal being with enough metaphysical omph that entire races can run shapeshifting abilities off a little bit of its essence. There's /something/ special about it. Perhaps that the pocket dimension it's in isn't connected to time and space like the demons and gods, and so when the world is simulated, it isn't ripped away - but it still exists outside the paper reality of the loops, so tugging on it with a ritual within the loops is like trying to stop a cruise ship from drifting with an anchor made of papier mache.
