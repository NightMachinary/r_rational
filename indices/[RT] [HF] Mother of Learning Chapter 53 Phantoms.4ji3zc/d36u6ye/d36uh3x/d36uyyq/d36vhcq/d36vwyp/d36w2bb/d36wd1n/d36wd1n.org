There is a big difference between angels/demons and the Primoridal though: the former are not beings of this world, while the latter is, pocket dimension or not. It makes sence that the former wouldn't be simulated, while the latter would.

The loop end bugs me too, but I'm inclined to give the Brand credit for that. Perhaps a mere presence of Pimoridal is bad for souls/minds of everyone present or something like that, and thus it's summoning is one of pre-programmed conditions to end the loop early. Like how the very first loop ended with lich Soul Melding Zach and Zorian (I think this is Zorian working hypothesis now).
