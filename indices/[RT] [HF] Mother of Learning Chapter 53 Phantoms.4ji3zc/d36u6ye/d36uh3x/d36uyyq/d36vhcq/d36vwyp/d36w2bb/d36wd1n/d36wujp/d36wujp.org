Another great preprogrammed reason to end the loop would be if anything is causing damage to the pocket dimension itself.

  Above the Hole, and presumably on the inside of it, space shuddered and writhed, distorting everything like hot summer air. Slowly, jagged black threads started rising into the air from the depths, zig-zagging through the air and occasionally forking offshoots.

  They were cracks, Zorian realized. Reality was breaking.

  Suddenly, a huge volume of space in the center of the cracks simply... caved in, creating a pitch black hole that hung in the air. Something huge and dark brown, like a hand studded with mouths and eyes, shot out of the rip in space, but Zorian didn't have time to study it much. Without any prompting from him, the marker on his soul suddenly activated and everything went black.

Point in your favor: The marker on his soul is the thing that activates after he sees the Primordial's hand.

Points in my favor: Reality was breaking apart, and reality reset when a giant hand punched a hole in the sky. Also, it's "primordial", not "primoridal", hence my victory (in spelling).

But in any case, I think we've argued this to the ending point and will be agreeing to disagree.
