A discrepancy that's been bothering me, perhaps related to this, is that the stars are apparently continuing to move, inconsistent with the rest of the simulation resetting. It would be easy to just set the values for star movement back to the same place each time.

My current theory is that a "perfect" reset is neither possible nor desirable. In order for information to leave the simulation during the final month, it needs to be stored somewhere in the interim. Stars and souls are the two best candidates we have for that right now.

Someone mentioned above that planar and planetary are treated as synonymous in this story, so perhaps it is both. I'm trying to use physics concepts as springboards for understanding the possible connections between these two things--light has no mass, like souls, light travels at the speed limit c, which seems relevant to the "time" part of the phrase "time loop"--but no great insights have appeared here so far.

Does anyone remember anything else in the book so far that suggests a possible connection between stars and souls?
