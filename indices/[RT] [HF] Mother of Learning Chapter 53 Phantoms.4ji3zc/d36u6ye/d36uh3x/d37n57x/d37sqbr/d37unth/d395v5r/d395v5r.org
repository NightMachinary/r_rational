I don't think RR's attacks affect the real world, just this false world. When I mentioned "deleting from the master copy", I meant the original snapshot of the world that is used to create the loop each time. Incidentally, this gives RR a way into the loop without any sort of soul marker, if he just modifies/updates the state of his soul in the master copy each time. It also means that mind/soul magic wouldn't have any effect on him that would persist through the loops, Zach and Zorian would have to figure out to modify the Master Copy themselves in order to stop RR inside the loop.

And RR can have abilities/knowledge about the loop beyond Zach without being the inheritor of the Brand that Zach is. The main downside to that is that the more knowledge RR has about the Sovereign's Gate, the less options we have besides Daimen for RR.

An heretofore unknown character gaining knowledge from Zach while inside of the loop, and cementing a position for themselves in the loop and then messing with Zach's memories to erase themselves from Zach's mind is still a possibility, but it has become increasingly difficult for someone like Veyers Boranova to be RR.

I get the impression that gods in this series are pretty hands-off, and it's possible that they decided to overlook/ignore the once every 400 years event because they found the results interesting. After all, it means that every 400 years you'd get to see some sort of super archmage arise. It's not called the Sovereign's Gate for nothing, those mages probably became kings and emperors most of the time.

I think the Ghost Serpent seemed every bit as annoyed being a false transient entity in the time loop as it did about being brought down by a Branded One in the past.
