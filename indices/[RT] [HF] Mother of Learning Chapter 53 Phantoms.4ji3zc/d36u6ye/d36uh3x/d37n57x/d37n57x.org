How do you think souls fit into this?

I mean, obviously, everything in the simulation has souls as usual: soul spells work. But then it was said recently that souls act as an otherwordly information storage, and also can not be destroyed.

So how does everyone who is not a looper get their soul reverted to the beginning-of-the-month state? Does the simulation just create extra bunch of souls just like it creates a whole new physical dimension? Most importantly, if yes to the previous question, then what happens to those new souls when the loop is reset and the dimension is collapsed? Do they go into the afterlife? Are they destroyed? (so it would be possible to kill a soul after all?)

Can it be that the spirit is simply wrong or lying about this one?
