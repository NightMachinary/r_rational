EDIT:Update to theory in comment below, explains the invasion, why he doesn't control Zach.

What time did the mercenary company drop dead? The loop could have been going on for hours by the time Zach and Zorian wake up, so it's a little suspicious RR attacked Zach right after he woke up. I'd expect him to be awake earlier, so have hours to fuck with Zachs unprotected mind, or later so Zach would be dressed by then.

I think he is using the mem packet method in Zach, because besides his Necromancy he seems like a mediocre mage. He didn't help the lich take down Zach, he needs a spell rod to cast magic missile, and was pretty pathetic at chasing down Zorian. Doesn't seem like someone who has been improving their shaping for the 200+ resets he has been aiding the invasion. He could have been someone Zach blabbed to in an early loop, and dominated him into delivering his memories each reset. Zorian wasn't present for the invasion while Zach was in a coma, so there is no knowing if RR was active.

The huge flaw in this theory is if he controls the only other time traveller, why bother setting Zach to fight the invasion? I still think his soul/shaping isn't improving with the loops.
