Based on what's been said, it seems like whatever initiates the loop is some sort of artifact or ritual that needs to be interacted with physically. Zach seems to be the only person on the 'real' end of it. Unless you're suggesting that once out of the simulation Zorian's soul will just appear in his 'real' body (which may or may not already contain a soul depending on the exact mechanics of the loop), there will probably be some issue with the gate outputting two souls in a setup configured for one.
