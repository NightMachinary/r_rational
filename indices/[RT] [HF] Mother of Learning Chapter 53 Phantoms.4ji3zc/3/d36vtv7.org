/Since many people are writing about it, I decided to answer in the first level./

I don't think there is an actual problem with having two Branded Ones. Nothing we know about the time loop suggests that having multiple time travellers is different from having only one. Perhaps having only one in all previous occurences is a matter only of:

- Convenience. If there is only one Branded One, everything he learns stays true, while if there is more than one it may not be that due to other ones influence.

- Tradition. If the loop creator's intent was to teach/enhance one person per cycle, there is little reason for that to change.

- Mechanics. If the initiation mechanism (Gate + Key) works only on one person, and sharing the Brand requires a /correctly botched specific soul magic spell/, it's no wonder that there always was only one time traveller despite the potential to loop more than one person.

- Any combination of those and anything I missed)
