Like the serpent said, anyone in the time loop is as real as an identical copy can be. However, this can be really complicated when we take into account that only "one" branded one can leave the loop.

We assume that Zach was the original beneficiary of the Gate/Key. This might mean his original walked through the gate or whatever, while Zorian has a double of himself in the "real" world.

I mean ultimately this doesn't affect the immediate plot, only what shenanigans might occur if only one person can actually leave the loop with memories intact.
