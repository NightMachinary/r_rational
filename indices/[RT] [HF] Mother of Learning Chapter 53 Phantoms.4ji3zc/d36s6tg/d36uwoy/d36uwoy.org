Someone started the Sovereign's Gate back up again, luckily in time for the Planar Alignment, the most likely candidate would be Daimen, "Indiana Jones"ish archaeologist that he is. RR has somehow been included in the time loop, but probably doesn't have the proper Brand. (The Brand is the "soul marker", which is essentially Zach's Noveda Bloodline ability, which Zorian gained a slightly flawed copy of from the Lich's Soul/Blood Magic, which should still be good enough, since it works well enough during the loop.)

So RR's soul marker can let him loop, but Zorian thinks it might not let him leave, in which case RR has to switch the loop over to recognizing him as the true inheritor of the Brand, in which case Zorian and Zach will, in a good case, return to reality as if nothing has happened, with no experiences from the loop, or in a bad case, the loop uses their marker in a backlash to mangle their souls. Even the good case would be horrible, since Red Robe has apparently deciding to contribute to Cyoria's destruction, and if a clueless Zach and Zorian were in there, they'd certainly die.
