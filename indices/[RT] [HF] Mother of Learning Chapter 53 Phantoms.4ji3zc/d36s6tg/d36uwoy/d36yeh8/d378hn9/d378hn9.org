Interesting analysis of the soulkill technique... But it's worth remembering that Red Robe almost certainly /does not/ have the soul marker. Remember that Zorian was never able to find him using the locator spell. He somehow found a different hack that lets him act like he's looping. It's also not clear if he started before or after Zach. I suspect that he started at the same time, so he could somehow project his soul into the "In-Between" before the simulation began.

It's strongly implied that soulkilling is derived from RR's necromancy + time loop knowledge. Batak mentioned that souls can be used to produce accurate simulations -- that's likely how the time loop works. RR probably knows enough about soul magic to prevent this from happening. It's curious that he hasn't used it against Zach or Zorian, though.

Of course, there's still a lot of missing information: What happened to Zach's memories? Why is RR doing this at all? Why does RR soulkill the aranea but not even try Zach or Zorian? What the hell is the time loop for? Stupid Ghost Serpent is /not/ helpful.

Edit: We also know the that the time loop resets when Zach dies, which suggests that he's the primary source.
