What if we're getting it all wrong? What if RR is the original source, and his goal in starting up the Sovereign Gate was to become strong enough to guarantee that his attempt to release He Of The Flowing Flesh was successful?

I don't know /why/ he wants to release a Primordial, but for the purposes of this argument I'm going to assume that he's just nuts. My evidence is as follows: 1) After the first attempt, the church and the government would lock the Hole down to prevent any further attempts. Making the first attempt work is a must. 2) Limited number of shifter kids. Sure, there's plenty in the world total, but very few who are close enough to Cyoria that news of their kidnapping wouldn't reach defenders of the Primordial prison before they could get there. Proximity is important. 3) Soul Killing is impossible, but someone claims to be able to do it. That either means that the claim "Soul Killing is impossible" or "RR can do it" is false. What if the Sovereign Gate gives its user the ability to kick out people not useful to their goals? It does seem tailor-made to be the best possible training device, and kicking overwhelmingly powerful enemies which could slow your training out of your simulated training ground seems like a useful feature. RR didn't use it on Zorian or Zach because the technique he uses to do it doesn't work on people with the soul brand to prevent magic - reflecting effects from kicking out the user of the Gate.

That all seems coherent to me.
