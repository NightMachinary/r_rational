Let's say you've invoked some strange dark ritual to give yourself a duplicate pocket universe to train yourself in. Maybe you get lonely or bored. Doesn't matter, because you're in the universe until the battery runs out. To train as hard as possible you need a powerful enemy. So you use your advanced knowledge of souls magic to mark another, so they will train along with you. But you wipe their memory of you, and set them on a path. In this case, make him play the hero and fight the invasion. That way, you can train against him by supporting the invasion.

The whole summoning is a distraction. Hell, it's possible Red Robe invoked this terrible magic to help train to defend against the summoned Terror. That's what I would do.

Honestly Red Robe might be a good guy who was confused when someone started trying to kill him and then saw those spiders definitely lied about being marked. I'll have to go back to the chapter where we meet him. Could this all be a misunderstanding, hyper-brutalism because he was training and the target would be fine?
