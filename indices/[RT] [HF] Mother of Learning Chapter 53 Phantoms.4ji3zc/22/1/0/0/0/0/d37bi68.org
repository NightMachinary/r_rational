I wrote it but never bothered to get it working properly or finish it. It was a pain to test because it could only be triggered once every three weeks. I only tested it once and someone managed to submit before me. It could have been for a few reasons, I suspect it was either:

1. The script was caching some data so it was slow to post.
2. Fanfiction.net doesn't update the header I was searching for immediately.
3. Someone posted a discussion within 6 seconds of it being released.

It was just something messed with as a hobby so I didn't have much motivation to finish it.
