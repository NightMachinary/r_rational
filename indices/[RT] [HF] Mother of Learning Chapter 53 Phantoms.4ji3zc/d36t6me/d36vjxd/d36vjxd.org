I like your assumption that Zach isn't in fact the original Branded One, because it would answer the question as to why the loop is showing signs of collapse after Zach has been in for only a few decades when the Ikosian Emperor spent 11 lifetimes (if a mage's lifetime is around 80 years, 11 lifetimes would be 880 years).
