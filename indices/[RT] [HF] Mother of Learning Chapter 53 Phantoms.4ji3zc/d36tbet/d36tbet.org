So, the takeaway is that time loop is connected to planetary alignment.

Funny, that.

  According to Ikosians, the world was originally a swirling, shapeless chaos, inhabited only by the 7 primordial dragons. One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World -- the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground.

I've thought for some time that Ikosian mythology doesn't quite account for other planets. Maybe those are the other 6 dragons.
