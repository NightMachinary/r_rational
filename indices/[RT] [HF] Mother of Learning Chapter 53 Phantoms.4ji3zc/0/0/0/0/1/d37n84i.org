Zorian's marker is a corrupted version of Zach's. He didn't get the whole thing, just enough to make it functional. This would make it difficult for RR to track Zorian's marker, as he doesn't know what it looks like.

On the other hand, Zorian's marker comes directly from Zach's. It makes sense that he is able to track the progenitor of his marker with a marker-tracking ritual. RR has a different marker that Zorian doesn't know the composition of, so he can't track it.

With this set up, both Zorian and RR are able to track Zach, but neither can track the other, which is exactly what we observe.
