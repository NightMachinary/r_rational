This... doesn't make a lick of sense to me.

If RR looped Zach, he is interacting with him awfully rare. I don't think Zach's intended role was a practice dummy or a companion. Unless the loop has been active for 11 lifetimes, of which Zach remembers only ~20 last years due to some mind wipe. But then RR is hundreds years old, and is basically godlike and is toying with everyone.

Another thing to consider, is that if Serpent is right, the In-Between happens on the first day of the month (when everyone goes to school), so in the real world the primordial has not been summoned. Yet. When the loop ends the Branded One(s) will live this month one more time.
