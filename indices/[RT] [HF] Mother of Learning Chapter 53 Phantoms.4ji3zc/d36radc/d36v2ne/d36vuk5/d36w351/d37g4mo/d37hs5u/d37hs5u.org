How exactly does it work, anyway?

I made a scraper for Worm, which could probably adapt very well to Unsong. Worm had a bunch of unicode 1/2 characters in the titles, and it worked (but my url downloader had some problems I manually had to work around). I used Calibre to manually make an ebook.

It should be fine. Everything is in Unicode nowadays. It would only be slightly harder, enumerating through next page links (table of contents might be a bit harder).

Would you mind letting me see the source code, or at least enumerating what you did? I promise to not make one (there is ficsave) or share your code if you want to keep it private. I'm curious how you made all three types of ebooks. Thanks.
