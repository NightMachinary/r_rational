So it is revealed in this chapter that the item driving the loop is called the Sovereign Gate, which hasn't been used in centuries. Coincidentally, the invasion force is using teleporting gates that haven't worked in centuries to transport their forces.

Once again, I will point out that someone has a lot of knowledge that should have been forgotten. Based on the preparations for the invasion and the fact that the loop started in the first place, this has happened before the time loop and thus rules out the possibility that RR found the information while inside the time loop. The three possibilities are Zach (who is lying or had his mind wiped, possibily geass), RR who may well be the original branded one, and finally a third party that is backing one of the other candidates.

Zach is missing incredibly important information, or is choosing to not tell Zorian. Until Zorian manages to get in Zach's head we have no way of knowing.
