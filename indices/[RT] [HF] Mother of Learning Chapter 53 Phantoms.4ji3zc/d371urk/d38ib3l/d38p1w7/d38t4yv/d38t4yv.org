He might not have done anything with the gate, could be that RR just succesfully fished some information from him or his library or something. Just saying that the lich totally has lots of information that should have been forgotten, like the teleport gate thingies.

Maybe they even work the same way? Lich told RR how the gates work and RR happened to know where the sovereign gate is...

Or maybe RR wiped the memory of the Lich just like with Zach? :D Or maybe lich just can't use the time loop thing because he is undead?
