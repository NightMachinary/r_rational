I was wondering the same thing about the Weeping, I'm not sure exactly how long ago it started (Zach was still "a small child" after the rest of the Novedas died), but the tail end of it was only a few years before the start of the story after all (Kana is only 3 or 4).

I'm still not sure about what RR actually cares about. Outside of him wanting to keep Zorian and Zach in check, his motivations and goals are open questions.
