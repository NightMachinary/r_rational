I assume since the soul-mark of the Branded getting copied onto multiple simulated souls is abnormal, all of the current time-traveleres except one will have to cease existing by the time this loop runs out of juice. So RR could be spending their time on researching how to come out as the surviving simulation --- and doesn't waste time attacking them for the same reason: it's near pointless in comparison to just hijacknig the only ticket out and letting them “die away” on their own.

  [..] It's also possible that even if Zach was given the better odds by the virtue of being the last member of a dying --- and powerful --- house, his victorious emergence from the time loop is still not guaranteed, and others can take the crown from him while the loop is still unbroken.
