Thanks for the criticism. Next time I'm dealing with a similar power I'll most likely pick one of those two options. As for robo-Armsmaster, can you tell me what made you think I ran with this characterization? I've tried to portray him as terse, someone who doesn't waste his time, but is aware of this and isn't a bad person or anything. You could call him rude I guess, but I think that's the greatest similarity I've allowed in the fic.
