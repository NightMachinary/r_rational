Gotta say, I am a bit disappointed with how fast things have moved. I love Mistborn and one of the more compelling aspects of both Vin and Taylor's stories is watching them slowly gain knowledge in how to leverage their powersets, coming up with ways to beat more powerful opponents with strategy. I wanted to see Taylor interact with more heroes/villains having access only to a few metals, then slowly expand her repoitoire, as much in the tricks and interactions she figures out as in actual new powers. Then branching into Feruchemy and EVENTUALLY, at a climactic moment, discovering compounding and breaking the scale.

She's been in few enough combat situations that I can count them on one hand and she's already (basically) at Lord Ruler levels. I don't see much more room for (or need for) inventiveness anymore; she's not going to waste time steelpushing Kid Win's gear, for example, or getting involved in an emotional battle with Glory Girl, or testing the interplay between Bendalloy and other temporal powers.

There are still places for the story to go, don't get me wrong, bur there's a bunch of cool, compelling stuff that got skipped over and in my opinion, would be weird to delve into now, after Taylor can regenerate from near-death instantaneously, move faster than the speed of sound, and throw cars into the sun. And she has atium too!
