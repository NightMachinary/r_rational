Encouragement and discouragement are totally things. I am considering releasing a story that I have been working on but I'm concerned about discouraging feedback. I wonder if there's anything one can do about that.

Real though, you got almost 100 likes on your last chapter. Clearly there's a large chunk of people who enjoy it. I think a part of the problem is incentive structures regarding feedback. If you like something you'll just throw a like and no have much critique, and if you dislike it the chance of lording it over someone else is compelling.
