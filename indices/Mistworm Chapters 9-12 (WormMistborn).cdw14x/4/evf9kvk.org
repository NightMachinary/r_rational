How are things comming along? I don't hope that you were motivated by my last post here. I was just pointing out that you'd have to look for OTHER challenges than the regular cape on cape. Amelia was a fanfic that did a decent job at finding challenges for protagonists with high tier power sets and I personally love fics with MCs that tries to change bigger societal structures.

Edit: I don't know too much about the mistborn series but someone mentioned that you could create mistborns? If so an interesting challenge could come out of Taylor trusting the wrong person and giving them powers/information that would let them challenge her.
