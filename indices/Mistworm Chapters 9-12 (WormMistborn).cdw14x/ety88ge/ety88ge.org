Just read the first two chapters. This is bad. Really bad, even by the low standards of Worm alt power fanfic (I say this having written eminently forgettable alt power fics like Logos myself).

EDIT: Ah, I see you're the author. No offense intended. If you're open to feedback, I'll write up some in-depth feedback when I get home.

EDIT 2: I'll take it from the downvotes that the answer's no. Good luck with it, mate.
