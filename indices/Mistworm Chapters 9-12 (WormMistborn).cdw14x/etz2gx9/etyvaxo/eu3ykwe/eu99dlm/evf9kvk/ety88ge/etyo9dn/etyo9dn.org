Hmm? I'm not the one who downvoted you, mate, I went to sleep immediately after posting the latest chapter, but you're certainly at positive votes now. Earlier feedback informed me that the first three or so chapters are pretty low quality but the story gets better after. Make of that what you will. I always accept feedback, which is why I'm posting on SpaceBattles and SufficientVelocity in the first place. And I do agree that Punctuated Equilibrium is ... well, awful, but I don't think that even the first few chapters of this story are anywhere near that bad.
