I'm just going to throw out that you just made Taylor the most powerful cape in the universe, possibly baring Contessa, and that it's going to be really hard to get challenges. So if you want for it to be anything other than a powertrip you gotta find other ways of creating tension. And if you want the story to be rational you have to assume that Scion have a stronger power, otherwise the entities wouldn't jeapardize their existence by giving her this strong a power, which is going to be a significant power up from canon.
