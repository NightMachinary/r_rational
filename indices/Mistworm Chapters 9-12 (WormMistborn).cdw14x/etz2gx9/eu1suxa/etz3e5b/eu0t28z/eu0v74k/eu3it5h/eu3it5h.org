  /I hope it's not too much to ask, but can we get a list of abilities that Scion didn't show in canon? It's mainly for a future fight in one of my D.C. crossover fics. Like force-fields, teleporting, other offensive attacks etc?/

  Don't mean to sound harsh or anything in any way shape or form, but that is a lot to ask - it demands a pretty comprehensive answer and a lot of tedious fact checking/digging, it's not a fun question to answer (like some of the ones I've answered in this thread), and it it just opens me up to a lot of unfun "But Wildbow you're wrong/then why didn't he/except!" responses where people just jump on me.

  Scion equipped himself to be able to fight pretty much any threat. His big weapon is a very versatile 'stilling' ability, which lets him cancel out wavelengths, which can be applied in a variety of ways, defensive or offensive - it lets him counteract, manipulate, and cancel virtually any parahuman or human generated effect. He can cancel out heat, eliminate sound, break Grey Boy's ability, disintegrate molecular bonds, etc. He can do so with beams, thrown orbs/bullets, a light he emanates, and a personal forcefield, among a variety of other mechanisms.

  He maintains a toolkit of a handful of other powers to be able to fly, thinker abilities to understand complex ideas/languages, the precog ability that costs him a lot of lifespan to use, and a bunch of other stuff I can't be arsed to name, as I said above.

Scion only has access to a few powers such as Stilling, PtV, flight, and others. He doesn't have access to all his powers, otherwise WB would have said he has access to all the powers of natural triggers in Worm.
