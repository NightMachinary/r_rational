Just a small suggestion, the new metals and the powers associated with them are hard to keep track of. Steel and gold are well entrenched, cadmium and bronze's feruchemical uses are getting there, but the rapid-fire testing of the last chapter is a bit overwhelming. You may have already planned something similar, but spending a couple of chapters where one or two new metals are the primary focus would help with that. This coming from someone who has read both Mistborn trilogies.

Other than that, an enjoyable read.
