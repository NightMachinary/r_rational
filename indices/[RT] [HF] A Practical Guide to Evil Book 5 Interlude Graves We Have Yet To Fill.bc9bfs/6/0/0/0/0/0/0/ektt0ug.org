My problem is that Abigail basically thinks "I'll ask for knights, no way she'll give them to me" despite them being the perfect counter to the particular enemy she's facing, and Hellhound wasn't surprised by the small amount she requested, if I recall correctly. It adds a sense of "haha, she bumbled into looking like a strategic genius, isn't that funny?" but... meh.
