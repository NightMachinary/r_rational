I dunno. it sure seems like the hellhound wasn't surprised at all about the tactical choice, only about the low amounts of knights she had requested. Why do you think everyone on this side of the cavalry charge should be so surprised? because Abigail's Tribune is so awed? That seems a rather small sample size to me, and as an orc, he wouldn't have that much knowledge about anti-mage cavalry, necessarily... or, well, he might just be a little bit enthusiastic about his boss. What am I missing?
