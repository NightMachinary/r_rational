  Not sure I get how the cavalry rode through the spirits? Aren't they formed of snow and earth?

My own interpretation was that the creatures were made out of real materials held in the shape of some creature or other via magic. The knights warded armor disrupted the spells maintaining the spirits bodies, turning them back into regular clumps of snow and dirt.

  Or is this just the first time anti magic armor has been used against bound spirits?

Yeah, I think this is the case. It's quite possible that Callowan knights have never before been on the opposite side of a battlefield from a Levantine binder, given that they're both Good nations with no shared borders.
