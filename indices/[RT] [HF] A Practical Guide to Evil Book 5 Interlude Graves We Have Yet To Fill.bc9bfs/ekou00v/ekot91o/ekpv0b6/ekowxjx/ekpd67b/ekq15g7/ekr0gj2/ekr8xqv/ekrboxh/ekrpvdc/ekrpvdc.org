It seems sensible enough to me - these are callowan knights after all, they are the military elites sharpened by centuries of charging into the worst, craziest magic the praesi throw around on the battlefield.

I don't think anyone on the side of callow was all that surprised by this, while Abilgail's internal decision-making is somewhat warped, it is a reasonable base idea - enemy employing weird indestructible sorcery, throw the knights at it, just like callowans have dealt with that shit for centuries. I think her surprise was that she actually did *get* the troops she asked for, as her approach was to request a strategic asset, for tactically sound reasons, assuming she'd be denied because of seniority/lack of trust. That way she'd have her ass covered but would still fail.
