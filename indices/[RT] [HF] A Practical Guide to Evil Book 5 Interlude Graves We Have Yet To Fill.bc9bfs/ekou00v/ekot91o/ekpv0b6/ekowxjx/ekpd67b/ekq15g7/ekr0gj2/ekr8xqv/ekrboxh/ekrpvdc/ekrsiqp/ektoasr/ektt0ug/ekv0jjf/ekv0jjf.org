I got the sense that Abby wanted to look like she tried, which meant going by the book (i. e. requesting knights in response to weird magical shit going on) and then just kind of awkwardly sitting around with a thousand horsemen 'cause there would be no opening to actually deploy them without getting bogged down in the enemy ranks.

Then Tanja ordered the binders to leave those ranks to keep disarming traps and sent only a force of two thousand infantry to cover them - a force that the cavalry could actually disengage from. After that it was a matter of an excuse to send out the knights, which Robber gleefully provided.
