  Sidequest: Does Giovanni from Pokemon: The Origin of Species appear to qualify for the said role?
#+end_quote

I don't... /think/ so.

Firstly, he hasn't lost yet. Last we saw, Mewtwo was plotting, basically, to betray him, but we haven't seen what counters Giovanni has in place for such an event. Counters which are likely several layers deep; between how smart he's supposed to be and the danger a hostile Mewtwo poses, I honestly expect Mewtwo's first genuine escape attempt to fail in some significant way.

As for whether he's a villain... well, I see a lot of parallels between the Mewtwo Project (I don't remember what it's called in-story) and the rl!Manhattan Project.

- Both worked on the cutting edge of known science (nuclear physics, psychics and genetic engineering).

- Both are arguably working towards a degree of salvation for humanity (Stop WW2/get the bomb before the Axis, remove the threat of Legendaries).

- Both have terrifying possible consequences for failure (Axis gets the bomb first and uses it, deaths and infrastructure damage continue unabated).

- Both have terrifying possible consequences for success, /which might be even worse than failing/ (basically the Fallout series, homicidal Mewtwo).

Giovanni's goal (or what I assume his goal is) seems pretty noble on the surface: remove hostile Legendaries as threats to humanity. We haven't really seen that much of what it took to get that project to its current stage, but from what little we do know, I expect the pile of sins to grow steadily larger.

tl;dr: Maybe? Too early to say, really.
