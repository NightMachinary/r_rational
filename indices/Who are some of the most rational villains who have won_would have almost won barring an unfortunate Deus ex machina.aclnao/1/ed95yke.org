Sauron is perhaps not very rational, but he canonically won, in that Frodo decided not to cast the Ring into Mount Doom, but instead succumbed to its power; this would inevitably cause him to become a servant of Sauron. As safeguards go, "the superweapon containing all my power inevitably corrupts its non-me bearers into becoming my servants" seems pretty good. It was only Gollum's suicide charge to get the Ring, during which he accidentally stumbled and fell into the lava, that defeated Sauron.
