What about Ozymandias, aka Adrian Veidt, from Watchmen? He wins, he's smart and acts for the sake of a greater good while committing decidedly villainous acts, and is only (maybe) thwarted by a completely random event. His plan is perhaps not perfect, in fact it makes slightly more sense in the movie version, but all in all I'd say he fits the bill.
