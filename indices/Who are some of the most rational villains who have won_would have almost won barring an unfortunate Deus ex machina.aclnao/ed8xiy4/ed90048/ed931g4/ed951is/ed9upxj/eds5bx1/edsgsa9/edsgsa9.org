It doesn't have to end democracy. Politicians could be replaced by pseudonymous masked personas. Also if you are going to do something like that you might as well do it from the start. If you make major anti-capital punishment politicians kill themselves while screaming that "God demands capital punishment" or something then you don't have to kill as many people personally and it is much harder for investigators to find out your limitations.
