Depends on what his hypothetical goals are. I agree that canon Light didn't act rationally, but I think what you're suggesting is too much of a goal-shift. He wants to punish people he sees as evildoers, and I think one stated reason he wants to do this is to deter people from committing such crimes. If no one knows there's any sort of pattern at all, then the "deterrent" aspect doesn't work.

Edit: I'm seeing in that link on [[https://gwern.net][gwern.net]] from another comment the suggestion that Light could make it seem like the deaths are happening as a natural course of the crimes; e.g. have them all be executions or something. I'm swayed, but unconvinced. I'm having a hard time imagining him killing enough people to make it a solid deterrent without anybody noticing some kind of anomalous effect, e.g. that controls execution procedures and makes them speed up somehow. Something like that would still alert people that some strangeness is going on -- that's the point, after all. Buuut, if he did that, it would at least seem likely to sidetrack L's investigation into folks with political power to determine execution procedures/schedules, though, before focusing L on potential generalized vigilante forces. I'd be curious to see this written up as a fanfic if anybody wanted to try their hand!

Fully rational Light would need to find the best line to ride, such that people are still scared to commit murders, lest they suffer the consequences -- but he needs to hold back a /lot/ more, be a lot more reticent to kill, be much more careful about his pattern, and provide L far less information than he did.

I often wonder how differently it would have gone with just one change; if he had simply /not killed Lind L. Tailor./
