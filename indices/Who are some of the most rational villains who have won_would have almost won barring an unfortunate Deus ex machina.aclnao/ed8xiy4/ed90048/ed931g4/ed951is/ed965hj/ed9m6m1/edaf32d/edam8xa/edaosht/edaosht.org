  L might as well have required a court of law to trial him which would never work. Imagine being the lawyer who gets to defend Kira.
#+end_quote

That was my point. If L had been less principled, he'd have decided that Light was Kira (he was pretty sure about that) but there was no way to have him put under trial by a normal court. Hence, he would have just killed Light, the end. The problem is someone who both had the means and the resolve /had/ found out his identity. Light got only saved by L wanting to do things by the book. Had it been someone like Mello instead of L, well, Light would have been a goner.

  What liberty is lost that isn't lost by the Bible existing?
#+end_quote

Come on, /seriously/? There is no empirical evidence that if I disobey the Bible's commandments I incur in any kind of measurable punishment. But Kira kills the fuck out of you if you step out of line. In the second part, it's even hinted that Kira plans to eventually move to kill not just criminals, but the members of society he deems "unproductive". Mikami mentions that, and Light thinks "it's too soon for that". Meaning he /did/ plan on doing it eventually. That's a very concrete loss of liberty right there.

Besides that, it's a loss of the guarantees a proper justice system is supposed to offer. Proportionality of punishment to offence, a fair trial. You get death for anything that Kira judges to be worthy of it, /if/ Kira judges you culpable. Kira may or may not be under extreme stress and pressed by other concerns while passing judgement and may or may not delegate the killings to his air-headed top model/idol girlfriend whose only moral compass is that she wants to please him. Who the hell would trust a system like that?

  Also most of the world supported him so antagonised is a stetch.

He made both friends and enemies. The latter ended up winning and killing him. Sure, he /could/ have gotten lucky, but ultimately, most of what he did was digging his own grave.
