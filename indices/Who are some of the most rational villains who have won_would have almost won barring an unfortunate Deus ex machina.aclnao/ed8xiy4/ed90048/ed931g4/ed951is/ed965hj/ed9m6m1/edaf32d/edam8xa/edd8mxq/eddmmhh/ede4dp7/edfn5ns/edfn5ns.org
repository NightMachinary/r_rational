I agree with you but the general public doesn't. That's the point. Kira will be supported and was by the vast majority of people, especially since the crime rate apparently went down dramatically.

The death penalty might not but the revelation of a supernatural force murdering people either an alien or God will.

That's before you get to the fact that other cultures don't have as big a care about the process as the west and that Kira was global.
