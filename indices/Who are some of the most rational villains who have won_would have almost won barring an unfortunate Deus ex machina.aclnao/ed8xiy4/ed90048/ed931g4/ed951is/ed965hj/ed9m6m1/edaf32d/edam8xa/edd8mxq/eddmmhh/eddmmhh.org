  You mean the one who outright tells Light he's doing this for fun and is going to kill him pretty soon after Light gets the notebook?
#+end_quote

'soon', and yes, I mean exactly that line. Why Light never asked what was fun for him seems insane to me, you should keep track to make sure he was never bored.

  Light was going on a power trip, everything else was an excuse. It's not so much that he wasn't rational, but that his goals weren't what he says. If you read it as if his goals are what he says he seems irrational, but if you realize he was just trying to show off and feel powerful it makes sense.

I agree 100% with this. Kira is highly motivated by how his actions appear and it's not irrational to say that you have a higher utility when you become world famous vs staying safe and secret like everyone else suggests.

Even looking bad I don't think that Kira would say, oh I wish I hadn't caused the cult of Kira, rather he'd want to continue that.

  that there are a lot of people who will disagree with vigilante justice, and if you want a reason why then look at the rates of false convictions.

Have you been on the thread about the priest who got killed by the hitmen of the parent of the kid he molested. A tiny proportion of people are against vigilante justice. That's why the death penalty has so much support even when it's clearly insane.
