The death note can be used to kill people in very specific ways up to their death. Something that's never tried is using this to /extend/ life - I will live to a world record old age, /then/ die of a heart attack.

Someone could have written in the book that they would find and kill kira, and he would be dead for 6 hours, then they would die (in a manner other than a heart attack, because that's the default if the death instructions don't work).
