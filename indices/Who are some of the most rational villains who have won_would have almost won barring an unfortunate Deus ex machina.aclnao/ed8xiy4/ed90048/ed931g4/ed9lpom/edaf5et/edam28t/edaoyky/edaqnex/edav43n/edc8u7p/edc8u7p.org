I agree with everything you said.

Kira should have realised that he cares more about being worshipped than morality but regardless of his perspective of his own motives I think that murdering criminals is a pretty good method for becoming the next Jesus. Considering the limitations of your book anyway, other methods would be destroying capitalism by murdering the wealthy and having them distribute their wealth or something. What else could you do with the death note?

I guess the first thing to do is have Bill Gates set up a census of the planet, make a bank that has an account for everyone on the planet, and make them all have their name. Then have a backdoor into this list of people or make it public. That at least will be useful to avoid murdering the wrong person.

I don't know how the heavenly kingdom guy did it but I'd look to that for advice.
