Agree on axioms. About emotion, depends on what you mean - if emotion affects my best judgement on how to achieve certain goals, then it's contributing to my irrationality.

It all boils down to what we consider Light's "goals". We can consider being worshipped as a God as a goal in itself, then you're right. But as a means to an end (namely, making the world a more just place, which was his stated goal) it's very irrational. Light was the kind of person who simply /wanted/ to be worshipped, he got off on adoration and power, and justice was really just a pretence, an excuse he used to justify his own ambition.
