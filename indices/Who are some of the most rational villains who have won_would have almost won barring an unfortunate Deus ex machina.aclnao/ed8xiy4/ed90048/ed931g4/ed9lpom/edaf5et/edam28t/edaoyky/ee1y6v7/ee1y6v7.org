Slightly unrelated, but emotions definitely hone and define 'rationality'. I remember reading about an experiment many years back where scientists managed to suppress the emotions of several test subjects, leaving behind only their 'rationality', except without emotions, the test subjects just started doing things like organizing objects by taste or color regardless of practicality.
