That ward doesn't stop, for example, a spell that freezes the air directly around Eragon in place. Plus, it depends on Eragon's interpretation of "spell" and "permission". It must be at least partially permissive, or it would try to nullify all magic in his presence, costing more energy that he had and killing him. So Eragon's interpretation of "spell" and "permission" must by necessity not be maximally permissive, so Galbatorix could get around that specific ward by choosing an attack vector that Eragon wouldn't perceive as a "spell", or just barely qualified as being "permitted" by Eragon. Similarly, Galbatorix likely had his own, similar wards, but for whatever reason, the draconic spell bypassed them. Or hell-- maybe his wards blocked the spell, but then he had a failsafe ward that disabled his wards if they would cause him to expend too much energy at once, because a smart opponent could try to create a spell that simply cost more to block than to cast, and make it an endurance contest. Wards in IC necessarily can't be perfect because it's always a tradeoff between energy use and covering loopholes.
