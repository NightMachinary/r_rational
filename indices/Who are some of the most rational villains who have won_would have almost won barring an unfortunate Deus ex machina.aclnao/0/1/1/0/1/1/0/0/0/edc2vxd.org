  The canonical example is, for instance, if you cast a spell which says "transmute this dirt to water," you might die because you can't tell the spell to stop if it's killing you, but "pour energy into this dirt attempting to transmute it into water" can be stopped by saying "stop pouring." By specifying a process rather than a goal, you can stop at any time.

I do remember that, and it makes sense as a major factor, but doesn't seem like an entirely sufficient explanation - if that was the only reason to be specific, people could still use vague spells for any effect they were /certain/ they had enough energy for, or use vague spells of the form '___ until I say otherwise' or 'try to ___', or any number of similar tactics.
