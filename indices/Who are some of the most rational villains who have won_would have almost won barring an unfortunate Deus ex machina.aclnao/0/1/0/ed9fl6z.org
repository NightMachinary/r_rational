It's established that dragons can do wordless magic with conceptual bullshit, but it's still a "legendary" event that only happens once or twice in history. It's not the dragons being able to cast the spell through the metamagic that's a deus ex machina, but the dragons casting the spell at all.

From Galbatorix's perspective, the hero finding a cache of dragon souls hidden through a last ditch long con due to some prophecy and so is able to cast the one spell your 100 year metamagic working can't block is a lot of stars that needed to align.
