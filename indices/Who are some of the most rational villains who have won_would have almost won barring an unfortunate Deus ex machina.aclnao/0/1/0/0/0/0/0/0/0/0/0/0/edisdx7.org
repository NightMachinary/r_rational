[[https://inheritance.fandom.com/wiki/Orrin][King Orrin]] did experiments in a lab. He created a vacuum (and complained that this apparently proved an elf (whose name I've forgotten) right). He wasn't a spell caster.

If there was an impact in the series, I'd say magic 1) gives spellcasters a way to estimate the energy cost of a task - raising the dead, seeing the future, etc. (What spells /will/ kill you, and all your friends, from the cost to cast is known.) and 2) gives people a reason to be superstitious. (Not to mention 3) being aware of existential threats - the creation of the ancient language was the solution to a problem, which had almost destroyed the world/wiped out life.)
