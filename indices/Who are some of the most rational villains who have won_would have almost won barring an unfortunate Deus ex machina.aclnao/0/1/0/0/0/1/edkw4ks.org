  (And the Sanderson model of arbitrary power systems is 2 dimensional and pointless.)

  Frankly, magic in stories seems to come off best when it's not systematized and instead is dreamy and twined intrinsically with the narrative

I disagree so strongly that I can't think of terms strong enough to convey it. I understand that your preferences will by definition be highly subjective, but it really feels like you're just saying "I enjoy soft magic therefore all hard magic is bad and pointless," which is needlessly smug and dismissive.

I think your opinion on this is colored too much by your impression of what "magic" should be, while I believe a more helpful way to look at it is just as a catchall term for any system in a fictional work that violates our physical laws as we know them. To give an example using physics, it's like you think of gravity when you hear "physics," and thus immediately dismiss anyone who uses the term "physics" to refer to inertia; it's not that inertia is pointless, but rather that it's a different thing from gravity, and conflating the two doesn't help the discussion.
