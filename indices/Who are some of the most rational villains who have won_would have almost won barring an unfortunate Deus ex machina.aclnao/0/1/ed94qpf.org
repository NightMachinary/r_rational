  wishy-washy conceptual magic bullshit and make him feel so sad he commits suicide - despite magic (supposed to) be impossible.

Common mistake. Him having the name of the ancient language made it impossible for people to use the ancient language to cast magic. Normally this means that it's effectively impossible to cast magic because of the extreme danger of using wordless magic, but the one group routinely shown to cast wordless magic safely are the dragons. Plus, this exact thing us foreshadowed with their previous act of large scale magic-- the dragons didn't directly kill the forsworn, instead, they made it so that the forsworn would commit suicide.

Galbatorix was, indeed, a fairly rational antagonist. But he was playing a game with incomplete information, and lost because of that.
