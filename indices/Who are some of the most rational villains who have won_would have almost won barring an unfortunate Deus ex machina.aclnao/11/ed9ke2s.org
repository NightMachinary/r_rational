Robert Shaw in From Russia with Love. Not only has multiple chances to kill Bond, but actually has to keep him alive surreptitiously until he's out of the country with the Lecter decoder machine. Is defeated when the train they're on goes through a tunnel with him just a few feet from Bond, holding him at pistol point.
