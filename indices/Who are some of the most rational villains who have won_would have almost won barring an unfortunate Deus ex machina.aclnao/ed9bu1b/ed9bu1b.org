Grand Admiral Thrawn. He was right on the brink of winning a large military campaign, but his bodyguard killed him because the bodyguard found out that the Empire intentionally wasn't healing his planet in order to keep his species subservient. The military campaign then collapsed without his genius to guide it.

I'm not sure how much of a deus ex machina that was, though, since it's been a very long time since I've read the trilogy. At the very least, it's something Thrawn had no possible way of seeing coming.
