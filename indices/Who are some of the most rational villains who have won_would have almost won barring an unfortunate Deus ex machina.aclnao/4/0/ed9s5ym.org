EDIT: expanded out a bit at [[https://www.gwern.net/Notes#the-tragedy-of-grand-admiral-thrawn]]

It's a /little/ bit of a deus ex machina, but as they go, I think it's very acceptable because all the mechanics are laid in place well in advance in [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Thrawn_Trilogy][/The Thrawn Trilogy/]], and the assassination itself serves a major literary purpose of demonstrating [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mitth%27raw%27nuruodo][Thrawn's]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartia][fatal flaw]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris][hubris]] leading him to a tragically bad end.

For years I was vaguely puzzled by the ending: sure, it made logical sense that the Noghri would retaliate by killing him, didn't violate any rules or worldbuilding or anything, but it felt unmotivated and lacking in literary purposes - why did Timothy Zahn choose that particular way of dealing with Thrawn when /Star Wars/ villains have often been dealt with in so much less final ways? After reading a boring Greek tragedy, [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Command][/The Last Command/]] finally clicked for me.

So first, the timing of the assassination is not implausible: the bodyguard can pick and choose the time, and since they can't expect to escape alive, they'll want to maximize the damage - major combat was common for Thrawn, his bodyguard would know this perfectly well, and also know that killing him in the middle of a battle based on having access to Thrawn's strategic genius would maximize the damage.

Second, the betrayal is also plausible, because Leia had at this point spent like an entire book or two on the [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Noghri/Legends][Noghri]] home planet, uncovering the deception, so it's been thoroughly established for the reader that 'the Noghri clans know how they have been deceived and enslaved for generations and that their gratitude/worship of Darth Vader (and then Thrawn) as a hero is the cruelest of lies'; the reader expects them to be... not happy about this.

Third, that Thrawn /wasn't/ expecting it is what makes it so ironic and dramatically satisfying: his last line is "But... it was so artistically done." Some people read this as referring to the battle or perhaps Thrawn's long-term plans or even the assassination itself (being stabbed in the back is 'so artistically done'?), but I've always read it as obviously referring to Vader's deception of the Noghri where the environmental cleanup robots etc were actually keeping the planet poisoned & destroyed; he understands the only reason [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rukh/Legends][Rukh]] would ever assassinate him is that the deception has failed and the Noghri found out, and he is disappointed that the so elegant and artistic scheme has collapsed.

Now, the /reader/ might reasonably say 'hey, maybe you shouldn't rely for bodyguards on a race of murder-ninja-lizards who you are tricking into generational servitude by a vast scheme of planetary destruction masquerading as a charity and who might find out at some point and not be happy, and find someone else to be your bodyguards?', but the reader is of course not a twisted strategic genius who delights in deception & trickery & exploiting the psychology of his enemies (remember the [[https://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/node/id/504][definition]]: "thrawn (adj). twisted; crooked") and enjoys keeping 'his friends close but his enemies closer', so to speak. This delight is Thrawn's fatal flaw, which leads him into the hubris of taking such an extreme risk which will explode in his face, and the lack of necessity is precisely what makes it tragic; and a good tragedy always ends in death. Unlike a more standard tragedy where our protagonist is a good guy, Thrawn is an irredeemable bad guy, so while he realizes his proximate mistake ('what a pity that the deception failed... even though it was so artistically done'), he doesn't get any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagnorisis][anagnorisis]] of his own flawed 'thrawn' nature being his fatal flaw like a hero would (ie he doesn't reflect 'well, that was really dumb & evil of me; I didn't need Noghri bodyguards /that/ much to justify ticking time bombs or poisoning their world').

And the fact that the assassination happens during a critical battle, which might have paved the way to victory, aside from being rational in-universe, only increases the tragic element: he was undone by his fatal flaw at the height of his powers and success.
