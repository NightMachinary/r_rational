I don't find that a very acceptable resolution because it makes Rukh appear arbitrary.

'Oh, he just got stabbed in the back for some reason, isn't that an amusing lampshading of a trope - his betrayal is /literally/ backstabbing, geddit!' It lacks any kind of global significance which ties everything together in a thematically-meaningful way as suits the final chapter of the Imperials in the final book of the trilogy.

Whereas if it's the culmination of his character flaw of loving lifelong scheming even to the point of unnecessity backfiring on him in a dramatically ironic fashion, then it accomplishes all that. A bad writer might simply have Thrawn be backstabbed by a random mook; a good writer gives the mook a reason and backstory and motivation which makes it a commentary on why Thrawn is evil & loses.
