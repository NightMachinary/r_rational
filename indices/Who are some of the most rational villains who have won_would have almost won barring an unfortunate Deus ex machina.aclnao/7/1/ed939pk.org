This was my reaction the first time I watched the show, but I don't really think this is the case.

The ending feels wrong, because it seems like Near wins, when Near didn't really "earn" that win. Near only won because Mello did something completely reckless and self-destructive (what many people would consider to be irrational). If Mello were not part of the picture and completely blind-sided both of them, Light would have won.

But the fact that Mello was still in the picture at that point was Light's fault: there was an entire arc that pitted the investigation team (led by Light) against Mello and his mafia goons. Light's investigation team failed to apprehend Mello. If Light had apprehended Mello when he had the chance, Mello would not have pulled the stunt that caused him to flinch at the last minute, and he would have beat Near in a fair fight. For the fact that Mello was still around to cause, Light has only himself to blame.

You might argue that Light /could/ have beat Mello, because in the end, his father Soichiro Yagami had a death note and knew Mello's name, and /if Soichiro Yagami would just write his name down and kill the bastard/, Mello would be out of the picture. In this moment, it seems like the elder Yagami is to blame, because Light set up everything perfectly for his father to kill Mello, and his father failed to follow through. "All he needed to do was kill our enemy!" shouts Light in frustration as the light fades from his father's eyes. "How could my father be such an idiot?"

However, the fact that Light's father couldn't bring himself on his deathbed to kill Mello is consistent with his character. Sure, Soichiro Yagami's inability to kill Mello in the final moments is frustrating, but is it really /surprising/? If Light's plan hinged on his father's ability to use the death note to kill, then he is guilty of typical minding: Light has no problem with killing people to achieve his ends, so he assumes (or hopes) that when his father is faced with the simple task of killing Mello, he'll be able to do the same. However, Soichiro Yagami is not his son. He clearly demonstrated this to Light (and the audience) when he willingly took the deal for the Shinigami eyes, forfeiting half his own remaining lifespan. This is something I pointed out in a recent [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egQ9o2VSHNw][video essay about Death Note and its magic systems]]: Light is willing to kill, but not willing to forfeit half his remaining lifespan. His father inverts this, by willingly sacrificing half his own remaining lifespan, but finding himself unable to kill in the final moments.

Light might complain that he's surrounded by idiots, but if your plan involves relying in said "idiots" to behave out of character, do you really have a right to complain when they let you down? It doesn't feel "fair" that Near wins even though Near didn't really outplay Light. But the fact that Light lost despite his ability to beat Near in a fair fight is the entire /point/ of Death Note's second half: Near and Mello together are able to accomplish what L couldn't do alone. Light had a chance to deal with Mello early on, and failed. Then, he lost because of interference from Mello. Whose fault is that?

Yes, the chain of events by which Mello's interference causes Light to lose feels poorly conceived and hackneyed and unfulfilling, but Light would have never had to deal with this curve ball if Light had dealt with Mello the first time the two of them squared off. Watching the series the first time, my impression was that Mello beat Light once, but then Light came back and beat Mello the second time the two of them squared off, and so it felt weird when Light lost. But the first time that Light allowed Mello to escape, he had already lost: his "victory" against Mello is ultimately hollow, because it ends with Mello dying, but in "beating" Mello the second time, Light's side flinches, and that's enough for Near to ultimately unravel his web.

Also, as an aside, there's the whole thing where Light meets with one of his disciples (Kiyomi Takada) and they communicate "covertly" by writing each other notes on pads of paper that were provided for the meeting and then destroying the notes. This is an ill-conceived plan from the beginning, as it should be pretty easy to count the number of sheets of paper in the room before and after the meeting to determine whether any paper was used or destroyed. Aizawa uses a more direct method to catch Light (he marks one of the sheets of paper, and finds the marked sheet missing), but Light's entire plan for communicating with Takada did not come across as the scheme of some brilliant mastermind.
