Gotta disagree. Light was certainly far from rational, but the leaps of logic that were made to even realize Kira existed to begin with were completely implausible. In real life, unless you did something to deliberately reveal the deaths as supernatural, there's no way that anyone could credibly realize it was the work of a person (and be taken seriously).
