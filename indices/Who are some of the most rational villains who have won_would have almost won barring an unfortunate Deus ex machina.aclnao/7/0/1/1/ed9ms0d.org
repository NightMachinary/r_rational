I don't know: the pattern Light made of criminals dying every hour on the hour of a heart attack is pretty supernatural. I mean, what natural explanation could there be of that? Even assassins putting heart attack poison in food wouldn't be able to time the death to the /minute/.

I feel people always seem to overestimate the amount of evidence that would be needed for a credible claim of the supernatural: IMO the amount of evidence is extremely tiny, which is all the more evidence that there's no supernatural forces at work IRL.
