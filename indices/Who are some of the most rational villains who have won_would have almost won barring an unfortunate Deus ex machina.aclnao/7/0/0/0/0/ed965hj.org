  I often wonder how differently it would have gone with just one change; if he had simply not killed Lind L. Tailor.

This is definitely a turning point. It also shows that his morals are very easily bent, since he goes on to kill innocents at the drop of a hat, as soon as he thinks they oppose him.

On the other hand, one could argue if your problem is, more in abstract, 'justice' and quality of life for common people (something he often brings up), then killing criminals just isn't the way to achieve that anyway. There are far bigger threats, and improving the world in other ways would probably /also/ result in less crime. Of course a person with a strict deontological ethic simply /wouldn't use the Note/ no matter what, but if you came at it from a Utilitarian perspective there definitely would be cases where it makes sense to use it. Just not as much, as frequently and as blatantly as Light did.
