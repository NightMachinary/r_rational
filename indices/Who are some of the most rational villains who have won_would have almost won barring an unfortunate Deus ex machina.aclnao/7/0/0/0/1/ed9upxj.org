  Depends on what his hypothetical goals are. I agree that canon Light didn't act rationally, but I think what you're suggesting is too much of a goal-shift. He wants to punish people he sees as evildoers, and I think one stated reason he wants to do this is to deter people from committing such crimes. If no one knows there's any sort of pattern at all, then the "deterrent" aspect doesn't work.

The problem is that his strategy doesn't work for that. He is dependent on the justice system and news to identify targets. If he creates an obvious pattern then people will also notice that he only targets the convicted and then only the convicted that appear in the news.

Since he only targets the convicted then he won't be much more of a deterrent than the existing justice system and eventually people will learn to stop reporting the identities of convicted criminals.
