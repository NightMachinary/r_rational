And the Fellowship should have flown in on Eagles and dumped the Ring from the air. That aside, how infinite is Sauron's army? He's already guarding the mostly-impassable mountain range surrounding Mordor, adding heavily-garrisoned walls to the few passes, and putting the giant spider, what'shername, in the tunnel. At some point you have to say "this weakness is adequately guarded, time to put some of my army into attacking". As for the Nazgul there are only nine of them and presumably they have high-priority tasks like terrorising the Shire, corrupting the southern marches, and preventing Gondor from calling for aid, to be about.
