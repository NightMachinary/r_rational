Lex Luthor in [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheMetropolitanMan][The Metropolitan Man]]. I won't spoil the ending with whether he wins or almost wins, but I think it's worth checking out.

It's the best insight and explanation I've ever seen regarding Lex's personal hatred of Superman and explains his obsession in a pretty rational way.
