Vague spells can kill you really easily. The canonical example is, for instance, if you cast a spell which says "transmute this dirt to water," you might die because you can't tell the spell to stop if it's killing you, but "pour energy into this dirt attempting to transmute it into water" can be stopped by saying "stop pouring." By specifying a process rather than a goal, you can stop at any time.

So a spell which just says "can't touch dis" will work fantastically, but you'll die the moment someone exerts more force than you can directly counter. A ward, however, which says, "push all physical attacks aside until I say otherwise" will exert just enough force to make sure everything misses without directly countering force for force.
