Come to think of it, it seems pretty plausible that the Ancient Language words that get translated as 'spell' or 'magic' just don't include wordless magic.

Also, although we're never told this outright IIRC, the whole setting makes more sense if more vague/general spells are significantly less efficient, or have some other major disadvantage. So a ward general enough to prevent really weird forms of attack which the caster never specifically considered might still not be very /good/ at doing so, even if the caster is extremely powerful.

(It's been a very long time since I read those books, so there may be mistakes here)
