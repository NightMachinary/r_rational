Judging by the fact that sapphira alone had already done metamagic twice (elda, rose crystal), it can't have been /that/ rare. Especially since it's mentioned that a number of Elduarni use dragon magic to kill /themselves/ rather than be enslaved. And it's not like there isn't precedent for the dragons using metamagic against galbatorix specifically. In fact, I'd wager that galbatorix had even taken precautions against dragon magic specifically, seeing as he was succesful in killling so many.

What makes the final use of magic so interesting was that it was a legitimately clever attack vector. They don't mind control galbatorix into killing himself. They don't even directly cause his guilt; they show him other people's suffering. Plus, there's actually precedent that also explains why galbatorix hadn't protected himself against that spell-- it's mentioned that while future seeing is flatly impossible, seeing the past is doable, assuming you're content with grainy images and killing spell circles of elven mages. So the only concievable people who could cast that spell would be a whole bunch of old dragons, which galbatorix had thought he'd gotten rid of.

The only part that could be called a deus ex machina would be the fact that the stash of dragon souls existed im the first place, but it had been foreshadowed ever since book one with solembum's advice (and it /would/ make sense for the dragon riders to pass their secret to the werecats, who weren't at war with galbatorix...), and at least from the literary perspective, again in book 2, where glaedr refuses to mate with saphari (which makes no sense from a preservation-of-the-species perspective, unless you realize the author intended to have a cache of dragon eggs all alone.)

I admit-- this is bullshit from galbatorix's perspective, but /any/ loss, from his perspectice, would be bullshit, because as a century old dragon rider with hundreds of dragon souls at his beck and call, the /only/ rational way to kill him would be with information assymetry.

It's my personal opinion that the way paolini handled galbatorix's final defeat was one of the best scenes in the books.
