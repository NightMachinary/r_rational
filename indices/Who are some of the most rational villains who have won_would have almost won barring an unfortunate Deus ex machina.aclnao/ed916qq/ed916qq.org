(Spoiler alert) Galbatorix from the Inheritance Cycle.

He killed (nearly) every single Rider and Dragon on the continent, which were the elite peacekeeping force. He stole the Heartstones of all the dead dragons, giving himself infinite mana. He established a reasonably stable empire as a buffer zone for himself.

He then threw his entire focus behind blocking access to magic to everyone on the continent without his permission, instead of spending time stamping down rebellions. This makes sense from a rational sense of striking at the root of the problem instead of playing catch up, although is very immoral and maybe stupid. The armies reconquering his land would cease to be a problem once his, and only his, mages can steamroll them, while also removing the ability for the elves to alpha strike him or resist his invasion of their lands.

The only reason he lost was Eragon talking to a bunch of dragon ghosts and them doing wishy-washy conceptual magic bullshit and make him feel so sad he commits suicide - despite magic (supposed to) be impossible.
