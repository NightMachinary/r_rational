  make him feel so sad

"sad" isn't the right word - torturing people isn't "making them sad". To put it mildly, he experienced the worst case of sensory/emotional overload in history. (He was basically Jesus (except it only applied to every thing after his birth).) If torturing someone is bad, and torturing them worse is worse, the spell used on him may be the most evil spell used on someone before.
