The thing is, the ring doesn't corrupt anyone into being Saurons servants. It just makes them think that they should be the ones with all the power, making them so ambitious that they make stupid mistakes (and also tends to make them go to Mordor which is exactly where Sauron wants the ring to end up).

I suppose that Gollum stumbling into the lava still constitutes a Deus ex Machina, but there is some poetic justice in the fact that the ring was destroyed because people were fighting over it because of it's corruption.
