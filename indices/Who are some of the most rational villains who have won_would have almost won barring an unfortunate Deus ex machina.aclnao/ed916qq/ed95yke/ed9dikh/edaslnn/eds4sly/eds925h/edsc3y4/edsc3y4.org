Sure. But widening the area to guard requires exponentially more troops.

He obviously commands legions. Surely it would take a few hundred, Maybe a thousand, to guard mount doom itself.

The natural terrain already makes it difficult for a large army to reach it. So the question is if a small group could sneak by his forces. If you have a single weakness, that leads to your absolute destruction, I would not gamble on my guards accurately stopping spies. There are always reasons to be passing through somewhere, or a spy sneaking over the mountains. But this area of no-mans-land has no reason to be there.

The Nazgul part is a bit extreme. But is sending 4 Riders to the Shire instead of 3 more important than defending his one weakness?

The quest succeeded because Mount Doom was completely unguarded. Sauron managed to reclaim power from nothing, despite being vanguished beforehand. Clearly his might was great. Time was on his side.
