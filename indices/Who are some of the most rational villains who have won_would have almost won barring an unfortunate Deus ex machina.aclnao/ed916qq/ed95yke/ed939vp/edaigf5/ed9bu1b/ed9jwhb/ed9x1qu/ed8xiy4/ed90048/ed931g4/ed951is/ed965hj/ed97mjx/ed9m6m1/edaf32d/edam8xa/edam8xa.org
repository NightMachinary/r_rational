I agree that he should have researched the motives of those gifting him the power.

I disagree that he was lucky, it requires ridiculous assumptions that I don't think would happen in reality even with death note fiction existing.

L might as well have required a court of law to trial him which would never work. Imagine being the lawyer who gets to defend Kira.

What liberty is lost that isn't lost by the Bible existing?

Also most of the world supported him so antagonisised is a stetch.

Literally if he never killed the fake L then few would complain about anything he was doing.
