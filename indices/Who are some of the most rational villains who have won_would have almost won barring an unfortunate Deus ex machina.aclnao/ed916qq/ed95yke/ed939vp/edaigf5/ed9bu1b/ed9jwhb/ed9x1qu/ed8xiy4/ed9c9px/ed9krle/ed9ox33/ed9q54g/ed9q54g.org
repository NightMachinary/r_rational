yea that book was the one that made me say fuck this and stopped reading the series, before that the main was basically a god but he was at least a likable dude for the most part, that book just made him so petty and the entire book was so hamfisted the communism parallel was not even a parallel it brought out the bat, took some barbed wire to it and hit you over the head with it over and over again felt like getting preached to in the most painful way possible.
