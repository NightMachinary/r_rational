I would call 'irrational' an objective that in itself mostly appeals to satisfying one's emotional cravings. There is no rationale for /wanting/ to be worshipped as a God except satisfying your own arrogance and desire for validation. There are no other advantages coming with it that you couldn't obtain with other means and without the huge disadvantages and risks. If you don't want to call it 'irrational', call it 'insane', because frankly I can't see how a mentally balanced person would consider that a good idea.
