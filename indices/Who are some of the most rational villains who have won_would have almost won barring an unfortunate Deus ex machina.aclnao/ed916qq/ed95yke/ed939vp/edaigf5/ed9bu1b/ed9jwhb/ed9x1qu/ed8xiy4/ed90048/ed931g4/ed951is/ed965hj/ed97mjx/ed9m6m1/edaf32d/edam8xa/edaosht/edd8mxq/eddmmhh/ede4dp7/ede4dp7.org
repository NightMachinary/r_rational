  Have you been on the thread about the priest who got killed by the hitmen of the parent of the kid he molested.

That's an edge case and you know it. [[https://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230][4.1%]] of death row inmates would be exonerated eventually- that's the minimum value for wrongful convictions for capital offenses. [[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/251115.pdf][Other crimes]] have higher rates of wrongful convictions, 11.6% for sexual assault for example. The reason why the death penalty is wrong, even if you don't believe creating more death in response to death is bad, is that every 1 out of 20 people you kill is innocent. And this is getting a lot of attention today, the UN has put out a moratorium on the death penalty (which the US is not following, go figure) back in 2007.

That's just one problem, [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Capital_punishment][there's a whole rabbit hole]] of reasons the death penalty shouldn't exist you can go down, some of which apply even more so to Light.

I realize you said you don't support this sort of thing, but it really sounds like you're trying to justify it. So I have to argue against it.

Anyway, Light is killing for crimes that have much less work done into showing guilt, so anyone involved in the criminal justice process (ie the people trying to catch him) are going to /really/ dislike him. [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267209738_Public_support_for_vigilantism_An_experimental_study][Here's]] a paper on support for vigilante justice. People support it, but I imagine that would change pretty quickly in Light's case once someone shows an innocent person was executed. And the death penalty doesn't deter capital crimes anyway, so he wouldn't be doing any good.
