  I agree that he should have researched the motives of those gifting him the power.

You mean the one who outright tells Light he's doing this for fun and is going to kill him pretty soon after Light gets the notebook?

Light was going on a power trip, everything else was an excuse. It's not so much that he wasn't rational, but that his goals weren't what he says. If you read it as if his goals are what he says he seems irrational, but if you realize he was just trying to show off and feel powerful it makes sense.

  Literally if he never killed the fake L then few would complain about anything he was doing.

I'm not going to touch the rest of this dumpster fire, but I think I should point out to anyone who might agree with this that there are a lot of people who will disagree with vigilante justice, and if you want a reason why then look at the rates of false convictions.
