What I was thinking of was that you could simply steer softly the politics of the world. One politician falls ill here, another has an accident... it would have to be done lightly though or the suspicion that political assassination has become the norm would arise. Or simply limit your intervention to really serious situations. Decapitate the whole of ISIS, stuff like that.
