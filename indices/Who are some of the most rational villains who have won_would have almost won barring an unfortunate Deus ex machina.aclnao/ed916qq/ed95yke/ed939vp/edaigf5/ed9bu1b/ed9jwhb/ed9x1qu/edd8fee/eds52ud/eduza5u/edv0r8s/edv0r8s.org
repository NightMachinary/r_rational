Well the interludes have been flashbacks so far, at least the early ones.

The Cave is suddenly open, but why? Pokemon are going on rampages, Like the Paras on Mt Moon. Plus it is where Mewtwo goes in canon.

It seems likely to me that the recent rampages are Mewtwo, either intentionally or unintentionally.
