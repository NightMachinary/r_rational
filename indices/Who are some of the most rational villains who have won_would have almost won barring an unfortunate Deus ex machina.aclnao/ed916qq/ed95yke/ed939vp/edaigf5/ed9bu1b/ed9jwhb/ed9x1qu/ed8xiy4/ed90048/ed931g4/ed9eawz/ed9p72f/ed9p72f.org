  deliberately reveal the deaths as supernatural

That's literally what Light did. He caused multiple criminals to simultaneously die of a heart attack every hour on the dot. He's making it as obvious as possible that something fishy is going on.

It's stated in the manga that he wanted people to *know* something supernatural is occurring and to be the work of a single person.

Light practically threw away his biggest advantage by revealing the existence of the supernatural.
