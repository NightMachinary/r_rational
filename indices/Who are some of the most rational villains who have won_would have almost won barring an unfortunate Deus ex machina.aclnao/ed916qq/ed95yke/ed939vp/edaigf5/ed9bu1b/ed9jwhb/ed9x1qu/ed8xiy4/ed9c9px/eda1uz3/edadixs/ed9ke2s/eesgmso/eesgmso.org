/Charles Adair/ from /Super Powereds/, I won't go into spoilers but: Save for perhaps the premise, the execution and steps taken to make sure his plan would succeed were fairly logical. And technically he does achieve his goal.

And the only reason he was caught was due to the combined efforts of over a dozen people just as smart and/or determined as him.
