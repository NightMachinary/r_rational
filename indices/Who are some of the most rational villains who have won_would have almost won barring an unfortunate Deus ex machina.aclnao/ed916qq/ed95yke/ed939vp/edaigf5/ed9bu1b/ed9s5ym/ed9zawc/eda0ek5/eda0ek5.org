I swore off Zahn/Thrawn after the big disappointment of /Hand of Thrawn///Vision of the Future/. And that was followed shortly by the whole /New Jedi Order/, which I did not like one bit, and that was when I stopped following the EU. I hadn't heard about any newer Thrawn books, but I doubt they'll recapture the magic.
