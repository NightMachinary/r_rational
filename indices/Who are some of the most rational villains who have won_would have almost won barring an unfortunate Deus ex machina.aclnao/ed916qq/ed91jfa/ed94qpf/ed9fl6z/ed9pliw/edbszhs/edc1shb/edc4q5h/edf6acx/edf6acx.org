The main limitation to magic in the series was 1) Your strength/energy and 2) Your knowledge. This makes it distinct from the source material* in which magic was hard for arbitrary reasons, and you had to 'really want something' to achieve it with magic. (Dragons were an exception to the rules on cost of magic, but couldn't use it most of the time. (And this did feel arbitrary, and sort of got commented on in the series.))

*The Belgariad - a series where the MC has a (magic) flaming blue sword. And the only spell you can't cast is "Be not" or you are unmade. (And people don't really cancels spells.)
