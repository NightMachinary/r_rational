What did Galbatorix gain by getting the name of the ancient language? 1) The power to cast any spell, with or without the words. 2) His spells can't be copied - he casts 2 spells at once, one of which erases the name from the memory of people he doesn't want knowing it.*

*That's not something precise - he probably didn't know what part of the brain stores the memory. While anyone could achieve that effect (erasing a specific memory) by destroying the whole brain, with the 'ancient language' you can do anything you can describe. And it happens.

Why would people /ever/ give up that power?

Why try to do something like making an AI slowly, over lifetimes, when you can just cast one spell? Whole brain emulation is difficult with our technology, but with magic brains could not only be 'emulated' but duplicated. Telepathy has already been achieved - no words required for that magic.

One of the benefits of becoming a rider is the guarantee that you won't die of old age. What is missing that
