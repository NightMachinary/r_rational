The wards Galbatorix laid over Urubaen as a trial run of his eventual magical lockout nullified all magical attacks launched without his permission. Magic in the Inheritance Cycle is basically a programming language, so warding from magical attacks is all it did.

What happened to Galbatorix was another case of fencepost security. He stopped magical attacks, but Eragon did not intend his final action before being suborned as an attack. The text says that it was an attempt to communicate, and Galbatorix had not blocked magical communication. He arguably couldn't, as telepathy is an integral part of the magic system.

You could argue that draconic magic is a bullshit deus-ex engine given that it apparently removed the concept of the first person singular from several beings, but I'd argue it has something to do with dragons being alien intelligences. They mostly think the same way Elves do, due to the dragonrider pact, but they're still giant murderous magic death lizards. The amount of energy necessary to prevent anyone from remembering names and stop a few from thinking in first person isn't actually that huge, so magic specifically structured to do that should be entirely doable if you have an intelligence capable of imagining the whole concept at once and instantiating it. Similarly, causing a single person to understand the magnitude of their sins should be really cheap, and you had another massive hive of draconic minds participating in that project as well to imagine the full extent of the concept. You even had a human mage present to channel the idea through, which makes it even easier.

So what happened in that room can be summarized as so: you had one force of insane, poorly-organized dragons attacking the mind of a single human mage, bolstered by a single, organized hive of draconic minds who had spent centuries working together. You had another mage who had gained the ability to directly edit the Rules of Magic, but wasn't very good or confident with the ability yet and was being conservative with it. This is a classic centralized intelligence versus individual value-drifters situation, so it isn't too surprising that the greater intelligence beat the disorganized raw power by finding a loophole in the rules as they understood them and just going for it.
