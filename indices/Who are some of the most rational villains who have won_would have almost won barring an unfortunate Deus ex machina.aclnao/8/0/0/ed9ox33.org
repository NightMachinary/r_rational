His books aren't all that good either, they are decently written but the characters are extremely unbelievable, the love story absurd, the main characters too perfect, and the villains over the top merely for the sake of making you dislike them. It was one of my guilty pleasure reads and I did enjoy them, but not a recommendation.

I will say I adore Faith of the Fallen (I believe), the one where he goes to the old world and the entire book is a hilarious argument against communism.
