I'm willing to go on the record as not having a pregnancy fetish, for whatever that's worth, and never attempted to depict the pregnancy in a way that was fetishistic.

(A lot of the details of that arc are drawn from my experience with my wife being pregnant, and I don't think I ever once thought anything like "it's so sexy that you're pregnant", even though I was happy that we were having a child.)
