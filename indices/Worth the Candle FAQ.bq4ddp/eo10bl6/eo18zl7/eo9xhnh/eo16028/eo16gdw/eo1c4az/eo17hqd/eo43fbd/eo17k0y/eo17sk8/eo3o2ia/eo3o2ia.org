It was also setup decently well (like from when they first met the locus/druid), and played off of what the different characters motivations were (Amaryllis stated early on she would do whatever she could to help the locus/druids; they needed a way to do the revival; the druid mentions rebirth early on). It also wasn't forced, one of the characters stepped up to do what needed to be done for the betterment of the world.

It was also a good excuse to get a lot of other stuff done. Like months of character development while only days passed in the rest of the plot, to have a pen pal sequence, let them move up in technology, and explore earth culture. And examined a novel (in my opinion) perspective on the concept for time acceleration.
