It seems a stretch to describe that as a fetish. It certainly doesn't seem to me like something "sudden and forced", for the sake of a supposed fetish.

I mean, take Christian mythology. That too includes a rather analogous pregnancy segment, where there is a magical pregnancy where a character (who happens to be called Mary) is implanted mystically with a pregnancy, as part of the storyline.

You may or may not like the Christian virgin birth story, but it would be a stretch to imagine it to be fetish-related. Rather, it's an integral part of the storyline, that yes, touches on a subject some people has a fetish for, but (as far as I can tell) without any particular sign that the author chose it for that purpose. (Or if they did, in either case, they made it sufficiently integrated in the story itself that I certainly can't tell.)
