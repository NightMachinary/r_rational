From [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7634/you-are-standing-at-the-origin-of-an-infinite-forest-holding-an-infinite-bb-g][math.stackexchange]], because I don't have a strong math background, the situation isn't analogous to the infinite forest primarily because people have width, and at least according to the highest upvoted answer there, yes, they will /always/ return to their home.

That said, actually circumnavigating the hex is pretty damned rare, given the distances involved.
