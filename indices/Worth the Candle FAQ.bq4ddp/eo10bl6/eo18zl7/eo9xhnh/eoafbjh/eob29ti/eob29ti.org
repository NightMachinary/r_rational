Yeah, if you're limited to a straight line (not on one of the six axis) the distances quickly explode but even just following the axis is difficult.

I guess you'll see most train tracks and powerlines running at (or rather in the general direction) one of the six optimal angles.

Edit : straight line because I am they measure it with a laser above the atmosphere and point it in one direction and see how long it takes to hit the back.

Like the moon.
