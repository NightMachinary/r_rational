Well at minimum you could just get rid of the Wisdom stat. Since the Wisdom stat is particularly egregious and inconsistent about what Wisdom actually does: For instance in D&D Wisdom determines perception and willpower, yet it's also supposed to represent "wisdom" itself which both makes 0 sense mechanically and because "wisdom" isn't a natural category that can mapped onto a stat in a coherent way.

So I'd recommend splitting up stats like Dexterity and Wisdom into stats like willpower, perception, reaction time, etc which can be coherently defined.

PS: The biggest problem with trying to make an actually accurate attribute system is that attributes should be correlated and having a certain stat in one attribute may require other minimum stats on other attributes (someone who can barely string a sentence together can never be that charismatic for example). The reason this is pretty unwieldy for tabletop RPG's is that things become massively more complex and you can't just treat attributes independently like you normally do.
