I think, for the latter objection, I would do some interlocking penalties, assuming it doesn't impede gameplay. I've known people who were charming in spite of not being terribly bright, and people who were very smart but utterly insufferable to everyone, and people who were naturally charming and augmented it with intelligence and insight. So have penalties apply when you're a dullard trying to fast-talk someone clever, for example.

Concur that wisdom is kinda silly. Perhaps replace alignment type values with big five personality traits, which are at least coherent even if I'm not sure how accurate they are scientifically?
