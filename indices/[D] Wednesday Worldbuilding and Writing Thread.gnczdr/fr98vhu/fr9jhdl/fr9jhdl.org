Perhaps the overlap and interaction could just be put into the system? In a RPG that would be a playability issue, but in a video game/story that sort of fine-grained complexity would be fine.

I find the main point of confusion/overlap with attributes is with the mental stuff anyway. The body-related stats (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity) are relatively distinct.
