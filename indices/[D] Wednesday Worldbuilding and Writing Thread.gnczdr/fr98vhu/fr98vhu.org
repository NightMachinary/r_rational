What a more "realistic" way to do attributes? In D&D, attributes are divided up into Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. That's pretty much the starting point for a lot of different systems that are used in videogames, but I can't help feeling that it's 1) awfully anthropic and 2) features a lot of things that ought to be interacting, overlapping, and correlated.

The reason I ask is that I'm working on a magic system for a bard type that works on attribute buffing ... but for that to happen, I need to decide what is and isn't an attribute, what falls under their domain as a realistic possibility. This can be fine-grained or chunky, though I suppose I would prefer a "chunky is easy, fine-grained is hard" approach.

Is there a better way of dividing attributes, maybe based on real world biology or psychology? For example, I'm thinking that we could make a "fast twitch muscles" and "slow twitch muscles" division, with each of those being a different attribute, or at least a base to build attributes from. Alternately (or additionally), "aerobic" and "anaerobic".
