I'm not trying to stick to anything physical, just ... coherent and measurable. In D&D (and other games), your stats map to a lot of things, but that mapping is on the low side of coherence. Something like "Constitution" is nebulous, including things like pain tolerance, immune system, blood clotting, lung capacity, and a bunch of other things that are only mildly related in the real world. It makes sense to cluster them, especially for gameplay, but not when thinking about the mechanisms of function.

At a higher level, I could imagine something like "homeostasis" as a functional cluster, which, if boosted, would assist in regulatory processes within the body somehow, though that cluster is obviously human-derived, since the body is a collection of systems that doesn't "know" what it's doing.
