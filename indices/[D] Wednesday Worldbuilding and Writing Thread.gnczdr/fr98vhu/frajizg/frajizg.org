I have this character who is accidentally made to possess another's body. That other happens to have superpowers, and is living a life that the first prefers greatly over their own. The majority of the story would follow the first character augmenting their new powers, making connections, etc. Then an incident occurs, and they're thrown back into their own body and the other character takes control of theirs again. Morally, the first character doesn't want to steal the second's body again, so emotionally and narratively, it's a setback that's thrown most of their progress throughout the story out the window.

What's the most satisfying way of resolving this so that the reader won't feel like the rest of the story was a waste of time?
