Put the POV where they'll have to figure out something new and important, so the power loss is just part of the difficulty rather than the key interest. Use an "and also." Like:

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to assemble a heist to rescue their lover, despite not having powers anymore and not looking like their lover expects.

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to persuade the mysterious supervillain who captured them to raise them from prisoner to servant and then trusted lieutenant.

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to break out of the mad scientist's prison-world full of interdimensional secrets.

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to take care of their children, who as part of the same incident acquired their own superpowers but need the POV's guidance to survive the superhero world.

They lose their powers, /and also/ finally see an opportunity to investigate what happened to their old friends, that they never could while they were in the stolen body.

When a stop in power is also a stop in discovery, the reader also stops reading. But when a stop in power opens up a new set of discoveries, that can be golden.

So, figure out new stuff in the world, secrets the reader doesn't yet know or cool feats the hero hasn't yet had to try. Then set up the "power setback" so that, to the reader, it feels like "new discoveries incoming."
