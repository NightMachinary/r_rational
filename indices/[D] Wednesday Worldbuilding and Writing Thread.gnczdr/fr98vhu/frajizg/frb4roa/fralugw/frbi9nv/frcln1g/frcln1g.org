Make it more about the character and less about powers. Maybe the body swap has allowed them to learn something about themself. To find reserves of wits or courage they didn't knew they had. Or maybe the time spent in superpowered body resulted in an access to valuable informations.

Just make sure that the character in question grew as a person and learned something during the possession.
