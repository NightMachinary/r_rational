For mental attributes from a psychology perspective... with working memory, you can further subdivide it into visuospatial sketchpad, episodic buffer, and phonological loop. All of these can be conceptualized as having size/length. You can also think in terms of reaction during recall and false positives/false negative when recalling. But at some level, the metrics we assign to these are more what we can measure than anything underlying. How these metrics arise from underlying neurobiology isn't known though there are various models and hypotheses. Still for the purposes of world building, it does get you distinct cool bardic enhancement: a bard self augmenting their own phonological loop while improvising poetry so they can plan more lines ahead, or enhancing the visuospatial sketchpad of the audience so they can visualize a scene better.

Another way to look at mental enhancement is in terms of stimulating brain regions: target the hippocampus to improve recall, or to block memory formation, target the amygdala to stimulate fear/arousal, target the somatosensory cortex to improve kinesthetic awareness or to create tactile illusions, target prefrontal cortex to enhance self control or to weaken it, etc. From a world building perspective its interesting how mental enhancement, trade off, and detriment are so close together in terms of what magical effect might cause them...

For physical enhancement... you could think in terms of physics, adding force or speed or momentum in some systematic way. From a world building perspective this might be interesting in that it's not a straight enhancement, those under the effect need to practice to utilize it properly.
