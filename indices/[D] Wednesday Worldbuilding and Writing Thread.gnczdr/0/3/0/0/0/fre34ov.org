In a D&D-ish environment, this means that special attacks or signature moves that are performed exactly the same way every time are easier to enhance than general combat competence. And that arrows that an archer had used in practice to make many extremely long shots are easier to enhance for similarly long-distance shots, and so on. It also means things that are preserved in very good condition for a very long time are easier to repair and restore than newer things, which is fun for ancient artifacts of great power and such.
