This may not be the direction you want to move in, but if you want to avoid making the connection between game-system attributes and mechanisms of function in the real world too murky, you could tie things directly to previous states and history/repetition.

So for any given enhancement you want to make or effect you want to produce, the "attribute" you're enhancing is "how much object X now is like object X was at time T". The effect gets easier to produce if more times T exist that embody the quality you're looking for, and also easier if the gap between X's condition now and X's condition at relevant times T is smaller.

So for example, restoring normal sinus rhythm to a heart in a patient that developed an atrial flutter at age 50 is easy because you have thousands of repetitions of "this heart has a normal sinus rhythm"ness in the past to draw from. But healing an aortic tear is gonna be really hard because the discrepancy between a turn aorta and a healthy one is very large AND because there isn't much "this aorta is growing new tissue to heal from trauma"ness in the past to draw from/enhance.
