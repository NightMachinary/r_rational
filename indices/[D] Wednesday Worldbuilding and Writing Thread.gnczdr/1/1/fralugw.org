I'm no writing expert, but I would say do your best to make it about the character not the powers. Focus on how they feel once they have them and once they lose them. This is kind of cliche, but you could have them get dumb and cocky when they have powers, but get smart and solve the problem anyway once they lose them. Not sure if that fits, but that's my general idea. As long as meaningful character growth results I don't think most readers will think it is a waste of time.
