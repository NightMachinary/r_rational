Its not totally dead, but Tales from Aeria is really a pretty massive project and I just got sort of burnt out on it. Despite the universe that SIH takes place in being much vaster in scope, I find its a lot easier to write about since its an extrapolation from our world instead of having all these fantasy cultures that I basically have to detail out from the agricultural revolution onwards.

So someday there will be more Fall of Oso, but probably not until after I finish SIH.
