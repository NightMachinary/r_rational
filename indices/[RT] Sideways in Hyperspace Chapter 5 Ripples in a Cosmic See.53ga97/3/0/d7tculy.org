  Is this meant as serial fiction or a book that's just happening to be released chapter-by-chapter?

I'm really sure how I'd describe it. Probably along the lines of Ra or Unsong, where there is an underlying plot, but concessions are made to make each individual chapter more interesting, given that they're released one at a time.
