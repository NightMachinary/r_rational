Funny thing, one of the most common critiques I see of rationalist serial fiction is that the author introduces too many story threads. I'm wondering if it's a fluke (my sample size is small) or if it's really a common mistake for the sort of people who write these stories. Or maybe the audience is highly enriched with people who find multiple threads annoying?
