Okay so this is something of a setup chapter, and I'm not sure how it meshes with the pacing from the previous excitement-packed spectacle. There are a bunch of story threads happening and I'm not sure if it works to open a new one especially with this much setup while another is ongoing. Though I'd probably have to read it in one go to be more confident. Also maybe the bit with the radiation hazard can be made slightly clearer.

Is this meant as serial fiction or a book that's just happening to be released chapter-by-chapter?
