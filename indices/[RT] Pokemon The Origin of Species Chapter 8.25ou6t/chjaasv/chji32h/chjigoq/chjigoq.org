Good question!

If I ever add or edit something significant enough that it's needed to follow the story, I will be sure to mention it in the author's note of the following chapter, and try to summarize the changes. Nothing really major has changed, so for now you should be fine without rereading.

That said, many of the previous chapters have gone through significant polishing since they were first published, so if you have not read them since the day or two after they came out, it might be worth doing to pick up the added nuances in character and world building. But it's definitely not necessary at this point :)
