Hey all, back again! Those of you confused about what CoRRNet is might want to check out the previous chapters again, specifically chapter 3, where I added mention of it for the first time. Simply put, it stands for Coordinated Ranger Response Network, and acts as a region wide task manager to help warn the public of threats, and allow trainers and Rangers to coordinate.

New story cover is by the artist Shion, from the website Pixiv. Enjoy the chapter, and as always, any and all feedback is appreciated!
