By originals, do you mean Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza?

The Endbringers themselves were inspired by the mythological beasts whose names they share: Behemoth and Leviathon as lords of land and sea respectively, and instead of Ziz as lord of sky, the Simurgh from persian legends. I imagine Game Freak was similarly inspired by the Land/Sea/Sky trinity when they made Hoenn's legendaries.

If you want to compare the region's legendaries though, I don't know about you but I see the ability to reshape and drown continents as much scarier than "just" making really strong, long storms :)
