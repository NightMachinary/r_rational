  exactly at noon of whatever time zone you're currently in.

It saddens me that this is time zone-based rather than sun location-based. I wanted to go to space and orbit around the Earth such that the sun is always exactly in the middle of the sky all the time, and thus have permanent invincibility.

Then again, since this power is strangely reliant on time zones, can you take over a country and take the concept of daylight savings up to 11 by setting the time to always be 12 noon? Would that make you permanently invincible within the borders of your country?

What happens if you are physically on the boundary between two time zones? Would only the half of you in the timezone currently at 12 noon be invincible? (What happens if there's a border dispute so the borders of a country aren't well-defined?)

  You may become invincible whenever you want, but you must spend an equal amount of time feeling like you have a bad flu
#+end_quote

Is there a minimum interval of time between invincibility uses?

If not, toggling your invincibility on for 1 nanosecond every 100 nanoseconds should be pretty much indistinguishable from being permanently invincible, since 99 nanoseconds isn't enough time for most attacks to penetrate your skin before your invincibility toggles on and negates the force of the attack. And 1 nanosecond of a bad flu every 100 nanoseconds shouldn't really affect how you feel significantly, so the side effect is manageable.

You just need to watch out for attacks that can hurt you in those 99 nanoseconds. Which attacks can do so depands on how your invincibility actually works. If you're being burned alive, do your cells just not absorb any heat from the flames? Does the invincibility rapidly disperse or delete any amount of heat above the harmful threshold? Do your cells that die just magically respawn in the same location in perfect health?
