Three scenarios:

1. You become utterly, Siberian-level invincible for one second a day, exactly at noon of whatever time zone you're currently in.

2. You have one full day of invincibility to use whenever you like. Using it permanently depletes your store. (This is 236 years of using one second a day as above.)

3. You may become invincible whenever you want, but you must spend an equal amount of time feeling like you have a bad flu (weak, shivery, headache/stomachache, vomiting, etc.) Payment begins as soon as you stop your invincibility, and it automatically ends after 24 hours of use. You can't go invincible while paying it back.

Your goal is to amass as much wealth as possible while avoiding capture.
