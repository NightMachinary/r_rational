  is the hallucinogenic gas /flammable/ by any chance

Actually, this point needs clarification. I'll let the gas be flammable, but since it's not designed to be an explosive, this will be in a similar sense to deodorant being flammable. A can of the stuff, yes. The diffuse particulates in the air? Probably not.

Note that the hallucinogenic gas in the room around Arlene is a different thing to the poisonous gas in the traps in Felicity's fortress.
