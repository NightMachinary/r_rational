If we look at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammability_limit][lower and upper flammability limits]] for different substances, we see methane is flammable at 5-15% concentrations and ammonia is flammable at 15-28% concentrations. Ammonia is difficult to burn, and methane is easily flammable but far from exceptionally so, but conservative numbers sound more reasonable for a substance not designed to be an explosive.

Since the presumed intended effect of the hallucinogen trap is to cause hallucinogenic effects, the wish would have used a concentration that is not toxic in the short term. Speaking as a total layman, 5% sounds excessive for potent hallucinogens, so I would expect the concentration to be under the lower flammability limit.
