You're part of the Resistance against an evil(well, greyish really) world-spanning organization in a world in which ideas have an effect on the world reality. Ideas affect reality in a way that is defined by the idea itself and it gathers power when people think of it. The evil organization already have a lot of content out there for people to think about and controls the media in a semi-autonomous way. Your ultimate goal is to topple the evil organization.

You want to create an idea that becomes a huge topic(such that people talk/think about it) and that is designed such that you can use it to fight the organization. The evil organization controls the biggest media but isn't monitoring actively, so if you want to use the news etc. to spread the idea it needs to be innocent on the surface, else you need to think of another way of spreading it.

Idea descriptions should include how it helps you fight the evil organization, why people are thinking a lot about it, and why/how it spread.
