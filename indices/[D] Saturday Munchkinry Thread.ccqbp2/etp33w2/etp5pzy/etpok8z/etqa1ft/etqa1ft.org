This is obviously a "ripped from the headlines" suggestion, but there's currently a meme popping up in a few subreddits about "raiding" Area 51 - you can see it occasionally on [[/r/all]] right now.

Most of the memes are about the loot people expect to gain, or nonsensical videogame-based advice about what to do during the raid. The success of the raid is treated as a foregone conclusion.

The thing is, most people don't really /know/ where Area 51 is. Because of that, the idea really boils down to "on <the date specified in the meme>, a successful assault on a government property will happen and the attackers will get away with high-tech government loot (and/or alien babes because this is the internet)"

So yeah. Spread a meme like that - vague location, concrete date, concrete action - and make sure it catches in the public conscience. Then on the day of, execute your plot with the assurance that this idea has your back.

Heck, it might even work in reality - security forces might be so tied up with the nonsense about raiding Area 51, that another attack somewhere else slips through.
