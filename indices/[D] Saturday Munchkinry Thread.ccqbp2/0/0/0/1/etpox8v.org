~~If done properly you can gain weight as a human very fast using the keyword "hungry" over and over. Just eat a burger, use hungry to empty your stomach and then rinse and repeat until you have gained the desired mass.

On average random transformations should have your stomach partially full as well, so repeatedly transforming into any large size animal and eating as much as you can in between each transformation should still allow you to gain weight pretty fast.~~

Just read you farther down explicley prohibiting this by saying you need to digest the food first. You could still gain weight fairly fast by just skipping pooping or peeing, but that wouldn't really help you grow that fast.
