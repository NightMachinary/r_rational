I'm actually unsure about this. I was thinking that you need exact weight for everything, and yeah, whale fetuses wouldn't work because of that, but in the end, this is too strong of a limitation.

I'd say that the new rule is that if you choose an exact person/whale/etc as a target, you would need their exact weight. But a generic "human"/"whale" would just make you a generic random body even if this exact weight is not currently present on Earth. If this is too inconsistent or just seems like a cop-out, I'd think up something else.
