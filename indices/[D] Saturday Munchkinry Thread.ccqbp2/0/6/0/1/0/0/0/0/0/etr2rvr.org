  If I get the weight wrong, then doesn't that just scale me up or down by a few percent?
#+end_quote

If you are trying to transform into something exact, then no, you would simply not transform. However, if you go for a generic "ant"/"whale"/"human", you would get scaled up/down if your weight doesn't match the target's possible range of weights.

  Can I bypass aging by, once a year, shape-shifting into myself at age 21? (Ideally from a photo after I did a six-month stint of hard exercise and really got myself into good shape)?
#+end_quote

You can bypass aging by body surfing, i.e., transforming into a generic "human" until you find a suitable body. Your idea would work if you measure your weight at that point and then replicate it.

  I can certainly sneak into places as a seeing-eye dog (there are some very large breeds indeed) or travel through air ducts as a constrictor snake, should that prove necessary.
#+end_quote

True.

  ...talking of snakes, if I turn into something venomous, can I poison things?
#+end_quote

Yes, you can.
