  You can shapeshift into anything that exists on Earth

You'd be able to determine the existence of top-secret technologies, and if you had someone else you trusted nearby you could have them analyze the technology before you turn back. The biggest problem with this would be finding a way to refer to potentially nonexistent technologies/objects with a single word. Does the military have a gun that shoots tornadoes? No way to find out, unless there's a word for that which I don't know of.

Does the one word need to be in English? I assume you wouldn't be able to easily break your own power by just inventing your own "language," but there's likely many languages which have single words which would require many more words to convey in English. If you can mix and match which human languages you use, it makes your transformation abilities much more flexible.
