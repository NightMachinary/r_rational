If I get the weight wrong, then doesn't that just scale me up or down by a few percent? If anyone even notices, I can blame it on new shoes.

Can I bypass aging by, once a year, shape-shifting into myself at age 21? (Ideally from a photo after I did a six-month stint of hard exercise and really got myself into good shape)?

I can certainly sneak into places as a seeing-eye dog (there are some very large breeds indeed) or travel through air ducts as a constrictor snake, should that prove necessary.

...talking of snakes, if I turn into something venomous, can I poison things?
