  Do I gain the sensorimotor capabilities of the target, though?

Yes, of course, even if the ones drastically different from human's would take some time getting used to.

  Firmly attach the motherboard of your computer to a precisely measured weight engraved with the word "Fnarglheim". Turn into Fnarglheim. Have an associate plug a CPU, RAM, SSD, PSU, a network card and maybe some peripherals into you. Can you see through a webcam? Can you interface with the internet?

Huh. If you'd transform into a computer all at once, you wouldn't be able to do what you are describing. However, if you first become the motherboard that has built-in support for peripherals and only then attach them... I'm not 100% sure how motherboards work, but I think the amount of /control/ you would have is not different from turning into any other non-alive object. You won't be able to use the Internet as a user would, but you would be able to see through a webcam or hear through a microphone, I guess.
