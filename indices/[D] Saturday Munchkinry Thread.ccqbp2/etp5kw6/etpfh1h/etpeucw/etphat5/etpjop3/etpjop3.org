Publicize your power, become an actor, become a celebrity and get stinking rich with wide influence, sure people might not trust you with an official position but it's still pretty good. Be a rescue worker or something on the side for good reputation. You'll be able to get pretty much anything you want for as long as civilization lasts and be in a position to help it continue a bit longer. No need for anything fancy.
