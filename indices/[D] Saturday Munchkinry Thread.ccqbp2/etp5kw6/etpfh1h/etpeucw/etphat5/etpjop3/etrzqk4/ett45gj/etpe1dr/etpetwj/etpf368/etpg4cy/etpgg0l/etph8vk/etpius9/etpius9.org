Let's say you are limited to living humans (to avoid confusion whether you'd transform into a corpse/skeleton or a person's original body). But anyway, this requires knowing the precise weight, the same goes you pornstars. I don't think it would be easy to transform into a certain person rather than a generic human/male/female/adult/child.
