  Can that description involve me looking at a photograph and saying "Him"?

There's a restriction: to transform into something /exact/, that exists as a single copy, you need its /exact/ weight, down to a milligram. It's a very difficult restriction to circumpass, so I'm likely to remove it in the story (then yes, your idea would work, thanks!), but for now, I'm thinking about what could be done with such limitation in play.
