Famous people names would still allow you to transform into specific persons, wouldn't it? If I say Obama, then wouldn't I be able to shapeshift into Barack or Michelle Obama?

Also one word is fairly limiting if intent can't specify the result. Blue whale vs Sperm whale, water tank vs military tank, american tank vs french tank. Speaking of whales, that might be one of the ways to increase mass fast, by eating krill.

Alternatively colonial organisms like the Pando forest, which is an interconnected colony of like one clonal tree. Trees take in co2, roots take in nutrients, gain mass that way.

I'm assuming size isn't limited, you just have extremely low mass while being something large.
