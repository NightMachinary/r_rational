  Does the one word need to be in English?
#+end_quote

Any language that you speak, where "speak" is an arbitrary but fairly low bound, something close to CEFR's A2. If you learn a lot of languages on a basic level, you would be able to do what you want.

  The biggest problem with this would be finding a way to refer to potentially nonexistent technologies/objects with a single word.

Yeah, it's not a good way to find out anything beyond stuff from popular culture, such as teleporters (even though you might become a device with which quantum teleportation is performed, I guess?).
