Balance yourself over a cutting machine, turn yourself into a precious metals, fall into the cutting machine. On the other side turn back into a (smaller human). Go to a buffet and enjoy yourself, transform into: "me". Infinite money or resources.

Assign someone a unique name. Eg, call Emeril Lagasse "Liremelagassy" in your head and then transform into Liremelagassy. Bam, now you can do nefarious things (as a presumably less overweight Lagasse). Turn yourself into a porn star and have some fun? How about George Washington and see what kind of teeth he had?
