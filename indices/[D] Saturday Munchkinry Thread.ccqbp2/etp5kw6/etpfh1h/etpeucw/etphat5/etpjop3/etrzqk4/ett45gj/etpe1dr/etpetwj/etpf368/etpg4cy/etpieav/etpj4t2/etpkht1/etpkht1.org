  Is it that you can't shapeshift into them if the weight isn't the same, or that you'll not match weights, but still look like them otherwise?

As I've answered in another comment, right now I'm actually unsure about this. I suppose that if you choose an exact person as a target, you would need their exact weight. But a generic "human" would just make you a generic random body even if this exact weight is not currently present on Earth. If this is too inconsistent or just seems like a cop-out, I'd think up something else.
