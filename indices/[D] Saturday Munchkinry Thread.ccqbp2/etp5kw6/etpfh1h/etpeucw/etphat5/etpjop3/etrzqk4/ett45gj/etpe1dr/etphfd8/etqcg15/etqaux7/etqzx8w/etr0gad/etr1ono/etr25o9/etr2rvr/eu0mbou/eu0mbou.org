Okay, so I have functional immortality. Can I be a little more selective that just 'human' by specifying, say, 'athlete' for a reasonably fit body? Can I revert to a sort of default form by specifying my own name?

If I specify someone else's name (e.g. "James"), do I turn into a random James of the right weight? Can I turn into a specific James, at whatever age he was when he was my exact weight?

In case of financial emergency, I could always turn into something with expensive or valuable venom, milk my own venom, and then sell it. I'd probably take note of the addresses of the sort of people interested in buying rare venoms, perhaps for medical research.
