Does transforming into small solid particules like dust works? Or is it banned same as liquid/gas? That would make you pretty much invulnerable

Also, you basically have unlimited ressources. The moment you gain mass you can transform into something valuable and dividable and take some scraps. Like if you transform into a stack of gold and an accomplice take away one gold bar before you become human again, what happens?
