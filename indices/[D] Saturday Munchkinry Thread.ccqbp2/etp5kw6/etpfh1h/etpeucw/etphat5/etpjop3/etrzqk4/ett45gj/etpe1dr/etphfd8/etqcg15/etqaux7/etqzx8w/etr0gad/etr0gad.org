...okay, so no self-cloning and shrinking myself down by rapid loss of mass - with the help of an ally - is going to be tricky. Still, I can lose a lot of mass very quickly with the Starfish trick, or by turning into a tree and having some branches cut loose.

I could /gain/ mass by turning into a constrictor snake, having a good meal, and spending a day or two digesting. It's not /fast/, but the mass limits can be worked around with enough prep time.

The Square-Cube Law will be my bane, however. I could turn into a human-sized ant, I'll just promptly start suffocating.

Hmmmm. So I need to turn into something with a one-word description. Can that description involve me looking at a photograph and saying "Him"? I won't gain the target's knowledge, naturally, but gaining a specific person's appearance has plenty of uses.
