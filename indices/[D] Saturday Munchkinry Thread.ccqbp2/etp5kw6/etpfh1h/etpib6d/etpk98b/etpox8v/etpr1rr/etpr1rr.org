Drinking two litres of water and then transforming into someone naturally two kilos heavier on cool down gets you half a kilo on average per minute per body, assuming that you cycle between bodies weighing 40 to 80 kg that gives a doubling time of 80 minutes. This means that 2 days of uninterrupted chugging water would give you 68 billion bodies, obviously logistical complications would arise before you get that high.
