Instant weight loss method. Just get a friend with a hacksaw.

Instant x, y, z, privilege, where the variables are any of the options that you prefer at the time.

Since it's always tied to the relative "speed" of time at a particular location, there's probably a way to exploit the power for ftl communication and perpetual motion machine based power generation.

Does ingested food count as firmly attached? What if I eat a pound of lead, transform myself into a gold statue, have a friend cut off about a pound of material, and turn myself back to the state I was in without the lead.

Actually hold on, if I transform at all I can't transform back, since another copy of me doesn't exist anymore. Maybe it's better not to use it at all.

Then again, if I transform into Hugh Heffner (before his death) I'll have copied his memories and thus experienced his life up to that point, which is pretty sweet.

You could combine all human knowledge in this way, and come out with some incredible technology. Or just confused about all of life depending on how other peoples' memories affect your perception of the world.
