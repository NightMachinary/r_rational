A very simple one, because I have a strong feeling it can be utterly broken but can't come up with an idea on spot.

You can shapeshift into anything that exists on Earth, as long as your mass stays the same (down to, say, a milligram) compared to the one you currently possess.

You retain your consciousness and ability to shapeshift, but everything else depends on what exactly you turn yourself into (a brick can't move on its own neither does it have any sensory organs, for example).

You are not required to know the working details of the thing you transform into: if you try to shapeshift into a human, you'd become a random human with precisely the same weight you currently possess. When transforming, you can use only one word in order to describe the result; you can become a "human", but not, say, a "human with the knowledge of a certain password." (Your knowledge stays the same anyway, the change doesn't affect memory and cognitive patterns.)

If you attempt to become a liquid or a gas (or plasma; anything non-solid, basically), you won't transform at all. You don't know what becoming liquid or a gas in during the shapeshift would do to you, but you suspect you'd die.

Only stuff firmly attached to you is counted towards your weight. If you transform into a small tree, and then someone breaks your branch, the weight of the branch is no longer yours.

This ability has a four minutes (passing on the surface of Earth) cooldown.

How would you use this power?
