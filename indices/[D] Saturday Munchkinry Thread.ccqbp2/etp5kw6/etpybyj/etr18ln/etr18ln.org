  Does transforming into small solid particules like dust works?

I think it either wouldn't work, or you would become one giant particle.

  Like if you transform into a stack of gold and an accomplice take away one gold bar before you become human again, what happens?
#+end_quote

You would become a random human that is 31 grams (a standard weight for a small bar) or 12.4 kilograms (for supersized ones) lighter.
