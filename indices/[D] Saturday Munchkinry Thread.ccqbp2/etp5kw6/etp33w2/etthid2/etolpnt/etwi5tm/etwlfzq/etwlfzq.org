Alright, so we went with this one:

#+begin_quote
  another is a fortress full of traps that can kill or disable the opponent and either poisonous gas or something that can disable the opponent, with herself and the cover at the center.
#+end_quote

I can't formulate a well-supported argument on why we should be winning without knowing what exact powers they have, but I suspect we could be winning with most other options.

I suggest we wait outside the room and let the oxygen in the room out. If that's implausible then at least she would be wasting stamina doing whatever. Then we stab her with a spear when she breaks out.

Edit: Also, may I borrow this idea and run a similar quest in SV?
