I wonder what kind of crazy stuff could happen if BoTW's Stasis power was Muchkined(is that a word?). I'll say you have to touch a thing to stop time from passing for it(because just seeing something seems a bit too overpowered), but anything done to the object will immediately take effect as soon as the effect wears off in 10 seconds. Also, to prevent weird stuff in space, let's say that it is frozen relative to whatever object has the highest gravitational pull, and all force done to it is relative to the gravitational pull of that object(so it wouldn't just destroy whatever it was on due to gravity).
