This is part 3 of the mini battle royale quest I've been running. It's very low effort, there's no voting, and it's intended to be simple fun.

Felicity caught the paper plane before it hit her this time. Aside from a few oddly blacked out suggestions, it was much the same as the last time.

She had four options. Speed and reflexes, useful long-term and well-rounded. Mind control projectiles, hopefully capable of bypassing defenses that would survive the falling rocks---assuming they fell again. Retrying the last wish at a larger scale, with gas-filled boxes around the opponent and a trap-laden fortress to protect herself, doubling down on an idea that so far had worked. A magical decoy, to engage in combat on her behalf, with physical skills in excess of her own, and absorbs targeted wishes.

Mind control had, fairly evidently, the highest potential by some measures, but it seemed the most risky, and if it was even partially ineffective it would leave her undefended, a gamble she didn't want to take. A decoy would also nullify some set of attacks, but if the power of a wish is limited, its complexity would mean she would lose most head-to-head battles, since after the decoy falls she would have no follow-up. The final choice was between landing the kill herself with enhanced speed, exposing herself to danger but allowing her flexibility, and an optimized static arrangement of traps and poisons to take out the target without her direct involvement.

The moment Arlene teleported into the arena, her heroic golden armour shining in the sunlight, her mythic warrior reflexes had her running for the gap between the slanted steel walls rising from the ground to entrap her. The moment she knew she was too late she changed course, charging at the centre of the wall, to climb her way up to the hole in the roof.

She reached the wall in a leap just as it ceased movement, and her hand, infused with unphysical strength, stabbed a grip into the smooth steel. Barely had she grasped its surface when a hundred rocks plummeted through the opening, cratering the unshadowed square in the middle of the room, other rocks pummelling against the sloped walls and wrenching her grip free.

The moment the rocks stopped, the square, steel roof fell into place, plunging Arlene into darkness. She heard canisters exploding, hearing and feeling a strange gas take hold over the room. Arlene screwed shut her eyes and refused to breathe. If she were in any other body, she would have lost all hope, but she was sure her strength was purely magical in nature, and it took no special effort to engage. However many seconds she had, it would be enough.

Tentatively opening her eyes, and relieved to find them unaffected, she regrabbed her handhold, and like an elite climber launched herself in one motion to the top, stabbing her fingers into the small gap between the walls and the roof. She made a handhold in the motion, but the force threw her free, and she had to leap back to and up the wall to secure herself again. Her chest was pounding for oxygen, but her body showed no trace as she pushed with all her force for the wall and roof to part. Neither gave enough---the walls were thick, and the roof heavy and littered from above with rocks.

The warrior spirit is indomitable, but Arlene's was not. She gasped for breath, and the hallucinogens took her.

Sorry for people expecting this earlier; most of the weekend wasn't a good time to write it and, to give some more out-of-character information, the other legal wishes would probably have left you dead, so I wanted to make sure the choice was what Felicity would really have gone with.

Felicity has been observing the outside of the room that formed around her opponent from within her trapped fortress. She's noticed loud sounds from within the room, which have died down but not fallen silent, and she's starting to regret wishing for the room to be filled with hallucinogens instead of general anesthesia. She thinks she sees an entrance, but doesn't want to fight barehanded. What does she do?

I'll give fairly free reign for what is in the trapped fortress that she can use, as long as people don't try to push too far. She knows the layout in it and can move around safely. The room filled with hallucinogens is a separate thing, and the rocks that fell with the roof were in addition to the previously fallen rocks, which are to one side.

Note that only time travel that makes my job much harder is banned out-of-character; time travel that's less difficult to write may still be considered. Same for the library wish that got squashed.
