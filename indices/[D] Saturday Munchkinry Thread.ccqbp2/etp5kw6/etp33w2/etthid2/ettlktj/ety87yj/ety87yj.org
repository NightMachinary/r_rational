Wolves.

Note: I am assuming a feudal kingdom in medieval Europe or the sort of place commonly seen in western fantasy fiction which is often based on Europe.

Wolves are common enough that I would expect them to be available in my kingdom, unlike, say, chimpanzees or elephants, and can be used for military/police purposes or for the sort of things we use dogs for generally, and making them my devout allies allows me to remove all the scary stuff that peasants hate about wolves.

Eagles or hawks might also be good for spying because they can fly and see really well, but I consider wolves' sense of smell to be good enough for spying, and wolves probably are, on net, better for attack purposes.
