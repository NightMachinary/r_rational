You can essentially focus 10 seconds of work into an instant. If you use a machine to put a lot of energy into it, the acceleration will probably result in something like [[https://whatif.xkcd.com/1/][relativistic baseball]]. Even without a machine to generate force, the effect of everything you can do to it over 10 seconds happening instantly is going to be insane.
