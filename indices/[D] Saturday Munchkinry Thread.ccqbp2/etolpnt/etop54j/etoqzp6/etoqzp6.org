Now let's think about how to actually exploit invincibility.

I'm thinking of hair. Grow your hair to extreme lengths and when you go invincible, you have an invincible mass of hair that you can use to cover arbitrary objects to make them invincible too.

If hair doesn't count for invincibility (or falls off too easily), what about skin grafts? I think you could mass clone your skin cells fairly easily then graft them back onto yourself, such that you have as much loose skin flopping around as you want.

Now you can make money legally by offering to be the heat shield for spacecraft. No more need for big and heavy heat shields that increase the fuel costs exponentially. Simply bring you on board as an astronaut, and whenever the spacecraft needs to re-enter the atmosphere you cover the front of the spacecraft with your body/hair/skin and turn on your invincibility. Depending on the mechanism behind your invincibility, you could re-enter the atmosphere without heating up at all, and also ensure the rocket behind you doesn't heat up either, yet still slow down to a safe velocity for landing.
