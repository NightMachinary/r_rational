Bounty hunting isn't really creative or innovative.. I mean more interesting stuff like low cost manufacturing with transmutation, like an early paper production operation that could produce paper cheaper than the paper production methods available 300 years ago. Giving them a competitive advantage.

Or shipping via teleportation and building a luxury goods import export company. Something interesting that uses the magic advantage to get a competitive advantage..

You could come up with much more interesting examples with 5 minutes of thought I'm just coming up with these from the top of my head.
