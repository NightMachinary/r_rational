You have a power that lets you take the result of any formal mathematical function and invert it to find its inputs. This ability works even if the function isn't bijective and if you don't know the function used, though there are some reasonability constraints here and there that you don't know the full details of.

Assuming you know modern technology and computer science, but nobody else in the world does, what's the lowest hanging class of exploits you can use this for?

(I'm asking because this is relevant to a small number of paragraphs in the next chapter of the story I'm writing, and I feel I'm not thinking about this perfectly straight.)
