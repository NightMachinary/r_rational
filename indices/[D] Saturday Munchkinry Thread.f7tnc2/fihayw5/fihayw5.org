I've recently been reading some Harry Potter fanfics where the MC's just have giant piles of gold lying in vaults. A bit deus ex machina, really.

So, my question is this: if you were transported into the Harry Potter universe at the start of the first book, how would you get rich, if, a) you could use magic, or b) you were a muggle?
