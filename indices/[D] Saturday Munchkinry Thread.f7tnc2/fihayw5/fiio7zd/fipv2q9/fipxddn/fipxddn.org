Make it seem like all those opportunities have been taken already, and have a few examples of it in the story in a seamless way.

For instance a character that comes from a rich family but instead of them being rich from having gold mines or some other lazy reason, make it so it was an ancestor or themselves finding an innovative way of using this hidden knowledge or skills in a way that made them rich while also taking that opportunity away from everybody else.
