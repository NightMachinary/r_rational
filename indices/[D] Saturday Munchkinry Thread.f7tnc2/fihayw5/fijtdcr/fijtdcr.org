Wealth is pretty meaningless to wizards who are not goddamn idiots (so, a handful of them) -Potterverse magic is powerful and versatile enough that a wand and the education to use it is a cornucopia machine.

However, UK magical society is also horrifyingly dysfunctional, which.. honestly, probably ultimately because of the damn imperious curse being a solvent of both all social trust and all efforts towards justice.

So if wealth is shorthand for "live long and prosper".. emigrate. To another magical sub nation if any of them are more functional than the UK, if not, just live in the muggle world while using magic with abandon to make your life better. That move is probably why ravenclaws dont run everything, they just study enough occlumency to make their minds sovereign, then peace the heck out to live in a magical beach house.

... how to make it rich as a muggle-in-the-know? Concierge service to the above crowd? classes on "How to pass as a retired investment banker" and the like.
