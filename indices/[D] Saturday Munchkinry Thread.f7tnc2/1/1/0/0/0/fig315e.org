I believe it is more on the semantic side. Without getting too setting-specific, in series it works on Ame-no-Habakiri which is a /Tsurugi/ by exact wording, and on Airgetlam which is much more like a shortsword but also referred to as /Tsurugi/, and even Tsubasa, who is a human person who think of herself as a /Tsurugi/ in a metaphorical sense. Once she stop thinking herself as such she stops being affected by Swordbreaker.

Edit: getting back to your question, I think as long as she also thinks of sabers as a subset of swords it would work on a saber wielded by this specific super-pedantic person.
