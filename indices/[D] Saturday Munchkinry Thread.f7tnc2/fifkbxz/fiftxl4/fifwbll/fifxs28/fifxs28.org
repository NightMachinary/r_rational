lol, don't worry about it, I'm not gatekeeping.

When you say “they think of it as a sword”, what does the term /sword/ refer to, the semantic category or the Platonic ideal or..? If you fought someone ultra-pedantic that thought it was important to call traditional swords Swords and sabres Sabres without mixing them up, would that change things? Or would that just be them using nonstandard language, since a sabre is still a subclass of sword?
