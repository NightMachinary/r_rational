  In what setting would this power be very effective?

Pretty much none other than civilian dueling in some very specific time periods. Swords are sidearms, not battlefield weapons, it's a common misconception. In most settings in most periods you'd rarely face a sword using opponent in a battle of any kind other than civilian dueling and self defense.

​

Most people would just use better weapons in battle given the chance, like spears, polearms, and specialized weapons in general i.e maces. Swords were backup weapons you can wear in case you lose access to your main weapon.

​

PS. there are easier ways of becoming immune to sword cuts, a cheap chainmail shirt and coif will give you around 95% immunity to it.. Put a gambeson underneath and you'll near 100.
