You could erase anything you possess from existence by getting a blind and delusional person to hold it and telling them it's a sword.\\
Altruistically, you could also apply this to radioactive waste and other dangerous substances.

With brainwashing, you could get that person to run up to your enemies, grab them, and then think of the enemy as a sword.

As for things that you don't possess:\\
You could 'push' the power, always attempting to use it on the thing your enemy holds, while taunting them about how they hold their 'sword.' Even a moment of indecision, and it's gone.

Do you have to touch something to wield it? Can a person hallucinate that they're holding a thing, then have that thing destroyed? What happens when you destroy something that only exists within one person's subconscious imagination?
