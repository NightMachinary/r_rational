The following power is based on Phara's Swordbreaker, from /Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX/.

The power destroys any and all physical objects perceived as a sword.

Activation is upon contact with your body or an object imbued with this power, by touching the object and willing it.

The perception is dependent upon the wielder of the object, so the easiest way to counter this power is just to not think of whatever you're using as a sword, although truthfully believing so while wielding it like a sword could be quite hard.

The specific wording is irrelevant; a Zweihandler is affected as much as Excalibur is affected as much as a lightsaber.

The physical object need not resemble a sword; as long as it is perceived as one it will be affected.

The effect propagates at c. The sword is physically erased from existence (potentially creating a 'glass half full' situation).

Given these parameters,

1) How would you use this power in real life?

2) In what setting would this power be very effective?
