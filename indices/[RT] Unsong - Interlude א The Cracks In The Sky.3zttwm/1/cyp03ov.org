Reposting my comments from the site:

Loved the first chapter, absolutely love the general idea of gematriya/kabbalah/science/crazy_world, but not a fan of the format in this chapter.

The tension of the story just popped with the satiric format of this interlude. Personally not a fan of the style of this interlude...it feels like a lazy way to introduce humor and explain the setting.
