  Tuesdays stopped happening.

Tuesday is the third day, when God created dry ground, plants, and trees. Earth skipped three Tuesdays. It is also the third (and presumably last) Friday (when God created animals and man), that Uriel called the President. He then goes on to play Bach's Concerto I in D Minor, which has three movements. On the first Friday, he stared at the phone for three minutes.

+The phone call is at 7:38PM, Washington DC time, which is solar midnight in Israel.+ No, it isn't.

Uriel speaks exactly seven sentences to Nixon.

Edit: There were 13 expletives deleted in the passage, there are 13 principles of the Jewish Faith, and God has 13 Attributes of Mercy.

EDIT 2: March 14 is 80 days (40 + 40) from the day Apollo 8 crashed into the firmament.

None of this was a coincidence because nothing was ever a coincidence.

EDIT 2.1:March 14 is also Steak and BJ Day, which may in fact be a coincidence.
