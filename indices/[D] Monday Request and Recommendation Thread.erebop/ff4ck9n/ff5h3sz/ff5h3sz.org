Oh! I like Magineer. Which is weird, because the writing is generally terrible, and yet, I really like it and very much want more.

Vainqueur has ridiculous charming moments but is the food equivalent, of, I don't know, Ben & Jerry's. It's delicious and that's about it.

I've been enjoying Street Cultivation and would call it high-quality non-literary young adult.
