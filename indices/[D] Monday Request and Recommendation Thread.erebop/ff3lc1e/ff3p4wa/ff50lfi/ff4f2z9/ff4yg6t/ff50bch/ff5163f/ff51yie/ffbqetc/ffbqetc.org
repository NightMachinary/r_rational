Paths of Civilisation is a pretty cool and unique quest, with an unfinished sequel, where the players made choices about how a civilisation would develop from pretty much the beginning of history.

There are a lot of quests out there - PoC used its own system, but if you're looking for more kingdom management quests I recommend searching for quests using the CK2 (Crusader Kings 2) system, which was based on translating some of the system of that game to the written format. It's sort of the "standard" kingdom management system, though it sometimes gets used for managing single characters. There's a lot of very good ones, but I recommend starting with A Dynasty of Dynamic Alcoholism, playing as the Elector Count of Ostland in the Warhammer Fantasy setting. (Which is pretty grim, but not nearly so much as 40k.)
