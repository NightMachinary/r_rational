Ehhh I tried Blue Core, but it got suuuuper cringey for me super quick, which is a shame. The premise is very interesting, and I like most of the writing from the MC's viewpoint. Interludes are a bit weak, but that's fine. If you can enjoy the way the author does the sex stuff, you'll be fine; I didn't.
