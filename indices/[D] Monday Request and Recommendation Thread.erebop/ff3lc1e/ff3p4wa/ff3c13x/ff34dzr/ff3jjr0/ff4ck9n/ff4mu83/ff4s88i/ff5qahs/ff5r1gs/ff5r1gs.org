Seconding this recommendation. Threadbear and the sequel, Small Medium, are both complete and excellent LitRPGs. Dragon Hack, the third in the series, isn't complete yet, but shows the same combination of good writing and worldbuilding.

Other recommendations:

- Cultivating Earth is excellent, but on hiatus at the moment.
- Nanocultivation Chronicles is also good, and has the interesting conceit of having the Outside (real world, with nanotech) and Inside (a VRMMO), with most characters existing in both.
- The Elemental Arena has been posted here recently, and is medium to good. Only a few chapters in so far, though.
