Interesting choice of litrpg for audio, I can't stand being unable to look at the numbers.

I can also listen during work and spend a lot of it listening to podcasts, but would love alternative recommendations. Use a public library app if you can by the way, saves a lot of money and let's you try books you would never buy for free.
