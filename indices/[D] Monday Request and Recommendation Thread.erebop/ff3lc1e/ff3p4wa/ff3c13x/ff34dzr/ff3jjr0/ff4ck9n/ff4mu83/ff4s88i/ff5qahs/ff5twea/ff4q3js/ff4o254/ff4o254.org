The korean web novel Solo Leveling* got a comic adaptation that you can read at [[https://sololeveling.net/]] which is a bit of an ad-infested translation-pirate site, but still, cool comic.

(a better translation of the title might be I Alone Level Up)

there's also complete translations of the original web novel at [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/i-alone-level-up/]] and also wuxia idk which is better/less evil
