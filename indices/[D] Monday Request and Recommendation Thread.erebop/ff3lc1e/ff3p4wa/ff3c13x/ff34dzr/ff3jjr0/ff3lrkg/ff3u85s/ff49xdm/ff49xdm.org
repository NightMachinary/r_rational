After you read /Sandman/, I recommend trying some of the other classic comic series in the Vertigo imprint. For instance, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer][Hellblazer]]/ was a trend setter for many ideas that later became popular in the urban fantasy genre. The series had its ups and downs as it changed authors and artists, and in some ways it's a time capsule for the issues that were important in Britain at the time it published, but the high points are definitely worth the read. It's not particularly rational (but then neither is /Sandman/).
