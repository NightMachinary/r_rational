my drop point for ward was the worldbuilding. i just cant imagine the mega city popping up from nowhere in as little time as it did without a much much longer time frame. megalopolises are complicated affairs.

how is wandering inn now? i dropped it long ago because i dislike when the mc is sidetracked from its own book. when i left the author was going in this long flashbacks and jumping characters half a world away while erin did alchemy in a corner over there.
