The writing's very good (much better than volume one), but it goes progressively more and more in the direction of an epic tale covering happenings all across the world rather than focusing on Erin.

I prefer stories focusing on a single storyline, and have been gradually losing interest (haven't dropped it yet, but I rarely reach chapters on the dya they come out anymore).
