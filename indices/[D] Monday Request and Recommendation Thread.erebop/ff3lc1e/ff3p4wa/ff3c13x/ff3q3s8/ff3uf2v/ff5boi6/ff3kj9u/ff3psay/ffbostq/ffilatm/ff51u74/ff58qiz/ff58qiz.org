The Wandering Inn still wanders a lot. Volume 6 has longer side arcs than any Volume so far and a lot less time with Erin. I can see how its frustrating and you might not like it now even if the plot points are starting to slowly draw together. But the Wandering Inn is my favorite running serial BECAUSE it wanders so much. I think it makes the world feel alive and lived in. I love being sucked in to some random new or returning character twice a week and learning to care about their world and struggles.
