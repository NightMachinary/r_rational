I dropped wanderinginn when the author decided that the antinium had feelings all of the sudden. During the antinium wars the antinium were known for the robotic ruthless efficiency. They were mindless cold killer robots and that's why they freaked out when they found out that Erin can turn ants into "individuals". The author clearly establishes this lore deeply and its a major plot point. But during a flashback scene in the antinium war, the female antinium commander was getting pushed back and used a morale boosting skill which reduces fear and bolsters hope to the soldiers? The author tried to make it an emotional scene showing how the antinium army is now fighting with hope. And thats my problem lol this nitpick which made me drop it. Antinium were feared all over for being ruthless killer robots with no empathy. But, this flashback scene suddenly humanized every ant there. They were fighting like humans and the other races able to feel fear and hope. They were supposed to be controlled by a queen hivemind and fight like how we were lead to believe for so long.
