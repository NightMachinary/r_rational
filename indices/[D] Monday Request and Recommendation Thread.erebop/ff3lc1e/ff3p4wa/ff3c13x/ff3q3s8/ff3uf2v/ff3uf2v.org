I bounced off of Ward pretty early (early arc 5), then listened to We've Got Worm, and now I love Ward. The more literary criticism based angle that WGW promotes fits it better than the usual fandom / watercooler conversation style. I'd also recommend We've Got Worm to Worm fans in general, it definitely made me enjoy it more.
