I dropped it towards the end of arc 17, though I'll probably binge the rest once it's over unless the reception is very negative.

Victoria as the protagonist is the main issue for me. She was already one of the few relevant characters in Worm I cared very little about, and unfortunately Ward didn't manage to change that. I can't pinpoint what exactly makes her so unappealing to me, though I suppose her being the opposite of Taylor in pretty much every way has a lot to do with it, as I was invested in her story from the first Worm chapter.

I generally like the rest of breakthrough more than Victoria herself, though that isn't enough to offset the glacial pace Ward has compared to Worm as a more character-driven story, especially since I don't enjoy the action scenes as much as in Worm either (again, Victoria is a problem as her power doesn't allow her to have the situational awareness Taylor had, which makes fights more confusing, and generally offers less interesting resolutions). I found the worlbuilding to be a mess as well, and the interludes on average weaker than Worm's, though I still did like a lot of them and they're my favorite part of Ward overall.

I think it's overall much harder to enjoy Ward if you dislike Victoria as a protagonist than Worm if you disliked Taylor, which imo partly explains why it hasn't been as well received. I've seen a lot of Worm readers who didn't care about Taylor but continued anyway for the action scenes and interludes, which Ward has less of.
