I'm trying to remember a self-insert I read a while ago. I think it was either for Worm or some other super hero series. The protagonist has a rpg screen too but invests his points into str/con instead of intelligence over time. And I think he starts out in some type of gang? I also can't remember if it was a quest or not.

Tried doing a search in this sub on self-inserts and couldn't find it. Anyone here happen to know it?
