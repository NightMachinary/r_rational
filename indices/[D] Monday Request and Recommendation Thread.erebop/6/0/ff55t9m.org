Author summary: Taylor triggers in the locker with the ability to turn into an arbitrary number of Soviet tanks. Easily a breaker 9/blaster 5/mover 3/brute 4/changer 8/master 7, our glorious heroine becomes the vanguard of the proletariat and brings about righteous revolution. Escalation, power wank, and stations of canon galore lie within these pages.

Author summary: Oh no! The supergenius bomb tinker Bakuda has been trapped in an endless recursion of time! But don't despair, boys and girls! Blasting out of a piddling temporal anomaly will be child's play for the most explosive woman in the world! How hard could it be?
