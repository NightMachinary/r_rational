I am desperate for audiobooks since my work allows me to consume them on the clock. I went through so many of the major ones, stormlight, first law, dresden, kingkiller, etc and even dived into niche litrpg. I burned through everything on hpmor podcast and wildbow's works.

Did I miss anything? Or am I stuck in limbo. My problem is that it has to be rationalist or I drop it. Any suggestions?
