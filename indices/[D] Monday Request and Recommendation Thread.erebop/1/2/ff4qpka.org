Queen in the Mud(Royalroad) looks like it'll have a focus on kingdom building but haven't explored that this far.

The more resent chapter of Empire of Salt(Royalroad) hints that there will be organization building though it is unclear whether that'll develop into an actual empire.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] evolves into kingdom building later in order to fight the white walkers but it is one amongst multiple focus.

All still ongoing.
