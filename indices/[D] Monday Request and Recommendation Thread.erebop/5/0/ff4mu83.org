Most of the LitRPG proper I've read has been mediocre at best. What have your favourites been?

If you liked Cradle, then here are two recs that are similarly LitRPG-adjacent and quite good: Sufficiently Advanced Magic, by Andrew Rowe, and Into the Labyrinth, by John Bierce.

You may also like the webcomic Order of the Stick. It starts out as a series of unrelated jokes about D&D mechanics, but evolves to the point where it has some of the most impressive moments I've seen in a fantasy story in any medium. Given that it's a stick figure comic, that's incredible.
