I just caught up with "Wake of the Ravager" and wouldn't recommend it. It's a junk food litrpg where the numbers are made up and the system just kind of happens. The romance is very YA, and the MC is far too good at combat based on obvious tricks and randomly beating soldiers in hand to hand. The writing is generally good but the content is lacking in my opinion. I don't know why I read it all, but if you're starving for material here it is: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager]]
