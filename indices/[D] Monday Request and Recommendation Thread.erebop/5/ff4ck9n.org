I need some more litrpg (and similar). I generally stay away from vrpg stories, since the stakes never seem to be all that high.

I've already read and enjoyed:

- He Who Fights With Monsters
- Azarinth Healer
- Cradle
- Mother of Learning
- The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound (kinda trash, but I love it)
- The System Apocalypse
- A Thousand Li
- Delve
- The Scourged Earth
- Everybody Loves Large Chests
- The Salamanders
- Allocation
- Life Reset
- Brimstone Fantasy
- The Gam3 (the first two books at least...)
- Dante's Immortality
- Street Cultivation
- The Magineer

I've read but dropped:

- Worth the Candle (might check back when it's complete)
- The Wandering Inn
- The Snake Report
- Vainqueur the Dragon
- Forever Fantasy Online
- The Arcane Emperor
- The Ritualist
