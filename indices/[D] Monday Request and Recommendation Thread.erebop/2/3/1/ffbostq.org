Spoilers: That is actually something the author did on purpose. The city is pretty much an empty shell, it never could have worked out in the long term. After Gold Morning, people prioritised going back to how things were before, without putting in place the solid foundations they would have needed to do so. People were unwilling to move out to the countryside and become farmers or miners, they wanted back to fastfood and skyscrapers. As a result, shoddy construction and food crises cause issues not just within the City, but with their dimensional neighbors. That is part of Ward's message about recovering from trauma; you cannot expect things to quickly go back to how they were before the traumatic event, you need to deal with the fact that going forward, some things might never be the same again.
