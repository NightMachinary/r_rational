Used some of the holidays to catch-up with Ward and frankly I was a bit disappointed. I made it to arc 11 before dropping it, despite Worm being probably my favourite web novel of all time. I'd never seen much discussion on this sub around Ward though so I'm not sure how it's received here.

I've noticed that now, I'm only actively following 2 series: The Wandering Inn and MoL, with nothing else having caught my attention for ages. Instead I've been reading far more non-fiction works recently The Global Minotaur and Why Nations Fail being the most recent. Both have interesting and provocative arguments on global economic issues and I would recommend.
