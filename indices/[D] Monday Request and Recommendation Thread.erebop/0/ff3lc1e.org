Can anyone recommend any non-fiction books about reconstruction after society goes awry? I've been reading a lot lately about how societies descend into, for instance, a Nazi Germany-like state, but I haven't found much on how they get out of it. Even just time periods to look to would be helpful. I can think of the reconstruction of Europe after WWII, and German unification after the Berlin Wall fell, but in trying to think of other time periods my knowledge of history is proving insufficient.
