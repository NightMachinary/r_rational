I can offer some recommendations on Japanese history. The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori by Mark Ravina is a book on the life of an influential samurai during the Meiji Restoration, now best known due to the Tom Cruise movie based on his life.

Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II by John W. Dower is probably the definitive book for that period and is definitely the more easily accessible of the two. It presents a nuanced look at the US occupation of Japan following WW2.
