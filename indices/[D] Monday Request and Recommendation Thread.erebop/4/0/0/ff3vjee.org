I've started reading /Red Son/ based on your recommendation, and I'm enjoying it so far. This take is especially intriguing since I'm a Russian myself and can, at will, look at the events through the prism of propaganda I was fed during my childhood.

/Saga/'s premise didn't seem very interesting to me, to be honest, but considering the recommendation has been seconded after merely half an hour, I think it's worth checking out anyway.

Thank you!
