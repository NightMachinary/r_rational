I didn't ask that long ago. No need to apologize!

Thank you for being so in-depth! The only thing better than reading good stories is vicariously enjoying them for the first time again through other people.

Ushanka Batman and LEGO Batman are definitely wonderful Batmen.

Also, I realized that I have some recommendations I can make!

COMICS BY WARREN ELLIS

/Planetary/ is about a team of "archaeologists of the unknown," who, in the process of digging up the secret history of the world, also dig up the history of superhero comics, their roots, and their influences on other genres (e.g. "here's the story where we see how 1920s pulp adventurers gave way to flashier, more inhumanly powered characters," "here's the story where we learn about a 1950s lab with atomic-powered people, atomic-powered ants, and, well, you get the idea"). Over time, a larger plot emerges.

/Transmetropolitan/ is, if you haven't heard of it already, Hunter S. Thompson (by another name) In The Future.

/Black Summer/ is another Ellis comic. Long story short, there were once seven superheroes who were all some spin on "Iron Man-type tech hero." They fought crime. Then some of them died or got injured. They split up. A few continued to fight crime.

Then in 2007 one of them thinks, "You know, I fight crime... And the President is a war criminal..." and straight up kills W. Bush and Cheney and kicks off a nightmare sequence of responses and responses to those responses, which is what the following seven issues are about.

Also, Warren Ellis is British, so there's an interesting "this is America as perceived from the outside" flavor to it.

/Nextwave/ is classic "people punching things and being witty" Silver Age superheroism, and I love it. There are tactical drop bears, broccoli people, and a dragon who wears purple underpants.

/Crécy/ is a graphic novel about the Battle of Crécy, narrated by a longbowman as he marches to and fights at Crécy. It breaks the fourth wall a bit (our narrator is speaking to /us/ and comments on modern events and contextualizes things in a way that helps them make sense to modern readers) but I don't think that detracts at all. It makes the important point that people in earlier times weren't stupider than us, they just didn't have the mass of accumulated knowledge from which we benefit today (which is probably an obvious point to anyone on this subreddit...).

COMICS BY KIERON GILLEN

In /Uber/ and /Uber: Invasion/, the Nazis discover how to make superhumans just in time to push the Russians back from Moscow. Luckily, a British spy is able to smuggle the formula back to the U.K., and so WWII enters a new phase, with new weapons. There /are/ characters with superpowers, but the series pays as much attention to "how platoons and regiments of superpowered soldiers would be utilized" as it does to "what this individual superpowered soldier is doing." Also, Ukrainian anarchism becomes relevant in the second series!

You mentioned elsewhere in this thread that you're familiar with /Watchmen/, so allow me to recommend the 2019 run of /Peter Cannon: Thunderbolt./ You know how DC bought some characters from a dying comics company, hired Alan Moore to write a story about them, and then asked Moore to change the names because his story had rendered almost all of their newly-purchased characters dead or AWOL? Peter Cannon was Ozymandias 1.0, and Gillen's run does some interesting things with the character's relationship to Watchmen. It gets fairly meta, in a /Planetary/ sort of way.

/Die/ is Tabletop RPG Jumanji. Six kids were drawn into a weird fantasy world, and five of them were able to get out. Now, decades later, the game is coming for them again.

COMICS BY OTHER PEOPLE

/Miracleman/ by Alan Moore is a peculiar one. It's another "revival of an old character from the days before DC and Marvel were synonymous with superheroes," and Moore does some really weird things with the character. Also, there's a (very much on hiatus) sequel miniseries by Gaiman which shows us a world transformed by Superheroes Who Actually Do Something.

/Dwarves/ is a French fantasy comic about, uh, dwarves. Most of the issues center on different characters, but their stories intersect over the generations (I'm working on a blog post that tries to put things together, because some events are centuries apart from each other). I really like how fleshed-out dwarven culture is. Unfortunately, the other comics in this universe, /Elves/ and /Orcs & Goblins/, are pretty bad.

/Superman Smashes the Klan/ is basically what it sounds like. It's a loose comic adaption of the 1940s "Clan of the Fiery Cross" radio serial.

/The Manhattan Projects/ is a Weird Superscience comic by Jonathan Hickman with nuclear ghosts, "Zen-powered Death Buddhists," and Oppenheimer's evil twin.

/The Private Eye/ is a 10-issue scifi/mystery comic where, in response to a privacy breach to end all privacy breaches, people decide that they really like being able to keep secrets and go all-in on it: there's no longer any "clouds" for people's secrets to spill out from, digging into someone's search history is a federal crime, and the government guarantees your right to use a pseudonym in just about any situation. Also, everyone wears a mask in public so there are lots of great costumes and you should get the trade paperback editions because there are even more costume sketches in the back.

Last but not least, I wrote a [[https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com/2019/01/04/media-recommendation-the-black-monday-murders-by-jonathan-hickman/][review for Jonathan Hickman's /The Black Monday Murders/]]. The story is complete in the sense that the initial mystery was solved but there are lots of sequel hooks dangling, and unfortunately Hickman hasn't gone back to it recently.

And...it's almost midnight, so I'll stop here. LMK if you want more recommendations, and please let me know if you read any of these! >:]
