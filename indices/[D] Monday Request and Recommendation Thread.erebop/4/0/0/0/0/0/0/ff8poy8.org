Okay, that's one long list. Saved, I'll go through it as soon as the concept of free time starts existing in my reality once again.

Out of all these, I only read /Transmetropolitan/ around four years ago and found it to be okay. I greatly enjoyed watching the antics of the main character and, to a lesser extent, his assistants, but nothing else was actually memorable enough for me to look back to. That's just my personal opinion, though, I totally can see why people may like it a lot.
