[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Red_Son][Superman: Red Son]] is a pretty good three issue "what-if" story where where Superman lands in the U.S.S.R instead. All the usual faces show up but that one change causes some interesting ripples.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_(comics)][Saga]], about a couple from opposite sides of a galactic war trying to raise their kid, is also supposed to be very good, but I haven't read it myself yet.
