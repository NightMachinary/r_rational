I spoiled myself all of /Watchmen/, from knowing the whole plot to reading random excerpts. Unfortunately, I don't think I can enjoy it to the fullest right now.

As for /Injustice/: even though I want to read it, I've just finished /Irredeemable///Incorruptible/, which, as far as I know, is basically "/Injustice/ meets utter insanity." I don't think I will be able to take it seriously until I get the other comic from my head.

Thanks for the recommendation!
