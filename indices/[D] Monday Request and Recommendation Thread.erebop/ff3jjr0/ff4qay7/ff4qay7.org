Literally glancing across my comic shelf...

It's not as famous as some of the other recommendations you're getting, but I really enjoyed Neil Gaiman's /Eternals/ run. It's available in a single paperback collection.

/The Unbelievable Gwenpool/ is widely acclaimed. If you enjoy it, or have read it, I just finished and quite enjoyed the next two comic series to follow the character (/West Coast Avengers/ and /Gwenpool Strikes Back/), although they're not /as/ good.

If you're ok with rather wacky non-mainstream comics, /The Adventures of Dr McNinja/ (by the same author as /Unbelievable Gwenpool/ - it's what landed him the job) is surprisingly good. It's available for free as a webcomic, but also available in print as a series of slablike collections - and the fact I bought one despite having already read the whole comic for free should speak to how much I liked it.
