Sorry for taking so long to answer! Work and uni leave no time for Reddit (which is good, I suppose, since I've been spending too much time on social media lately).

I'm going to share my thoughts, so in case someone other than [[/u/callmesalticidae][u/callmesalticidae]] reads this: there are going to be unmarked spoilers!

First of all, the ending BLEW MY MIND. While I wasn't /that/ surprised with Lex Luthor winning, and him being able to run government efficiently was foreshadowed in the first issue, the very last twist was /amazing/. I just sat here, absorbing that ending for a good minute.

I don't have a deep knowledge of DC lore, but I recognized all the main characters, and, more importantly, could compare them to their usual portrayals. I really liked the takes on most of them, and I especially enjoyed how Lois not-Lane was written here. Also, Batman the ushanka terrorist is probably my favorite portrayal of the character aside from /LEGO Batman/.

The depiction of Stalinist and post-Stalinist USSR was fine---but since the story was about the characters, not the setting, it wasn't explored at all, and I didn't really mind that.

I feel like timeskips between issues could've been handled better; sometimes the drastic changes were a tad jarring. However, I got used to them by the middle of the third issue---so it wasn't too bad.

From the graphics standpoint, I found the style to be pleasant but not /outstanding/. I honestly can't remember a single frame that visually captivated me, but neither do I remember anything badly drawn. The color pallette was probably the best part.

Overall, I enjoyed reading the story and would probably recommend it to some of my friends (definitely to those who enjoyed /The Metropolitan Man/ or /Injustice/).

The last but not least: Lex Luthor here is unacceptably hot. I never thought I needed a ginger version of that smug fuck, but I apparently did.
