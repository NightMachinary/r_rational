Neal Stephenson's "Anathem" has some of this. "Cryptonomicon"... probably doesn't qualify tbh.

Mary Robinette Kowal's Lady Astronaut books technically exactly fit your description, but almost certainly not in the way you actually mean - "math theory is used in a prominent, meaningful way by the protagonist" is pretty much half the first book, but the story is not about the maths and does not go into it. Still, they're good, though uncomfortable, reading.
