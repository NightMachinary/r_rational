Honestly, I feel like the books just overdid things on the stakes. If you want a hyper-motivated space program, have a meteor kill some millions of people, and detect an ongoing increase in debris heading into the inner system from the oort cloud - that is, the nemesis theory is correct and there is an urgent need for space infrastructure to do deflecting.
