R.W. Krpoun is good at this - he often writes from the perspective of characters who are not necessarily smart, but who do have to rationally examine their surroundings and opponents in order to figure stuff out.

His novel [[https://www.amazon.com/Grog-RW-Krpoun-ebook/dp/B0851HYMXV][Grog]] is a good self-contained introduction to his sort of character.
