I recently read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836728-the-rook][The Rook]] and found it pretty rational and enjoyable. The premise is that the protagonist wakes up with no memories then discovers that she's part of a superpowered secret organisation. There's exploration of the impact of memory on personality, rational problem-solving and a heap of interesting superpowers.

One of said powers was a person having one mind occupying multiple permanent bodies. It's a concept that I've never really seen explored much (outside shadow clone shenanigans), with the only other fiction I've read that exploits it being [[https://vi-fi.github.io/Cedric's%20Eight.html][Cedric's Eight]] (which was also quite enjoyable).

Any recommendations for things with that concept?
