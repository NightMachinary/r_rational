The Arithmancer is basically the opposite of using math in a meaningful way. The applications of the mathematics are surface level at best.

It also perpetuates the idea that doing arithmetic quickly = mathematical ability, which is not only plain wrong, but also discourages people from seeking a deeper understanding of the subject (How many mathematicians have heard "You study math? Wow, I hated that in school"?)
