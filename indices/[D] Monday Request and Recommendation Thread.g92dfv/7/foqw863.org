Request- Any stories where math theory is used in a prominent, meaningful way by the protagonist? So for example in Methods of Rationality, Harry is consistently using Bayesian statistics to update his views. Or in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_Zero_(story)][Divide by Zero]] by Ted Chiang, the entire story revolves around a theoretical mathematical concept. Greg Egan's works also have this to some degree.

Basically, any story in which more than foundational mathematics are used in meaningful ways; bonus points if it's statistics because that feels criminally underused.
