Can only de-rec Lady Astronaut. For example I agree with [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2368358561?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1][this review on goodreads]].

I am also guessing we are more sensitive to plot holes here and despite the usual plothole that it is easier to build isolated biospheres on earth than on mars if you have the option, there are other really obvious plot holes. For example the protagonist somehow builds a (perhaps) accurate climate change model in the 1950s (I guess that is the math theory that OP wants?) (and more unbelievable is that people actually act based on the model predicting a catastrophe).

Same themes but different medium: I can really recommend "For All of Mankind" (Apple+). Other than a bit of orbital mechanics it doesn't have much math in it, though. The science is good (though it takes a back-seat behind the drama) and the cultural themes are handled with nuance.
