That's a bit more of a stretch, because there wasn't really a lot of public research into the effects of individual events on the climate until like the 80's ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens][the explosion of Mt St Helens]] made people veeeeeery interested in that topic in 1980)

Again though, given a sufficiently large incentive, you could potentially do [[http://www.geo.umass.edu/faculty/bradley/bradley1988.pdf][the same math they did in 1988.]] Encyclopedias and newspapers would have had data on the explosion of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa][Krakatoa in 1883]], and almanacs would have had local temperature data in the years following. Alternatively, depending on her security clearance, she could have extrapolated from the work done on models of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Early_work][nuclear winter in the early 1950's]] - maybe both?

Given the time constraints I imagine she would have just drawn a straight line scaling the Krakatoa explosion to this meteor impact, which would have indicated a great deal of cooling. The rest of it, eh who knows - climate models are really hard, because there's always some variable you forgot to account for. She just needed to convince the POTUS of an existential threat.

Edit: though I do kinda agree - if none of this stuff is mentioned in the book, then I can see how it would feel like a handwave / cop-out.
