  For example the protagonist somehow builds a (perhaps) accurate climate change model in the 1950s

I haven't read more than a summary of the book, but that's actually entirely believable. We knew about climate change in the 1950's - the basic physical principle was worked out in 1896 by Arrhenius, the first estimates at "a doubling in atmospheric CO2 will lead to mean temperature anomaly of X degrees" were made in 1955, and the first ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO2 started in 1958.

All of that work could have been shifted a decade or so if there were some massive pressing meteorological disaster, depending on how WWII went.
