Oh boy, if you want to read another story where the main character experiments a lot and sometimes partially succeeds have I got the story for you, Savage Divinity by Ruffwriter. I've got a love/hate relationship with this story. When it hits its stride, it's very good, but the other 30-50% of the time it's either a boring slog or the same last sentence 5 chapters in a row. It also has a main character whose character flaws stick around with him for a long, /long/ time, with periods of making progress and periods of /regress/.
