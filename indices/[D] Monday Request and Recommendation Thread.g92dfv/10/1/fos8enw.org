Have you read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-world-waits-on-evil-hivers-eoa-ww-a-finished-story.274791/][The World Waits on Evil]]?

In that story the protagonist is rational and intelligent, but in many cases he lacks the critical information needed to make informed decisions. He's often at a disadvantage because his mindset is that of a 'normal' person; his mental skillset isn't oriented towards Machiavellian power plays or combat strategy.
