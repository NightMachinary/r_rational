I've been reading Enlightened Empire on royalroad for a while, and it updates again last week with a staggering 20 chapters. It's basically a transmigrator uplift story, but it has some positive points that make it unique.

*The Enjoyable:*

- The worldbuilding is very thorough and top notch. The world feels alive and consistent, and no matter where you go in the world the places are distinct and feel lived in. I had a few moments of straight up wonder when the main character describes the traditions and legends of their homeland. It's done with a quality that I don't see often in other webnovels.

- The main characters are for the most part well written. Of course, there are a few cardboard cutouts in the side characters and some of the antagonists are cartoonishly evil, but they have enough background to feel at home in the world they live in. Most of the main characters have depth to them.

- The technological uplift is done by drip feeding, with numerous, usually realistic setbacks along the way. The main character doesn't always have, say, the best methods to mass produce steel, or the best lathe to make a better lathe, and so on. Things take time to spread, and weapons technology takes time to develop. It's done in a way that feels realistic in the basically middle ages world that this takes place in. There is a big focus on logistics and bureaucracy, and ideas taking time to spread effectively, and that makes the story good imo.

*The Unenjoyable:*

- Hoo boy the politics. This story has a big focus on politics after the first quarter of the story. The politics can be enjoyable at times but most of the time it's straight up unenjoyable for me. Imagine xianxia esque politics, except it's /everywhere./ Every person prostrates themselves and ingratiates to their superiors while terrorizing those weaker than themselves. Plus there's a thing with controlling your emotions to retain face, but then somehow expressing them and shouting at times is acceptable, and slandering and counter-slandering -Just... Ugh. It's not my cup of tea, though it's competent for the most part.

- The pacing gets really slow after the first quarter, with a long period of little progress due to all the politics. That part I sometimes had to slog through, although now it's mostly evened out after the MC gets free of the situation.

Anyway, overall I recommend it if you're looking for another uplift story to read. There's a good backlog of about 650k words to read.
