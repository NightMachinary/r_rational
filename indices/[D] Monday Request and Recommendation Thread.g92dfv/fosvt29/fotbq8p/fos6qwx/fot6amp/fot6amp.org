Be warned, this fic really focuses on the canon feature of Tanya misinterpreting situations, trying to sabotage herself to the point that she can finally chill out in a safe and secure position, but ends up wildly succeeding far beyond her expectations. Lots and lots of misunderstandings. And it can be fun to roll your eyes at this, but it can also get grating. I still had a fairly fun time, but I'm taking a bit of a break from it.
