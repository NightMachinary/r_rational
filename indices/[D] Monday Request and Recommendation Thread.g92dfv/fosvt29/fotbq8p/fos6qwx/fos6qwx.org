I just discovered that "[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/reader/page-5][A Young Woman's Political Record]]" has returned to update regularly, so it is a good time to re-recommend it. This is a fun and well-written fanfic of an anime, "Saga of Tanya the Evil", to which my recommendation does not extend.

Edit: in terms of rationality, I would argue that all characters in the fanfic truly act rationally, in the sense that seemingly all decisions conceivably result from their understanding of reality, which itself is based on reasonable (if wrong) interpretations of the evidence.
