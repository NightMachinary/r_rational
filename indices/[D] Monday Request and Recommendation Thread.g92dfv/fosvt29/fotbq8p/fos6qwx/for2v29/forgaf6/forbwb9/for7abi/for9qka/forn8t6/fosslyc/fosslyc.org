The first Stormlight Archives book has a main character whose first character arc is focused on medicine and surgery. It gets different from there but there's a significant enough amount of it I'd say.

Ex Synthetica is a Worm fanfic where Taylor becomes a sidekick to Panacea, healing the sick when possible.
