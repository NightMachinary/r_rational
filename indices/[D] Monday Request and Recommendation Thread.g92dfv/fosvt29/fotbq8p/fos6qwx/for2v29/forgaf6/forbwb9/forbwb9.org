[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244][Sanitize]] is a very well written and medically focused Naruto fanfic that takes place so far in the past before canon that all you really need to know about the setting is "magic ninjas exist".

It's more about medical ethics than any practical medicine, but it's v. good.
