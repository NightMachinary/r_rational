Any really good fanfics out there? I used to read a lot of Naruto ones when I was younger, but strolling though fanfiction.com and it seems like a lot of it isn't so good. The fanfics don't have to be Naruto either. I'm mainly just looking for very well written works. I already know of the main stream ones like Methods of Rationality, Origin of Species, and Mother of Learning.
