Honestly same. I only tenuously keep up with it nowadays. It started off being fun political maneuvers (~100 chapters ago) and slowly got more and more stuck in the same damn place. I think the last 10 chapters have covered a grand total of 1 day.

But I would say it's worth reading at least the first half, maybe a bit more. Some of the twists and trope subversions are well done, and the characters are pretty good overall, except for the obvious caricatures.
