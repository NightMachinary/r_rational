So, a bit of an odd one.

Anyone have a story with a 'dumb' rationalist? Rationalism dosen't require that you be well versed in moral or ethical theory, only that you operate on the information you do have to the best of your ability.

So often though it's paired with a character who is more intelligent then most, I'd be curious to see a more 'everyman' approach.
