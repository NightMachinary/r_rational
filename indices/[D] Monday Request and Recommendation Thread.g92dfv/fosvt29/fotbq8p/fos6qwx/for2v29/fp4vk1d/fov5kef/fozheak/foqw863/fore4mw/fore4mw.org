There's a couple of really great dungeon core-ish stories going on right now:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31096/dungeon-pearl][Dungeon Pearl]]: fairly standard Isekai as a fantasy dungeon core setup, but the MC experiments with his abilities and prioritizes projects in a rational manner (or at least as rational as he can be, given that his human ADD combined with dungeon core instincts make it hard to focus). One thing that stood out to me is that the MC's experiments often fail or only partially succeed, and in believable ways. Also has some slight rationalist themes, because the MC has to do some introspection to figure out how his thinking has changed since the whole Isekai thing.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31685/the-core-of-a-factory][The Core of a Factory]]: another entry in the "tech dungeon core" subgenre, in this one the MC is a self-aware machine intelligence who opens up a sort of system thanks to "owning" enough land. This story is a lot more rationalist and transhuman than the other entries in the subgenre I've run in to (specifically Bunker Core and The Laboratory), with the AI having a fairly well defined utility function and not being either a doormat for humans or senselessly hostile.

Edit: now that I'm not on my phone, here's some non-dungeon-core stories:

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085MT4QWR][Savage Cultivator]]: a light and short read. The setting is fairly rational, the main character is as well (at least, within his capabilities - he starts the book out at 12 years old and doesn't advance much from there, socially speaking). Very similar to Dungeon Pearl, actually, in that a lot of the book is "here's an entirely new magical context for you, figure it out" - though in this case the MC didn't get isekai'd, rather all the Qi turned into deadly poison all of a sudden.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29996/the-power-of-ten-sama-rantha/][The Power of Ten: Sama Ratha]]: I am super conflicted about this story. I have a lot of thoughts about it.

On the one hand, it really feels like it scratches that munchkiny optimization spot.

On the other hand, most of the fun of these sorts of stories (like say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & Nat 20]] or [[https://www.amazon.com/Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-War-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74][2YE]]) is seeing the fun rules-as-written-but-in-reality interpretations the author has, and following along with the munchkinly optimization.

Power of Ten is not a system you recognize. It's kinda like [[https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/97252/what-is-e6-why-would-i-use-it][E6]] - based on D&D 3ish, but you cap out at level 10. Oh, and also, once you hit level 3 or so, instead of gaining level 4 you can /basically gestalt another class onto your previous class/. And you can do this forever, until you run out of classes to combine, with no XP penalty. And also there's a bunch of new weapon enchantments, that basically let you treat your +X bonuses as something to be allocated. And also there's a bunch of feats that I wasn't able to find in any splatbooks but see *really* heavy use, because they're fairly overpowered. /And then the WH40k Warp shows up/. There's no way to follow along because you haven't spent decades playing this particular homebrew system, and there's no way to know if any particular piece of munchkinry is some "rules as written are crazy ha ha" thing or just the way it's supposed to be.

Back to the first hand though: the combat is really well written, it's dynamic and fairly visceral and characters make good use of their powers and abilities. The standard "reborn in a magic world" trope is deftly handled - Sama Ratha spends her (inevitably boring) childhood years trapped in a looping nightmare full of combat, and then eventually the story splits and starts alternating nightmare chapters with post-nightmare chapters (and later, what her fellow isekai-ers are doing) and it all works a lot better than those stories that are full of four-year-olds doing push-ups.

But on the other hand, all of the isekai characters /read exactly the same/. It's like they've all optimized their personalities to the point where they're basically the same person, but wearing different costumes. And they're all continually super smug at the NPC-ish people. And also somehow the isekai cadre are only people who are able to actually optimize and find synergy in their builds, despite every option they take being available to everyone. And then the book gets in to D&D Good vs Evil and it gets pretty creepy but also really dumb.

I think what broke it for me is the author's completely inability to use "then" and "than" correctly. It's a minor thing but I don't think I spotted a single /correct/ usage of those words in the 150ish chapters I read.
