It's also how it's presented. She does the calculation in two evenings. She uses "Encyclopedias, almanacs, atlases and newspapers" as data sources. Then she gets a meeting with the president where the "calculations are on the chalkboard". The meteor hit the ocean. The model shows that the earth will cool by 70-100 degrees (no unit mentioned, I presume it's Fahrenheit) for several month, then by 2.2 degrees for 3-4 years, then it'll grow hotter and hotter within ~50 years because of the water vapor (feedback loop) from the Astroid making the earth uninhabitable.

Edit: Water vapor feedback is interesting and I found e.g. [[https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.441][[1]]] as review (in 2000). It was considered since the 1960s and Satellite observations seem to be important to confirm models. I guess the energy balance differential equation could be used in the 1950 to predict runaway water vapor feedback. Though there would be many unknowns...
