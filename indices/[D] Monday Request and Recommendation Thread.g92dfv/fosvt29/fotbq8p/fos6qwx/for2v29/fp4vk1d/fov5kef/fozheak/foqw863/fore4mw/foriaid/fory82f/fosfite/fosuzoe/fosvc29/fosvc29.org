  Even in this story it's not a very well written one in terms of actual courtship. One side is already committed no matter what, and that destroys most of the usual back and forth needed for relationship growth. Edwards just capitulates to Bella after token refusals, and or a teenage angst session.

Yeah, I think this is why I object when people point to Luminosity as an example of rational romance; it's got romance /in/ it, but the rationality is about all the Vampires Fighting Each Other type of stuff, and that is very cool. The romance is just background, even though it starts off so focussed.
