Fair enough. I wasn't much of a fan at the start either, but it really grew on me as it went on. Twig didn't seem nearly as coherent of a world at the start as Worm or Pact did, but as he wrote more he seemed to get into a groove and figure out what story he was going to tell with this book. It's probably not much of a spoiler for someone familiar with Wildbow's works, but it gets /dark/.

I'd recommend trying it again at some point if your reading backlog is looking sparse.
