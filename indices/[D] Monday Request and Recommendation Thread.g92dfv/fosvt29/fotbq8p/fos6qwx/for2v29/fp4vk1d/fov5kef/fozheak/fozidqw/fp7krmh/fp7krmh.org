Check out the /Steerswoman series/. It's an older fantasy series about a woman who discovers a strange and unknown object that people are willing to kill for an sets out to discover its source.

By and large, the novels are almost entirely about discovery, exploration, and the hardships of the journey. It's an interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy, with some good worldbuilding.
