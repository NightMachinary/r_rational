On a writing level, I love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]]. Hermione is born in the 1920ies and befriends Tom Riddle, who therefore doesn't become quite as monstrous by the time they enter Hogwarts. Really beautiful prose and intelligent, though not unrealistically competent, characters.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Alexandra Quick]] is a series of Harry Potter fanfics, which are structured similarily to the books, but take place in America in the 2000s. I'd say this is as good as the first couple of HP books in a lot of regards. It uses the magical world, but shows new sides of it, and thus manages to catch some of that sense of wonder the first HP books are so beloved for.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]] is a completed post-canon Good Omens fanfic, in which Crowley gets therapy. Has some really powerful passages, made me tear up a couple of times.
