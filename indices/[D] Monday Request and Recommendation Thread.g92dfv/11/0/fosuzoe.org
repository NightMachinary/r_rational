Aye, I'm here!

I don't really disagree with the way you've gone about analyzing Bella and her relationship with Edward. The firs time through, and on subsequent reads I'm not sure if she's supposed to come off as Sociopathic or not.

She operates for the most part rationally, but like you stated she's comfortable enough in her understanding to manipulate others to achieve her own goals. I'm a few chapters behind on the re-read, but as I recall she does not ever utilize the relationship with Edward in a selfish fashion.

Or well, beyond establishment of a relationship with romantic undertones and immortality right off the bat.

I would tend to agree with the assessment that Edwards life story right off the bat is a little hamfisted, but from his perspective it is a marginally intelligent thing to do. He's already laid out the facts that he is a vampire, in utter love with Bella, and reluctant to make her immortal.

He thinks he's a Monster (which he is), he has no control over his infatuation, and the morality of his generation is still a factor in his actions. Attempting to contextualize his extraordinary claims is warranted.

As for the actual romance, meh. Even in this story it's not a very well written one in terms of actual courtship. One side is already committed no matter what, and that destroys most of the usual back and forth needed for relationship growth. Edwards just capitulates to Bella after token refusals, and or a teenage angst session.

It's likely on my mind due to the horrid looking movie coming out but the last good romance I came across with the things you're looking for would be this nice collection of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/17774][Artemis Fowl Stories.]] Particularly [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/382799/chapters/626026][In Another's Eyes]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/389481/chapters/638697][Fowl Ties.]] wouldn't recommend jumping into these cold as they are towards the end of this AU but relationship buildup is rife throughout the universe. Although In Another's eyes elevates two background characters to the forefront, so maybe..
