Any recommendations on stories focused on the surgeon profession or something medical related (e.g. litrpg with system focused on being a better doctor)?

Recently reread Iryuu: Team Medical Dragon which is a pretty good manga about a brilliant surgeon and corruption in Japan's medical system. Not sure how rational it would be considered to be, but I'd probably say it is at least rational-adjacent. I will warn that it has a brief sex scene in the first chapter, but doesn't come up again in the rest of the manga.
