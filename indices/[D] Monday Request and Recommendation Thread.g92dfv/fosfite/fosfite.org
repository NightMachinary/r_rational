So, as I promised in last week's thread, I'm doing a weekly read-along "review" of Luminosity, a great Twilight fan fiction that, much like 50 shades, really should be given a chance to stand apart from its humble inspiration.

So here we go, [[/u/weerdo5255]] , hope you can participate like you promised! And of course other interlocutors most welcome :)

--------------

So, I just finished chapter 6 (of 29) last night. So it'll take about two months for me to read the whole thing: strap in, cats and kittens!

Spoilers below.

--------------

My main criticism of Luminosity as a romance novel was that the vampire romances are magical and immutable, and that's definitely the case, but I forgot that back when Bella is human she goes through a whole lot of stuff to do with her relationships and those of people around her.

In particular, she:

- Identifies someone has a crush on her and tries to manipulate him and another friend of hers to get together (review: I've never done anything like this, but it's presented as sound and logical and she has no illusions that they're going to get married)

- Is carefully considering how she feels about Edward and the whole "forced eternal love" thing, however, she is, quite rightly growing resigned to the fact that she has no control over it, and if she's wanting to be immortal (stated early as one of her goals), she's going to have to give up to it.

- There's a great part in I believe chapter 6 (maybe 5) where she talks about how much power she has over Edward because of his magical "falling in love with her" thing, which was really cool.

So it's some interesting/good stuff about early relationships, but my criticism of it as a good example of romance is that it is lacking some features:

- Bella is shown to be very carefully calculating whether she wants to be attracted to Edward on some level; for me, a more "pure" romance story would have her being attracted to him and acting to determine how to act based on that. Writing it out, perhaps /that's the point/, perhaps she's meant to be carefully calculating whether she wants to like this guy, but... I don't know, I feel like what I /want/ is for her to be attracted to him and not be able to control that and try to work through all the pros and cons of that, whereas she seems able to be detached enough not to be affected by it. The conversation where Edward told his life story to her was a really good addition, though, as it made me feel like she might actually like him as a person, though understandably it was a bit annoying that it was more of a "tell, don't show" situation than I'd like.

- For me the main work in romantic relationships is /maintaining them/. Having fights. Making concessions. Growing and changing as a person thanks to your partner(s) advice/support and helping them grow and change. I've not seen any of that yet (but we're still early in the story so I wouldn't expect it). I'm going to keep an eye out.

Rationalist bona fides:

Something I didn't notice Bella did, that I think I need as a lesson in my life right now, is when she's mad she asks herself "is what I'm mad about stopping me from getting what I want?". I found myself asking myself that the other day when I was angry about something, and it was good.
