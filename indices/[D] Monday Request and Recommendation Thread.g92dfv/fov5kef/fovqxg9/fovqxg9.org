Disappointing news. I kind of wish it ended when he avenged the captain (and himself, sort of). That was a great scene. One gripe I have about recent chapters is that the author has fun with some potions (seer gets a lot of play, clown, faceless, and to a lesser extent puppetmaster or whatever), but he is doing very little thematically with the bizarro class, it just feels like he's gaming it and it's less interesting to read.
