Is there any rational fic about Better Call Saul or Breaking Bad? I find it fascinating how Gus acts like an optimization agent in his environment and acts in somewhat rational ways or at least following a logical pattern and aiming towards maximal efficiency and minimal waste.

The contrast between Gus method to Walter White or Lalo Salamanca's heuristics is fascinating and makes me wonder if anyone has explored it before.
