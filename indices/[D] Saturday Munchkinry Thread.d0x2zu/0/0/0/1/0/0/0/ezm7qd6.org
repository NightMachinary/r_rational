That's a very good question. How do they work when going uphill, or over uneven terrain? If you're walking towards a hill, could you end up half-buried in the hillside? Or, if you've reached a hilltop and start heading down, would you end up constantly falling down as you move forward? Or do the boots slightly nudge your teleportation to always land your feet on the ground? Do you have some degree of conscious or subconscious control to direct where the boots will take you?
