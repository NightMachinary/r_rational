Countered with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-looking_infrared][FLIR]] and thermal NVGs. Your body releases heat both through convection and thermal infrared radiation, so unless this spell also happens to roast you, that heat will have to go somewhere outside of your bubble.

"Abused" with echolocation, an inertial navigation device with integrated map and compass, or a thin wire and small camera to poke out of the area of effect. I say "abused" because these, at best, only let you do things you could normally do. The ability itself inherently already has a variety of uses that could be considered abuse.

No counter. In regards to "abuse" could conceivably cure myasthenia gravis and a wide range of neuromuscular disorders.

Could potentially be abused if any other ability allows increasing stride length, like some kind of shapeshifting ability. See boomfarmer and my response him for counters.

  Oobleck Cloak

Countered with pepper spray and other chemical weapons, flamethrowers, and other energy weapons like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Acoustic_Device][LRAD]] and lasers, as well as slow-moving attacks like melee weapons. Or just aiming for areas that aren't covered.

Could be abused by having someone with this covering their whole body using blackout invisibility and standing in front of you. Then apparently exposed areas might not actually be exposed.

  Oobleck Blood

Why? Just because the blood hardens doesn't mean you're safe. All the force being applied to that patch of blood just gets transmitted to the tissue behind the point of impact. One blunt impact and suddenly you've shredded a ton of blood vessels and you're bleeding to death. Is this a debuff that we're trying to avoid getting cast upon us?
