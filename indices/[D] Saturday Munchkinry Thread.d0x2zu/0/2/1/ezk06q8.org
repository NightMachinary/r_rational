FLIR and thermal NVG both are still viewing light, just like your eyes. It is just light in a different part of the spectrum. Any magic technology that perfectly warps visible light around someone to render them invisible would likely be just as invisible unless the magic didn't work for all kinds of light and was "tuned" to only warp the visible parts of the light spectrum, but why would you design an artifact that way?
