The thinner blade concentrates force to a single point or line. It's inherently a force multiplier, by being an area decreaser. Non-newtonian fluid would become more rigid the more force you apply, so a blade should make it behave like a solid even more than a punch. With normal Oobleck, the solid physical behavior doesn't make it strong enough to RESIST the blade, but with the Oobleck Cloak we can assume it's stronger.
