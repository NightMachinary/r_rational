Yeah, I've learned I was wrong for a few reasons.

My current understanding is that 10N on a single point is still 10 Newton's, we've increased the psi on the single point by using a blade, but that does not change the amount of force.

Let me know if I've got this right.

For examples sake, if your Oobleck becomes solid at 10N and can withstand force up to 20N. Then your weakness is a slower, forceful stab under 10N, you're protected like armour between 10 and 20, and your armour breaks for anything above 20N.
