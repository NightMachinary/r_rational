Blackout Invisibility can be prevented by casting a spell that causes the invisible person to glow. Ideally, they will glow in a distinct color of light. Warping light that would hit the caster doesn't do anything if the light is emitted from the caster. You may also be able to use the caster as a lightweight but imperfect analogue to a black hole's gravitational lensing.

Blinkstep Boots could be countered with glue. Depending on whether you count a "stride" as two full steps, fetters would also work by preventing full steps. Also, if it's teleportation, since they can walk through walls, make sure the walls are more than three times the length of the stride of the person with the longest legs. Four times if you're pessimistic, and six times if you're an Evil Overlord.

Nervestep might be countered by forcing an opponent using it to rely on muscle memory rather than conscious motions; trained motions would go awry if executed entirely within the peripheral nervous system at accelerated speeds, since the mucles would not respond at speed.

An Oobleck Cloak is susceptible to sustained loud noise at a frequency that helps keep its particles suspended.

Oobleck Blood would likely kill the caster on their next heartbeat.
