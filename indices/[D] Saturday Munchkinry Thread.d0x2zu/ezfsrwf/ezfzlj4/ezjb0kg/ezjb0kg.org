I'm sorry, but I really can't see how the blood one would be helpful. I don't know enough to say all the different ways it would jack you up, but you're essentially giving the caster a giant, transient embolism for defensive purposes whenever he gets hit. An impact anywhere near the lungs would have alveoli going off like popcorn; an otherwise glancing blow to the head becomes brain damage. Assuming the ordinary jostle and stress of blood flow doesn't set it off; like boomfarmer said, the heart thumps.

What if you cast a spell to convert a thin layer of air around you into a sheer-thickening fluid of sorts? That would be a closer mimic to the cloak.
