Blackout invisibility would work as radiation shielding, correct, not just humanly visible light?

If so, there are some obvious applications. You would be immune to radiation while it was active.

If not, then you could wear UV goggles to see and any animals or people equipped to see outside the conventional human visible spectrum would be able to see you.

Edit: UV, infrared, x-rays. and basically everything else would be able to see you.
