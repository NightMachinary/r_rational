It's magic so ultimately you decide what rules it goes by. I think the biggest to consider is that whatever the spell threshold is, is has to be higher than the internal forces on the body, or it needs a second component to provide an exception for internal forces. In which case the exception could be what you use to exploit as a counter.

Whatever you do this [[http://www.digitaldutch.com/unitconverter/pressure.htm][webpage]] might be a useful resource for unit conversions.
