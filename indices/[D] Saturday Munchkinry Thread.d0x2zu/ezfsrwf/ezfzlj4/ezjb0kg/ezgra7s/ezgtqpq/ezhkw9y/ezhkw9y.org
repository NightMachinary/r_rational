I actually think that it would be a better defense against blunt force impacts rather than a bladed weapon.

The purpose of a blade is to be thinner and require less force to cut. Blades might actually be the counter to this spell.

You can have the force threshold of the spell high enough that you won't be stopped by your own heartbeat, and have it be useful for massive impacts like a mace or a cannonball.

Possible alternative uses: telling someone it's â€˜feather fall' and pushing them off the roof.
