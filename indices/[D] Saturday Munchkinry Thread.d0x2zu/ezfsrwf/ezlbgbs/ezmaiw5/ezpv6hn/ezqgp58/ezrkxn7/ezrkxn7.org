Hm. The difficulty is that the atmosphere's around 1% CO2, which isn't a lot to play with. Given time and sufficient fine control, you could probably build structures out of it, and have an infinite supply of custom tools. You could disrupt electronics by growing things inside them, which has its uses. Don't know enough about their properties, or engineering, to say much about those applications.

In the absence of a Manton limit, the easiest application of any telekinetic-type power is going to be stealthy murder, humans being so easy to kill.

EDIT: you could probably get fine control over fires/burning, with some practice, by rapidly replenishing their oxygen supply.
