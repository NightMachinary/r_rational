It belatedly occurred to me that your exhalations have a substantially higher volume of CO2, even if the overall atmospheric percentage is much lower. This means you could, if you chose, build small objects inside your mouth, stick out your tongue, and tah-dah! By exhaling through your nose instead, you could make your nose hair appear to grow quite dramatically as well. Fun party tricks.

You could also, at the rates specified, blow a steady stream of black powder out of your mouth more or less indefinitely. Since that's basically powdered graphite, you could make anything slick that way--not sure if powdered graphite contains oil too, but the powder itself no doubt has applications.
