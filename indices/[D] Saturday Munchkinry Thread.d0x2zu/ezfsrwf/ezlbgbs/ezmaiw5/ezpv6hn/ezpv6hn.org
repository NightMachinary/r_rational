Do you wind up with leftover oxygen? CO2 is very small percentage of the atmosphere, so the effect would not be dramatic either way. The main use I see right now is assassination; anybody within ten feet gets a lot of black dust in his lungs, assuming you can do this quickly. Suspect it would be a fairly nasty and protracted kind of death, and highly resistant to treatment. Would they go anaphylactic, I wonder, or just shred the small airways?
