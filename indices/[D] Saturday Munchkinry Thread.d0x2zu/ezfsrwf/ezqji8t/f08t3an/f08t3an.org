Not all radiation is light; alpha and beta radiation consists of helium nuclei and free electrons, which would not be stopped by the spell. However, they are easily stopped by air or skin, so they are not too dangerous. The real danger in irradiated areas is ingesting or inhaling radioisotopes, because once they are in your body there is no shielding to save you. The cloak doesn't stop that either.
