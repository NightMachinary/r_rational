-Blackout Invisibility is a spell which warps light around the caster, making them invisible but also preventing light from reaching them.

-Nerveskip is a spell which accelerates the transmission of signals down nerves to the point that it is practically instantaneous; casters of this spell still have a reaction time, but that comes from processing in the brain and not transmission time of sensory or motor nerves. The spell does not affect the brain (if it did it would cause seizures.) The effect is overwhelming at first but casters acclimate to it quickly.

-Blinkstep boots are a magical artifact which teleports the user with each stride, in the direction of the stride, to a distance roughly three times as far away as the length of the stride. The effect can be toggled on and off.

-an Oobleck Cloak is an alchemically-enhanced cloak whose lining is filled with a layer of impossibly non-newtonion (shear thickening) fluid. The cloth acts like heavy but normal cloth under most conditions but hardens in response to stress, similar to modern liquid ballistic vests, but better.

-Oobleck Blood is a spell which applies a similar effect to the caster's blood. I've not yet worked out the math to a point where I'm confident that this wouldn't kill the caster, so if someone well-versed in fluid dynamics has an answer, that would be great.

How could these spells and items be abused or countered?
