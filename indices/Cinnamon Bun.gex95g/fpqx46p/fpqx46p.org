Fun, and I'll probably read the whole thing, but Cinnamon Bun is really not a human. They don't give their classmate a message for their parents? Or feel angst, or starvation (concerns about poison should decrease after getting Identify)? They practice cleaning rather than trying to grind for Stealth or other plausibly-useful skills? They don't notice the weird domesticity of their assigned class and immediately try cooking, sewing, etc.? They don't even think about signalling the airship?

The story would be a lot different if these sorts of things were fleshed out - and not necessarily better at being what it is. But the protagonist would definitely be more of a person, and less of a doll animated by the needs of the plot.
