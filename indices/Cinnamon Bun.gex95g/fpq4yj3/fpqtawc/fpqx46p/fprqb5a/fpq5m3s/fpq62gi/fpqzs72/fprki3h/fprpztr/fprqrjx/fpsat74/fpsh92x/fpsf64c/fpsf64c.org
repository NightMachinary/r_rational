Oh you are in for a treat.

First of all The Erogamer is erotica, so written porn. But it is so much more. The best description i could give is that it is an erotic rational existential horror comedy. It is funny, scary and sexy in all the right ways. It tells the story of a girl who wakes up one day as an erogame (like a japanese porn visual novel/ or porngame) protagonist. There are silly and funny arcs, but the story also deals with very heavy topics like power, individual rights, body image, rape and consent in a very intelligent and considerate manner. Saying anything more would be a spoiler. The only reason I have not suggested this to my friends, is that suggesting porn to people you know is embarrassing.

You can find it on questionable questing, the nsfw section. It is honestly amazingly good and the writer puts in so much effort.

Edit: Here is a link, you have to make an account to read the story:
