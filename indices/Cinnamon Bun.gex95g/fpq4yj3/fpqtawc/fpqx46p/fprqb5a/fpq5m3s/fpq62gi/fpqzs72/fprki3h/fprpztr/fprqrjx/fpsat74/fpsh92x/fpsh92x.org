I don't know how much you already know, so I'll define some terms first, because it's hard to explain Erogamer without those terms.

A Quest is a kind of interactive fiction, where the audience votes to decide what direction the story will take next, and the author continues the story in the direction that the audience has decided. An example of a Quest would be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gac3jc/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/][Legacy of the Goddess]].

A LitRPG is a kind of fiction (often portal fantasy) where the protagonist finds themselves in a role-playing game, with stats, and levels, etc., and has to discover the rules of the game, and find a way to survive and win. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/galt0r/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_196200/][Worth the Candle]] is probably the most popular LitRPG in [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

There's a subgenre of Quests that overlaps with LitRPG, called Gamer Quests. It's a LitRPG where the direction of the story is decided through audience participation, so pretty much just the two previous concepts combined.

Finally, there is a genre of game called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroge][eroge]]. I'm not going to go into any depth explaining that; if you want an explanation, click the link. The TLDR is: erotic anime videogame.

So, The Erogamer is a Gamer Quest where the protagonist finds that the rules of reality have been rewritten so that, while she's still living in the same city, with the same family and friends, she's also the protagonist of an eroge, and her life has accordingly taken a turn towards the surreal.

As you might expect from an Eroge Gamer Quest, it's decidedly, explicitly, over-the-top NSFW. Like, so NSFW that you have to register for the forum where it's posted, in order to get access to read it, because they don't want people stumbling across that kind of thing accidentally.

And it's very, very well written. Not just "well-written for a NSFW Gamer Quest," but well-written /in its own right/. It deals with themes of depression, body image, transhumanism, consent, and more, and does so in a sensitive, thought-provoking way, yet without losing any of the fun of its premise.

If that sounds like it interests you, [[/u/MisterCommonMarket][u/MisterCommonMarket]] has provided a link.

One last caveat: it is currently on a coronavirus-related hiatus, so don't expect updates for a while. However, it's pretty long, so you shouldn't have to worry about that right away. I guess my point is: don't rush through it.
