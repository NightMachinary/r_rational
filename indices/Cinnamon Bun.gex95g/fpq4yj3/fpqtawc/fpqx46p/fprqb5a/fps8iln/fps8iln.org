Yeah same - I like it and it's fun, but I don't think it belongs to any of the specific definitions of "rational" in this subreddit.

However, I do think this story falls into a lot of the themes that people who like rational fiction also like. In my head I think of it as the "sensibility porn" genre; classically, it's exemplified by things like the way Ankh-Morpork deals with invaders: by welcoming them in and selling them things.

It's not rational, but it is reasonable and sensible in extreme situations - just because you got Isekai'd to another dimension doesn't mean you should automatically assume everything wants to kill you. Why not talk to the monsters before resorting to violence?
