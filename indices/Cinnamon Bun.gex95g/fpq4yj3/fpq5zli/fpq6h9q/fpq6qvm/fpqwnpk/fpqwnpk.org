Deconstruction is one of the tagged categories for the sub on the sidebar, so I think it's pretty reasonable to post one here, personally. LitRPGs tend to be hard magic, too, which is another valid tag for the sub. I haven't actually read this one, but I don't mind seeing things that aren't full rational here as long as they're properly tagged (and this one seems to be).
