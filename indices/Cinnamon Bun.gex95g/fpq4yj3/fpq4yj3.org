Hello [[/r/rational][r/rational]]

This is Cinnamon Bun, a comedic take on the typical LitRPG, where every trope is played backwards. The main character is happy and doesn't know the first thing about angst, she gets exactly no overpowered skills, and her luck isn't all that incredible.

The idea was to take every staple trope and cliche and do the opposite while still keeping to the core of what makes a story a LitRPG.

It's currently available on Royal Road, where it will be updating every weekday (Mon to Fri) until it drops off the front page, where it will continue to update three times a week for a long time (I hope!)
