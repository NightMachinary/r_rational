Read the opening chapter. This feels like pretty much like the oppiste of rational. The deconstruction makes it go future into the oppise diaretion of what rational fiction is. Unless the story changes in other chapters it is based around an airhead mc who the skill box littearly describes as niave and too pure. All the signs point to this being a deconstruction of a the niave mc whos super luck and friendship powers lead them to defeating the bad guys, which is anthore way of saying the oppist of this sub.
