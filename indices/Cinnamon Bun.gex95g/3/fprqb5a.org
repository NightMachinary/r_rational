My hot take:

I have been reading Cinnamon Bun and I like it a lot. It is very good and I will gladly recommend it to everyone. I am just not sure its rational fiction. This is not a negative thing either, I dont think the fic would be nearly as good if Broccoli was a very rational protagonist. Now, this might of course change later if Broccoli for example starts to think more critically about some of her priorities and wondering how these classes might be effecting her mental state. So depending on how meta you are going to take this (the Erogamer is good nsfw example of taking all the implications of being a protagonist of an erogame to its logical and terrifying conclusions, with out making the protagonist some avatar of rationality), the fic might eventually fit in here, but I just dont know if it fits right now.

Generally if its good and people upvote it, that seems to be okay with everyone though so I hope some people see this thread and find something they like.
