Arithmancy and Ancient Runes can both do literally anything or everything you want, neither of them have been really defined and tied down at all by Harry Potter canon. A fairly common fanon would be something like Runes to make magic items, and Arithmancy for making new spells - but really whatever you want to roll with is plausible for these classes to do, neither of them are terribly well described or at all interesting in canon. Also, the reason for Astronomy to exist as a course is pretty mysterious and weird, and having the night sky actually matter in some way to magic could be interesting.

I think that it would be sort of weird to have illusion magic bracketed out as you describe, and not part of e.g. charms or whatever. I like illusions a lot, and think they're underused in most fiction with magic, but what narrative purpose there is to having an entire extra class about them in specific instead of having a scene with Flitwick teaching an illusion spell or a character picking up a book of illusion spells is really not intuitively clear to me. I mean, I don't hate it, and I think that most fanfiction doesn't go far enough in transforming source material... but if there's no underlying reason, spending wordcount introducing a new OC and a new class with new stuff in it just seems sort of pointless.
