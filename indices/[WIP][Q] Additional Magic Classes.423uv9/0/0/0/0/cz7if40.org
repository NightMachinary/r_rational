I don't want it to be that easy, the trades should be approximately equal. Like sacrifice one eye and gain superior vision in the other. The sacrifices should be major enough that hero's wouldn't be morons for not simply using them to win every fight, but villains would be willing to sacrifice others to become stronger. Rituals should be more beneficial to villains than heroes or the lack of use they see in the books wouldn't make any sense.
