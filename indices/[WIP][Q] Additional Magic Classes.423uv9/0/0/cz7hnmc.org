I guess your point about illusions is correct, it could be dangerously world breaking. However there is some use of ritual magic in cannon (bringing back voldemort in book 4, as well as the unbreakable vow). I was planning on ritual magic to be different in that it required sacrifice (whether in magic, resources, or souls which seem to be real in the HP universe) however in return it should have powerful near permanent effects.
