I think you should group magic by effect, not cause. If you want to add ritual magic, what does it do that 'normal' magic doesn't? If it transforms things, you might as well put it into Transfiguration. If it enchants things, Charms. And so on, and so forth. During canon, the contents of lessons changes rather a lot from year to year, and we never see the contents of Year 7, so you can even plausibly add it without being too AU.

Illusions would be a good example of a new subject, if you really want one. However, think about how it would break the setting. Do the villains know it? If so, how does that change the background of the setting, before your story starts, or if it doesn't, why not? Basically, any /useful/ power you add should change a lot of the setting, and any power that doesn't change the setting much isn't very strong. It's a bit of a problem unless you are willing to rewrite large parts of the history and magic system from scratch, like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][Wit of the Raven]] for example - the changes in worldbuilding become apparent after a few chapters, although the start is a little uninspired.
