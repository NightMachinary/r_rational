There's got to be more to magics of the mind than Occlumency and Legilimency, right? There could be an elective course in the later years on things like magical mental illnesses, how exactly /Imperio/ works, dream magic, the risks of bootstrapping your test scores, and the current theory behind hypothetical long distance telepathy spells.

I was going to say something about how "elective course in the later years" is likely the best place to add most subjects not already in the core curriculum, but then I remembered that if this particular brand of magic were real, I'd want almost /all/ of it, save for theory and a few simple charms, to be confined to college courses with many prerequisites.
