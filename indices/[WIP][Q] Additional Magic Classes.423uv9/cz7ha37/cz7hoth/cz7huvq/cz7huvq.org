I'm pretty sure enchanting items with some magic is different from making magical items. I think the latter needs magical parts and it might not be all just casting a spell at a mundane object, like the stuff for core for the wands. There is a reason why some brooms are better than others, unless you think they just keep refining their make broom fly spell wand flicking and pronounciation.
