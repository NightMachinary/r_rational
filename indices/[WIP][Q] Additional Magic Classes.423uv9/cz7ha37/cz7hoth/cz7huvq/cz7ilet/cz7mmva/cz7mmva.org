I think it'd stand to reason if an Enchanted item, one with a permanent effect like a broomstick, would require a magical component prior to wandwork, while, by contrast, a mundane item could be /Charmed/ by wandwork alone, but the effect would be strictly temporary.

It's not like there isn't, apparently, a large variety of miscellaneous magical resources lying around, and an entire magical economy that trades in them almost exclusively.

EDIT: I tried looking into it, and as an example, while we know that no wizard knows why muggles need rubber ducks, it's unclear if there is even a market among wizards for materials with interesting-but-purely-mundane-in-origin properties, like rubber.
