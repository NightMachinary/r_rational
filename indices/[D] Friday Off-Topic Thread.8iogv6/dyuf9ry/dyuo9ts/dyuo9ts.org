Depends on your definitions for exciting and interesting :)

But based on my own, there are a few things that I wouldn't mind talking about:

- I'm making a [[http://felix.prinz.name/villageBuilder/index.html][game]].
- I'm writing [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14620938/chapters/33789492][fan-fiction]] for The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant, from the point of view of the Dragon.
- I have a [[https://dnimeht.wordpress.com/][blog]], and there are statistics over when people have looked at it and from which country. Especially the last part I find fascinating, because there is so much variety. I also wonder how people came to find the blog. I told friends and family, but... I don't really think any of them read it. I haven't put the link out anywhere on the internet (before this very post). So I assume that it has something to do with it being hosted on Wordpress where people can find my posts through the Discover feature or something like that.
