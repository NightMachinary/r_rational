I want to start writing some fiction but i suck at motivating myself to actually write. I am so lazy...

also my drivers license exam is coming and i suck at driving so i am really worried

there is also my technician exam which i am not worried about because its easier and i am feeling rather confident about that, atleast more confident than i am feeling about the drivers license exam

i just finished my aprenticeship and it was shit. I am never working that job again. Shit hours, shit commute, exhausting af and boring. I felt like dying everytime i had to wake up 4:30 am to get there on time. Also since summer is almost in full swing already and i am allergic to pollen i wanted to die even more while working outside because i had to blow my nose every couple of second ( the skin on my nose is all cracked because of it) ughhhh even after 5 years of treatment its still horrible. And on the last day of work we had to go near the ukraine border and there were so many mosquitos there. Like if you stayed in one place for a second something like a 200 or smth mosquitos instantly tried to get onto you and i am not exaggerating when i say 200 it was as if a whole beehive was onto you so to not get bitten all over ( my friend thought he woulnt need a hoodie or full lenght pants and got bitten all over although he got a replacement hoodie from one of our coworkers who worked somewhere else but the short pants made his life misarable...poor lad). It was 30 degrees celcius so working in a hoodie while digging holes in a dirt, raking the earth and planting grass (WHICH SHOULDNT BE MY FUCKING JOB!) was god damn horrible and i dont want to repeat that experience ever again.

I also want to get some summer job abroad when i will have vacations but i kinda think i realized it too late and it looks like most of the things are taken...ehh maybe i will try next year.

I also have some ambition of learning programming but the same thing with writing i am lacking motivation. I once started learning, downloaded codeblocks and started doing some things in accordance with some guide but i didnt get too far and forgot most of it by now cause it was in middle school. Also being more technologically literate would be cool like knowing your stuff about PCs etc so i could build my self one that is on a budget or smth. Are there any usefull sites to learn such things ? i used to learn programming on cpp.pl which is a polish site since my english in middle school was a lot worse than it is now i think i am more confident in trying at some english course. I know its probably easy to find and its just a case of googling it but are there any really good ones that people tested or learned from themselves ? i have some aspirations as a game designer since yeah, i kinda like games etc.

It kinda bums me out when i see guys younger than me or my age doing amazing games or some cool engineering when the only thing i ever do is is surfing the net and playing games when i am home. My excuse is that school and all the things like drivers license and other exams are taking a toll on me but yeah... its mostly because of my laziness

atleast my and my friends smithy project is going kinda good. We are like making a smithy for a year already but thats mostly because we live on the opposites sides of town and its hard to meet up cuz the bus times are horrible. Hopefully it will be easier when i will have a car. Its almost done tho and we can finally make some cool swords or smth
