  Way back in 2009, when I first played [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gale_of_Darkness][/Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness/]], I was endlessly impressed with how every monster had two separate "shoot beam from mouth" and "bite/swipe/charge at the enemy" animations, on top of which the generic animation for the move being used was layered. Much later, I learned that [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Contact][every attack in Pokémon has a flag that represents whether or not the move makes contact with the target]].

Isn't the second sentence in the paragraph presented above hideous? It's terrible, how, if the verb in the subordinate clause of indirect speech describes an ongoing activity, there's no alternative to either breaking [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_of_tenses][the sequence of tenses]] or falsely implying that the activity did not continue to the present... :-(

I randomly decided to waste a few hours in watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKahXPxTGfY][a playthrough of /Doki Doki Literature Club/]]. It reminded me of how much I dislike visual novels.

Years and years ago, I played some of [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Katawa_Shoujo][/Katawa Shoujo/]], and I got quite angry at it.

  Oh, here's a hawt gurl sitting in a library! Would you like to walk up to her and say hello? No? Well, actually, a gigantic chunk of the game is gated off behind this action that you absolutely never would take IRL, even though it's supposed to be an "immersive experience" (that has a relatable main character rather than, /e. g./, an action-RPG protagonist). This "game" actually is nothing but a set of parallel stories that shouldn't even /try/ to be immersive in the first place. Also, we wasted a bunch of effort on art when we could have just written a half-dozen short stories. ;-)

IIRC, I ragequitted after getting into some stupid argument with the default/fallback (armless?) romance choice (since I'd skipped all the others without realizing what I was doing). Months or years later, I tried [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/299540][a proper text-only CYOA]] and found it similarly annoying. I also tried a few text-parser games ([[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb][example]]) and watched Yahtzee Croshaw's [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkiai4nXBVL8CqfMQk4KMtKibKJUfBwZ][playthroughs]] of his /Trilby/ series of point-and-click games, but the CYOAs seemed more like cute little toys than actually-interesting games (let alone stories), and the point-and-click games looked quite annoying to play.

In my opinion, the typical visual novel puts too much effort into immersing the player in the motivations of the character---motivations at which the player may /actually/ be curling his lip. In order to play a visual novel, I /must/, not only read the character's thoughts, but also act in immediate and total accordance with those thoughts! An ordinary, /non/-interactive story, on the other hand, gives to the reader the freedom [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715/51][to empathize with the character]] or [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][to keep the character at arm's length]], in accordance with how friendly he feels toward the character.

(This argument probably can be leveled against a linear, non-open-world RPG, but such a game still contains less browbeating of the player because all the cutscenes can be skipped. Of course, if cutscenes /can't/ be skipped, or if the game's action sequences are separated with "walking cutscenes" in which the player has merely-nominal control while the character discusses his motivations at great length, the argument is bolstered...)

Reminder: Trolling /properly/ is considered the /combination/ of baiting and lying. A person who /genuinely believes/ his inflammatory statements is /not/ a troll---but he /is/ still baiting for [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-here-s-your-you][(You)s]], if he doesn't actually expect to convert anyone to his side of the argument.
