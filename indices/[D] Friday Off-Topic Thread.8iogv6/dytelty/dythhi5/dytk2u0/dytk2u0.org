It's "proper" in the sense that it's the original definition of such, way back in the days of yore when trolling was a art. Linguistic drift means that it's sadly entirely valid to use the term to mean "being mean on the internet", rather than the amusing practice of making an obviously erroneous statement on a forum and (seemingly) earnestly defending it.
