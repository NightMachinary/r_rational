In ASOIAF or GoT it's always "King in the North". Why King IN the North? Why not OF? Maybe because North is actually a direction but that seems too shallow. (could be the reason though)

In real medieval Europe such "connections" had actual meanings. For example Brandenburg-Preussen. They(the Hohenzollers) were the rulers of Brandenburg and Prussia and because they weren't allowed to be Kings in the HRE, their titles were "Prince-elector OF Brandenburg (Kurfürst von Brandenburg) and King IN Prussia (König in Preussen) so they technically were still a prince in the HRE. But Kings outside of it.

But in ASOIAF there isn't such a circumstance and I am probably thinking far too much about something which was probably thoughtlessness by the Author. Just wanted to say it.
