I was ready to call it quits on /Full Metal Panic/. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8gzxzd/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dygpdoq][It took seven episodes for me to warm up to it]] and the rest of the first season was a mixed bag. I liked the show whenever Sagura and Kaname were together, even if the story was /far/ from nuanced, but when they were split up I was just bored.

I expected there to be filler, the problem was that almost none of the filler took place at the high school where all the episodic comedy happens. Even when Sagura's job took him places that get referenced later, I really didn't enjoy those episodes because they felt like pointless tangents at the time.

But then I gave the purely comedic Fumoffu season a shot and *I busted a gut*. I don't remember laughing this much at a anime since /One Punch Man/. The story is complete nonsense, of course, Sagura and Kanme are stupid even compared to the first season, but I don't care because it's so funny.

This is some quality anime comedy with perfect dubbing and spectacular visuals from Kyoto Animation that I recommend to everyone. It's all dumb on purpose so it's not like you need to know that these characters are also from a serious military thriller story, but for me it heightens the absurdism.

The experience of watching this anime is one of the strangest personal narratives I've ever gone through. The first season was really just okay at its best, and boring for long stretches, yet I enjoyed it anyway for some reason. Now my loyalty has been rewarded with the comedy I never knew I wanted.
