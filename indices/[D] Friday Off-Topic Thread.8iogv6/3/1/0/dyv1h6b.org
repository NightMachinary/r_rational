You can sort of combine playing games and learning programming. There is a rather small genre called programming games. It teaches the abstract basics of programming that trip up many people that start with text.

Some recommended examples:

[[http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/]]

[[http://lightbot.com/flash.html]]

[[http://www.zachtronics.com/the-codex-of-alchemical-engineering/]]

(And all other zachtronics games)

There are also some programming games on steam. (But these cost a small amount of money).

Like Human Resource Machine and Opus Magnum.
