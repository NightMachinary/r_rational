Why do you think that this type of media portrayal comes from a legitimate social trauma? Commercial media creation is not a democratic process. Nor do people usually watch and like the movies/shows that portray workers' unions this way because they really enjoy that specific fact as the main appeal.

Honestly, just look at how pro-capitalism even poor people are. They routinely vote against what would clearly be in their best interest, selfishly seen.

If that is due to wholesome libertarian ideology or due to rampant capitalist propaganda is for yourself to decide.
