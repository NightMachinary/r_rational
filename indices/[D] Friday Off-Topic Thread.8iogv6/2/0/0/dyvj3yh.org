  Why do you think that this type of media portrayal comes from a legitimate social trauma? Commercial media creation is not a democratic process. Nor do people usually watch and like the movies/shows that portray workers' unions this way because they really enjoy that specific fact as the main appeal.

First, let me point out what I wrote (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  *I wonder if* there's the societal trauma the US went through, where unions killed off industries in their 'shortsighted' demands for higher wages, better working conditions and OSHA compliance.
#+end_quote

It was just one of the scenarios I could come up with, in the likes of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Riots][swing riots]], destroying products and machines of industrial manufacture the workers use to emphasise and make a point of their plight during the strike.

Like I said, it's not a part of US history I know anything about. I find it curious how this stereotype came to be and wonder if there's an actual foundation to be pointed towards that inspired it, or if it's a slow accumulation and gradual development that came about in light of the developments in the old world.

Another factor could be the socialist reforms that were talked about for a long time during the 19th century before they were implemented in various European nations, and how the American Way of Life with its deep-seated roots in capitalism, personal enterprise, and such was threatened (or at least /felt/ threatened) by these reforms, with newspapers and opinion columns reporting and caricaturising these events from afar and drawing a more fearful picture that later transformed into the self-harming unions stereotype.

Again, like I said, I'm not a historian, this is just guesswork on my part. It'd merely be nice to know more about it, especially in some comparative way.
