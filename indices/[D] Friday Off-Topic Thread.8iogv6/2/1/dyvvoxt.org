I'm in my union at work (engineer's union) and I find it a very positive organisation though it does get a little political at times. Mostly just in a partisan way, the worst experience I had was I went to a union training session and they politely asked us if we'd like to stay back to cold call people to vote for their preferred candidate, and I and a bunch of other people said no and there was no pressure or shaming or anything so overall not too bad.

In Australia at least, unions are the reason a lot of our great benefits are there: things like employers having to pay 9.5% of your wage into a retirement account, four weeks of paid leave a year, two weeks of paid sick leave a year, legislated minimum conditions for different types of job, extra pay for working on the weekend, maternity leave, long service leave (I get 3 months off, paid, after being at my employer for 7 years), redundancy (usually about 12 weeks pay if you're fired!), etc. These are all things that people take for granted here (and probably sound like unicorn tears to people reading this in the USA).

This has all been happening for a ridiculously long time and Australia isn't some jobless wasteland. (Aus unemployment: 5.6%, USA unemployment 4.1%; but we have unemployment benefits for basically as long as it takes you to get a job...)
