I think context-switching is something that you can get better at, and if you can't actually carve out time from your other responsibilities, that's probably what you'll have to try to do. The actual question of "how do I find time for writing" is a much harder one, and depends on your specific responsibilities and/or schedule.

Some techniques I've found helpful for either writing on a consistent basis or being able to jump back into it:

- If possible, writing should be your default background mental process, i.e. the thing that you're thinking about when you have any time at all. If you've got a commute, that's a good time to think about writing, rather than zoning out. Even if you're not "writing", then your time is still being spent working out problems or thinking things through, which makes getting it on the page easier, and (in my experience) getting it easier to get into the flow state.
- Be careful about where you leave off, and how you spend your writing time. I try not to leave a scene unfinished, if I can at all help it, because coming back into a half-done scene means that I'm spending my writing time trying to get back into that specific headspace, rather than just the general world of the novel.
- Use notes, especially for upcoming scenes (though this sort of depends on how heavily you outline). I think that when you're "in the zone" you can sort of lay the groundwork for your return to "the zone" at a later date, but that's its own special sort of skill, and very individual. Toward the end of a writing session I usually try to leave myself a line about what the next scene I'm writing is, and I have a doc with a few dozen scenes that I'd like to include at some point, which helps me get back into it without taking up a huge amount of time (though I hardly ever look at those notes, since they're all part of the persistent background processes and the kind of stuff I think about when I'm not actually writing at the keyboard).
- Make writing as much of a habit is you can, in order to wear in that groove, and ensure that there's no rust when you start back up. Writing is, in many respects, a muscle, which doesn't just snap back into perfect condition the moment you need it. But you already said that doesn't really work for you, so I don't know -- included here because I think it's good general advice, rather than good advice for you specifically.

If none of that helps, which it might not (because that wasn't your actual question), and the problem really is just time management, we'd need to know more about your specific schedule in order to know what you might be able to drop and/or change.
