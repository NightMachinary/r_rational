so, anybody have any suggestions for finding time to write while juggling other responsibilities?

I find context switching very hard. It's very difficult to get any writing done without spending a lot of time to get into the flow. (I've tried the "oh, write for an hour each day, or write /n/ words each, or whatever, but had no luck.) Right now, I've found a system where every couple of weeks, I set aside 3-4 days to do focus on writing. After the first day I can focus consistently. But then after 4 days I get sufficiently beyond on my phd work and the like, and then I have to stop.

This has an OK output level, about what I can reasonably expect me to achieve given my current writing experience level, except sacrificing a bunch of days in a rows kind of sucks and makes other things in life hard.
