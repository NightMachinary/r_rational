So, I'm writing a novel, studying part time, and working full time. This is more organisation specific than writing specific, since that's where I excel. *cracks knuckles* here's the strategies that work for me:

- Bake everything into your routines. Saturday mornings I typically spend 2-3 hours broken between studying and writing. After work I go into an empty office, log onto the computer there, and spend an hour or so after work doing anki cards or editing the novel. Since I'm still in the office building, it's not distracting like being at home and having to worry about cooking dinner / walking the dog. I normally finish work at 4 so I stay until 5 working on personal projects.

- On the above, change your context. I found I got a lot more done when I wrote in libraries than when I wrote at home, because home has all these distractions and the libraries have none.

- This TED talk inspired me to do the above, by the way: [[https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_vanderkam_how_to_gain_control_of_your_free_time/transcript?language=en]] particularly the following passage:

#+begin_quote
  She comes home to find that her water heater has broken, and there is now water all over her basement. [...] So she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night, next day she's got plumbers coming in, day after that, professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet. All this is being recorded on her time log. Winds up taking seven hours of her week. Seven hours. That's like finding an extra hour in the day.

  But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week, "Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?" "Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?" I'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said, which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?" Yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement, she found seven hours. And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic. We cannot make more time, but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.

  And so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater. To get at this, I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed. By busy, I mean she was running a small business with 12 people on the payroll, she had six children in her spare time. I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview on how she "had it all" -- that phrase. I remember it was a Thursday morning, and she was not available to speak with me. Of course, right?

  But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike, because it was a beautiful spring morning, and she wanted to go for a hike. So of course this makes me even more intrigued, and when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this. She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do, every minute I spend, is my choice." And rather than say, "I don't have time to do x, y or z," she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority." "I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority."

- Examine what you're doing and what you want to change. I use a productivity website called [[https://complice.co/?r=uv93q4n34x][Complice]] that has you do a weekly review. I noticed last week that I hadn't got any writing done at all, and decided I had to lower the priority of my study time in order to fit more writing time in. (note: complice link is a referral link, but it gives you an extra week of trial)

- Measure things that are easy to measure. I prefer to measure time rather than outputs, because if I say "no going to bed until I finish editing this chapter/write this many words", I know there's a risk it could take me hours and I never get to bed which means I'm going to let myself off the hook. Better to use a time goal. Complice has an integrated pomodoro timer, so I have started using "pomos" as my time limit: so for a typical Saturday morning, for example, I might say, 1 pomo studying anki cards, 1 pomo working on my talk, 1 pomo working on chemistry, 1 pomo working on my novel. That's about 2.5 hours of time and I'll get a hell of a lot done.

- If you need words written, check out beeminder: [[https://www.beeminder.com]] - I used URLminder and google docs to force myself to get a word count. If I didn't get that word count, I had to pay $5. It helps keep you accountable to yourself.

- You have downtime. You're on the toilet. You're waiting in line for coffee. Make that productive - like someone else said, you can think about your novel, think about plot ideas, but also work out ways to scaffold other parts of your life into that time. I use anki decks to study and I use the phone app during those times. I can get 15 minutes of study done every single day just from those moments where I'm at work waiting for people to attend a meeting, waiting for coffee, and pooping. I don't know how this works for you - maybe you can do stuff related to your phd on anki, or maybe you can use a note taking app to brainstorm, or maybe you can use it to sketch a scene out in dot points. Even if it's less efficient than using your computer, it's time you'd have wasted anyway.

- I reward / bribe myself. "Can't start making breakfast until I've done one pomo", "that pepsi you're craving will only be yours if you've done a pomo of project status reports", etc. Only ever small things that I get immediately after my equally small achievement.

- Don't be too hard on yourself. The biggest thing that gets me in my work day in terms of productivity is my "shame spiral". I don't get much done which means I feel shitty about myself and keep on not getting much done, "the day is wasted anyway". I try to think what my best friend would say to me and internalise that rather than thinking what a failure I am. Also, if I have a real shame spiral sort of day, I try to change my to do list to just one or two stupidly easy things, or break tasks down to steps the include "open the program", "click on the link", "type in the name of what i'm searching for". It's motivating to give yourself some wins.
