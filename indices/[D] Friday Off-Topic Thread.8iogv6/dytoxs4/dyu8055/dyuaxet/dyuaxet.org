I don't how representative my mindset it, but man did beeminder /not/ work for me.

I went through cycles of being more active to get ahead of their productivity curve, having periods of lower activity, forcing myself to work more to stop being in the red, getting tired of forcing myself, and getting dinged.

It's roughly at the point I stopped using beeminder that I started thinking that the "accountable to yourself" approach was not working, and that I really wasn't capable of holding myself to pre-set objectives and deadlines. Since then I've started thinking in less in terms of deadlines and more in terms of priorities and moment-to-moment productivity, and I think my average productivity has gone up since; my happiness certainly has.

I don't know if I'd recommend my approach to anyone else, since it's basically "wing it and try not to set too many hard objectives".
