I had an epiphany two weeks ago and allowed myself to recognize the fact that I'd been in a depressive state for quite a while, noticed its correlation with the fact that I've been a shut-in hermit for like a year, and started taking vitamin D supplements. I feel less numb, and more capable of thinking. There's a lot of contradictory information about it on the internet; but, anecdotally, it's seemed to work for me. YMMV.
