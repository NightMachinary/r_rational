I'm starting to seriously think that my mood is strongly tied to the day's weather, to the point that I'm wondering if I might have some sort of variation of seasonal affective disorder.

I've often noticed that I felt happy in motivated during sunny days, and sluggish and depressed in cloudy/rainy days, even when I'm spending most of my time working indoors. I used to made jokes to friends about how the only possible explanation was that I had mood-triggered superpowers that controlled the weather, but now that I'm paying attention to the correlation it seems way stronger than confirmation bias would explain. Or maybe this is just placebo+nocebo effect, and me noticing it has made it stronger.

Any insights?
