It's weird you got tired of forcing yourself and that's a bug; for me it was a feature. I had a goal to finish the required reading from the textbook by the end of the semester and each page was a chore (it's a textbook, not exactly Grisham!), and every day I read 2 pages so that I wouldn't be dinged made me more motivated to read 15 pages on days when I could so I wouldn't have to go through that again.

You can see I start out having frequent emergencies and towards the end I end up building up huge bits of buffer because I decided I didn't like the "eep" feeling as beeminder calls it. Which was great because it meant I was doing my reading at better than my goal pace!

At the end of the day it's personal preference, if you found a system that works for you then awesome! But thought I'd offer my perspective on how I benefited from the same feeling that made you stop using the service.
