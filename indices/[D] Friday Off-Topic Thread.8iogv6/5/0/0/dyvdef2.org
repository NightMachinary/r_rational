I can be decently productive in my downtime (commutes and so forth), in terms of thinking of story/plot/character ideas, the issue is actually with you know... sitting down to write.

My general life strategy is that when I'm having trouble being productive, I just switch to whatever task is on my mind that's distracting me from doing the task I'm 'supposed' to do be doing. I believe this is basically like structured procrastination or closely related. The problem is... the task that I switch to is almost never 'writing words on a page', UNLESS I'm in one of those days-long writing flow states which are painful to get in and out of. I guess what I'd /ideally/ like to do would be to pack some writing into the 2-3 hours of downtime I have every evening but I can't swap in that fast.
