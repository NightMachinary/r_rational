You need to bake something into your routine IMO, and if you have 2-3 hours of downtime every evening it's possible. I'd aim for something small and achievable - 20 minutes, maybe, or 30.

Here's a few places you can bake it in, depending on your exact life setup:

- In between your daytime activity and your evening activity, stop at a public library or quiet coffee shop with a laptop. If you're in the coffee shop, order the cheapest drink because that's the social contract. Write for 20-30 minutes. (If you don't have a laptop, try borrowing one for a week; if you want a cheaper alternative to a laptop, you can buy bluetooth keyboards that hook up to smartphones and let you type quickly onto their screens. Public libraries generally have computers you can use.)

- As above but use your lunch break.

- Presumably, you eat dinner. Spend 20 minutes (before you start cooking / while another person in the household is cooking for you / before you place your takeout order) writing.

- Presumably, you shower or brush your teeth. Write immediately before / after this time.

- What are you doing for those 2-3 unproductive hours? For me it's netflix. Promise yourself that you can netflix as much as you want with abandon after spending 20 minutes writing.

- Find something that isn't important, but would still be useful, that is even harder to motivate yourself to do than writing is. For example, cleaning your room, organising your cupboard, vacuuming the house. On any of the above steps, you have the choice of writing 30 minutes or doing that activity 30 minutes. Worst case scenario, you do something else that is useful.

It's hard, especially at first. I used to leave the office at 4 and be home at 4:30. The first time I stayed till 5 it was a chore because I was thinking about how I could have been home already. But I toughed it out and now it's completely natural for me to take my backpack from my desk and go to an empty office and start studying.
