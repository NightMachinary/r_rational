Yeah I might have overreacted. My actual point was merely that media, especially in cases like this, doesn't always necessarily reflect a widespread social opinion/bias and sometimes can be the actual source of such stereotypes.

I too don't know many actual details on this part of American history, though I do know that both corrupt and self-defeating union leaders definitely exist, at least in my home country. But (as with most things) so does the opposite, and not infrequently. Which side gets portrayed then becomes a choice of the media item's producers.
