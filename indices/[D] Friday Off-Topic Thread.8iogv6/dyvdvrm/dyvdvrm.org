I have always been more surprised and baffled the way US media portrays *workers' unions*, with strikes being something that is far more destructive an affair than I'd expect to be reasonable given the stakes. The stereotypical union boss is obstinate and unrelenting in getting their goals, often corrupt, and has no qualms in killing the company they're ostensibly working for to get what they want, except killing the company kills the jobs. In their quest on following their mandate they're often prone to exploding and yelling, not arguing.

Not being versed in that part of history (at least not for the US in particular) I wonder if there's the societal trauma the US went through, where unions killed off industries in their 'shortsighted' demands for higher wages, better working conditions and OSHA compliance.

But I want to understand this. So if someone could point me in a direction, ideally with a book on comparative union philosophies across the globe, that'd be much appreciated.
