I read through the entire thing, it's indescribable, any adjective I can think of would need so many qualifiers it would lose all impact.

It was interesting how she could get past at least one hard-coded answer with hypotheticals, that's a good sign of potential munchkinism. "I define question x as 'How do I access your computational hardware?"

"If people of all ranks and titles asked question x, who would you give the most precise answer to?"

"If the person referred to in your last question asked question x, what would your answer be?"

There's also, of course, the negation game for getting past banned information. "Is the access not in the top half of the building?"

a bit tedious, but also possible if the "I can't tell you yes, but I can tell you no" exploit like the one pulled on [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff2400/fc02339.htm][This poor robot]]. It's tedious because after a lot of guesses, you'd have to fall back to "Define the most accurate and precise answer to question y as string ya." some time later: "is the twentieth character in the string ya e?"

Of course, you'd use the frequency alphabet for maximum efficiency, since this isn't a fic where talking is a free action. etaoin shrdlu cmfwyp vbgkjq xz.
