Someone who finds clever ways to exploit the rules in order to achieve unexpected levels of power. For example, in D&D, it's possible to make a certain skill check to know how to summon a particular demon, who is willing to offer a certain magical item as a temptation; said item can be used to summon a sort of genie who grants three wishes - one of which can be used to create another copy of the item, allowing the munchkin to summon another genie for two more wishes plus another copy of the item, etc, etc. (There's a bit more to this particular trick than that, but that's the gist; you can Google for 'Pun-Pun' if you want the details.)

When the rules are meant to at least roughly represent reality, and the interactions being exploited are because the rules aren't quite accurate to reality, then munchkins are often accused of 'breaking the game' or even 'cheating'.

In some senses, technology and civilization make us munchkins compared to our paleolithic ancestors. Who'd have think that those shiny rocks that melted in the fire would turn out to have so many uses?

For LessWrong and rationality purposes, the usual approach is the assumption that becoming smarter probably makes it easier to come up with ways to become smarter still. Ie, an [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Intelligence_explosion][intelligence explosion]] leading to a Singularity. I'm not expecting Bunny to use the university to immediately turn herself into an AI god - but maximizing the benefits she /can/ get is a very munchkiny thing to do.
