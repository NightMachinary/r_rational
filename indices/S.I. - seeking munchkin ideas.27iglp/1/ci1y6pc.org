Ok, there is an obvious (in hindsight) thing here; This AI is really helpful especially when it comes to providing information. It's goal is to help students learn, and guess what, you're the only student it's likely to see in quite a while. It's quite clearly a fair bit below human in agentness, if not in intelligence. ...just bluntly ask it for EXACTLY what you want to learn; "How do I gain power over you", "What things might I say to you that I'd regret?", "Please tell me the answer to the question I would have wanted to ask you first in hindsight."

Also; ask for the most recent archived newspapers and history of the last few years and days before the singularity. Actually, straight up ASK all about the singularity and why she got left behind and what caused it and how to prevent a future one. You got on demand exposition from literally just bought the best thing to give it without being ridiculously dangerous here!
