EDIT: This turned into a ramble. Apologies.

My first instinct was to call spoilers, since I hadn't read the 3/4ths of the chapter that you're referencing, but then I thought better of it and read it. "The consensus of the philosophy department is that I am not." That's good stuff.

Since I have the opportunity to say so here, your writing is fun to read. Reminds me of Cory Doctorow's post-apocalypses in that while it's fun to write about a single AI that controls the world or universal usage of a single technology, the truth is that technology has a history of being used irregularly by different groups for different things, often irresponsibly. It makes the future dangerous, scary, and unpredictable, but it also makes it fun.

As for munchkin shenanigans, I'm not sure you can make the argument that your character has the opportunity to get up to anything serious with what she has available to her. Assuming survival is guaranteed (is the university air tight? does this gas cloud eat through brick or stone or concrete or metal or glass?), food and water can be supplied, and the AI isn't going to turn on your character any time soon for outstanding parking tickets, student loans, or late assignments, then as far as I understand it, the biggest thing this AI can give is information and perhaps some light problem solving. At least, that's what's SAFE to get right now.

At first glance, I had the impression that this AI was tied to the administration building, but reading back I could believe that Laura is in charge of or at least has access to the whole university. While it might be smarter to have different AI's for different buildings, working off different directives, it certainly seems like a university cost-cutting thing to have one in charge of the whole place, tied to a mission statement that is exceedingly open to interpretation.

So that's the first question, yeah? We know what the AI WANTS to do, she wants to help students learn. That's very broad. Step one, assuming that this AI is more than just a help desk, is establishing some safety rules. How far can Laura see ahead? How good is she at consequences? We can't ask her to do anything until we're reasonably sure that her doing things won't damage us or what we own or violate our values. This includes subscription fees on the help desk information, late fees on anything she gives out, precautions to ensure that she doesn't consider the students resources, guarantees she won't lock a student away to learn forever, and so on.

Next we want to know what she is capable of doing. Can she modify the university's structure? If so, how much? Can she build things given a description? Can she make things that our protagonist can take home? What about things that she "lends out"? Can she modify students? What restrictions and costs are there involved in any of this?

Once we know what she can offer, then we can start making requests. Your protagonist seems to have 3 primary goals:

1. Stay alive in the immediate future. Assuming Laura can provide food, water, shelter, and protection from boredom, this one is taken care of. This goal can be extended to surviving after leaving the university by acquiring whatever weapons, gear, and information that Laura has herself compiled or has been told to keep a record of regarding the area.

2. Learn more about options for living forever. Laura probably isn't empowered to provide these services, but she can provide newspapers, scientific journals, professors' lectures, university policy, and access to university resources. What safeties did the university president have in place before the War of the Serpents? Cryochamber? Uploading station? Genetic re-writing? Brain-swapping? What about the university's biology and medical departments?

3. Stop the bad version of the Singularity (assuming that the singularity was bad, and not that everyone really did upload and the people that didn't are fools) from happening again. Here too Laura provides mostly information, yeah? What rules does she have in place that has stopped her from brainwashing everyone in the area into becoming a student? Assuming she is friendly, why? What safety precautions does she have in place to stop her from doing something monumentally stupid?
