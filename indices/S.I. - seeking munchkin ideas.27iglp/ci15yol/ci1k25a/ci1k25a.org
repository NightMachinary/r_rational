  This turned into a ramble. Apologies.

No apologies needed; I appreciate the ideas, whether or not they're directly related to my question.

  It makes the future dangerous, scary, and unpredictable, but it also makes it fun.

I've gotta admit that it's fun to try and come up with as many weirdtopias as can fit into the setting's basic premises. :) (Technoville for Yudkowsky's "isolate dangerous knowledge" proposals, the Great Peace for tweaking the value of personal identity/integrity, etc.)

As for the remainder of your response, you've hit quite a few nails on their heads. I should be able to incorporate at least some of that analysis into the next chapter; though, of course, the protagonist's life is going to encounter a few complications along the way. ;)
