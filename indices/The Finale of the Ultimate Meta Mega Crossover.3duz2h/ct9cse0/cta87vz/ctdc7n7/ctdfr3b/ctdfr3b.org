They are labelled: 1000, 4 x 10^{4,} and +1

As in:

1000 = *Thousand* Shinji

4 x 10^{4} = Shinji and Warhamer *40,000*

+1 = 1 more = *Once More* With Feeling

Corroborating evidence:

- The sequel to Thousand Shinji, the Open Door, is on the Less Wrong fanfic favorites list, and on the Yudkowsky favorites list where he posted this story.

- Shinji and Warhammer 40k is on the Less Wrong fanfic favorites list
