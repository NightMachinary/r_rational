Wow, that was really interesting.

Also, that line about "can't run a computer program without a computer" really seemed significant. Now that I think of it, what would a fundamentally basic universe even LOOK like? Maybe there ISN'T any fundamentally basic universe, and there are infinite levels of recursion in both directions. Although it might also be more of a hierarchical web, since there's no rule that says that all universes must contain only one simulation, or any simulation.

But infinity isn't a number, so how can existence be infinitely recursive?

I suppose maybe there IS a base reality, and it's a logically impossible universe. Or maybe everything that exists at the most basic level is pure abstract math or something. Wait a minute, what's the simplest possible operation that a computer can do? Because if if the more basic a reality gets, the more computing power it has devoted to it and any simulations within it, and the simpler their laws of nature/magic get. How simple could the laws of nature for a reality get as you go down to more and more basic levels? Isn't the most basic operation a computer can do a selection between 0 and 1, or on/off, etc? No wait, that's base 2. Maybe the most basic reality is a computer operating in base 1. But then, you couldn't really have enough detail to make a universe if your only law of nature is state={0 or 1}, and definitely not anything simpler than that, either. So what's the minimum amount of bits needed for something to be detailed enough to be considered a "universe"? I probably don't know what I'm talking about at all...
