What is going on: A bunch of people are recursively finding out that their universe was a simulation on another universe's computer, which universe itself was actually a subset of a universe accessed by a magic spell, which universe itself was a daydream of a higher being... etc, etc, ad nauseam, for hundreds and hundreds of layers, each time picking up people who thought of that 'layer' of reality as the actual baseline. The settings that are awoken into explicitly on camera are the Zones of Thought by Vinge, and Permutation City by Greg Egan. The characters are from books, anime, games, etc. and even fanfic, and many of the characters hail from settings where dimensional travel is possible in one form or another - and they've been clumping together into a group to travel into different universes pretty constantly as a growing society.

As to who the specific characters are, well, from the reviews of the fic is a character list I cannot better (I don't know who the shaven man talking of neutrinos is either - anyone here?)

#+begin_quote
  Pham and Ravna, of course (who were new to me, as stated)

  Haruhi (Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and sequel light novels/anime - Hruhi and Kyon (below) seem to appear here in a fanfic version, though)

  Harold Shea (the Mathmagic series by Lyon Sprague duCamp/Fletcher Pratt)

  Merlin (not the wizard, but Corwin's son from the second Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny)

  Jake Stonebender (from the Callahan's Saloon series by Spider Robinson)

  Xander Harris, Jedi? (from the Buffy/Star Wars x-over fanfic?)

  Lazarus Long (from the classic books by Robert A. Heinlein)

  Shinji Ikari x3 (originally from the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime, of course, but here apparently in fanfic incarnations, from Thousand Shinji, Shinji and Warhammer 40K and, probably, Once more With Feeling (?) in particular)

  Asuka Langley Soryu (also NGE, but which version? Maybe another fanfic, and if so, which one?)

  Belldandy and Keiichi Morisato (from Oh! My Goddess manga/anime)

  Alice (in a grown up version; originally from the classics Alice in Wonderland/behind the Mirror by Lewis Carrol)

  Kyon (also from the Haruhi Suzumiya novels/anime)

  Mr. Spock (from Star Trek, of course, but for completeness' sake: the (original) TV series by Gene Roddenberry etc.)

  Oops, I also can't place the "tall man with a shaved head", even if his neutrino question seems... familiar.. somehow...

  Sgt.(?) Vimes (from the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett)

  Miles Vorkosigan (by the appropriately named Miles Vorkosigan series by... mompls... ah, right, Lois McMaster Bujold)

  Harry Potter ("boy with the scar on his forehead" is nowadays such an obvious description... ;) from the overly famous Harry Potter novels/movies by J. K. Rowling, of course)

  Mr. Rogers ("man in the bloodstained sweater" obviously refers to the end of "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny" by Lemon Demon, not to the original from the PBS children's TV series "Mr Rogers Neighborhood". EXTREMELY fitting, since the song/video is just as full of cameos as this story)

  Tohsaka Rin (this one I had to google: from Fate/Stay Night which I don't know (yet))

  John Constantine (blonde, trenchcoat, complainer; from DC comic's Vertigo line, Hellblazer and Books of Magic etc.)

  Kenny (orange winter coat - from the South Park TV series, of course)

  Belgarath (from the Belgariad and Malloreon Sagas by David Eddings)

  Clarence Shandon (from the appropriately-named book "Silverlock" by John Myers Myers, another cameo-heavy story)

  The Doctor (from the longest-running SF series ever, BBC's "Doctor Who", of course)

  Daniel Jackson (from the Stargate movie/series, of course)

  Dream (Morpheus, the Sandman etc., also from DC's Vertigo line Sandman, originally written by Neil Gaiman)

  One of the Monty Python crew ('Get on with it!')

  Nathan Brazil (from the Wellworld series by Jack Chalker)

  The Nameless One (from the old but still GREAT D&D computer game "Planescape: Torment", the main character)

  Prince Adam of Eternia (aka He-Man, TV series "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe" etc. - "as if adressing an audience of six-year-olds" - LOL)

  Neo (aka "Mr. Anderson" ;) from the "Matrix" series)

  "Number forty-two! Maybe /this/ time I'll learn the Question" - Arthur Dent (most probably, but could be any other of the cast of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams)

  "Tvelve! Tvelve vorlds! A-ha-ha!" - who else? The Count (from Sesame Street by Jim Henson etc.)

  "Seventeen is the mystical number" - Vlad Taltos? (from Steven Brust's "Jhereg" series)

  Just Mentioned by Miles: Dorothy and Glinda (the Good Witch) - from the Oz series by L. Frank Baum and successors)

  Maria Deluca (also new to me, as stated)

  Xena, Warrior Princess (from the TV series, of course)

  [...]

  (Oh, and character note: Squirrel Girl is from Marvel Comics, a character with mostly trivial or ridiculous powers - except for her uncanny (humorous) ability to win /any/ fight, with /anyone/, no matter how powerful - the Hulk, Wolverine, Galactus ... and obviously, here, God/Jehovah - OFF-SCREEN!)

  Characters who show up at the end party:

  Menolly (from the Dragonriders of Pern series' Harper's Hall trilogy by Anne McCaffrey)

  An unnamed Lensman (or maybe "the" Lensman (main character), Kimball Kinnison, from (most of) the classic "Lensman" book series by E. E. "Doc" Smith and successors - there's even a (bad) anime around)

  As stated, I unfortunately can't place the "sensuous woman whose deep oaken irises were marred by a single crimson-red dart."

  #+begin_quote
    For anyone curious, the exhaustive character list already posted was missing the woman with a blood-red dart in her eye; she is undoubtedly Phèdre nó Delaunay of the Kushiel series by author Jacqueline Carey.

  Gillian Baskin (from "Startide Rising", one book of the Uplift series by David Brin)
