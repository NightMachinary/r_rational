  Shinji Ikari x3 (originally from the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime, of course, but here apparently in fanfic incarnations, from Thousand Shinji, Shinji and Warhammer 40K and, probably, Once more With Feeling (?) in particular)

Huh. I thought these were Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion, End of Evangelion, and Rebuild of Evangelion, the three 'canon' works.
