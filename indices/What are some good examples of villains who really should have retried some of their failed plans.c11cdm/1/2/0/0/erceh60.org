Yes, the movie's interpretation of it is a bit cartoonish, but you can also imagine one specific leader being pivotal to the success of a movement. Sometimes wars are won or lost because of the right (or wrong) man at the right time. Would Chamberlain had done as well as Churchill in WW2? Would the USA have gotten their independence if it wasn't for George III's mistakes? Sure, the ingredients were all there, but in war you can squander a big advantage with a serious enough error. And rallying people up (and keeping them united) also is an important skill, that some leaders display more than others.

So my point is, while I think the notion "without John Connor there is /literally no hope whatsoever for humanity to survive/" is indeed a bit silly, the idea that without him their chances might drop isn't all that weird. Though it gets weirder I guess when we /see/ John Connor as a kid and he doesn't look especially smart or charismatic or anything.
