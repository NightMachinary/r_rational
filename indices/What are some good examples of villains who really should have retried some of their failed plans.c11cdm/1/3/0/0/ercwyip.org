Wouldn't work due to a limit on how far you can send things back in time as explained in Terminator: The Sarah Conner chronicles which limits time travel to ~40 years each time IIRC. Of course that doesn't mean that skynet didn't have a buttload of options available to it that would work far better then what it did use.
