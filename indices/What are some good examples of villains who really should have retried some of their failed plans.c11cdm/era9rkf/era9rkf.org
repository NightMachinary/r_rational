Magneto in the first X-men movie had a working machine that turned people into mutants. The one converted human died a few days after being converted, and that was after swimming a great distance in the ocean.

He /really/ should have tried to tinker with that machine some more. Turning (willing) humans into mutants isn't even evil. Experiment on willing, dying patients who are willing to gamble on a random mutant power that might cure their illness or whatever, and try to get the machine to a point where it doesn't kill you, so you can get healthy volunteers. If even ten percent of humanity would volunteer to get free mutant powers, his work would be so much easier going forward.
