The machine slowly kills the operator, and could only be operated by a metallokinetic. This was so central to its operation that the only way Magneto came up with to use the machine without dying was to have Rogue steal his power and use the machine instead. Magneto doesn't see himself as evil and was willing to test operate the machine himself, so he presumably didn't know a better way to build it.
