Necro post. I believe the idea for the deathstar was that the 1st one was a shit show as all 1st build concept projects are. By the time it was finished so much had changes it barely met the old schematics. So having made 1 you now know how to build a better one. There were always going to be changes. And if the design was streamlined it could be bigger in the same time.

The weapons were because hubris and traps.
