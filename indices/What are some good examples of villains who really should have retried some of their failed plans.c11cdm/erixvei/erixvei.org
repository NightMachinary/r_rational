I can actually name somewhere this was subverted pretty well in the web serial Pact. MC stops a group of time mages from doing a ritual only find out that the guy they sent to talk to him while he was heading home was just delaying him while the antagonists recast the ritual from the beginning because why the fuck wouldn't they?
