Brain from /Pinky and the Brain./

Every scheme he ever tries comes within an inch of working (or /actually works, but he abandons it anyway,/ e.g. in the Christmas episode).

For one example: he figures out a way to take over the world that, in a contrived coincidence, requires that he maximizes the amount of money he could win on a /Jeopardy/-style quiz show. He fails the Final Jeopardy question, which is a pop-culture reference, despite the fact that Pinky has been making that same pop culture reference for the entire episode. But, when he fails to get the money, he writes off the plan entirely, even though he could have just come up with some other way to get funding.
