It's a fascinating side of the world of the Matrix that isn't explored enough. I think they have what we would consider an orange-and-blue morality, utterly alien to us, at least in some respects, but with some degree of consistency. Anyway, do check out the Animatrix if you can, it is one of the best things to come of that franchise, all around. A lot of small stories that deepen the lore in minor or major ways, and are often just good sci-fi stories in their own right. There's even a couple of shorts directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, of "Cowboy Bebop" fame.
