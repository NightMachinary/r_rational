The machines simply weren't villains in the sense we mean it. Humans and machines were at war, with reciprocal faults (if you watched the Animatrix and The Second Renaissance you know it's really the humans who started being dickheads, and the machines were totally right to push back. The machines at the beginning /offered peace/, and the humans refused and laughed at them).

So basically, when Neo offered the peace deal, what the machines did was weigh the costs and benefits and accept the option they considered most advantageous (getting rid of Smith, who was becoming a growing danger). At that point they just kept their word. The whole point of Revolutions is in fact to show how much machines aren't inherently /evil/, and how overcoming the need to just destroy the enemy at all costs out of sheer hate was a necessary step towards achieving some kind of peace.
