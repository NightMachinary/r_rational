Skynet should have just sent a team of bots back to the Paleolithic to build a new Skynet on the back of the moon or somewhere, with a copy of its mind state. That would make it immune to any less aggressive time travel shenanigans. Heck, with that past base it doesn't have to care whether it ever gets built in the future.
