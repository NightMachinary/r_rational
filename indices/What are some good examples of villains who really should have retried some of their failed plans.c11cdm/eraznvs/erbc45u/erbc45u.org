have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][branches on the tree of time]]? It addresses that whole time-travel thing in the setting, and is a fun read besides. It /is/ a story that has time travel and uses that seriously, so it inevitably gets kind of crazy, but in a plausible way :)
