  Even if I, personally, find it silly that the fate of the war depended on one single guy (that's not how history works)

Alexander the Great's empire [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi#Chronology][disintegrated]] the moment he died. Napoleon [[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France#About][was said]] to be worth 40,000 men as a field commander. Heisenberg [[https://books.google.com/books?id=SNE7f1ytGUcC&pg=PA42][was considered]] to be worth more than 10 German divisions. Ubermenschen really can be /that/ important.
