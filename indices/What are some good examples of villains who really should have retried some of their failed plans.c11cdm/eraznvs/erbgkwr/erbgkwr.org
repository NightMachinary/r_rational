I disagree, in the sense that there might indeed be some certain convergence points where so much hinges on such a tiny event that someone being killed at the right time can send the whole thing spiralling away. The most blatant example I can think of is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov][Stanislav Petrov]]. Guy single-handedly averted a nuclear war. Kill him in 1982, have him replaced with some other dude who's much more of a party drone that simply thoughtlessly obeys his orders, and you've just turned the Earth into a glassy, radioactive wasteland. One man, massive difference.

Or imagine John F. Kennedy /not/ being killed in Dallas. Or Abraham Lincoln. Or Archduke Franz Ferdinand. How does history go there? It's hard to think it wouldn't have far-reaching consequences.
