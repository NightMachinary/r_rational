Is the OP meant to ask

#+begin_quote
  "...really should *not* have retired ..."
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  "...really should have retired ..."
#+end_quote

Everyone seems to be answering the former even though the latter is written. Just curious, not that it matters too much, both are good questions.

I think a lot of super hero villains have a plan that revolves around fighting the super hero. Yet the super hero tends to come out on top pretty consistently. It seems like the smart plan would be to actually avoid fighting the super hero all together.

1. Keep them busy with fake crimes.
2. Avoid the super hero's area of operations altogether.
3. Coordinate a crime spree with other criminals.
