Everyone cites that one episode, in the midst of some of the worst writing the series has ever had, as proof of Buffy being helpless against guns. She gets shot at quite a bit, in one case even by helicopter mounted automatic weapons [Sanctuary, Angel 1x19], and more or less aim dodges those for the entire scene. What happened with Warren was an exceptional circumstance.

Newly turned fledglings, with very few exceptions, are impulsive, stupid, and more flammable than dry kindling. Expecting them to behave as some kind of elite military unit and not a disorganized mob are farcical.
