Oh man, D-Gray Man. I've never run into anyone else who watched the show. So, with apologies, I'm going to take the first opportunity I've seen to rant on it. I remember feeling outright *betrayed* by the end of the show's run, despite thinking it was unironically cool through most of the early episodes (I was right in the early male teen demographic it was aiming for).

It's just...the central, *defining* theme of the story was the inevitability of death and the futility of trying to bring the dead back. From the first episode, even, where it's revealed that every Demon is born from a Faustian bargain for the resurrection of a loved one. The entire schtick of one of the main characters was being able to hold off the deaths of others, but /only/ so long as they could keep awake. Another joins the cast mostly seeking death because their loved one had already died. It's shown over and over again that death is final and meaningful because of that. It's not a message friendly to this particular subreddit, but it was at least consistent in pushing it in every episode.

Then comes the penultimate arc of the anime adaptation, which consists of /twenty episodes/ of continuous fight scenes, with several character deaths made more meaningful by the fact that the show's premise is that death is final. After all that, though, the protagonist /effortlessly/ and /costlessly/ resurrects all his friends who died (and notably, none of the villains despite his self-professed neutrality on the issue). It isn't even his goal at the time, as the point was getting control of the Ark/teleport device; it's just an unearned, un-foreshadowed side-bonus. But it instantly undoes the culmination of the character arcs of half the cast, makes the past *seven hours* of episodes completely pointless, and fundamentally breaks the premise of the series. I just kind of gave up on the whole thing. Who cares what happens to them, when the author has already proved willing to bring them right back again if they die? Who cares about the story, when the author abandons its central theme?

So, yeah, the inconsistency of the Millennial Earl in pushing sensible plans is the least of the issues the series faces towards the end of its run.
