Nah, the anime was pretty faithful to the manga in that regard. But there's some context to /why/ that plot development occurred, which the manga goes on for in considerable length. In a universe that runs on christianesque tropes, the protagonist is being played as a Messiah figure. It's pretty blatant in the plot developments after the resurrections, although it's also foreshadowed even before that point.
