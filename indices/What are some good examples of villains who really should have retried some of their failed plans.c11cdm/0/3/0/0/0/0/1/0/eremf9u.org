Not sure, but you can't use the Death Note to tell someone else to kill another person, and you can't write your own name in the instructions for someone else's death or it'll work just as a regular name and you'll die.

The possible hack is this:

/Bad Luck Brian.\\

Car Accident\\
Decides to take a walk before dinner, carrying a pen and a lighter with him. At the corner of High Road and Low Street, hidden under a manhole cover, finds two sheets of paper, one with a name, the other blank, and a photo. Copies four time to the best of his abilities the name on the blank sheet while looking at the photo. Then burns both the paper and the photo. A car hits him and he dies instantly./

Since the Death Note can't make him kill someone, he will /have/ to misspell the names, and it will be involuntary, which makes you gain immunity. However there are two risks with this:

1) the Death Note is smart/flexible enough about the rules that it interprets this as YOU purposefully misspelling your own name four times, and you die;

2) the Death Note can't make Brian misspell your name and he just dies of cardiac arrest, leaving your name, your photo, and a sheet of Death Note paper out in the open.

Both are Very Bad outcomes, and together I would say their likelihood exceeds 50%, though you can guard against no. 2 somewhat by being in the area ready to recover the items (but you're still exposing yourself a lot). Honestly, I can understand Light not taking the risk.
