By amending "hidden under a manhole cover, finds two sheets of paper..." to "receives from a stranger two sheets of paper ..." you will know if they don't show up that it didn't work and retain control of the Death Note page and otehr materials.

And "to the best of his abilities" to "accidentally misspelling it each time".

This makes it explicitly accidental in the details so either the misspellings are accidental and you gain immunity, or the Death Note can't fulfill the criteria and the subject dies of a heart attack in which case your name isn't written in the Death Note.

Edit: Also you can test the Death Note's ability to cause accidents by using similar phrasing in some experimental killings and finding the limits.
