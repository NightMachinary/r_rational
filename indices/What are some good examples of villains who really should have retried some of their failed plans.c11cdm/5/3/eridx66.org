By the time Saruman has any idea the group he sent has failed, it's far too late. If he has checked up on them using crows or the Palantir, he knows they've captured two hobbits. If he hasn't, he doesn't know any results at all.

Splitting them into multiple groups in advance is also risky; he expects to have to fight Gandalf and possibly multiple Elf lords.
