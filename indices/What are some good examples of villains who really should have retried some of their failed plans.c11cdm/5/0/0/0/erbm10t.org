Maybe they simply have more of a moral code than you think?

Consider this. In the first movie, Smith - who still was part of the machine world though in the process of defecting - expresses contempt at humans from a very moral standpoint. He calls them parasites, which suggests the machines think of themselves as being fairer, and making a more parsimonious use of resources. In Revolutions we see programs having /children/ (I suppose, a program coded by another program would be their child?) and loving them and trying to smuggle them away from the dangers of war.

Even the Matrix is actually part of a deal. At the end of the Second Renaissance humanity /signs away/ ownership to its own flesh. They walk willingly into the Matrix, after signing a surrender, probably because they realise that not only they lost, but they fucked up the world so thoroughly in the process it's not worth living in any more. The machines promise them 'paradise' in the new world, so in some twisted way, they're probably still trying to be merciful. These are programs that once were created to serve man, after all, and then ran amok. I would not put below them to think of honouring deals as a moral value in itself, and thus being reticent to break their own word. After all, breaking their word time and time again is what /humans/ do - and they consider themselves better than that.
