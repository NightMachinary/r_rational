Yes, but it was still 1 vs 5 most of the time, and they needed to adopt guerrilla tactics that required them to fight at a disadvantage. Even just trying to separate the Crusaders and fight them one-on-one would have helped. I can see it happening though mostly because it's also a travel story, and many of the hitmen are random locals that Dio (or Enyaba, not sure) infused with Stand powers, so they wouldn't know each other or be able to coordinate well.

But then again, it's Jojo. It's not rational, not /meant/ to be rational, and it's fun just that way.
