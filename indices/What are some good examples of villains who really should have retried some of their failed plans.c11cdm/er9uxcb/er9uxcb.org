Voldemort should have tried the hostile-portkey attack from Goblet of Fire more often.

--------------

The Borg try a time-travel attack on the Federation once. It nearly succeeds. They never try it again.

The Death Note is a magical item that can kill anyone, if their true name is written and their face known. Light, the villain-protagonist of the series, tries using the Death Note to kill his rival (a man known only as "L") within the first two episodes, after L appears on television and issues a challenge with his real name. That attack is foiled when it turns out the man on the broadcast was a double, who gave his own name rather than Ls.

L later reveals himself to Light in person, and Light comments that he still can't kill L because, among other things, he doesn't know L's real name.

It turns out, though, that L isn't a pseudonym. It's his real name. Writing it in the Death Note again would totally have worked. And, to be honest, the non-L authorities were so incompetent that I'd bank on Light getting away with it.

In Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Warren's group give up on the 'supervillain schemes' and instead decide to kill Buffy by simply shooting her with a gun. They end up killing Tara instead, but even that's way more damage caused to the Good Guys than basically /any other evil plan/ in the entire series. Things fall apart for them after that, but arguably they still could have succeeded by doubling down in what time they had left, or others could have tried the same thing to greater effect.

The villain of D.Gray-Man, the Millennium Earl, has an army of mooks called Demons. They have a level-based exponential power-ranking---Level 1s are mowed down by the average Exorcist. Level 2s pose a threat one-on-one, but can be taken on by a team. Level 3s can only really be put down by the handful of elite Marshals, or by the protagonist.

Shortly after the first Level 3 Demon was introduced, one was sent to attack one of the Good Guys' bases, and nearly wiped it out before the protagonist beat it off with a power-up. This being a one-off thing made sense at the time, as the Level 3s were portrayed as a rare resource for the villains. Except it later turns out that the Earl has had, for the better part of a century, an island base with /thousands/ of Level 3 Demons (as well as access to a near-instant global teleportation power), and has never carried out that direct-assault plan any other time before or since, instead favouring attrition in the field using the lower-level mooks.

Even if the direct assaults could be thwarted by keeping a Marshal/protagonist on base at all times, just throw a Level 3 every month or two and the villains would lock down vital resources for what turns out to have been basically no relative cost.
