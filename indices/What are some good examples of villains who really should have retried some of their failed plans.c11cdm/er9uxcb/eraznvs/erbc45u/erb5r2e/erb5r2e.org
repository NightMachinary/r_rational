I think Skynet's problem was that it was retrying the same plan. It sent one robot assassin three times. The problem is it didn't escalate nearly as much as it should have. Or it could have gone with a better plan, and brought itself back along with enough robots to rebuild its infrastructure to before humanity had any way of fighting it.
