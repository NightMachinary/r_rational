Ever played Battle for Westeros? Level 3 units are awesome, and need to be collected and kept safe. Level 1 and 2 units should be used because they can level up into level 3 units. What do you mean that makes it harder to beat the game? I'm pretty sure collecting the biggest, most awesome theoretical army that I never use is the real win condition.
