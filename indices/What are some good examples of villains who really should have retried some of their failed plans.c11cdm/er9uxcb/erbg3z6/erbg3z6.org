  It turns out, though, that L isn't a pseudonym. It's his real name. Writing it in the Death Note again would totally have worked. And, to be honest, the non-L authorities were so incompetent that I'd bank on Light getting away with it.

L isn't his /full/ name, though; that would be L Lawliet. No full name = doesn't work. And the Death Note has a rule that if you misspell someone's name four times while thinking of their face you make them /immune/ from all future DN uses. So that was an outcome Light would rather avoid.
