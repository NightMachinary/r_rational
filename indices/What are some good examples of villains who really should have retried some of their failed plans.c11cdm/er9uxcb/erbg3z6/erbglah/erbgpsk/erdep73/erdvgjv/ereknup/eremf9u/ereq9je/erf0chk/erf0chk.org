But what you can't test is whether it is faithful to the letter of its rules or the intention. You still run a risk of the Death Note realising you're trying to trick it and kill you. I mean, the Death Note is not /sentient/, but there is a very specific rulebook that seems full of ad-hoc patches for loopholes, and there is a King of the Death Gods, so 2+2 says it's probably /kinda risky/ to openly defy the obvious intended meaning of the rules by trying to munchkin them.
