The reason they dont do this is, near as I can tell, that turning someone into a vampire reliably makes them evil, but it does not make them loyal. So any vampire trying this would pretty predictably get killed by the vampires he or she just created because they want to embark on whatever Evil Scheme their sergeant or captain comes up with instead of the evil scheme of the turner.
