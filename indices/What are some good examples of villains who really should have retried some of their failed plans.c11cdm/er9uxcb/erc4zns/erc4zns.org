Re: BtVS “Buffy is weak to guns”---

A vampire could, in theory, walk into an army base and turn an entire company of soldiers to their cause. They'd capture the base and all the materiel available to them there (guns, armour, explosives, some tanks, some drones, an attack helicopter or two), and could maybe also fake their way into getting even more stuff requisitioned before anyone notices something wrong.

What would a rational Buffy Summers do against the threat of a well-equipped and well-trained military force---one that can shoot guns at her /very well, in coordination/---entirely composed of vampires, with their near-invulnerability to being shot at in return?

One obvious answer is “break the masquerade, tell the military what happened, and teach them how to make weapons that kill vampires (RPGs with wood-loaded frag heads, etc.)”

But, if you take that answer off the table, is there another solution available at Buffy's resource level?
