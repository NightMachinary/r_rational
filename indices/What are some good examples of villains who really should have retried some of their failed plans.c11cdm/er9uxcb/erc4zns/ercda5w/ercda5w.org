If you regard The Initiative as villains (they were certainly antagonists), I'd say they qualify for OPs question, too.

They made a prototype supersoldier by throwing every possible demonic/cybernetic/chemical enhancement they could get ahold of into a single subject, and damn the confounding variables! They could have chosen to learn from the failure and iterate on it to find a mix of donors and indoctrination that works. maybe start with a /single/ enhancement and go from there? The chems given to the human soldiers seemed a relative success, at least, and grafting a tough spiky demon-arm onto an otherwise human subject seems a net gain.

Instead, they bury the whole project and hide any trace it ever existed.
