  Yes, but the question is, does a human under control of the Death Note count as their own person, or do they count as a tool in the hands of the Death Note owner? They don't have free will any more.

No, that's completely irrelevant. If you'd managed to accidentally misspell your own name 4 times you'd be granted immunity (not practical to exploit as trying to do it makes it not an accident).

The person who wrote the names misspelled them accidentally, so even if you are responsible for their actions you're responsible for them accidentally misspelling the name 4 times.
