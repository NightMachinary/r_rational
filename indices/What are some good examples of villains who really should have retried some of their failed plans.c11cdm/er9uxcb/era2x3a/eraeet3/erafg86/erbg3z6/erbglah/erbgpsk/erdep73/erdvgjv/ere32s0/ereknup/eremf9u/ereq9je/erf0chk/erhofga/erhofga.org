If the Death Note worked on intent then it wouldn't need all the obvious patches. The existence of the mess that is the rules indicates pretty strongly that the letter of the rules matters.

The risk would be that the rules availabe to Light were written by Ryuk who is shown to have an incomplete understanding of them, so you can't be sure he didn't forget (or never know) any obscure ones, or accidentally drop some nuance when he translated them into English. However Light's otehr testing has generally shown that if he overreaches what he can make somone do the whole attempt just fails and they die of a heart attack instead of what he wrote. So the probability that this one specific case will be handled differently seems low.

IMO the better argument for not trying it is that the benefit of being immune to the Death Note is relatively low for the person in control of the Death Note, so even a tiny chance of dying against a marginal benefit doesn't work out to be all that compelling. The best reason I can think of to try it would be if it gave immunity to all Death Notes in which case since Ryuk flat out tells Light that he's going to write Light's name in his own Death Note when he gets bored making immunity to Ryuk's Death Note highly desirable. Though this also increases the risk considerably as independently of the rules the plan requires antagonizing Ryuk.
