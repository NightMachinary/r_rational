  If the Death Note worked on intent then it wouldn't need all the obvious patches. The existence of the mess that is the rules indicates pretty strongly that the letter of the rules matters.

Yes, but the question is, does a human under control of the Death Note count as their own person, or do they count as a tool in the hands of the Death Note owner? They don't have free will any more.

  if it gave immunity to all Death Notes in which case since Ryuk flat out tells Light that he's going to write Light's name in his own Death Note when he gets bored making immunity to Ryuk's Death Note highly desirable

It should give you immunity to all of them, and in that sense, if Ryuk didn't convince Light to try it, Rem definitely ought to have. But it still seems like a very big risk to take unless the alternative is certain death.
