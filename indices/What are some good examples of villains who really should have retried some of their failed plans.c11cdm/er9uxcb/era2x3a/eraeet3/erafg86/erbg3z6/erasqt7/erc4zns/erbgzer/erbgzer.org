Also, the D.Gray-Man is a problem with, well... every villain ever who only sends one Monster of the Week at a time to get annihilated by the troupe of heroes rather than just sending them all in. It's such a common problem it's basically a genre unto itself, "stories where the villain only loses because he's too stupid to count up to two". Dio in Stardust Crusaders makes a similar stupid mistake, though I can imagine his hitmen are perhaps just too random and have way too out there personalities to actually coordinate in a group attack. Only Hol Horse and J. Geil seriously attempt that.
