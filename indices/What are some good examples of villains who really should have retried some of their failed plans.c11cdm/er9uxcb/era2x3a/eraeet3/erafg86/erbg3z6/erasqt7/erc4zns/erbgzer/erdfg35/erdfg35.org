To be fair, a few of DIO's assassins, such as Tower of Gray and Dark Blue Moon's users, had assassination plans that involved blending in, which would get a lot more complicated than they thought necessary in a coordinated attack. Arabia Fats and Vanilla Ice would be active threats to nearby allies, N'doul's perception would get far less accurate in a chaotic battle, making Geb less threatening, Dark Blue Moon and Strength require fighting out at sea to be effective while Yellow Temperance is weak to water, Bast would lead to an absolute clusterfuck after a few minutes of close-up fighting, and Death 13 and the gambler brothers would be useless in a straightforward battle.

I can /kinda/ understand why most of them didn't try to rely on synergy, especially when they often got close to a total victory on their own by being able to pick fights in advantageous conditions.
