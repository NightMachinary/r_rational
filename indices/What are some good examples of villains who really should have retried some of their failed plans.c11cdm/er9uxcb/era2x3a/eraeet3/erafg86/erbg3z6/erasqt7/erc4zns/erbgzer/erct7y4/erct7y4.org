  The Borg try a time-travel attack on the Federation once. It nearly succeeds. They never try it again.

I think that could be explained by some sort of unwritten rule or Geneva convention because the federation could easily do the same to them (or any enemy with a known origin). I don't think finding out about the borg home by going back far enough and capturing an inexperienced drone is impossible.
