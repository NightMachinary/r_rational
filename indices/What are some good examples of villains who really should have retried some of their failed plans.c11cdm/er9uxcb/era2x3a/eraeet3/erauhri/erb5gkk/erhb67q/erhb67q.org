Allen is being played as a messianic archetype in that scene at the end of the Ark Assault Arc. It's not so much the work contradicting itself as a theological difference between the capabilities of mortals and divinities. Admittedly, the theology of DGM is a bit weird, because the 14th, who plays Christ to the man Jesus - in the gnostic sense of an Aeon inhabiting mortal flesh and bestowing wisdom and power upon that flesh for so long as it inhabits it - is essentially a risen demon as opposed to a fallen angel: an anti-lucifer. And instead of creating a path to heaven, the 14th seems to by trying to fully incarnate on earth. D.GM reads kind of like what you'd get if you turned the esoterisms surrounding the abrahamic faiths inside out without changing the protagonists.

I'm not at all arguing the series is rationally constructed, just pointing out that the author was doing something perfectly in line with the thematic backdrop that she had established, in that instance.
