First, I certainly agree that lately Cat has been more of a Chessmaster, with Tyrant closer to the 'thrives-in-chaos' role.

Stepping away from the characters, my own internal model (which might easily be flawed/wrong) is of a difference between short-term and long-term gains, between tactics and strategy. The Chessmaster tries to see the end goal, build an artifice that connects to it, and then either defend that artifice or build a new artifice from scratch. The Chaotic ignores the end goal and looks for immediate opportunities. When the Chessmaster's artifices are robust enough and the Chaotic's tactics weak enough, the Chessmaster can lead the Chaotic around by the nose and into a noose. When the Chessmaster's artifices are fragile enough and the Chaotic's opportunity-seeing brilliant enough, the Chaotic can quickly smash the Chessmaster's artifices faster than or as fast as the Chessmaster can think of new ones.

The question is, could a brilliant Chessmaster switch to becoming a equally-brilliant Chaotic or/and vice versa? My suspicion is /maybe/ yes (and maybe no), but if yes then probably with a learning curve first.

Keep in mind that both Chessmaster and Chaotic are playing styles, rather than naturally-emergent states: an amateur can act as a really weak Chessmaster by plotting a path to victory that includes only the dumbest(?) moves and assumes the opponent's moves to be moves that only a similarly weak player would ever make.

Hmm, I'm reminded of Jing Jiu and Yin San (Jing Yang and Taiping) in The Path Toward Heaven, regarding their Go-playing styles, Taiping plotting grand plans that Jing Yang then smashes directly in a reactive fashion because he's too lazy to think ahead.
