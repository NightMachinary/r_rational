During the whole Second Liesse debacle when Assassin!Black is “killed” by Akua he briefly turns into a Tahgreb woman which is where the Scribe=Assassin theories sprung up from. We're also not sure if he's actually dead as it was confirmed that he's incredibly hard to kill and a massive goblinfire explosion was the only way Alt!Cat was able to kill him. My bet is that he's secretly replaced one of the side characters on one of the sides, quietly biding his time before he strikes.
