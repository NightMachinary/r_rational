Malicia is behind the coup, pretending to be Rosala Malanza. Black/Scribe is against the coup, they are the 'hatchets'.

Basic purpose of the coup is to make sure Procer and Callow can't unify vs. Keter and Praesi.

White Knight and Witch are neither for nor against coup, just wandering around judging everyone. I bet they kill Cordelia at end of arc.

Very interesting to wonder if Assassin is here. Seems likely he is after Augur in the confusion.
