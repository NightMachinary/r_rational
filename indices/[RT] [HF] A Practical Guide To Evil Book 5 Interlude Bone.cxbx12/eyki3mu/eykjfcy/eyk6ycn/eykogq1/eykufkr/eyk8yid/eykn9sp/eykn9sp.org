Wow, I honestly can't tell who's behind what side anymore, or at least what Scribe's motivation is if she's not behind the coup.

These kind of situations really are perfect for Hanno, nobody knows what's going on and there are enemies and manipulations everywhere...so here comes instant and brutal justice-in-a-can. I feel like people (in this kind of community specifically) tends to be very cynical about paladin types and this chapter really shows that some holy fire, a big piece of sharpened metal, and a magical moral compass, added together makes for a really good crisis solution.
