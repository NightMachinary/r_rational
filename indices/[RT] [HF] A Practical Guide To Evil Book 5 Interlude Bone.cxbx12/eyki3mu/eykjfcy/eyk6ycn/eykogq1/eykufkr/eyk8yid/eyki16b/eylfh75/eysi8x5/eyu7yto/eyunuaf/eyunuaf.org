It would be interesting if Scribe actual /was/ Assassin and it turns out that the differences were because of having flexible aspects. So Assassin's ability to not be noticed could be matched with Scribe's ability not to be remembered. Maybe *Obscure*? Then Assassin's copying ability could be the same aspect as Scribe's ability to forge or falsify documents and personas with unerring accuracy. *Mimic* maybe? Finally we have Scribe's ability to create meticulous plots, and Assasin's ability to arrange events so that he can safely take out his targets. Maybe *Arrange* or *Organize*?

I do think that Scribe has more than one “passive” or “always on” aspect though
