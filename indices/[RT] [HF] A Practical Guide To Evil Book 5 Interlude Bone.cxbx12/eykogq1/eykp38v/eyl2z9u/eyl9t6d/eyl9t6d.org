I think that's nonsense image she wants to cultivate. Like Joker saying in TDKR he's just chaos and not a schemer and yet he perfectly outplayed everyone and got what he wanted.

Cat perfectly guessed what the others were planning which allowed her to counter them all.

This was certainly true vs GP and a lesser extent for the rest.

Edit : is like saying I beat you in chess not because I could forsee what you were doing but rather I could exploit chaos.

Nonsense, you may steer the game towards complicated positions, but if you win is because you can see more and outplay your opponent in those positions by understanding his strategy and using a better one to counter

Or you just got lucky...unless you arguing cat is always lucky..
