“For you to scream loudly enough that it will carry to our other prisoners,”

This is when you start /yelling your head off/, eking out every erg of acting ability you have in the desperate hope that he'll honestly feel he couldn't make a big difference by actually doing it, and that he'll be impressed enough by your efforts and your cooperativeness to look more favourably on you. Of course, chances are good he's going to kill you anyway, but at least you'll have a better chance at a quick, clean (more humane) death. Better in any case than if you hear that clue and yet still wait there for him to start on it himself.

I am intrigued that Louis is awaiting Scribe; I can't imagine anyone else he could be awaiting (/controlling the hatchets), yet it turns my impressions on its head to think that Scribe isn't the one who wanted to start the fires. Unless she was, and then she later changed her mind after being contacted..? But no, then she could call them off, so it must indeed have been two different groups, and for Scribe to be holding things back goes completely against what Cat and Black thought she would be doing there? But if the hatchets were cracking down on /her/, then again I'm completely bewildered about who Louis could be awaiting, unless he's awaiting Scribe and is completely wrong her about her leading the hatchets--that could be a fun (for us) surprise for him, if she really comes and he's gotten her side backwards.
