  Given that the conspiracy's own soldiers were the ones on the right side of walls and gates, at the moment, even if the two princes had struck an unlikely alliance they simply did not have the strength to take the palace with steel. And even if they did, by some miracle, they could not defend it: while it might be true that the servants in the palace had been fond of Hasenbach, and some even protested her seizing, he had Silver Letters among their number that'd open secret ways into the palace if it need be retaken.

Ominous ! I suspect Cordelia hid back in the palace (backtracking is a good way to throw off pursuers), and let that fool Balthazar go on a wild goose hunt giving her all the time needed while she purges the Letters with the help of loyal servants and guards, and gathers reinforcements. She knows all the secret passageways already.

In fact, I suspect that right now she's sitting upon her own throne, inside the very Chamber of Assembly, waiting for them all to rush inside... so she can have them greeted with a hail of arrows.
