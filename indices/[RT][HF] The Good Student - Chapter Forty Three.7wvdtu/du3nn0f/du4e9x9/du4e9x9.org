Regarding the Green Demon and demon hierarchy --- interesting point.

  Still not sure why Denke is helping the demons - aren't they going to invade? Is he one of them too?

No. It Is All For A Cause. He is a demon fanatic, see the last section of [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-39][Chapter 39]]:

  *The Librarian:* The sacrifice need not be of the highest order of power. Better to be something more easily digested and not so potent. A mage, perhaps, such as yourself. Perhaps that's why you were sent here.

  *Denke:* Gladly would I have offered myself. <...> If that was your wish, I would not hesitate to obey. But I would serve you better in other ways. <...>

  *The Librarian:* And what of you, little mage? What does your loyalty cost?

  *Denke:* Mine is given freely, for it is not loyalty but love.

Probably was manipulated or even grown into that role by one of the demons, who as you probably noticed by now love their extremely-long-term plans. “Your desire to shed your skin makes it easy to tempt you into new clothes”, indeed.
