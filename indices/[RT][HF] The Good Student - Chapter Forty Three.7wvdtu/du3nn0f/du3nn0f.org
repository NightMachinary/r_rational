Seems like one of core differences between Nic and Dizzy is how they view people - Nic would be confident in his read on Dizzy if the situation was reversed and he also spotted something was wrong with Davo straight away. Still not sure why Denke is helping the demons - aren't they going to invade? Is he one of them too?

It also finally clicked for me why the demon inside of Nic was so eager to make a deal. From what we know of the them from the Librarian, they're basically immutable and we can assume they have a strict hierarchy in place based on that. In Nic's story however, the demon changed on a fundamental level. I imagine this knowledge would seem like the holy grail to many of them as they're at the bottom of the hierarchy.
