Ok, I'll give you my take on it in hopes of making it clear :)

Back in [[http://gravitytales.com/Novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-38][chapter 38]] Nic tells the tale of Green Demon. After the story, the demon inside of Nic tries to figure out the reasons behind the Green Demon's actions but it can't make heads nor tails of it. First, its answer is incorrect and then it tries to argue that the Green Demon is not really a demon at all.

This continues in [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-40][chapter 40]]. It's easier to quote the text than explain it:

#+begin_quote
  “Your mistake,” said Nic, “is in assuming the Green Demon was unchanged by his many years in captivity. Or assuming he resented those years.”

  There was a moment of stillness between them. /He gained from those years,/ said the demon, hesitant but clear.

  “He changed,” said Nic. “You cannot change the function of a thing and not change its shape. And you can't change its shape without changing its function.”

  /He became more like those who surrounded him./

  “When you face a power that is able to control you, whether by force or subterfuge, you can destroy it and hope it will be lost forever.”

  /All knowledge will once again resurface/, said the demon.

  “Or you can learn it yourself.”

  /And become changed by it./

  “Yes,” said Nic.

And then in [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-42][chapter 42]] the Librarian talks about humans in comparison to demons:

#+begin_quote
  “Your souls are so different from ours,” the Librarian continued. “A person is constantly changing. They have the capacity to grow, learn, wither, die. Their soul does the same. It is fascinating to watch. Every morning... you are someone new. Even the most insignificant of you have the potential to be something better. Or worse. We are what we are. You are never the same person twice."
#+end_quote

Looking at the story of the Green Demon with the above quote in mind makes it clear it holds the key to how demons can change their nature - which seems impossible. I think that's why Nic's demon is so eager to find the ending of the story and cut a deal.
