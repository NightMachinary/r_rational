This theme is expounded on with a lot of thought in the HPMoR spin-off: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] which branches from the main story near Chapter 81. Full "disclosure" doesn't happen until around chapter 99, but I enjoyed this /alternate timeline/ turn of events as much as canon HPMoR.
