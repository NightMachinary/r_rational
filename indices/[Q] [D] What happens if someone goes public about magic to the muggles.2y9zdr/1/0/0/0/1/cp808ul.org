The parallel between a whistle-blower on magic and Edward Snowden esque figures is something I didn't consider, and interesting.

However, the US Government is a public, known institution, with secrets. In the case of magic, it's the existence of the institution itself that's a secret. Even if the leaker gets crucio'd to death, the cat's still out of the bag, isn't it?
