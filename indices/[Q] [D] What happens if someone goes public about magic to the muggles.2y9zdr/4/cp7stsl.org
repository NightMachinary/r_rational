Several people have addressed Harry Potter, I will attempt to outline the answer to the question for Nasuverse...

*Scientific:* Magecraft in Nasuverse gets weaker the more people use it. The mysteries that make up magecraft get weaker the more people understand them ("degradation of mysteries"). The collective will of the planet, Gaia, and of mankind's collective subconscious, Alaya, also act to suppress magecraft. Magecraft would likely get weaker if secrecy is broken... however, people accepting the existence of magic might reduce Alaya's suppression of it. How this finally balances out it anyone's guess. In-universe, the Magus Association is completely against any risk to secrecy, so they must think magecraft would ultimately be weakened. The Magus Association uses the scientific method for the most part, so they are probably right, however they are also heavily bound by tradition so they could be wrong to at least some extent. At the very least, the whole degradation of mysteries thing is really going to mess with the normal scientific procedure of replicating experiments.

*Social:* Many Magi experiment on people, and the Magus Associaton allows this so long as secrecy is not put at risk... So if the details of this get out there is going to be some kind of reckoning.

*Political:* The nobility of the Magus Association are all wealthy, upper class European aristocracy. I am not sure how there political power is going to be effected by them being exposed... I imagine some might consider trying to use their magecraft to take control and rule openly since secrecy is broken anyway. Also, the vampires in the setting, the Dead Apostles, might consider trying to openly seize power since mankind is becoming aware of them anyway. Probably going to be some massive causalities because of this.

*Religious:* In universe, the Church (not clear if Catholic or Orthodox, because this setting was created by Japanese people who don't care about the difference) actually has the strongest Thaumaturgical Foundation because they established it early in their history and they have the most widespread belief and faith. I imagine the fact that the are able to consistently train vampire hunters and the have genuine power is going to lead to a revival of faith.
