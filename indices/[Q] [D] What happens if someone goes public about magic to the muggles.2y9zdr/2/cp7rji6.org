It's certainly possible that Harry Potter and the Natural 20 might explore this at some point.

My own thoughts:

- New social movements would probably blame real, misattributed, or imaginary ills on mages. Existing witch hunts would claim vindication. Depending on the political climate, you might see people trying to lynch mages or outlaw magic.
- Governments would probably try to either recruit or conscript mages; after all, you can't have a "sorcery gap".
- Cults would probably spring up venerating magic users or magic itself. Most would probably be benign.
- Legal systems would eventually be overhauled, both to incorporate magical methods and to add protections against, say, someone being memory-tampered into confessing or someone else compelling juries to acquit. This would be very controversial and probably take a while.
- Various groups, both governmental and private, would start offering rewards for things like Muggle-usable magic items or testable theories of magic.

Edit: Of course, one of the big places to start is to look at /why/ magic is kept secret and work from there. Odds are that someone in either the mage or muggle power structure benefits from it.
