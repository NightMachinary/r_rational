This is a very common weak point for modern-setting fantasies - Far to many people just go with "It is a Secret" without covering the two most basic aspects that really do need covering: "Why" and "How".

There really has to be a pretty darn compelling reason for the magic world to be in the shadows. And religiously motivated persecution, while frequently used, really doesn't make much sense if you think about it - Having magic that works means that your religion wins. Anything else makes about as much sense as a world in which religious bigotry persuaded people in general to not use electricity.

I've seen good reasons in fiction for the magic to be secret - "There is only so much of it, and many more magic users would make it nearly-impotent" is very popular, and has a built in reason for everyone on the inside to keep their gob shut.

I've played a bit with a setting in which the standard fate for anyone catching on is to be hit with a banishing spell - Earth is the best place to be a mage because it has all the fun stuff and all of the non-practitioner humans, so it's occupied by the most talented and skilled practitioners -the ones who have centuries of practice and tradition enhancing their ability to use mana very efficiently - and any noob that starts practicing gets spotted due to their colossal drain on the leylines and summarily punted to another /planet/.
