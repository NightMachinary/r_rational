If they do find out, prepare to get your shit pushed in so far it comes back out your mouth as food. You will never work again. You will never have another lasting relationship. How do they do this? A good example is what the Church of Scientology does to people who leave it, spreading false rumors about them, putting up flyers in their neighborhood, etc.

Maybe you're 007 and especially good at subterfuge. I'm not. Never had a taste for deceit so I never got good at it. The last ten years of my life have been uninterrupted grinding misery. Two weeks of which I spent homeless, living on a hole covered by a tarp.

Maybe I just suck at it and everyone else is skilled. I don't know that for sure. So my advice is to simply keep your mouth shut and your head down unless you want to be F'ed in the A as hard as possible for the rest of your life. There's a certain sort of naieve person who sees Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and the Wikileaks guy as romantic heroes. That's a mistake imo. You don't want their lives.
