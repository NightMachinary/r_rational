No you don't, and I'm sorry to hear that happened to you.

Honestly, most of the advice on how to whistle-blow with minimal repercussion has been assembled after Manning and Snowden. For governments in particular we've got a much better idea of their actual capabilities, and other institutions who cause issues for whistle-blowers can be kept in the dark with the same measures.

Cult like organizations are different, because their goals are to keep anyone from leaving. Most of the advice to keep whistle blowing from ruining your life is built around maximizing the number of people who could have done it, and making sure that you never do anything more that could lead to you being found out. (With the implication that you should get out of said organization soon before things have a chance to come to head)

Getting out of an organization that wants to prevent all attrition and uses tactics like slander to do it is difficult but for different reasons. And there's not as much you can do to keep from coming to the attention of retaliatory measures.
