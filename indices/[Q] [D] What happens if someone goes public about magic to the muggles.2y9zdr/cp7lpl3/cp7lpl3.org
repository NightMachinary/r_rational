You'd have to figure out how magic actually works in the Harry Potter world, and how their society is structured, neither of which are clear from reading the text. And you'd also have to know how intertwined the magical and muggle worlds are, which isn't clear either - the muggle Prime Minister knows, and family of muggleborn children seem to know, but who else? What are the points of connection?

If the people running the masquerade have been wiping away memories for hundreds of years, and if that doesn't result in a war, then at the very least there needs to be Truth and Reconciliation type of thing. But there are too many variables to know how that would shake out.

/More generally/, a single motivated individual with strong proof is always going to be a problem for any secret, and having a community of diverse individuals is going to tend to produce people with their own views on things. Unless there's some magic compulsion, really strong magic, or the nature of reality itself, the masquerade doesn't seem like it can last long.
