Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren - Democratic - 1829-1841

Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A. Arthur: Republican - 1869-1885

William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft: Republican - 1897-1909

Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover: Republican - 1921-1933

So it looks like Republican have held office for 3 terms in a row 5 times, while democrats have have done the same only twice.
