I put together a quick Monte Carlo simulation, assuming equal probabilities of each candidate in each election. With 47 elections, the number of "runs of 3" [[http://i.imgur.com/gRc27Tc.png][are plotted here]]. The mean is about 11.25, but the standard deviation is pretty wide. Since about 24% of the simulated runs of elections have 8 or fewer runs of 3, we don't have strong evidence in concluding that there is a bias.
