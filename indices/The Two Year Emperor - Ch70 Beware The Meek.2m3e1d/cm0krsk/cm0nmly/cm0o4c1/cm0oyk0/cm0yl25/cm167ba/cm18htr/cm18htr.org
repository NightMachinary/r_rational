Not going to pretend this is properly optimized or even complete, just what I got before I called it quits. Ive more or less just gone through bunko's and the ol' list of necessary magic items to pick some crap out. I assume Suze went through the big list of magic items Jake asked for way back and that combining two magic items is fair at level 120. MIC has rules for adding on common effects to certain slots for no penalty, so I also did that.

#+begin_example
  head (cowl of warding+headband of conscious effort+6cha) 
  face (hathran mask of true seeing+third eye clarity+6 int)
  throat (hand of glory+amulet of second chances+6 wis) 
  shoulders (starmantle cloak+minor cloak of displacement+5 def to ac) 
  body (+1 soulfire, proof against transmutation, glamered, deep robes+robe of eyes+5 nat armor) 
  torso (shirt of wraith stalking+custom-continuous foresight+5 resistance to saves) 
  arms (bracers of armor +8 heavy fortification+something+6 str)
  hands (something+something)
  waist (belt of battle+custom-continuous haste+6 con)
  feet (boots of temporal acceleration+sandals of the vagabond+6 dex) 
  ring1 (ring of sustenance+ring of anticipation) 
  ring2 (universal energy immunity+nine lives)
  ring3 (ring of fly+something)
  slotless-all of them. Fill a quiver of ehlonna with 60 wands, fill a handy haversack with pearls of power, etc. 
  Custom item of at-will prestidigitation and mage hand is mandatory of course.
#+end_example

AEG has rules for adding special abilites on bracers of armor. Make the base item for the arm slot a wand bracer from dungeonscape for nonmagical swift action wand retrieval. Also makes for good party trick.

As for custom items I would improve an item I have always hated, the infinite scrollcase. Despite its name, it only holds 50 scrolls. So give it the storage space of a handy haversack to hold a few thousand scrolls, then toss in wish every round to create a scroll of a spell the user knows but is not already in the scrollcase. Now thats an infinite scrollcase worthy of the name (bonus effect: spells/day are now irrelevant).

Wish is so broken +when you dont have to pay xp costs+
