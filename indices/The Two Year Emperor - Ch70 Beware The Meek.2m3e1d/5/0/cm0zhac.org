  Wouldn't it take only one Wish from a follower of Neklos to summon him back out of the time freeze?

Gods are immune to "effects that...banish them" My interpretation of this is that you can't move them around with mortal magic -- you can /ask/ them to show up, but you can't /force/ them.

But, if you don't like that reasoning, try this:

As a greater god, Neklos has spell resistance 32 + divine rank (20) = 52. In order to move him with a Wish, you need to make a caster check to beat his spell resistance; unless you're level 32 in that class(*), you can't possibly do it. (Note that you can't take 20 on the check, since you have to pay a cost to use Wish.) Because of this, no one who hasn't gone through the FLEA is going to be able to Wish him out of the hole. (Some of the Lich Kings might be an exception, but even they aren't going to have a great chance.)

Now, Neklos could lower his spell resistance to make this straightforward but that takes a standard action and he's currently trapped in a non-magical Temporal Stasis. (He is immune to the magical version, but not to simple physics-based time dilation, just as he wouldn't be immune to the Flowing Time trait of a plane, if I were allowing those to exist.)

tl;dr -- He can't be Wished out of the hole because he's a god and gods are immune to that. Even if that /weren't/ the case, it wouldn't be practical for any caster who actually exists.

(*) From the SRD: "To make a caster level check, roll 1d20 and add your caster level (in the relevant class)" So, if you're Wizard20/Sorceror20, you only get to use 20 as your caster level.
