I had originally been going to have to this be the end, yes. Then I realized I still have lots of story to tell, and I intend to write it. I'll probably call this the end of "Book I: The Drauga War" and will start into the next after I finish it. That said, there's still a few more chapters left to wrap up the details, so you'll keep getting drops for at least another month.

(Aside: this should really be Books I-III, since 80,000 - 100,000 words is typical for a novel and I'm closing in on 300,000.)

I do have other things that I'm interested in writing, so there's some question about whether I'll go right into a sequel or take a break for other stuff first. You'll still keep getting weekly drops of SOMETHING, though.
