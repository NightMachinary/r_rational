Suze seemed a /little/ unreasonable considering that the reason Jake didn't want her coming along was that as far as he knew she was level zero and couldn't do much to help, so it would have put her in unnecessary danger.

If she had explained Jake probably would have taken her willingly.

(Of course, this doesn't excuse him from not sending her through FLEA himself, as soon as it was convenient to do so.)
