I'm not sure I get how the whole God Portfolio Sense thing works. Herrun seems to be implied to be constantly aware of everyone's secrets - she's aware of secret knowledge only discovered or posited after her formation since it was pointed out that scheming against her is difficult since trying to keep your scheming secret makes it known to her.

Since Neklos's portfolio is death, and the protagonists take pains to avoid a plan that actually kills him, it seems to be implied that he is aware at least of anything that could lead to his own death, and in conjunction with the way Herrun's Portfolio-Sense works, I'd hazard a guess that he's able to sense every death before it happens.

Shouldn't Suze's use of the anti-osmium to kill everyone he had Soul Trapped tipped him off that something was about to happen and prevent the surprise round? Even if Neklos' sense doesn't quite extend to literally every potential death, it seems contrived that his sense would give him foreknowledge of his own death, but not the imminent death of a dozen souls he had under his personal control at the moment.
