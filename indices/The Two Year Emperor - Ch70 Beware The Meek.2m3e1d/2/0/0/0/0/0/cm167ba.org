Without prestige classes, feats, and alternate systems there actually wasnt much to go through once I got a chance to work on the build.

It may have been said, but I couldnt remember if Suze was NG or LG. I went with LG. I assumed her starting stats were the elite array except for an 18 int. Distributed as: str 8, dex 10, con 12, int 18, wis 14, cha 13.

The build:

#+begin_example
  Suze (no items)        
  Commoner 1/wizard 20/archivist 20/knight 20/factotum 20/scout 18/paladin 3/dragon shaman 1/dragonfire adept 1/marshal 1/ninja 1/
  spellthief 1/spirit shaman 1/swashbuckler 1/sorcerer 1/ranger 1/beguiler 1/duskblade 1/favored soul 1/healer 1/warmage 1/monk 1/
  fighter 1/cleric 2
  1516HP, BAB+76, Init+21, Fort+69, Ref+59, Will+83
  Str 14, Dex 28, Con 20, Int 34, Wis 20, Cha 18    
#+end_example

I pretty much ran out of classes to take.

Flavor-wise: Knight/paladin seemed weird at first, but fit Suze more and more the longer I thought about it. She wants to be recognized and respected, which is literally what knights fight for by the class fluff. Paladins fight for a cause but are recognized and respected for it and it is a natural extension of the knight. As for Ninja, while it doesnt fit in with the setting Suze's ninja-like stealth cannot be ignored. The class is also from complete adventurer so it isnt actually from a different campaign setting and can be taken in vanilla greyhawk type d&d silly-ly enough.

Mechanics-wise:Commoner level is simply because thats what she had when she went into the flea. Only way to get rid of it is with rebuilding and she hasnt had time for a rebuilding quest.

Wizard/Archivist is pretty much 95% of the builds power. From everything Jake has done I think it is safe to assume Suze realizes that combat is a game of rocket tag. Having more spells/day from other classes really doesnt help when you have 1 standard action and combat ends on turn 1. Being lawful, Suze cant be a bard so wizard/archivist has every possible spell she can get. Most noncasting classes do not have any features that compare to spellcasting and are thus useless.

Knight is a normally crap class with two amazing high level abilities. Impetuous endurance means Suze doesnt fail a save on a natural 1 and that is IP-proofing gold. Loyal Beyond Death lets Suze ignore dying due to hp damage for a round for every daily use of knight's challenge she expends. You could drop an anti-osmium mountain on her and she would live through it. Sadly doesnt help against disintegrate and the like though.

I already mentioned Factotum before. Int to initiative, bypassing sr/dr, temporarily gaining other 15th level classes (ex) features, gaining more standard actions, etc. Stuff that augments Suze's existing abilities.

Scout 18 gets (ex) freedom of movement. Enough said.

Paladin is for cha to saves, disease immunity, and fear immunity because why not. Re-reading your rules, I noticed you said paladin's lose class features if they ever take levels of "thief or assassin" . I was excited to take levels of rogue for a second until I noticed you also renamed rogue into thief, but at least factotum still isnt a thief :)

The rest of the classes are there just for their +2 save bonuses at 1st level and an extra cleric level to fill space. Nothing really impressed me out of all those classes. spells>melee combat, better saves>more spells/day off lists Suze already has. Honestly, those levels can be replaced with anything: the end result is more or less the same.

I thought about monk 11 for poison immunity or dragon shaman 4/9 for sleep&paralysis immunity/1 energy immunity, but ultimately Id rather have base saves over something I can easily get in item form. If saves come up you are probably already dead, but might as well try for a fighting chance.

I havent even started to look at items yet. Im pretty sure the answer to what items Id take in Suze's position is "yes". With lots and lots of scrolls/wands to have all spells "prepared" at all times.
