One item I had forgotten about, but should be part of standard kit is the shirt of wraith stalking from the magic item compendium. It grants at-will [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/hide-from-undead--2330/][/hide from undead/]] except that it doesnt allow intelligent undead to make a save. Should make the cleanup efforts go a bit smoother.
