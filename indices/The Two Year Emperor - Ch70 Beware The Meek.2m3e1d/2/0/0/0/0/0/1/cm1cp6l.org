Cool. Very cool. Thanks for putting it together.

And yeah, I realize that under my rules it's hard to do real OP builds...that's kinda the point, actually. Simplifies my life as the writer when I don't have to try to figure out the most OP cheeseball build for Afi and can just say "he's stupid high level in all the casting classes. Done."
