It just pisses me off. I haven't managed to have an original idea in my freakin' /life/. Every time I come up with something that I think is at least somewhat unique...nope! Someone else already did it, haha!

I hadn't even /heard/ of the Iron Druid series, or its author. And, I mean, seriously -- trapping a god with time dilation??? Really?????!! Someone had to preemptively steal that?

Ah well, I suppose I can't complain too much. [[/u/drageuth2]] was the one who originally thought of it, although I adapted it a bit.
