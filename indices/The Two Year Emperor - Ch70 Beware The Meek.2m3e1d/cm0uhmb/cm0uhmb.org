Hmm, if I was mindscraping people I would always do it before and after disjunction since people are highly likely to be going to be using magic on their thoughts.

Now, if no one else thought they were going to get mindscraped then why did Suze of all people predict it to use Programmed Amnesia?

I'm surprised the Gods teleported to him instead of teleporting him to them, seems awful uh, ungodlike I suppose, though it's not clear I suspect if he had teleported it a note would be made.
