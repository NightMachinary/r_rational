There is a subtle implication there that perhaps not all salient divine abilities (the ones which particularly target 'mortals' for example) work on Jake.

This may be because of his status as an Outside Context Problem.

Some powers obviously still work, and anything which creates a true magical effect or a gross physical effect obviously does (see - painful death and time regression resurrection).
