  They knew they would get Mindscraped. They chose to not protect it because they had nothing to hide -- the whole POINT was that they were there to help Afi, so it was in his best interest to work with them.

  Every single time we've seen a god to date, they've teleported to him.

Sure, singular, there's never been a reason for them not to be the one to teleport to him, though I am also of the position that it was ungodlike when he was being given into trouble.

A hall of God judgement is just the kind of place Gods would have, and summon mortals there to feel very Godly and dious, them teleporting to him all the time feels like he's in charge u get me
