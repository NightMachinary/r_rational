The Summoning ritual used by Flobovia to find their rulers makes it clear that there are multiple versions of the Prime Material out there. (This used to be part of D&D cosmology. Not sure if it is still canon, but it is for 2YE.) The operating assumption is that this is a Copenhagen model of QM, so the number of Prime Material variants is effectively infinite, and each universe is the size of our own. In total, this means that there is an infinite number of planets, some percentage of which are habitable. Therefore, there are an infinite number of habitable planets.

Wish can transport you anywhere on any plane, so all of these worlds are reachable.

Yes, you can do both a Wish and a black hole with zero time between them. You just do what Suze did: use readied actions. In her case she used a Celerity spell to give herself a readied action after already taking an action; that works, but you could also just have two people cooperating. Better yet, you can REALLY go nuts: two people are cooperating. Each has both a readied action and a Celerity which gives them ANOTHER readied action! Anyway, yes: you cast the Wish then, using a readied action, you cast the PAO:X-to-singularity. The PAO resolves first and then zero time later the Wish resolves and transports you out of there. (If you do it the other way around then the Wish resolves first, so your PAO resolves at your new location and you die.)

Now, could the gods interfere with this? You betcha.

There are roughly 50 gods here. Each of them can have a readied action and a Celerity-caused readied action. They can also have a Contigency which gives them another another Celerity, meaning they effectively have three readied actions prepared.

Let's assume, provided they have a chance to act:

- All of the gods have the power to stop a mortal from casting one way or another
- All of the gods have the power to escape from a just-formed singularity
- The gods are working together to make sure they all survive.

In this case the actions of the gods form one long chain with the first god (Al) readying three actions with the trigger "If a mortal starts casting, I smite him". The second god (Bob) readies his three actions with the trigger "If a mortal starts casting and Al doesn't smite him, I smite him" and so on. There are effectively 150 actions stacked up in front of you, and you need to go before all of them. The only way to do that is to declare your action after all of them...but the only way to make all of them TAKE their actions is to make sure that each of them fails in turn, so you have to have more than 150 actions stacked up yourself.

Long story short, you'd need to have way more mortals than gods before the gods wouldn't be able to shut you down.
