OK, I see how that could work. It'd depend on the time scales, and I'd be kind of surprised if it does. Let me check the numbers.

Suppose you create the singularity 10m above you. (Above is so that it's equidistant from the gods surrounding you, which probably does not matter but is conveniently symmetrical.) You have 3.33x10^{-8} seconds to live, your time. How much time passes on the outside is a function of the mass of the singularity.../and you can make up a number as big as you need it to be/. I forgot about that part. Guess I don't need to look up time dilation equations after all.

So you're right. If this works, they could survive doing it. Do they have any Wish-capable allies off that plane who would know that's what they need to try?
