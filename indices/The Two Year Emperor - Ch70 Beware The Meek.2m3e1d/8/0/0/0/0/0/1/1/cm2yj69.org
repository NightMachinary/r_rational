  A black hole of a billion solar masses won't even eat the solar system

A black hole of a billion solar masses would be 39.5 AU in radius (if Universe Sandbox is reliable about black hole radiuses, which I sincerely doubt) and would most definitely eat the solar system regardless of size. The milky way is only a thousand times that size.
