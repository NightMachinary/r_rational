  Suze seemed a little unreasonable considering that the reason Jake didn't want her coming along was that as far as he knew she was level zero and couldn't do much to help, so it would have put her in unnecessary danger.

Oh, she's not pissed at him about that. Actually, she's not really pissed at /him/ much at all, at least not in specific. To the extent that she's angry with him, it's because he's treating her with the same type of thoughtlessness that all the other nobles do...but in his case he's always treated her well and she actually likes him, so that moderates the situation a lot.

No, she's fine with the fact that he didn't want to bring her along.
