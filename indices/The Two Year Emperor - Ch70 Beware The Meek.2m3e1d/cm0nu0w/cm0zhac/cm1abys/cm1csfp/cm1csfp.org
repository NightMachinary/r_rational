He knows about FLEA and POPE and RAW and physics, actually. :>

Ane, actually FLEA works less well for him than for the heroes. Bumping a firsts level person to 60 is easy -- six Linnorms and you're done. Bumping someone who is already high level is much, much harder -- it requires hundreds of Linnorms, maybe thousands, to get the same effect.

Of course, he can just PAO into a non-undead, drop levels with a negative-level-fail-save trick and go from there.
