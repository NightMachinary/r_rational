Do they know that there is another habitable planet? It'd suck if they got teleported to the same planet, or some place where the strong nuclear force is 3% stronger.

Also, can you do both a Wish and a black hole simultaneously with both taking zero time?

Oh, and what if one of the gods has a Readied Action for if a mortal tries casting? Would that allow them to do something in zero time and escape? (I knew a thing! Thanks SirPoley!)
