Well, back in chapter 2 we got this:

#+begin_quote
  a girl in a maid's uniform [...] She was very pretty but I chose to ignore it; I was old enough to be her father.
#+end_quote

But no, her age hasn't been explicitly stated.

EDIT: Just realized that the above was ambiguous. There's nothing tricky going on -- she's 19.
