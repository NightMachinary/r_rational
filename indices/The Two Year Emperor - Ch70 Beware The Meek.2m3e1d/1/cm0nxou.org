I don't buy Suze's reason for keeping it secret. People shouldn't expect others to hand them opportunities on a silver platter, especially if it's something they could easily ask for themselves. Being a "servant" has nothing to do with it, if someone who has carte blanche to act with Imperial authority can even be considered a servant.

As a result, her resentment put the entire mission - and by extension the entire world - in danger. Nevermind that it's still stupid for a group with millennia of tactical experience between them, a median IQ and wisdom quotient^{^{TM}} of 200, not to expect a mindscrape when it's their opponent's signature move; once she had that realisation she should have informed the rest so they could all have hidden information from the Icefi's. It was only by the dumb luck of Neklos not bothering to perform the free action to capture Suze's soul like he had done with every other soul in the party that the mission wasn't a total failure.

However, the author has a history of plans within plans within plans. [[http://predictionbook.com/predictions/43636][My guess is]] that this is still not the innermost layer of the onion and Suze had more legitimate reasons for her actions. Besides, my tropey sense is tingling, saying the Goddess of Secrets still has to do something important to justify her existence in the narrative, so we can't be at the end yet and there are still secrets left to uncover.
