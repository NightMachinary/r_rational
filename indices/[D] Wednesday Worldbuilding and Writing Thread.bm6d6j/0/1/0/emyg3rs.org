You could do that, but I don't think that it would be more convenient, because to access space_A, you have to get out ring_Z, open space_Z, take out ring_A, close space_Z, and finally open space_A, and then reverse all of that when you want to put ring_A back into space_Z. You could though, if you wanted to, or has some reason, I just don't think that convenience is a compelling reason, unless I'm missing something.

Right now, rings cannot be duplicated, meaning that so long as you hold the ring, you have the only key to that unique space. If rings could be duplicated, you'd be able to use it for instant transfer between remote places, essentially giving you a fast-travel conduit, and even if you said living things couldn't use it for whatever reason, it would shrink the world an enormous amount in terms of economy. Even if the rings make transport a whole lot easier, that transport still has to happen, with all the risks and costs associated with that.
