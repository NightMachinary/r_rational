  I kind of want a more robust system here, rather than a single simple rule (which I've been trying to use for the world as a whole), a robust system which would allow things like pulling a sword from extradimensional space on the high end or a carpenter taking five minutes to get his chest of tools out of storage. Variables include time to take out, time to put in, volume restrictions, weight restrictions, etc., all of which would need to be balanced against labor/cost, then extrapolated out, which seems like a lot of work ...

I think you could reasonably get all that with a single rule that merges cross-section and mass by limiting the number of units =cross-section * mass= that can be added or removed to a pouch per unit time.

But you'd have to check the math on that; I don't have intuition about whether a sword would be drawn from an extradimensional sheath more slowly than a same-mass same-length cylinder. Perhaps it should also be a factor of the cross-section of the opening of the extradimensional pocket?
