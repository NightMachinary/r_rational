This sounds a lot like a Bag of Holding, to me.

So, you can't access your Inventory while on a moving train? This is important; it means that prisoners can be kept more securely on a moving train than in a stationary location (because you can't break a guy out with a well-disguised Static Inventory box and your personal ring, even if you could smuggle them in).

With supply lines not being a problem, it's a whole lot harder to starve out resistance cells by cutting off supply lines. However, it is probably a lot easier to locate them (especially if you manage to slip a tracking spell onto something that is likely to be delivered to said resistance - like a prisoner who you then deliberately guard less securely than you could have).

And it is still possible to starve them out by cutting off access to resources useful to the Reisistance on a wide basis (i.e. if the Resistance uses a lot of mana potions, then they can be starved out by cutting off mana potion supply to /everyone/).
