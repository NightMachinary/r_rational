I was considering the more large-scale applications of it for convenience, since you mentioned supply lines. I can imagine a kind of person-driven mass transit between shipping facilities that have a multitude of ring boxes for fast loading and unloading. So for moving large quantities of material, you could use the ring_Z method, allowing couriers with "Speed/Endurance" builds to safely transport goods, since it would be much easier to protect and keep track of a single ring rather than a bag full of them.

It was building off the assumption that, like most apocalypse litRPG worlds, monsters/dungeons/etc in the wilderness make it cost-prohibitive to use rail-based freight, and shipping would be done primarily by caravan or courier.

As for the duplication, I was thinking more along the lines of replacing a destroyed ring to regain access to its space, but after thinking about it that still produces the same issue of purposefully destroying a ring and re-crafting it elsewhere for instant transfer.
