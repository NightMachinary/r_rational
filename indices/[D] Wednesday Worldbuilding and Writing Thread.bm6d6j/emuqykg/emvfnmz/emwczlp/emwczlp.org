  Supply lines don't really need to exist as such, because for enough of an investment, you can just have someone carry a bunch of rings and then pull things out of "static" inventory.

If I understand static inventory right (ring_A opens up space_A) then wouldn't it be more convenient to use ring_A to _Y (etc) for your goods, then ring_Z to store the rest of your rings in space_Z?

I think one of the bigger decisions that would affect inventory usage is whether rings can be duplicated, or every ring opens a unique space instance. If there's a single point of failure to the system then ring-stacking is probably too risky for most uses, although it leaves a lot of interesting ideas about instant and perfect disposal for any sufficiently small (or choppably small) material.
