Still working on the diegetic MMO concept (i.e. the world is built on the back of MMO mechanics, but they're all "in world" without interfaces or a separation between game mechanics and worldbuilding). Today's topic: inventory.

Inventory in games is usually one of the biggest disconnects between mechanics and what those mechanics are meant to represent. Typically speaking, there's either a numeric representation for weight or a grid representation for volume, or some combination of the two, if there are inventory limits at all (which there sometimes aren't). This ... is a little sillier than I'd really want to go, at least as a base, so "natural" inventory is just inventory as it normally is in the real world.

As for magical inventory? Well, I'm thinking there will be two kinds.

First, there's "static" inventory, mediated by a magic item that's about as expensive as a refrigerator. If you have a special ring (about as expensive as a toaster) you can interact with the box and open it up to an interior space that's the same no matter which instance of the box you're interacting with. This means that items put into Box 1 at location A can be pulled out of Box 2 at location B. One ring can only open one box at a time, which solves apparent issues with duplication, and the boxes don't work if they're not airtight. Additionally, boxes have to be stopped with respect to some privileged reference frame in order to be used, and will fail if moved while open. (This design is largely based on inventory systems as used in Resident Evil 2 and other games.)

Second, there "personal" inventory solutions, ways that a person can carry more on them. These are much more expensive, the kind of thing that you might have if it's part of your job or if you're independently wealthy. I kind of want a more robust system here, rather than a single simple rule (which I've been trying to use for the world as a whole), a robust system which would allow things like pulling a sword from extradimensional space on the high end or a carpenter taking five minutes to get his chest of tools out of storage. Variables include time to take out, time to put in, volume restrictions, weight restrictions, etc., all of which would need to be balanced against labor/cost, then extrapolated out, which seems like a lot of work ...

In terms of practical worldbuilding consequences? The biggest impact is probably in terms of logistics, which has impacts on trade, the economy, and warfare. Supply lines don't /really/ need to exist as such, because for enough of an investment, you can just have someone carry a bunch of rings and then pull things out of "static" inventory. The big exception is things that don't fit in the box, and depending on the specific rules for "personal" inventory, there might not be things that fit into even the most expensive storage. Maybe this leads to modularity and a focus on assemble-on-site equipment.

As a knock-on effect, it's really easy to both hide and steal things, assuming that you're willing to pay the initial investment for inventory. I don't think that this is that big of a deal from a worldbuilding perspective, but it's kind of interesting to think about burglars going into a house and dumping things into a variety of inventory spaces, then bailing out with no outward indication that they've actually taken anything. Maybe people will gravitate towards making sure their expensive things are big so they can't be stolen as easily.
