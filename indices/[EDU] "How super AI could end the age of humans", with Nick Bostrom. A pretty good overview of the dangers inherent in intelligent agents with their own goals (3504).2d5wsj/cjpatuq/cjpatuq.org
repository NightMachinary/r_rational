For some reason, I see strong AI as not as a threat, but simply a possible next step.

Evolutionarily speaking, the two main ways a species goes extinct are an invasive species dominating the niche of the native one, or that native species having enough beneficial mutations that spread through the populace until none of the original flavor are left in that biome.

In that sense, many of these people are equating strong AI with the former kind, but to me, I see strong AI as the latter kind.

I wonder if this is just me having an abnormally weak bias for DNA-based descendancy.
