Yeah, that would suck. But a strong AI wouldn't be built in a vacuum. Sure, one strong AI could be a mundane paranoid paperclipper, but there's also human children who grow up to be criminals. Due to social constraints, criminals rarely thrive in a complicated environment if the entire social structure is against them.

Similarly, a single strong AI would be dangerous, but one paranoid paperclipper wouldn't be able to take off if there's hundreds or thousands of Strong AI in a social network of checks and balances.
