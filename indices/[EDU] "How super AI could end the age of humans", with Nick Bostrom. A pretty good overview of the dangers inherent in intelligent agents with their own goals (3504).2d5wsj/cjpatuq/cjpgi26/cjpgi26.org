Well, I think I understand the sentiment of our AI 'child' sort of 'inheriting' the universe from us, but how would you feel about an AI that killed us all and then went around doing something totally worthless, just because we programmed it badly? Like going around turning every source of energy into computational resources for itself until in short order it has absorbed the universe and sits just running cycles on loop searching for further threats against itself or something equally mundane?
