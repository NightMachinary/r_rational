This chapter chillingly and excellently portrays one of my favorite sci-fi horror concepts.

Memetic hazards have been a favorite topic of mine since hearing They Might Be Giants' [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=cSEQ0kMt-0k][The Bells Are Ringing]] as a child. (I couldn't read this chapter without hearing it and in the Netflix adaptation I motion that an instrumental cover be used for this scene's soundtrack.)

Speculation and possible spoiler for future chapter: I fully expected someone to conduct the ol' Oedipus protocol to avoid reception of The Concept. (No, not when he banged his mom, what he did when he realized he banged his mom and saw her dead body.)

A couple of links for others who adore this sort of thing.
