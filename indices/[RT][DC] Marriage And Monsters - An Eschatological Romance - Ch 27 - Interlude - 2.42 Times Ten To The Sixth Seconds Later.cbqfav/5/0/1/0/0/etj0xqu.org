Wait, so the concept isn't a memetic vector that can be transmitted through a single image? Is it a video feed? Is it magical in nature/does it need to be spread through a magical surface? A still image isn't enough to spread it? Cause the set of images that can contain the concept's vector at a given resolution and colour coding is finite if the duration is as well. Because of this, you can guarantee that there is a minimum resolution required for the spread. Go below and it will be unable. You can filter any part of an image that changes faster than a given frequency reasonably well if you average pixels over a duration. If the concept is hidden by steganography, I think the right kind of noise would cancel it.

You can develop a vision system that filters all textures and only transmits the macroscopic shape of objects; I imagine that would defeat all currently existing forms of it. It would make screens and signs unreadable, but for combat and navigation purposes it's essentially sonar. I think you can create sonar and output the data as an image, which would still allow vision reasonably well.
