Your point about a single failure being enough is valid. By the way, do you know if magic wishes have infinite computing power? If so, generating a competing meme/anti-meme by brute force is viable. This is several times more expensive than the implied cost of Haleys timeloop though. Somewhere on the order of 10^{10000} times more expensive. But it's probably a good way to annoy the guys who called her, or make them give her the meme she needs if they don't want her to drain them dry. I assume the concept has a reasonable way to search all possible images that contain itself without resorting to brute force. It'd be interesting to see if that can be used to search for other memes or anti memes.

Edit: You haven't really lived if you've never used a computer that can do a Greyham's number amount of operations per second.
