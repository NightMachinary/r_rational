I take your point about the power of Wish. However, its limitations in this story seem to be centered around its interactions with opposing narratives (or people who just haven't embraced Haley's narrative.)

Haley herself would have absolutely zero trouble avoiding infection or ill effects, I think. But this story isn't about one person trying to save herself in a chaotic world. It's about someone trying to /save/ the world. She's going to have to move very, very fast to do that, and time dilation will only go so far in that regard, because she's going to have to convince every person on Earth to accept her narrative before they get even a glimpse of the Concept, and time dilation won't work for them until they do.
