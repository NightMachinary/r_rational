I agree on all points, except that I don't feel that any given set of measures against memetic exposure will ever be universally sufficient, since the Concept has the equivalent of thousands of dedicated penetration testing teams of which only one needs to get lucky once to deal a major blow to the protagonists. That's why I don't feel that even comprehensive measures will "castrate" its ability to spread-- and those comprehensive measures won't be available to the general populace of Earth quickly enough to prevent the Concept from quickly swelling to billions of minds' worth of strength even if Haley's faction remains safe.

I still feel comfortable with the 'Death Star' assessment, since it's nearly impossible to kill, will shortly have a significant chunk of the population as hostages, and has access to at least as much magic as Haley does (and presumably many more narrators.)

Edit: Changed 'any single measure' to 'any given set of measures,' to more accurately reflect what I meant in terms of even layered security.
