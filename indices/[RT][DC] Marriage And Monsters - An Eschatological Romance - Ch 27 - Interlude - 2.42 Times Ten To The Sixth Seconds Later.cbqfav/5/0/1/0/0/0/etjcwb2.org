  A still image isn't enough to spread it?
#+end_quote

I didn't mean that the still image isn't a memetic vector, but rather that infinite variations on that still image exist.

#+begin_quote
  Ever so slightly, the thought it encoded had changed. And viewing it, his visual cortex fired neurons in a new way, and he changed. Ever so slightly. The process repeated, over and over. View, paint, observe, repeat. The pattern shifted, became fluid, began encoding new thoughts, new overwhelming demands.
#+end_quote

Every time he changes it, it's no longer the original image, but it still retains the core directive of the Concept. From the [[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm][original short story]] where the Concept's progenitor (the "Langford Parrot") was conceived:

#+begin_quote
  The "Fractal Star" is generated by a relatively simple iterative procedure which determines whether any point in two-dimensional space (the complex field) does or does not belong to its domain. This algorithm is now classified.

  ...In several zones of the complex field, this can produce BLIT effects when the resulting fine detail is displayed on a computer monitor of better than 600 x 300 pixels resolution.
#+end_quote

That implies an infinite set of patterns that produce BLIT effects (or in this case, spread the Concept.) However, if the Concept is physically limited by those properties re: pixel encoding, then I think you're right on the money here:

#+begin_quote
  Cause the set of images that can contain the concept's vector at a given resolution and colour coding is finite if the duration is as well. Because of this, you can guarantee that there is a minimum resolution required for the spread. Go below and it will be unable.
#+end_quote

Reducing resolution below 600x300 /might/ be enough, although the Concept in this story has many more minds to work on the problem full-time, all the time, and may be able to discover lower-resolution images producing their desired effects. (In the original story, a terrorist wielding the Parrot wears special goggles to distort his vision and prevent lethal exposure, but he winds up cumulatively seeing too much of it from too many angles, and his mind eventually puts the pieces together against his will.)

Resolution gating, noise, pixel averaging and sonar are clever defenses but would be significant handicaps in battle, especially if the Concept has its magic users disguise existing thralls as friends and loved ones of the protagonists. Disguised thralls rip off the good guys' headsets and then the Concept wins the engagement. Or the Concept builds surfaces that reflect its carrier pattern when viewed with sonar (two tones is enough: the initial infection began with a pattern scratched into a table, and in the short story the Parrot is spread with stencils and spray paint.) Or the Concept manages to convert itself into an audio signal. Or any number of other things we haven't thought of, because it's got lots and lots of minds in its grasp and it's spreading like wildfire. And that's why it's so dangerous-- it's a constantly evolving hivemind that can spread at the speed of perception and which has already started digging into the nuts and bolts of the narrative-driven framework in which this universe exists.

The only foolproof security measure against the Concept is to run away from it. However, Haley doesn't run away from trouble and she doesn't abandon innocents. And, the narrative gave us a thread in the form of Anna's daemon Telantes; unfortunately, Telantes won't be able to get too far away from Anna barring the few special mechanisms in His Dark Materials that grant daemons the ability to physically separate from their masters, but it's a Chekhov's gun now, so from a narrative standpoint it has the power to turn the tide at a critical moment. It's also a possible indication that Wonderland creatures may be vital in defeating the Concept, because their brains don't run on neural nets, they eat paradoxes for breakfast, and their narrator is safely nestled outside physical reality.

(PS: I hope you're enjoying this back-and-forth as much as I am, this shit's what I come here for, if you aren't arguing about science fiction on the internet are you even really living)
