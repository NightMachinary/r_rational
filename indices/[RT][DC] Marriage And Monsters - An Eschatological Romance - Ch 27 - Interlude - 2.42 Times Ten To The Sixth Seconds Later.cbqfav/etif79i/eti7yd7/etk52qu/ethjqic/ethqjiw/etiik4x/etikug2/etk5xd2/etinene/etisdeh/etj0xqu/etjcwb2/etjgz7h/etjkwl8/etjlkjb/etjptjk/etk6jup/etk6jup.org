It's /Wishes/, man. You can literally ask them to tell you what you should be looking for, then do the next one to narrow it down, until you've perfected the wording of the /wish/ you need, then actually use it.

Divination is broke enough in D&D/Pathfinder, having infinite /Wishes/ that can copy it /and create other spell effects/ is even more powerful.

Plus, there are spells like /Mind Blank/ on the high end and /Protection from Alignment/ on the low end that make you immune to mind control. This isn't as big a problem for Haley as you think... and that's ignoring that she's a Dragon now and thus an entirely new 'class' of creature it's not optimized to infect, with the ability to shapeshift into others.
