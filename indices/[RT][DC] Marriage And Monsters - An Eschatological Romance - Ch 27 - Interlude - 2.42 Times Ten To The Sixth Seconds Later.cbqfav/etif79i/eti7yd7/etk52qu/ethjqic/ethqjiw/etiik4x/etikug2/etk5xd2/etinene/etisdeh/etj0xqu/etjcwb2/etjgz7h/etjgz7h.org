  . (In the original story, a terrorist wielding the Parrot wears special goggles to distort his vision and prevent lethal exposure, but he winds up cumulatively seeing too much of it from too many angles, and his mind eventually puts the pieces together against his will.)

There are two explanations I can think of:

1. He really did get exposed in small amounts, which are cumulative. This means that layering several layers of defense which increase the required exposure time is probably enough to make the meme useless for combat purposes. If each layer increases the required exposure by a factor, then a few of them stacked in the right way (preferably in a constantly randomized order) mean that there isn't a single effective way to get past all the filters. This means that exposure is always minimal. This means you can possibly increase the safe exposure to its influence/proximity to months, if not decades. It's kind of similar to avoiding resistance in HIV by using several medications at once. For all intents and purposes it would not be possible to infect someone using the right set of filters without ripping off their headset. And if there's any chance you can use puppet bodies or replace your physical eyes, even that wouldn't be enough.
2. His vision simply adapted to compensate for the distortion. I imagine if you're using lenses, every image is distorted in the same way (this wouldn't be case in a computer vision filter). So I think it's possible that his brain learned to compensate for the distortion. This is the same effect as your eyes actually seeing everything upside down, but your brain correcting for the effect. You can flip your vision if you wear upside down goggles for long enough. A lot of distortion effects can actually be reversed almost perfectly if you know how the distortion works, see e.g. unswirling images.

I think the second one is more likely. You can avoid adaption if you constantly change the distortion etc. You can also make distortion effects that are effectively irreversible. Even if you do know a way to get past it at a particular time, the chance of you guessing the right one in succession to achieve enough exposure is astronomically small.

  Or the Concept manages to convert itself into an audio signal. Or any number of other things we haven't thought of, because it's got lots and lots of minds in its grasp and it's spreading like wildfire. And that's why it's so dangerous-- it's a constantly evolving hivemind that can spread at the speed of perception and which has already started digging into the nuts and bolts of the narrative-driven framework in which this universe exists.

For the purposes of the story, it already is an immensively powerful antagonist just because it has converted several magic users and a few million people while being a hivemind. Castrating its ability to spread at range isn't making it pushover. It's pretty much just evening the playing field to the point where it becomes about as infectious as a normal zombie plague/antagonist with access to mind control and telepathic communication. It loses the added danger of being a meme.

I think my methods wouldn't make for a compelling narrative, but they would be the most logical path.
