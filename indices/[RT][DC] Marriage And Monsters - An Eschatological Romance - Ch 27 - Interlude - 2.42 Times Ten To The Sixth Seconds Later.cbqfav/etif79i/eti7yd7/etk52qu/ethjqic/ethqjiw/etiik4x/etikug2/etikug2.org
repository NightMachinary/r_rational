If the Concept were limited to the description of the basilisk from its origin story BLIT, you would be precisely correct. However, the Concept is shown to evolve and plan via its thralls, so I wouldn't be surprised if it managed to "out-think" or otherwise circumvent algorithm-based filters. For one thing, it could discover the audio analog of its visual pattern, thereby opening a second sensory front on the memetic battlefield. For another, it's currently capable of spreading incredibly fast, and they have something of a counter to Haley's time dilation via Merlin's mulligan spell. Not to mention that it's going to get very good at infiltration very very fast.

The old ratfic saying "If you give Frodo a lightsaber you have to give Sauron the Death Star" appears to have been honored carefully here. Haley is super powerful but the Concept makes the Borg look like door-to-door missionaries.
