What if someone decides to strap a smartphone to their head to a) falsify colours (invert them, make everything black and white, etc.) b) reduce resolution c) train a neural network to recognize and blot out the meme signature? One of those must be effective at blocking it , otherwise the concept is not believable. Best case, coloured contact lenses/colour blindness fucks it up enough, worst case you always need a digital filter.

Or say you look at everything through a grating, there is probably grating that fucks the image up enough at the right distance to render it harmless.

To be fair though, everyone downloading an anti meme app and using a VR headset for protection does seem like it'd be kind of funny-looking.

If you bring computer vision into the picture, a sight-based meme is not nearly as dangerous as it could have been before modern technology. Chances are our wish engine could probably churn out the required program almost immediately.

Also Holmes should have come up with the idea of trying to make himself the narrator.

Also, if wishes can exploit the limits of modern technology, I'd try replacing my eyes entirely or develop contact lenses that fo the same thing.
