Well, it's certainly giving [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale Of The Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover]] a run for its money-- TFOTUMMC is extremely good as Rational-Ultimate-Showdown-Of-Ultimate-Destiny but it's only three chapters, whereas Eschatological Romance is at 27 chapters and continuing at a brisk clip with way more character development and tension.
