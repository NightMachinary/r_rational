My disagreement stems my current understanding of the fundamental nature of the Concept. I think everything you say would be completely true if the Concept's infection vector consisted of a single static image. However, the Concept's infection vector is an /infinite set/ of images, and no matter how many of them Haley's side manages to recognize and filter, the Concept will always be able to evolve another variant which won't be recognized by the software-- and its victory condition for a particular engagement consists of its prey perceiving it for a fraction of a second.

The Concept is /intelligent/ and it /evolves,/ and it has at its disposal the cunning of fiction's canniest detective and the magic of fiction's most powerful mage, and who knows how many other powerful characters. Algorithmic recognition is [[http://www.evolvingai.org/fooling][notoriously easy to break]]-- Google's phone camera software is certainly unable even to universally recognize human handwriting, regardless of those situations where it works well. The Concept should certainly be capable of evolving patterns that crash the recognition software itself (even if that software consists of time-dilated simulacra manually sorting through visual inputs (although this is probably the defense that would last the longest against it, but keep in mind that even a properly-sandboxed infected simulacrum is essentially an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_box][AI box]] scenario-- and an iterative one, if you're sensibly killing off simulacra after every use. (Re: subjects falling unconscious, the duration of unconsciousness appears to change with varying iterations of the Concept. I'll bet it could easily evolve a version that appears to have no effect, while still effectively thralling. Or even just a time-delayed version that only takes effect after an interval. Or a binary-explosive form that requires two different images to be viewed at different times. Or one that doesn't affect simulacra.)))

Add to this the fact that the Concept is capable of sending in sleeper agents and Haley's impregnable security posture is suddenly Swiss cheese. (Flagg managed to breach her security, and Flagg wasn't as big a threat as Aslan. Aslan, in turn, was not as big a threat as the Concept. What will Haley do if Sean is brought back alive and well, seeming normal as ever, but "Haley just look at this one thing for me really quick?")

The Concept's greatest strength is that it doesn't rely on magic, and therefore doesn't rely on narrative to spread: Haley can only protect people with her magic if they agree to be a part of her narrative, whereas the Concept is only ever a Skype call, blog post or infomercial away from securing more minds, more firepower, and more narrative weight. Even her infinite Wishes aren't an automatic win in this scenario.

Carriers of the Concept have no sense of self-preservation, and the Concept itself has every motivation to acquire Haley so that it can speed its burn through the multiverse. For it to win, she only has to slip up once, and it has no qualms about expending its thralls, whereas Haley will definitely have moral qualms about eradicating its shambling infected multitudes.

The Informorphs' defense mechanisms are useless against a superintelligent, fast-evolving version of the Concept. Their ancestral environment didn't include anything remotely as powerful, sheerly for anthropic principle reasons.

Add to this the fact that as long as a single instance of the Concept is recorded anywhere, it can grow back from that root. Haley will need to filter every mind in reality and every kind of recorded media in reality in order to defeat it. Even when she /thinks/ she's defeated it, it might still have a bubble dimension somewhere full of thralls ready to spill out into reality, drop a Concept spray on the Moon, blast Concept music on every frequency, and release aerosolized prions into the atmosphere whose entire job is rewiring brains to serve the Concept.

Haley has magic, but /it has magic too./ It will certainly prioritize acquisition of magic users. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Gandalf, Sauron, Galadriel, Loki, Doctor Strange, John Constantine, Eidolon, Doctor Manhattan, Harry Dresden and more are certainly on the Concept's menu-- it will seek them out to gain more power so that it can accelerate its spread.

Aslan was a /miniboss./ The Concept is /factorially/ more dangerous.
