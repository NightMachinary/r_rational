The problem is that this isn't even a Sauron Death star situation. You could do all the things I described with a team of engineers at Google in a few days at most. Haley having simulacra to serve as test subjects and having access to time dilation and wishes just makes it faster and easier. Especially acquiring training data, which might be risky otherwise, is super easy if you have someone who is immune and can label the images. If you want a working example of what I'm talking about, take a look at the live translation feature of the Google translate app (works on android, not sure about iphones). You can use your phone like a video camera to hover over text and it will alter the video feed to make it seem like the text was originally in your language. It's basically almost Dr Who Tardis translation level bullshit. The same technology exists as a proof of concept for audio already, but hasn't been implemented in any commercial products I am aware of.

If they manage to alter the pattern, that means that subjects will fall unconscious, which the meme could detect, and save the camera feed to use it as new training data to improve the network. It'll mean reduced effectiveness, but I doubt it would make it useless. There is a disadvantage in actual combat because there's usually a small processing delay, but outside of close range combat half a second isn't crippling.
