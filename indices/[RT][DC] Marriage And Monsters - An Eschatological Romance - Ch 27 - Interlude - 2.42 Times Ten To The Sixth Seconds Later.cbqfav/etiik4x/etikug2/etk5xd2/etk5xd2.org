You don't need an algorithm-based filter.

You just need glasses that aren't in your prescription. Or goggles with a bit of paint sprayed on at a distance.

You have to have enough visual resolution for the image to actual transfer over. Reduce your resolution, and it simply can't form, and thus can't infect you. And you don't need screens with pixels to do it.

Similarly, teaching a person to keep their gaze moving and not focus on patterns so hard breaks the 'cumulative' effect.

The same is true of the audio, should it evolve that far. Distort it, alter it, drown it out, whatever.
