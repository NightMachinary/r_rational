I just realized that this is the greatest (only?) piece of metafanfiction ever written. Bravo.

And now our intrepid heroes have to face Merlin, Sherlock Holmes, Lord Asriel, and a Harry Potter witch who has /already read the Harry Potter books/. God forbid she's actually incarnating HPMOR instead of the original canon.

I can't frickin' wait.
