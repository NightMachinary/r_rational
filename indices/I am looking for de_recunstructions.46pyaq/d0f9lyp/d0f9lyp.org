/[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/1295/][Of the Stars]]/ is intentionally designed to be a reconstruction of /Sailor Moon/. Quote from the author:

  For the most part it will follow the /themes/ of the anime - love, hope, redemption, friendship, forgiveness, second chances, idealism, etc - even as I reconstruct them so that they work without blatant plot backing.

I don't know if it's the kind of thing you're looking for, but it was exactly the balm I needed after stomping away from /Sailor Moon Crystal/ in disgust (the way I see it, one could be forgiven for thinking that /Crystal/ is a /deliberate attempt/ to create the most uninspired, bog-standard Magical Girl show possible).

Fair warning: it's a bit AU, and updates tend to be months apart (but several thousand words long).
