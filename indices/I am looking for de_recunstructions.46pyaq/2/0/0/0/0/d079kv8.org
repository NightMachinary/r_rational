I think there is one anime that plays with it for laughs, but generally ya it's more that there might be one or two token monster girl characters in a fiction and not an entire world/setting of them.

The weird thing is how it shows up, in a lot of MMORPG for example (although this is changing) there might be a super monstrous race that has males that are pretty obviously meant to be creatures... and then the females are to be frank barely divergent from the 'tried and true' body type of human female with maybe some horns, tail and some artful features.
