Uncommon in anime for the exact same reason it's uncommon in western media. The concept mostly got introduced by /Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou/, a manga turned show that has a frankly disgusting amount of fanservice. That's partially why it's a fetish, and the other is that the internet likes to take its own ideas and run with it.
