Whelp I'll keep working at it. One of the things I knew getting into this is that I needed more work on my characters. Thanks for the input, if you don't mind I'd like some input on what you found not working for the characters. I've been told that there was a lack of caring about them before abs been working on re-evaluating things with my work since then.
