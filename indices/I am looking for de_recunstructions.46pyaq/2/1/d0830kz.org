I am familiar with a few of the major monster girl works, and, for all its virtues, I cannot say your story struck me as a deconstruction of it. The characters mostly do not feel like Real Everyday People who just happen to be monstergirl-ified, and all the reactions feel a bit artificial.

(I have apparently not read far enough for the "how could this EVER actually happen" part. I'll take your word for it.)
