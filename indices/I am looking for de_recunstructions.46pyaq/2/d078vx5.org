Anyway [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/oh-my-generic-monster-girls-space-battle-forums-edition.366441/][I'm doing]] a deconstruction of the self insert world transformed story/genre/fetish with a side of magical creatures emerge in modern society.

The main point of the story is to ask "what and how would people actually respond to this and how could this EVER actually happen". In hind sight I'm not even sure if the original thing I'm deconstructing is/was ever popular enough that any of my readers have actually seen the original examples.
