It is a LITTLE ambiguous, but the size at the end there could apply to either "Naginata" OR "scroll" by english grammar rules. In that sense that I could say:

"I ate a chicken slice with my hand the size of my face" - it would be unclear which thing is the size of my face. Or I could say:

"He drew a sword from his scabbard covered in blue gems" - it's not clear whether the sword or the scabbard has blue gems

Technically this is the kind of thing you could get dinged on by an english teach who is a real stickler. That being said:

"He at a small egg from a basket that was a foot long" while technically grammatically ambiguous, is not actually ambiguous, because the first half of the sentence says the egg is small, so it must be the basket that is long. By the same token, a full-sized Naginata can't be twice the length of her hand, so it must be the scroll that is.

Try to avoid writing sentences like this I guess
