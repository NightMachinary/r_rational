Nope. Humongous scrolls are all well and good when you have time to unroll them to the seal you want to use, or when you're chucking the cutlery drawer at the enemy and it doesn't matter what comes out (Twin Rising Dragons), but in mid-combat something smaller and more specific is better. Think Kakashi's dog scrolls.
