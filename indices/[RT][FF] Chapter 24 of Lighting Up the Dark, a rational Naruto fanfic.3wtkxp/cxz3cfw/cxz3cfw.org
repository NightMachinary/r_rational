Now *that* was a fight scene. This feels like a return to form with Naruto starting to utilize his Uzumaki Style of fighting again.

With luck, Naruto will let this result take him down a peg. Naruto had such a big advantage with those clones, combined with henging, and Shikamaru still outplayed him at basically every single point besides his last-minute surrender from Tenten. The absolute best part of that was that Shikamaru had earplugs in the entire time, and never gave it away, which either means he read Naruto's lips when he yelled at him, or predicted how he would react with ridiculous precision. This'll teach Naruto to underestimate his opponent.
