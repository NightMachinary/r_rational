Well, so the big guy has a power that effects physical size in fun awesome ways. What if Shikamaru's core "power" is mad boost to mental capabilities, particularly, speed of thought? I can easily imagine a huge power cost difference in speeding up everything that doesn't move versus speeding up anything that does move. I mean, that's a common thing in Mage: The Awakening - stuff that effects just you is easy, but breaks as soon you as interact with anything outside.

If that's the case (or, if I wanna be all egotistical, NOW the case...), however, it means the Shadow technique is either an unusual application of that power (moving things that don't have mass, or something) and/or they're both good at and have branched out to particularly useful abilities given their core strengths (critical application of slight action). The other one I would then expect is a perceptive technique like the byakugan - something that, among other things, lets you perceive in detail outside of not only the focal point of your eyes, but through your head, as the major weakness in "I am now thinking at 100x" is getting new information....

Which kind of in turn leads into "combos are broken" - as seen in Time Braid and/or Drop of Poison? - but really as seen in /the enlightenment/. Which is now making me think about interesting historical relations between "sharing information" and "people not trying to kill you with what you taught them"...
