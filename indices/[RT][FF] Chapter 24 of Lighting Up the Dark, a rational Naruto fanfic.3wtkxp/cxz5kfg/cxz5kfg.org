First reaction: Yeah, I was pretty sure Shikamaru was going to advance. Was about 50/50 on whether Naruto would be outright defeated. I like the fact that while this Naruto might be much more rational, he's /not/ just The Smartest.

Second reaction: THAT'S GREAT AND ALL, BUT OUT OF NEJI AND HINATA, WHICH ONE, IF EITHER, ADVANCED???
