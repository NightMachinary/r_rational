Actually, the chapter covers this.

It says that Shikamaru wears his kunai holster on the left while most ninja wear it on the right. During the battle, Kin also swaps hers to be on the left, thus preventing "the obvious Shadow Imitation trick" (which you've described). However, Shikamaru has a backup plan ready for this exact eventuality (draw a bladeless, "safe" kunai for himself while forcing Kin to draw a real one).
