By the way, something I forgot to ask. Are the Nara avoiding this weird mistake that I feel like they made in canon that is to wear their equipment on "standard" locations?

I mean, in canon, during this fight, after Shikamaru gets Kin with the Shadow Repetition, he moves to grab a shuriken and obviously she ends up grabbing one too since both of their pouches are in the relatively same places. If he had just wore his on the other leg he could've grabbed one of hiks shuriken and she would have nothing.

Similarly, if a Nara ninja ever finds an enemy, and gets the Shadow Repetition on, they can make the enemy grab one of their kunai from somewhere, where, presumably the Nara would have nothing and make a stabbing motion at your own neck which would be completely harmless for the Nara and lethal to the enemy ninja
