Are you trying to write them from their point of view, or from an external view (either the reader's, or another character's)?

Could you write them as if they had been deliberately raised, corrupted, damaged, coerced, or gaslighted into being this way? If, in other words, they honestly believed they were doing the right thing, but they we acting on misinformation - possibly a lifetime of it?

In particular, if they're not themselves the kind of rationalist who automatically challenges and cross-checks every piece of information they're presented with, but just accepts everything on face value because they never learned that it was possible to do anything else?
