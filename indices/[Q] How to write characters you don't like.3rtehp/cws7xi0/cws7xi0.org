Cast away your humanity, rationality, and sympathy, dive into a twisted psyche, feed them lines from the blackening cauldron-boil of your tainted soul, and when it comes time to drop the mask, don't. They are you, now. Their thoughts, yours; their motives, your own. You are no longer you. You are a husk, a shell filled with unborn ghosts. They whisper lightning-quick commands to muscles, tendons. You move, and you are not a puppet, for there is no master. There is only you, and you smile at things that should disgust you. Your arms turn, and sometimes, you think: Where have I gone? Where is the voice screaming in the corner of my mind? But there is no voice. Accept it. Embrace it. Become it. You are not. You are all. You are a virus, a parasite. You are the thing that wears your skin, and every day it fits more snugly. You are. Do not scream. You do not need to scream. Be. Be, and place your fingernails against the keys. Hold them still. Good. Now, tap tap tap. Tap tap tap. Write out your ghosts. Describe your madness. Make yourself a mask with eyes and a moving mouth. Wear it, and forget yourself. Remember yourself. Good. Tap tap tap. Tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap. Tap. Tap. Tap tap.
