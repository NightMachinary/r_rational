In general, whenever writing feels like work I write poorly and my best (IMO) chapters have been the ones I enjoyed writing.

If that's true for you (and I posit that it is), then you need to switch their primary adjective from "unlikeable" to "interesting."

Also, if you are having a tough time writing a scene, see if you can just skip it with a sentence. Consider some Mike Hammer fight scenes.

#+begin_quote
  He had a gun.

  I took it from him.
#+end_quote

If it bores you (the writer), it will probably bore me.
