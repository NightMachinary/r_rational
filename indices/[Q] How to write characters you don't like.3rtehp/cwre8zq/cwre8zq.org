The important thing is that your own character shouldn't /bore/ you. If you don't like them, make them someone you can /hate/. Viciously, viciously hate, because of how /utterly wrong/ they are in /every/ way. Then write down all their horrible wrongnesses as character traits, while also keeping a wall in between your "ROCKS FALL YOU DIE" vengeance and their actual life-course, letting them /run rampant/ over your nice fictional world, /the bastards/.
