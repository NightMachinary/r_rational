Don't then.

If you can't empathize with their goals and think that they are stupid or silly for doing so, then spend time thinking about their backstory and why they would ever want to pursue this particular action and see if you can change their reasons, even if it amounts to the same thing in the end.

If you are trying to write about people acting stupid, then think about what flaws they must have to cause their inability to properly reason about their choices.

If you're trying to write about unpleasant individuals, then think about what formative events caused their terrible personality. It's easier to relate to someone being a bigot, if everyone who hurt them in their childhood was of the same race.

Expand their backstories to make them into multidimensional characters.
