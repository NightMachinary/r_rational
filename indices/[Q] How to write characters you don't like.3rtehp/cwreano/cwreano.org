I think you shouldn't /truly/ dislike any of your characters - they should all represent at least some element of you or elements of people you love. A flawed past version of yourself. Someone you really care about except for /uuuggh/ that one horrible, character defining flaw. that sort of thing. I've never met a person I 100% disliked, so I don't write characters like that either.

Also, I think the key to characters that get under people's skin is to have them be /just/ relatable enough that somewhere deep down you're afraid that they've got a point. That nasty voice that whispers in your head sometimes. It's hard to hate someone properly unless you see yourself in them.

And in order to write a character like that, you have to be avoid being afraid to think those thoughts and getting into the mindsets you don't particularly want to adopt. For example, try playing ideological turing - put on a mask and play around in some forum you seriously hate, and see if you can get them to upvote you for true insights that fit within their schema.
