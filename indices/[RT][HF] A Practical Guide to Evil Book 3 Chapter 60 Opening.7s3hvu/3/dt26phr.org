So, some random thoughts:

1. Order demon, huh? Lots of ways to take that name, but the most likely is that it messes with "the natural order" of Creation. Objects in motion stay in motion - except around the demon, a soldier moving forward leaves behind his skin. Objects at rest stay at rest - except around the demon, solid ground becomes like liquid. Time flows only forward - except around the demon, where it resets itself and then replays. Timey-wimey shennanigans! I feel like "Disorder" would have been a better name, but oh well...

2. Warlock death flag! He's taking the 15th, which is heavily hinted to be compromised by soldiers who ate the tainted stew and can be turned undead with a simple ritual. I really hope Juniper isn't marching off to her death as well...

3. Do we know where Thief is right now? Is she in Liesse? I forget... but it's interesting that despite her being part of the Woe, it's really only Cat/Archer/Hakram/Masego who get the rhythm. I wonder if Thief isn't a true member, kind of like how Scribe isn't a true Calamity?

4. What other trump cards do we know Ubua has? The 15th turning, as mentioned... is the Madness Demon the same one she unleashed before? Other than that just her father is a strong member. The gestalt is obviously still in play, but the implication was that she'd need a few days for her soul to be in a state ready to use it again... right?
