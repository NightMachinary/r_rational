And then it got worse....

Actual analysis comment: Interesting to note how messed up the command structure seems to get with so many high ranking named on hte battlefield. Squire being contradicted by Warlock then by Black. Named don't cooperate well unless there's very clear dominance structures. Right now black is the most powerful, but Warlock is going rogue and Squire has a seperate powerbase with the troops.

Curious to see what an order demon is, i would have assumed that would be a trait of angels. Could be order in the sense of neverchanging status, that can be a malevolent feature

Juniper's quote is excellent:

  “I am,” she said calmly, “a general of the Legions of Terror, anointed and sworn under sacred standard. If a Hell wages war upon the Empire, then I will invade that Hell.”

Odd that squire keeps mentioning that her way of speaking is not the same as a Name. Could be ironic foreshadowing. "General" would make a good Name.
