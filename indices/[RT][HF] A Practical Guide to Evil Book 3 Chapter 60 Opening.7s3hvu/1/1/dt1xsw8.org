  Next, Scribe. She is technically not a Calamity but she is affiliated and she must die before Black does so she gets on this list. So what do we know about her? Not much really. She is from the free cities, her name is Eudokia and she is a scribe. We also got a few start of chapter quotes by a "Eudokia, the Oft-Abducted, Basilea of Nicae" which I can only assume is the same person as Scribe and that everyone but me noticed the connection even though I haven't seen it mentioned.

I'm fairly sure Eudokia the Oft-Abducted was an old ruler of Nicae and not Scribe. Just because they share a name doesn't mean they're the same person.

Here's another quote from her:

  Always walk into traps. Evil is clever and patient and never as vulnerable as when it thinks it holds all the cards.

Strikes me as a guide for the good guys rather than something one of the Calamities would say.
