Right, but the fact of the matter is that Captain only died because of an even savvier player.

Subversion is the heart of this story. Also, I think a big chunk of what emphasizes a 'story' in this universe is intent. Captain's death blindsided Black because they didn't know about the foreign story and thus they fell into the trap of seeing it through.

It may be difficult to see the Calamities step down without dying, but I think it's certainly possible. Your list of examples is true in the sense that yes, losing teammates makes it hard to fight, but it really doesn't jive with Black as a character. He's not going to commit to the same plan without the same pieces on the board. You can still wage war without the same Names by your side, and in this case he is doing so by using the Woe. It still works.
