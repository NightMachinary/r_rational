I understand what you mean but I'm not sure how much they can be taken out of the picture. Ranger is already retired so it is not clear if she needs to be more out of the picture but I have a very hard time seeing Warlock and Scribe leaving Black's side in this war.

For me it is a matter of Pact like precedent setting. Each time a pattern happens it is easier to do then the last time. The Calamities have been handicapped by not having Ranger for a very long time. They did just fine without her, because they are powerful, because they are savvy, because they are clever and yet one could easily see that having Ranger in the Nicae fight could have easily turned the fight in their favor. If Ranger where in that fight she would have been the one to duel the Champion while Captain would have probably been with Black where she fits. Instead Captain let's out the Beast, like she has done many times before, and her luck/skill has run out.

This is due to Bard's interference as you mentioned, but the next time the Calamities are going to try something they are more handicapped. How much can your savviness and experience carry you when every time you lose it becomes that much harder? How long can you keep playing the same game if you keep losing crucial board pieces? The Woe is now coming to reinforce Black on the front lines to help him punch through the defences, this is the exact spot where I expect Captain and Ranger to be of use to him and fight by his side.

Right now he has Warlock's Link giving him the ability to orchestrate battles, we have seen him use it before to control all pieces of the battlefield and maneuver his soldiers but what happens when Warlock dies? Suddenly the game plan doesn't work as well anymore, he can't be on the front leading the fight and still control the battlefield like a general. There are reasons why we see Ranker standing next to her mages, they give her communication and access to information. Suddenly if Black is on the front lines he can no longer simply ask backup, he cannot call out to have a mage line help him like he did before.

Simply put, with every loss the Calamities tactics become harder and harder to do until it all simply crumbles. They have survived decades without Ranger on the roster because they are savvy, because they are clever, because they set the field well but each death causes an easier next death.
