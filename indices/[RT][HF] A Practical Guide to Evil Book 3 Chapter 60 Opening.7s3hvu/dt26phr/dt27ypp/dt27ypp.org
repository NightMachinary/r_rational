I agree on 3, and as far as 4 goes she keeps using these trump cards too soon in my opinion. Opening a gate after forces fully committed to assaulting the walls would have been a better option. Using demons after either Hierophant was somewhere dealing with something already or in such a way so as to get the most splash damage on the legions would have been better, not to mention how that works with the You Have Just Activated My Trap Card story mechanics.
