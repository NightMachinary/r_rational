To me this chapter exemplifies why Black and the rest of Calamities need to die by the end of this book. A crisis occurs and instead of figuring things out Cat and her group are relegated to fulfilling orders. It seems almost like that was the purpose of the chapter: Cat is about to get things moving when Warlock descends from the heavens and orders them around instead.

This isn't to say that I dislike this - within the setting it makes perfect sense for the Woe to listen to their more experienced counterparts - however it takes away too much of their agency for the story to be satisfying. Ultimately, this is Cat's story and having her act out orders would not a good story make.
