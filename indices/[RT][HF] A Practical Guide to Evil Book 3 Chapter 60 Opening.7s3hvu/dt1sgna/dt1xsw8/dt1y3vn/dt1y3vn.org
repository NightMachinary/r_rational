Like I stated above, I made the connection a while back but I have seen no one making any mention of it. I completely agree with you, it does not seem to be Scribe and because we are missing so much information about her it is hard to even invalidate my claim.

Pretty much the only thing we really got on her is:

  “The Free Cities,” he said. “It was an interesting encounter in many ways."
#+end_quote

I'm mostly speculating here but I think Scribe used to be a hero. The Name as I stated above fits the free city of Delos which is supposed to be on the side of Good. I could see a person which had such terrible experiences as Eudokia the Oft-Abducted did ultimately break with the side of good. It could also explain why Black referred to their meeting as an interesting encounter.

Once again though, too much information is missing to validate/invalidate my mad theory which makes it hard to guess things. It would definitely be simpler if they are simply different people.
