  Was surprised to see that Brian was female, considering their name. Why was having sex seen as odd?

The crew have rather different norms regarding sexuality and gender than we do. Also a very different approach to naming.

Arthur is something of an outsider due to their social anxiety issues, so their opinions tend to be based on but not in perfect alignment with the broader norms. In this case Brian is much closer to the consensus view but maybe a bit on the extreme side, while Arthur is going "Yeah I guess the consensus view is mostly correct but honestly I have bigger things to worry about".
