Was surprised to see that Brian was female, considering their name. Or at least, I think they were going by that 'curvy' comment - it's hard to tell sometimes due to the different way things are phrased from this far-off potential future viewpoint.

Why was having sex seen as odd? The MC had a perfectly respectable view on it, and similar topics I imagine you were paralleling today (religious views, sexual orientation, etc), so Brian's reaction is a bit confusing regarding it.
