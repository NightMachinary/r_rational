100% agreed. The trade fleet (or at least this part of it - I don't know how uniform they are in this regard) are a little better than that - they're not so much military authoritarianism as small scale communism with a fairly rigidly enforced consensus - but they're very far from a libertarian free for all.

This story is loosely inspired by Vernor Vinge's Qeng Ho, but one of the things I realised fairly early on in writing it is that I didn't really believe in his social model for them at all (Vinge is solidly in the libertarians in space camp), so I ended up with something very different.
