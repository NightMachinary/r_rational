I mean yeah but I feel that "optimized for social unity" is maybe not achieved by forcing the social awkward person into a mold, and it's just /strange/ to me that if they have planetary interaction and game theory mapped out every step and every scenario down to the tenths of percents, they can fail so transparently at integrating a nerd.

Maybe it's a case of the Cobbler's Children? Lots of planning for the show on the big stage but nobody running things behind the curtain.
