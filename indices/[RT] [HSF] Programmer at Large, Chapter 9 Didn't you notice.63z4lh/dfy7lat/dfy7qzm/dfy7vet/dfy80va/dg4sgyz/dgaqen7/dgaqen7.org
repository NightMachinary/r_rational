Actually, I've realised the obvious explanation (which may well be fully explained in a future chapter, but either way is certainly consistent with and more or less implied by the current text).

Arthur doesn't have an anxiety disorder at all. They're neuroatypical in some complex way (probably either actually autism or something related) which causes them to have a lot of difficulties with social interaction. They are then made perfectly rationally anxious by interacting with the ship's complex social system while being completely intellectually unsuited for doing so.

As a result while they /can/ take drugs to reduce their anxiety, that can't help that much without severely impeding their ability to think, because their anxiety is more or less proportionate to the situation in which they find themself.
