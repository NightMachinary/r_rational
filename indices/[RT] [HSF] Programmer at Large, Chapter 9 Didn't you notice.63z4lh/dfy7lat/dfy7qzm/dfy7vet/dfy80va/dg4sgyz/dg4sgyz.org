This is the part that's SOD breaking though. Before I knew they could /turn off the sex drive/ without major maladjustments, it seemed more reasonable that they don't have miracle treatments for social anxiety or just plain not wanting to socialize.

But if you have such a degree of control over brain and hormones, how does it make sense that they wouldn't have conquered social anxiety, too? /Especially/ given the priority placed on social unity!

Also, just making people asexual but not /aromantic/ isn't going to get rid of jealousy, but /does/ get rid of a lot of bonding/grooming functions...

Yeah, the whole thing just seems weird to me, on account of sex and romance have a /lot/ more complexity than plain old social anxiety. Technologically speaking, they should've been able to solve social anxiety /long/ before they got the bugs out of the giant ball of mud that is sex, romance, and gender.

All that being said, I get how, from a Doylist perspective this lets ace readers with social anxiety relate to the protagonist... it just doesn't make sense from the Watsonian perspective, given that we /already/ have more available drugs for social anxiety than we do for turning off sex drive. (While completely ignoring the issue of how you convince people to /want/ to turn off their sex drives in the first place...)
