Yeah, their priorities roughly go:

1. Long term survival of humanity
2. Long term survival of the trade fleet
3. Long term survival of this particular lineage of the trade fleet
4. Long term survival of this ship.
5. Individual happiness of the crew members

All of these priorities are important, but items higher up the list have a much heavier weighting, and even on the happiness metric the way they aggregate and model such things means that the way they treat Arthur is mostly a net win: They believe that a well integrated crew is sufficiently better for most people that the cost to the people who struggle with that is worth it.

Obviously this sucks for Arthur (and would suck for me too), but from a coldly utilitarian point of view and for their particular problem domain they're not obviously wrong.
