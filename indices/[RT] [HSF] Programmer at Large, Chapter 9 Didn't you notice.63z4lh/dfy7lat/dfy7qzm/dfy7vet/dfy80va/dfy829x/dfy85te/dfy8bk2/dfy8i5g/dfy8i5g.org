I think you're probably underestimating just how much data they have and how long they've been refining their metrics based on it. I'm also not sure how much they care about the difference between measuring the person and measuring the externally visible characteristics of the person (which include quite a lot of preference elicitation due to the voting system).

Spree killing in particular is probably a non-issue (they have a /lot/ of ways to avoid it, but the easiest is just that they've had a huge amount of selection pressure and deliberate engineering against aggression). The failure mode they're trying to avoid is societal breakdown rather than individuals snapping.
