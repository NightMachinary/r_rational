  they can fail so transparently at integrating a nerd.

Well, they're not really failing. By the metrics they care about, Arthur is an adequately integrated member of society. These are not the same metrics /Arthur/ cares about, but that's not that important from a social planning point of view.

Arthur also has a sort of thresholding problem where they /can/ integrate, but don't enjoy it. If they were substantially less socially anxious they'd be fine. If they were substantially more socially anxious and unable to integrate as a result then they'd be dropped off on a convenient planet with an apology and a large trust fund. Arthur has that option if they want to take it, but on balance prefers to stay on ship and deal with the unpleasant aspects of that.
