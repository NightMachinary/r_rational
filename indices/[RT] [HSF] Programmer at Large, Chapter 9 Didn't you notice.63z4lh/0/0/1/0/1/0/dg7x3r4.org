  it just doesn't make sense from the Watsonian perspective, given that we already have more available drugs for social anxiety than we do for turning off sex drive.

I agree there's a bit of an unfilled plot hole about the effectiveness of anti-anxiety drugs. I think you're overestimating the effectiveness of the ones we have though. Arthur's behaviour is largely based on that of my friends with social anxiety /after/ they've taken their meds (and, to a lesser extent, off mine, but mine is milder than Arthur's and I don't medicate for it), and Arthur is probably on some sort of medication themselves.

I also think you're overestimating the difficulty of turning off a sex drive. A lot of the drugs we currently have for anti-anxiety will do that by accident.

For the moment I'm choosing to just brush the details of this under the carpet as "Brains are hard, hormones are easy" though.

Also in general drug availability is driven by demand rather than ease of the problem. We probably have more drugs for anxiety because more people want to fix their anxiety than turn off their sex drive.

  While completely ignoring the issue of how you convince people to want to turn off their sex drives in the first place...

This is actually relatively easy: When creating a new ship, you split on whether people think this is a worthwhile experiment to try. You then do it by default to kids (turns out trade fleet medical ethics are rather different to ours), and the next generation grows up thinking this is normal. Note that the norms you are seeing are those of the /ship/ (and a non-trivial but unknown fraction of their lineage), not of the entire trade fleet.

Oh, also, they've not really done anything medical to romance or gender, that's just a result of constructed social norms.
