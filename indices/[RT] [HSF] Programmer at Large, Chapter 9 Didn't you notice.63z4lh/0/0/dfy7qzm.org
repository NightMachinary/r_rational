  It's kind of weird that the best this future can do about "this person does not want to play social games" is "force them to play social games anyways."

Note that the future in question is heterogeneous. It's not the best that the future can do, it's the best that this particular highly resource constrained tiny corner of the future that is optimised for social unity does.

(But yes, the future in question is very explicitly non-utopian. It's better in some ways, worse in others, and just different in yet more)
