  It's not the best that the future can do, it's the best that this particular highly resource constrained tiny corner of the future that is optimised for social unity does.

This is probably the best you can expect for a sublight starship, or a low tech space colony, or any other environment where continuous obsessive resource management and infrastructure repair is required for basic survival.

You're not going to get the libertarian-in-space future that a lot of American SF authors write about for a long time, if at all. A military authoritarianism is much more likely.
