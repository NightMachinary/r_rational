I hadn't really gotten the impression that the internal structure of the Queng Ho was really well described in /Deepness/. The ships themselves seem to be mostly independent, but internally they seemed to have a pseudo-military organization.

The Beyonders in /Fire/ might be a different matter, but they have resources and redundancies that are far beyond the technology level I'm talking about.
