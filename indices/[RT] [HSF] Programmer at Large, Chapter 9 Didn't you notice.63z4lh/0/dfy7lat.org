What a weird and confusing sociology.

I want to hug Arthur a lot. Metaphorically. By which I mean leave them alone to do the stuff they enjoy. Possibly talk about exciting tech topics.

It's kind of weird that the best this future can do about "this person does not want to play social games" is "force them to play social games anyways."

It kind of has a Rapture of the Nerds ambience of "just because this is /future/ doesn't mean it's /better/".
