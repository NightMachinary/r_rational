This would be really interesting. I especially like that the link between brains is at a subconscious level. It is not as if you are connected telepathically to others but as if you share the "same" subconscious and therefore arrive at similar beliefs and biases.

I do not know enough about psychology to make suggestions but this would be very interesting. I would suggest that not all of the results of this would be bad. Also, cults might become more unified, but skepticism of cults is widespread and that would become unified as well. I think that this is really an examination of individualism (the belief that individuals are most important unit of society). Remember that some people do not believe individualism and they are perfectly rational in their disbelief.
