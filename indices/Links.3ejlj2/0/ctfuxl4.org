Sounds like /Unstable Orbits in the Space of Lies/ by Greg Egan.

It's a short story, about a city with this sort of phenomenon (although the mind-link is magical rather than technological, it otherwise works the way you've described). Philosophies end up divided along geographical lines - you have a Buddhist neighbourhood, a nihilist neighbourhood, a Catholic neighbourhood, etc - because the effect diminishes with distance and people are drawn towards other people who agree with them. The main characters are vagrants who live in the spaces where these beliefs overlap and combine and they're less likely to be pulled into any particular basin.

It's a weird story even by Egan's standards.
