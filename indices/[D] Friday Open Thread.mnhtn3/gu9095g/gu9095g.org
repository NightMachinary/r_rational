*Hypothetical Question: Deserted Island + Letter Envelope*

You are stranded on a desert island (a bit like in CastAway) with no possibility of escape (lets assume the island is on a human-less version of Earth or something).

You will be teleported back after 10 years.

You can receive one standard letter envelope each morning. It will fall down from the sky.

You can pick the contents of the envelope, but it will be exact same contents with each one, for 10 years.

The contents must fit into a standard, non modified letter envelope, without it being specifically altered, torn, etc, and it must close normally.

What would be your most rational choice of items?
