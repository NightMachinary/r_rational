(mobile typing is ass, but here's how I think about values and stuff)

~1. Work out what you value about yourself.

-Is it just your wellbeing in the current moment you value?

-How much does a point in the future where you have concerns about your wellbeing matter to your values today?

-Do different aspects of your wellbeing matter differently? You could keep on living after losing an arm, not so much your brain. On a less dramatic scale, how do you weigh sources of enjoyment/pleasure/fulfillment/sustenance/protection?

-How important are your own beliefs to you?

-How important is the proliferation of your beliefs to you?

~2. Work out why/how you value others.

-Is there innate value in a person?

-Do you value the people close or similar to you more? (physically close like distance, socially/emotionally close like friends/family/coworkers/etc, judgement-based closeness like similar opinions and beliefs)

-If you value others, how do you value the people that they themselves value? And so on?

-How does time change these assessments? Does valuing someone over a period of time, a limited time in the past, or having the potential to value them in the future, change your assessment?

-If time and the social links that connections have matter (ie. Friend of a friend, uncle's great-granddaughter, cousin thrice-removed, etc.), then assessing your impact in the future and its consequences for others matters.

-What determines whether someone gets assessed if they could potentially have value in the first place? Appearance? Similar experiences? Thinking patterns and intelligence? Opinions and beliefs? (questions to ask yourself here are how do you value someone braindead, even if you valued them before such a state? How do you value animals? What distinctions between animal and human are the ones that matter? Can animals meet these distinctions with help, like if you teach a gorilla sign language?)

-If changes to technology and knowledge can change how you value others (and what value others could potentially hold in the first place), how much leeway do you give in your valuing of others, based on changes you could not predict? (relating to the previous, if we met intelligent aliens tomorrow, what differences/categories between valuing animals vs valuing humans would be obsolete?)

~3. What are you basing your decisions on?

-How accurate is your knowledge and evidence? How broad or deep for different topics? How wide are your error bars on your judgement?

-If you value others at all, how does their knowledge get weighed against yours?

-If you work out theoretical scenarios, situations, and people, do your methods of assessing value hold up? Where do they break down? How reliable should the questions you ask and definitions you abide by be?

I feel like I could spend hours writing this out and still not be able to express things fully, but the most important one to me is that last one. Since I don't think your current judgements should be taken as absolute, the more time passes the more experience and knowledge you gain to make judgements with after all. But rather than rely on time and having your experiences accumulate (and hopefully be relevant), you can start thinking through hypotheticals to update your valuing constantly.

I also think trying to break down and understand how you think and make decisions to be a worthwhile endeavour, since it lets you both check for errors in the process, and optimise them for future decisions. Going through countless hypotheticals helps bring to light faultlines and inaccuracies in your assessments as you make tweaks and updates.

Anyway I'm the type of person who has spent way too much time inside their own head, so trying to boil that down to something simple is hard. But tl;dr work out what you value, then work out why, then work out what would have to change for that valuation to change, then decide if that point of contention is relevant/worthwhile. Rinse and repeat across hundreds of sleepless nights and simulated arguments with yourself.

Edit: Also the meaning of existence =/= the meaning of your existence. The latter is a hell of a lot easier to work out, and the former would require a ludicrous amount of knowledge to determine (and there's the question of it that knowledge is relevant to you at all).
