Capitalism does not value efficiency. That has also been sacrificed to the terminal value of increasing shareholder value. We know this, because if efficiency were actually instrumental to capitalism, all corporations would spontaneously reorganize into socially owned worker cooperatives, as those are known to be more robust and productive than traditional corporations. The reason this is not happening is because doing so eliminates shareholders as a concept, as the business is owned entirely by the workers or a union which represents them.

Doing this does not increase shareholder value. And so, attempts to do it often result in the organizers being literally murdered by fascists (see: Revolutionary Catalonia, the Coal Wars, Nicaraguan Sandanistas, etc).
