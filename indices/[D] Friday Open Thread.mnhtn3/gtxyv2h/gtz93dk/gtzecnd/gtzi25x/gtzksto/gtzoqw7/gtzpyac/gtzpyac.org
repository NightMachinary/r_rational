There is a working model which goes a long way towards fixing many of these issues, actually.

1. Unionize your workplace.

2. Fuck up your workplace's business operations until the owner agrees to sell to the union.

3. The union runs the business as a democratic worker cooperative.

These aren't some utopian pipe dream. Thousands of them exist worldwide, and the largest one employs over 80,000 people in Spain. They are more robust to economic downturn, provide better benefits to their workers, are more productive, and actually care about minimizing environmental harm because they're run by people who need to live in the environment. Creating one can be done entirely nonviolently by turning your boss' life into a living economic hell through strikes, deliberate economic sabotage, and vexatious litigation.

This allows you to modularly replace exploitative capitalist industry with socialist industry (as in: industry run by the workers for mutual social good rather than for profit). The reason more of them don't exist is because there are no shareholders under this model. Therefore, capitalism resists their creation by literally murdering the people who try to create them. And also by lying to you, personally, so you believe no other options exist.
