Yep. I really liked the first one but I don't usually like movie and game sequels as much because the novelty tends to wear off and that was the case here. The beginning of the sequel was ok but I got to a branching story point and wanted to see all the choices -- mechanically it's a bother to do that so I stopped there.

I didn't realize the game was an unfinished trilogy when I started it, I probably wouldn't've played it if I did.
