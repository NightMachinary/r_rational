  I'm not the biggest fan of computational stuff. Brains, the universe, everybody has decided to believe that everything is a computational system, and I think they're wrong and it's a framework that's outlived its usefulness, but whatever.

Not everything is computation. Though information theory does play a role in physics.

  But I do like ideas that assume the fabric of spacetime is discrete and actually made of something, and that me and you and the sun and the universe and quarks and electrons and everything else are actually made of spacetime rather than being something separate that sits on top of spacetime.

Isn't that also quantum field theory? It is interesting to think about string / brane theory and what it implies (if it is true, which is a long way from being proven). We have these little "things" that can vibrate, or are a surface, and it is in some sense natural to ask what those things are made of. Though that may not be answerable.
