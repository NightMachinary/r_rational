I mean, I don't know anything about phones or cameras, but there's a third option besides "get a new phone with a better camera" and "not get anything at all" - look into getting a thin digital camera for a few hundred bucks.

Probably not as good as your bulky expensive camera, but thin enough that you can carry it around in your pocket and keep it on you at all times, and almost certainly better image quality than a phone camera. From what I've read in the past few minutes, it looks like the iPhone 12's camera is still a phone camera with most of the same limitations as any other phone camera. A good phone camera, maybe better than most other phone cameras, but still a phone camera.

The camera you mentioned is a Sony, so I looked at Sony's website and found these:

There are cheaper ones, and more expensive ones, and I don't know how good any of those cameras are, I just wanted to bring up the third option: keep your phone, use the money on a thin camera you can carry around in your pocket.
