Going to go against the grain and say personally I upgrade my phone every two years and get something mid-high tier (I'm Australian so I spend $800-$1000 AUD, the last few phones being the OnePlus offering of the time) because I spend HOURS and HOURS looking at it every day (let's be fair here) and having a new shiny faster phone is nice.

Yes it's 100% a luxury but if you are going to have anything as a luxury the thing that you (no doubt) spend the most time looking at and interacting with is the way to do it.
