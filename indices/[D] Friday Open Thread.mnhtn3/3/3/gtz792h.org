If you have the money and the purchase would increase your quality of life buy it. I'd look into other purchases that would improve my quality of life to a higher degree, but that depends on how optimized or convenient your day to day life is.

From what you said you're already in your 30s so the assumption is that you already have things optimized to a reasonable degree, if that's the case just buy the phone. But if you're one of those people that doesn't have things like dishwashers, driers, airfrier and other basic convenience tools I'd say look into those, assuming you'd have to choose between them.
