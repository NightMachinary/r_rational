I was thinking about similar things this past week, though more from the angle of pollution in the environment.

I was thinking about ways to reduce the amount of trash I generate, and more generally about this for all of society, and of waste in general. I can reduce my consumption and thereby my waste, but I have to convince the rest of society (at least enough to have laws passed) to do the same.

You can start with things like paper bags going in the trash vs. going into the recycling. But then you look at consumption overall, and start asking questions like: "Why should people have hobbies like jet skis, when they could just be walking through a forest preserve instead?" Do people really need jet skis? Sure, they are fun, but we could encourage people to have fun in other ways.

And of course, where does this end, before we get to everyone sitting at home meditating? And then from there we go to what, the Human Extinction Project? Of course, what's the point of that either? Why not just do whatever the hell we want, consequences and pollution be damned? What gives tigers in the jungle more right to exist than we do?

But of course, reducing consumption isn't sustainable either, without 100% adherence by the entire world. If gathering resources, and polluting more provide an advantage to one small group, they will eventually take over. Unless, of course, there is a worldwide catastrophe.

Capitalism is, at its base, about competition for limited resources. And the competition is never really opt-out. We are all in competition, all the time, in all aspects of our existence.

AGI will be created by corporations, whenever and however they provide a competitive advantage. And corporations will eventually be subsumed by AGI in turn, in the name of greater efficiency. Greater shareholder value.

One of the few ways out of all this that occurs to me, is a Star Trek Borg-like existence, where all are forcibly incorporated into the Collective, and there is no competition. Only a singular vision, a singular goal for all to work towards. This does not seem like a desirable outcome to me.

I don't know, I think we're all screwed.

Also, what's the meaning of existence?
