  Capitalism, at the core, is about selling people things they want

Strong disagree. This maybe seems true on the surface, but if you go back a few steps it becomes clear capitalism is about manipulating people into either needing the product you sell or thinking they need it.

Let's look at landlords as a big example. Everyone needs shelter, obviously. That's not the manipulation. But not everyone needs to rent from a landlord. Lots of people don't even now, but going back further you see entire societies which existed in the past and present where the concept of renting didn't exist at all. It's only once you have individuals who both own lots of land (ownership here in the sense of the society they live in giving them the unilateral right to deny anyone else access to it) and have enforcement mechanisms, that you get landlords.

How is this relevant? Capitalism manipulates society into creating those conditions when they didn't previously exist. The enclosure of the commons in England meant a whole lot of land which had been held in common, essentially owned by no individual but accessible to every individual, was parceled out to individuals. Who were then forced to sell it to wealthy landlords by various economic conditions. This was deliberate on the part of capitalists, turning something which had never been a product into one, and turned a whole lot of freeholders into tenants. Which let the aristocratic class of feudalism maintain their power into the modern age, not by selling people things they wanted, but by forcing them to need something they had bought every supply of. Then they jack up the price until everyone on their land is barely treading water economically, and they are exploiting their tenants harder than they ever could their serfs.

That doesn't even get into things like marketing, which has gotten so effective it can sell literally worthless garbage at massive profit margins, and the chicanery which went into destroying American public transport so absurdly inefficient modes of private transport can be sold to each individual. Individuals don't want essential oils or cars as part of their terminal goals. They are manipulated into thinking they want essential oils, and given no option except a car by capitalists who bought and literally trashed all of the alternatives. These things serve to increase shareholder value at the cost of things humans actually value.

So no. Capitalism is not aligned with human values, because its goal isn't something humans value. We've been manipulated into valuing money by a system which routes all the things we value, like safety, food, and comfort, through processes which increase shareholder value at the cost of everything else. And also the cost of the literal planet we live on.
