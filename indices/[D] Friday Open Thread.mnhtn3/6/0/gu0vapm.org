Capitalism doesn't optimize for anything, because unlike an AGI, capitalism is not an agent and does not take actions. People are agents and they have many goals which may or may not maximize shareholder returns. In fact, a major area of study in business and economics is the issue of principal agent theory and the misalignment of goals between owners and managers.

The issue that you have is that people's values do not align with humanity's values in many cases. This would occur regardless of capitalism or any other system (and what replacement for capitalism would you like?). However, we have found that capitalism tends to produce the best outcomes, despite not being completely optimal and having unwanted externalities.
