I'm not the biggest fan of computational stuff. Brains, the universe, everybody has decided to believe that everything is a computational system, and I think they're wrong and it's a framework that's outlived its usefulness, but whatever.

But I do like ideas that assume the fabric of spacetime is discrete and actually /made of something/, and that me and you and the sun and the universe and quarks and electrons and everything else are actually made of spacetime rather than being something separate that sits on top of spacetime.
