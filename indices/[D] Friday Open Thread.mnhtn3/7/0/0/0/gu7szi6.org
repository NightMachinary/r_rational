Well that's probably because computational systems are more general than you think.

I mean if you have something that has a finite set of states and transitions between them depending on some external imput you can see it as a finite state machine.

Saying something is computable or equivalent to a computational system its not really assuming it has a weird specific computery structure it's assuming wayy less than that.

Plus incorporating insights from how brain seems to work does produce ai advances, we successfully reproduce whith computers things only brains were capable of doing before all the time etc.
