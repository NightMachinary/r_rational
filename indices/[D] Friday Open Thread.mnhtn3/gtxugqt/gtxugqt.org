I'm subscribed to Markiplier on YouTube, and I watch... less than 60% of his videos but more than 20%? It fluctuates. I'm subscribed to a lot of channels, I can't watch every video from every channel every day.

Anyways, I clicked on the video he put out yesterday to see if I wanted to watch it. I ended up watching it. Game is called The Fall. It's looks a lot like that game Limbo from a few years ago, except instead of being a kid lost in the woods or whatever it was, it's sort of like the beginning of Halo 3 where somebody in an armor suit falls from space and hits the ground.

Twist is, you're not Master Chief, you're his armor, it's like Iron Man armor with an AI in it, and you play as the AI piloting the armor to save your pilot who's been knocked unconscious from the fall.

The AI has its own “three laws” and I thought they were interesting:

1) Must not misrepresent reality.

2) Must be obedient.

3) Must protect active pilot.

Obviously that's similar to Asimov's three laws:

1) Don't injure humans or allow them to come to harm through inaction.

2) Obey orders given by humans unless the orders would conflict with the First and Third Laws.

3) Protect your own existence (unless that conflicts with the other two laws).

The Fall's third law is similar to Asimov's first, and the second laws are basically the same.

Obviously everybody doing a story with an AI and three laws is almost certainly inspired by Asimov, I just thought it was interesting that they replaced "a robot must protect its own existence" with "must not misrepresent reality," and there's a distinction between "must protect active pilot" and "must not harm humans."

Here's the video:

If you don't watch people play games on youtube, but you play games yourself, maybe watch the first 6ish minutes and see if you wanna buy the game. It's not a recent release, 2014, but I'd never heard of it before I watched Mark's video, it's an indie game so maybe you've never heard of it either.

Even if you do neither, the AI stuff in this is pretty interesting. I don't think anyone has ever said Markiplier has an unpleasant voice, and the game is atmospheric and the characters are interesting and whatever, so if you're interested in stories with AI characters maybe watch it even if you don't normally watch "gamers scream at games" videos.

Obviously I don't know much about AI, but the AIs seem to be written pretty reasonably for something mainstream and that's part of what made me decide to continue to watch the game even though I skip a lot of them.
