I do like Markiplier's voice. It's very mature and deep. But then he screams. Not a lot, but just sometimes.

What I've described is probably why he's popular. He's got a mature/authoritative voice but with explosions.

I'd watch a lot more of him if he stopped the screaming and adding loud edits/sound effects, but then he'd simultaneously lose a lot of his popularity.

As for the game.... I remember watching another YouTuber play it a number of years ago (don't remember which one). I recall the, "must not misrepresent reality," comes into play somehow.
