"Suit saving it's owner" was a short story I remembered reading; maybe I can find it again.

I've had an idea for a video game floating around where you play as the suit, but it's still an FPS but you really only target enemies for the pilot to shoot at (with limited AI override control over the suit itself). The game would track how much your pilot trusts you (frequency of AI overrides, how reliable your recommendations are), with branching plot paths based off that.

Part of a series of "third-person" video game ideas, where you don't really play as the protagonist but as a supporting character.
