Also it's now been a year since my jurisdiction's last "unknown source" case of COVID-19 (i.e. since last community transmission). We've basically been living the post-covid life since July/August. Feel so privileged even if Australia's vaccination rollout is kind of pathetic and the AZ vaccine (our main one) may actually not be appropriate for under 55s after all.
