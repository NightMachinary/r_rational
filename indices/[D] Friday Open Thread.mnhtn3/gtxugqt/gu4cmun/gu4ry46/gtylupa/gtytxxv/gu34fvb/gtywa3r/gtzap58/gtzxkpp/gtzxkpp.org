That doesn't look like it'd fit in your pocket. The ones I linked are all... maybe not quite as thin as a phone, but pocketable.

I think you've already decided that you want a new phone. That's fine, I just thought I'd spitball an alternative. It really seems like a dedicated digital camera would take noticeably higher quality pictures than a phone, even a phone with a better camera than most phones, and I figured that since you own a $2,000 camera you might want to take better pictures than what can be taken with a phone.

But yeah, I guess we've only got a limited number of pockets to work with, and I guess it's not realistic to keep a dedicated camera on you at all times regardless of how thin it is when you've already got to keep a phone and a wallet and keys on you at all times.
