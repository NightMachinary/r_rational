I think the limiting factor for me isn't so much the weight (the 35mm f1.8 is pretty small, and another option would be to get a pancake lens to toss on the already quite small mirrorless), it's having another little doodad to keep track of. A phone, meanwhile, is on me at all times. Spec-wise, I think phone cameras are not all that exceptional compared to point-and-shoots (i.e. in terms of sensor size, lens quality, etc.), but they have a lot of computational tricks going on under the hood that make images looks much better straight out of the camera (plus some hardware perks, e.g. lidar for low-light focusing, or sensor-shift stabilization, which my a7iii has implemented in under the heading of IBIS, but point-and-shoots would lack (you only get it on Sony's mirrorless cameras w/ the a6500 and up).
