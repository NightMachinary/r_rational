Well, I do want a new phone, haha. But I think I've decided to hold off, maybe until the fall for the iPhone 13. Current phone's good enough for now, and a 2021 iPad Pro should satisfy the itch for a shiny new toy.

Otherwise the 35mm f1.8 isn't pocketable, certainly! But maybe with a 2.8 the a7iii would be. Plus I just sold off my previous camera, which while not point-and-shoot size came close (an a6000, incl. the 18-50 kit lens)
