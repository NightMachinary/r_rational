Anyone here know anything about phones? I've been using a hand-me-down iPhone 7 for a few years now and it's still going strong, but I'm feeling some itch to upgrade, mostly in the interests of getting a better camera. Costco's having a sale on the iPhone 12 line, and I'm thinking of getting a Pro or Pro Max... mostly for the improvements to screen real estate and camera. However, I already have a solid camera (an a7iii w/ 24-105mm f4, 100-400mm f5.6, and 35mm f1.8), I just don't have it on me at all time and therefore miss lots of shots. I'd also maybe use the phone for a bit of videography -- out-of-camera it seems like iPhones' internal computational algorithms are better than those of the competing phones, like the s21u. Would probably pick up a lightweight 3-axis gimbal for that, too. (I'm also studying computational biology and so am plenty familiar with macOS, and will probably get one of the new iPad Pros when they release for drawing / reading papers, so it'd be nice to stay in the same ecosystem).

But it's also, like, $1k, and I already have a perfectly working camera & phone. Anyone wanna talk me into or out of upgrading?

(financially, I'm finally at a place where I can afford shiny toys like this a bit more frivolously, having moved up to a postdoc making $65k per year to parallel my wife's residency making $75+40k per year. Even though rent's crazy high we don't have dependents and so are left with lots of 'fun-money' after retirement etc. funds are withdrawn -- certainly much cushier than our $15-$45k grad student stipends!)
