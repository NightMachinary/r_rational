Nice list! A few points:

- The salt should only be necessary if the island is not in a salt ocean, otherwise farming salt should be very easy.
- I always thought chewing gum is bad for your teeth or are there special kinds of gum?
- Toilet paper: It's not that I have a lot of experience, but couldn't you easily use large leaves for that?
- Pencil: I first thought burning them could lead to some kind of toxic residue but as pencils don't actually contain lead, it seems like that is wrong.
