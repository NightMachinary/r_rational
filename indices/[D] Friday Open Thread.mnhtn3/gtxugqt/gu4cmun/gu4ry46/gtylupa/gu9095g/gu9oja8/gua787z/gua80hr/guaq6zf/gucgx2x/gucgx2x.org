nails vs screws:

This depends if you want to build a boat. Nails are easier to hammer in when you are making a shelter etc. But screws let you put together amuch sturdier structure, like a raft.

Personally, I would pick nails, because I would not dare to brave the ocean, not further than about 30m off the shore at furthest, and only in perfectly calm weather.
