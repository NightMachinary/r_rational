1. It is literally not being fixed, and the capability of the people working on it is irrelevant. The "fixes" proposed are far too little and decades too late to prevent the transformation of multiple nations into oceans and deserts. Nothing short of an economic system aligned with human values, rather than shareholder value, can fix this.

2. "Haha iPhone" is not a good argument for capitalism. None of the technology to make them was produced through capitalism. Computing, transistors, microchips, LCDs, and battery technology all came out of government grants, rather than competitive research. GPS was and still is a military (and therefore collectively funded) project. Large sections of the internet, like everything which runs on Linux, are maintained entirely by groups of volunteers doing it for the common good, rather than for profit. If you privatised it, the whole thing would immediately disintegrate. The only thing capitalists did was take all these things produced through your tax dollars, or provided for free by literal volunteers, put them in a box made by people on slave wages, and charge you $1,000 for it. Furthermore, just having phones does not mean people aren't poor and struggling. Tanzania has cellphone coverage over nearly the entire country, and most of their citizens including some of the nomadic tribal groups have phones. They are still incredibly poor and lack access to basic necessities. When I say people are worse off, I mean a greater proportion are living below the poverty line. If you remove China from the picture that's just true, and if you put it back you aren't talking about the kind of capitalism you think is good anymore.
