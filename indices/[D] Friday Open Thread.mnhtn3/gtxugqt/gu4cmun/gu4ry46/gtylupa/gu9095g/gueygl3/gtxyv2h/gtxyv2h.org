Spiders warning. This is just the only place I can get this musing out.

If you're ever trying to explain to someone who isn't a fan of capitalism why AI alignment is important, or why capitalism is bad to someone who understands why AI alignment is important, you can tell them they are the same problem.

We can be absolutely certain that an AI which valued something other than what humans value would cause massive devastation, because that's basically the description of modern capitalism. Capitalism, as a system, seeks to maximize next-quarter shareholder value. Even though it is composed entirely of humans who have terminal goals other than shareholder value, it makes maximizing next-quarter shareholder value an instrumental goal for most human terminal goals, causing humans who participate in capitalism to maximize capitalism's terminal goal in the process of seeking theirs. The result of this is enormous wealth inequality, economic instability, imminent climate collapse, hideous imperialist oppression by those powers capable of imposing their will on others, and serious questions as to whether humanity will even survive the next century. The line keeps going up because capitalism's terminal goal is being met, but that terminal goal does not align with human values, and that fact is destroying us.

An artificial superintelligence would be better at getting what it wants than any human. Under current economics, it's a good bet that the first superintelligence is likely to have some variant of maximizing shareholder value as its terminal goal. Anyone who understands AI alignment knows this would likely spell lights out for humanity. On the flipside, it is possible to argue that capitalism /is/ an artificial superintelligence, and that this intelligence is not aligned with human values. We can tell because it has all of the characteristics of an AI: greater intelligence than a human (by virtue of being run by many humans), a specific utility function, resists being turned off or modified, exploits local resources without caring about consequences which don't impact its utility function, etc.

These are the same problem. You can't protect humanity from a misaligned superintelligence, and you can't align capitalism with humanity because it /is/ a misaligned superintelligence which just happens to be running on nontraditional hardware. You'd have to reprogram capitalism to be aligned with human values somehow, but capitalism correctly identifies that this reprogramming would fail to maximize shareholder value. And so, it funds cops and the CIA to protect itself from being modified.
