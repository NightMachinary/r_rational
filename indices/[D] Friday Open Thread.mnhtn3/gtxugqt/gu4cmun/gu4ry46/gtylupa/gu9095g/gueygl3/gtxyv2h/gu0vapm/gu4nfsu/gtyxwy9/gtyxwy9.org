The phrase "spiders warning" sounds familiar but I can't remember exactly what is implied.

Anyway, I broadly agree with the use of this analogy to explain AI alignment for laypeople. I suspect the harder points to sell are "the first superintelligence will be (much) better at getting what it wants, " and "this implies that I should take X action to support AI alignment." For the first, I think a lot of people have a hard time envisioning how a large impact could be achieved. Again, the capitalism analogy works here, since it is an engine for coordinating disparate resources towards its goal. For the second, I don't know of good arguments to convince the average layperson that it's important, or that they should consider research for a career, etc.
