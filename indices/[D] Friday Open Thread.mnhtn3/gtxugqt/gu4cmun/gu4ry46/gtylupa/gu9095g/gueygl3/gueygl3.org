I'm rewatching Close Encounter of the Third Kind, and I have only one question buzzing in my head...

*...what the fuck, aliens?!?*

What the hell is your problem?! Did you ever stop and consider what an appropriate first contact protocol is if you're supposed to be /peaceful/ visitors (which we assume you are because if you were invaders your incompetence would be even more staggering)? What are the random flybys of random people supposed to accomplish? Why do you irradiate them with your freaking lamps causing them sunburns? Do your engines generate such strong magnetic fields that you can't prevent them from causing power outages and random rattling of metallic objects, and if they do, /why the fuck do you keep flying around inhabited areas?/ Why are you mindblasting people with your inane musical messages and pictures of a random mountain, which by the way has to be the most inefficient way of giving people an appointment ever? On what planet of this godforsaken galaxy is /kidnapping someone's child/ a good icebreaker?

Seriously, geez. If you didn't have the good luck of finding yourself in a goodie-goodie Spielberg movie about how aliens are actually good saviors from outer space you'd actually end up having your pathetic floating carousel light shows shot down by the US Air Force and you know what? You'd have totally fucking deserved it.
