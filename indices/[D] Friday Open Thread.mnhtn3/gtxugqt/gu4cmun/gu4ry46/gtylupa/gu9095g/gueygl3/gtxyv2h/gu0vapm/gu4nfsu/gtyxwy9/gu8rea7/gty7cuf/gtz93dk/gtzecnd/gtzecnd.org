  It's simply the only system that works while giving a large percentage of people decent quality of life.

Two problems with this.

One: Capitalism does not work. We know this because it is currently destroying biosphere of the planet you live on, and actively resisting all attempts to prevent that. The only difference between capitalism and the systems you might describe as nonworking is that its failure mode is outside the time range within which humans are generally capable of making reasonable decisions. And also that none of those other systems have ever succeeded in destroying Earth's capacity to sustain human civilization as we know it.

Two: Capitalism does not increase the overall wellbeing of humanity. It just concentrates it, and moves the disutility to places where you personally don't see it. It's true that overall wellbeing has increased over the last few decades, but most of that increase happened in China. Their authoritarian state capitalism, for all that it is horrifying and exploitative in its own right, is responsible for lifting more people out of poverty than any other system in history. If you ignore them, the rest of the world /including/ all the traditionally capitalist nations have collectively gotten worse off in the past few decades.
