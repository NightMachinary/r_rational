  you'd have to reprogram capitalism to be aligned with human values somehow,
#+end_quote

Capitalism IS aligned with human values, it is just human values are not very nice, or aligned with the best interests of society as a whole.

Capitalism, at the core, is about selling people things they want, it does not control what people want. Capitalism always follows what makes the customer happy (and for it be possible: alive, numerous and prosperous), but the side effect is that combined irrational selfishness will destroy the environment sooner or later.

It does not matter if we exchange capitalism for socialism, or techno-collectivism, or whatever. As long as people will want scarce things, one of the outcomes must happen:

1. People do not get the things they want ( result: unhappiness, poverty etc)
2. People get the things they want out of the environment (environment goes kaput).

Its not capitalism's fault, its an inherent function of scarcity.
