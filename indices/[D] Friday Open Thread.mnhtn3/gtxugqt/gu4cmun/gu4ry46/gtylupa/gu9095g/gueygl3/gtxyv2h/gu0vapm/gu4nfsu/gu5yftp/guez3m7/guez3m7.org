  The problem is not that AGIs will do what their owners want and their owners will want money.

That's not the argument. The argument is that corporations in a capitalist systems are effectively their own entity. They do not do what their owners want. They are designed to make money, but they can as easily turn on their owners as soon as these don't have a 50% share of the company and a takeover is possible. Most people in them are just serving someone else's interest, doing some duty to someone else. In practice, a corporation can be an entirely autonomous entity in which every single human cog is just acting "in the best interests of the shareholders" by following principles that they do /not/ personally share in principle just because of distorted systems of incentives. Corporations aren't pure AIs nor are they completely misaligned to the interests of humans (there are cases of companies that definitely do follow strongly the interests and desires of a specific owner: Elon Musk's are an obvious example), but they sort of approximate that kind of thing.
