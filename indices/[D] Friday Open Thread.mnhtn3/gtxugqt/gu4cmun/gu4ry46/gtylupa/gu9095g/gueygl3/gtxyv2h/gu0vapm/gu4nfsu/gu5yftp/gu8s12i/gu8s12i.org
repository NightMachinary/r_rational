the problem with that line of thinking is that its not just capitalist share-holders that have this flawed relationship with values, it is that every human alive, past and present, is equally as bad.

Humans, as species, tend to be irrationally selfish and their actual wants do not match with the ethical values they preach.

You could have the most pacifist, vegan, kind hearted socialist hippie design an AI to do their bidding, and it will turn the world into a hellhole in a year. As long as people will want things that are not 100% perfectly rational, ethical and harmless, an AI godling WILL turn it into a paperclip nightmare.

The only way out of this problem is to design an AI that will decide optimal moral values for us, and then act without further consulting us on anything major. Not a slave to our wishes, but a babysitter.
