I've got two separate comments, actually.

This week I came across two articles written by Stephen Wolfram (the guy who made WolframAlpha).

[[https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/what-is-spacetime-really/]]

[[https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/]]

I didn't read the entirety of the second article, it's 20,000 words long. First one's only 6,000 words.

What I understood of what I read seemed interesting... but I haven't taken a math class in like 10 years and I never took a physics class. I know some facts about some of the findings of physics, but all the math and technical stuff might as well be written in Greek, I don't actually understand physics, so I'm posting this based on trusting Wolfram's name to not be associated with some sort of crackpot Theory of Everything like Time Cube.
