There are very few people that are 'fans' of capitalism, it's not about that though. It's simply the only system that works while giving a large percentage of people decent quality of life.

​

Sure many people suffer, but it's better than feudalism, communism, imperialism. It's also the only one that can sustain us and keep sustaining us while the number of humans is still growing.

​

We can't just go, 'oh fuck capitalism, lets stop optimized farming, industry and logistics systems', and not expect famine, disease, and an incredible loss in the general quality of life for most humans.

​

What can be done is simply regulate it, force company splits after a certain size and influence, forbid them from creating interest groups so they can poll resources enough to influence government and regulations.

​

At this point it isn't as simple as, 'just spread wealth', we're past that. That was viable in the 19th century, now it just isn't.
