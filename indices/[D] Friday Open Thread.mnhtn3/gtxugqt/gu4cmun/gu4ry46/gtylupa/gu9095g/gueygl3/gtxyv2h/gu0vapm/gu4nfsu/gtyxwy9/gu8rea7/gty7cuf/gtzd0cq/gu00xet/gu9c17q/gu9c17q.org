Thanks.

I think I have at least a decent handle on what I think it takes to make my own life fulfilled in the short term (like on a timescale of 100 years). That's not to say that I'll accomplish that...

I was more asking a rhetorical question about the overall ethical / moral framework for the entirety of existence. I realize that is a big issue. :-)
