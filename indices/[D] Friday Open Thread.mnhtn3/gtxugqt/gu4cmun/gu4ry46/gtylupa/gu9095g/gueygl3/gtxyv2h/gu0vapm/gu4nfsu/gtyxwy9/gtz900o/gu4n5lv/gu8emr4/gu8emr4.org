The LessWrong website isn't just your own writings, somebody else wrote an article on LessWrong that used the phrase "politics is spiders" and I guess maybe that became a meme that spread and I guess maybe since "LessWrong" is associated with you people associated "politics is spiders" with you. Scott Alexander had a relatively lengthyish conversation about the article in its comment section, that may have helped it spread. Regardless, some non-insignificant number of people now associate "politics is spiders" with "Eliezer Yudkowsky." I personally did up until like just now. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
