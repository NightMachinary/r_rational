Does everyone here likes Eliezer Yudkowsky and his works? He's a large part of rational writing but I don't if he was the first to make one or something.

What about SlateStarCodex and LessWrong?

I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to these three but I like the stories that are recommended on this subreddit, which doesn't feature them much (recently?).
