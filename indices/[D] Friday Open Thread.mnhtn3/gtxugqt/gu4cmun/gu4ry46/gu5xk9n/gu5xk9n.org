This subreddit was spawned because of people liking Eliezer's /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ and wanting more like it. While that was over a decade ago, that story of his in particular is still highly regarded (though the flaws have been debated to death, as this community is wont to do). Whenever he releases something new it's typically well received, but he doesn't write any serials, so you won't see his stories posted here very often.

SSC is a different part of the rationalsphere, not focused on stories. Scott does write fiction occasionally, so those posts of his get good traction here, but it's not consistent or frequent.

LessWrong isn't for fiction, just rationality AFAIK. While you may see people reference LW articles here, this sub is explicitly for fiction, so the overlap is small.
