Lmao when it looks like he (or at least someone with his sn) is downstream of this very comment!

Regardless, I think they're a pretty fun (and funny) fanfiction writer! Has some neat ideas, though occasionally feels a bit too edgy for me. Rather wordy, perhaps -- some good beta readers unyielding with their scalpels could help cut down on that long-windedness.

SlateStarCodex and LessWrong (and I guess Overcoming Bias before them) provide pretty fun communities to shitpost about nerdy stuff in, though there's generally a dearth of expertise & competence outside fairly narrow domains (e.g. psychopharmacology in the former case). Lotsa square wheels being reinvented on the reg, not that there's anything wrong with that in a blogging context. Some uncomfortable political views in the broader community, too (e.g. alt-right-y race realism bolstered by high-school-level understanding of intro pop gen and stats). I do broadly like the sentiment behind [[/r/EffectiveAltruism]] that emerged from those fora (and others, like felicifia) a little over a decade ago. Have also provided fun fiction, as well, like [[/r/unsong]]!
