For my thinking, I've never spent more than $200 on a phone. My wife has an iPhone 11 pro max which cost a ton, and it does nothing that my Xiaomi can't do. Even if I had way more money I still don't think I'd ever stop being frugal on phones.

That being said, photography might be one of the only factors that could justify the much higher expense, so I don't know.
