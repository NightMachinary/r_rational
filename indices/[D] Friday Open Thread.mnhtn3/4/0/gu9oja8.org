Nominating the following items:

*A multivitamin pill*-- I don't think there's any way to fit a human's full daily caloric needs into an envelope, but this should at least protect against scurvy and major deficiencies from a diet presumably consisting almost solely of coconuts, presumably with some occasional fish or crab.

*A matchbook* -- I thought about maybe just a few matches per day to save space, but when you need matches you really need them, and it's not inconceivable that some of your matches could get wet or lost. The smallest matchbook one could find, probably. It'd still stack up after a while, but maybe you could find alternate uses for the matchbooks once you stockpiled more than enough.

*A strip of jerky* -- on days when you can't catch any fish, the protein will be a godsend.

*Salt packets* -- improves flavor. Save it up to preserve other foods. Include other spices if desired (you probably will.)

*A squirt of antibiotic ointment in a folded notecard*-- You're likely to get a bunch of cuts, scrapes, and so on. There's no emergency room on the island, so you need to safeguard against potentially deadly infections.

*Five squirts of SPF100 sunscreen in a folded notecard*-- Skin cancer, yo.

*Three squirts of toothpaste in a folded notecard* -- Dental hygiene is important especially when you can't see a dentist for ten years. If you can get a disposable toothbrush in there, cool, but a toothbrush can be improvised with a finger in the worst case.

*A few inches of floss* -- Useful hygienically and can also be used as fishing line and for various other things.

*Strip of chewing gum* -- It's dessert, it's adhesive, it keeps your mouth from going dry and helps prevent cavities. Foil wrappers can be saved for other uses.

*Sturdy handkerchief* -- Now you have a stockpile of cloth.

*Needle and thread* -- Now you have a way to stitch together your cloth stockpile. Clothes, blankets, curtains, tents now unlockable. Needles can probably be repurposed as makeshift fishhooks.

*Wax paper* -- useful for a lot of things, primarily collecting drinking water (rain or condensation.)

*Writing paper* -- Now you can journal your experience, express yourself artistically, map the island, etc. Can be repurposed in lots of ways (tinder, papier-mâché, insulation, etc.)

*Toilet paper* -- You can fit a few squares in there and why the heck wouldn't you. (Other things here could be repurposed as this if necessary, but it's such a QOL boost I'd only skip this if you really had to.)

*Pencil* -- without a sharpener this would be useless if you didn't get a new one every day. Can be burned or used for crafting so it's not too bad if they stack up.

*Razor blade* -- Not the most useful possible blade, but they're super sharp and you'll get a fresh one every day. Can be used to shave (carefully) but more importantly, it can be used to cut the cloth, the thread, can be used to gut fish, etc. Building out handles for them won't be super easy, but it'll be doable, and you'll have time to figure something out.

*One tampon* -- If you are a person who menstruates, this is vital. Can also be repurposed once a stockpile has been built up.

Honorable mentions:

*Anything with a screen*-- it'd be tough to find something matching this description that would fit in an envelope, but if "a fully charged, jailbroken, 128gb iphone loaded with all my favorite media, a library's worth of books, and my selection of apps" could somehow fly, that'd obviously soar up the list. At that point, it just becomes a question of how well you can architect your iphone mesh network ahead of time so they automatically sync your files and register themselves under your control mechanism. You could set up video surveillance and stuff (although battery life would mean replacing these regularly.) GPS and internet functions would be out of the question, but you could do a lot, up to and including building out your own development environment so you could code to your heart's content.

*A dose or two of your drug of choice*-- lots of drugs would fit in that envelope pretty easily. Sorry, alcoholics. You could fit a few cigarettes in there, or a joint, or some tabs of LSD, or a few pills of your choosing. (You're out here alone, you need all the entertainment you can get.)
