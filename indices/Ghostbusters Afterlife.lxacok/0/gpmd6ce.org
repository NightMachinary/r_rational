First off, Ghostbusters is a comedy about a group of exterminators whose 'pests' just happen to be ghosts. Funny it is, rational, it isn't.

Second off, they actually kind of do mention that in the movies, as there is at least one scene where they are listening to the radio or TV commentary about how some religious people are questioning whether it is the "End Times" or not.

Thirdly, assuming they put Slimer's ugly green mug on exhibit, it wouldn't contradict or 'prove wrong' any of the religious institutions. It doesn't prove or disprove anything, it just shows there's a green ghost-like creature that likes to eat everything in sight and leave slime all over the place. Nobody is really proven wrong.

If anything, the courtroom scene from Ghostbusters II would be much more alarming, as the ghosts that erupted (the 'Scoleri Brothers') were recognizable as individual people that had been convicted in that courtroom and later executed. Even then, they could simply use the "Hell is full" or "The End Times are nigh!" approach to explain it.
