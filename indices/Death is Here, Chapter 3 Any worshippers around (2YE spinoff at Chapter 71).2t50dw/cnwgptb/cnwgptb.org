1. I really liked how you handled the bit with Herr√∫n; glad to see she's going to be more than a sex toy.\\
2. The phrase "[she left and] I followed in her wake" worked well for me; for whatever reason it was very evocative of the divine transit experience.
3. Maht's temple in Capital City would have been one of his major places of worship in Arannias. Having Cairn trash it is very definitely going to draw his attention, and I don't see why he wouldn't show up and apply the beatdown stick. Hopefully that gets addressed next chapter.
4. I'll second [[/u/JackStargazer]]: for me at least, Cairn feels dumb, drunk with power, and is not a character I can identify with or like. I'm not sure if you're intending for that to change, if this is going to be a bashing fic where the point is to enjoy watching him get beat on, or something else. No matter what option you choose, I hope it starts soon.

A couple of links that might be useful to you:

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm][Divine Rank]] lists what gods in general can do. Death started off as a Rank 20 god but will be losing power quickly unless he can find some worshippers. (This is happening to Suze in 2YE.)

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineAbilitiesFeats.htm][Divine Salient Abilities]] lists the different powers that a god can have. In 2YE Suze definitely has the Alter Reality and Alter Size powers, although beyond that nothing has been definitively shown. Cairn, of course, can have entirely different abilities if you so desire.

EDIT: I would suggest avoiding putting key information in your author's notes. (e.g. "Cairn is an unreliable narrator and that skews his (and our) perception of the story.") Give the audience and your own writing credit -- the story can stand on its own.
