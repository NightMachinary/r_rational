Up to you. Personally, I took the "Suggested portfolio: Knowledge, secrets" part to be proscriptive instead of suggestive in this case -- when I created Herrún I decided that "knowledge and secrets" was a portfolio, so only she got to take that ability.

(Interestingly, I created Herrún and her portfolio long before I ever read that list of abilities, so there was a certain synchronicity there.)
