I'm so glad Kat turned out to be the monster. She was the only candidate I could think of for the monster, and as per usual, the monster unleashed turns on its master. I hope Kat's name doesn't limit her too much, though. If it's heavily based in Fae power, she might be extra susceptible to narrative twists, which would suck since she would have a much harder time messing with other people's narratives. Great chapter tho, the Assassin move was brilliant
