  Why did Cat's limp come back? Or more accurately, what made it disappear before? It seems weird that a soul binding physically cured her limp in the first place...?
#+end_quote

When the King of Winter made her a Duchess, she mentioned how a side of her face that shouldn't have been feeling anything at all now felt cold. I think that whatever safeguards he (and later, Masego) installed also added to her soul.

  Which Aspect did Cat keep? She mentions that two were now gone and one become overpowered. I'd assume that Take was what she kept considering what happened with Ubua's Call, but Fall seemed to be her Winter Aspect previously. How did Winter decide which to keep?
#+end_quote

She had one Aspect remaining in the sense that the other two were used for the day. Take was previously used to force a resurrection from an angel, so maybe the remark about it being overpowered refers to that?

  Do we think that Ubua's soul vessel/child is going to be related to a main character? Would provide more of a punch than just making it some random kid, no? Watch it be one of Sabah's children...
#+end_quote

It's a newborn, and both times Sabah gave birth to a child she stayed with her husband to raise them, so that's not in the cards. Still, I expect a grim scene of the Woe deciding who has to do the grisly deed before the epilogue of this book.

  Why did Black seem "warier" after Ubua confirmed she had a single conversation with the Wandering Bard? My guess is that he's worrying that she set up things to turn out this way, so he's still playing into her plot... could it be something else?
#+end_quote

Maybe he suspects something along the lines of what happened in the end of the last book (Bard leading away a party of heroes going for Liesse or something).

  It seems a little odd that Vivienne's true name is, well, Vivienne. I'd have expected something a bit... more? Like her last name too, at least? Maybe I'm just used to Dresden Files' take on true names.
#+end_quote

'Given willingly' is the important part here. Now she has some kind of authority over her, maybe like with the Adjutant and soldiers.
