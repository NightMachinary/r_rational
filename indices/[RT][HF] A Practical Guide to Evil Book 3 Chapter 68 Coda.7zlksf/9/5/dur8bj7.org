  Which Aspect did Cat keep? She mentions that two were now gone and one become overpowered. I'd assume that Take was what she kept considering what happened with Ubua's Call, but Fall seemed to be her Winter Aspect previously. How did Winter decide which to keep?

  Even my Name was stripped bare, its power dimmed and dull. I had no aspect left but one, and that one was gone far beyond what an aspect should be. Squire, I thought, but the name rang hollow. Tied to me only by the barest thread.

The aspects of Take and Break were Squire's, but Fall never fit - it was purely Winter's, and it definitely goes beyond a mere aspect now. And her connection to the name of Squire is nearly severed. Fall is definitely the aspect left, such as it is.

You'll note she didn't *Take* Akua's *Call*, she used winter's power to assimilate it, and then kept the corpse.
