Well well well... looks like it's the ol' Assassin switcheroo! I'm getting major FATE vibes from Assassin, although its aspect seems to manifest differently than Hassan-i-Sabbah (one person who can take many forms rather than many people using the same name/role).

I'm not sure what this means for Cat, or what's going to happen when she transitions. I don't like Fae-Cat much so far, although her casually killing Ubua was quite satisfying. Random thoughts/questions:

- Why did Cat's limp come back? Or more accurately, what made it disappear before? It seems weird that a soul binding physically cured her limp in the first place...?

- Which Aspect did Cat keep? She mentions that two were now gone and one become overpowered. I'd assume that Take was what she kept considering what happened with Ubua's *Call*, but Fall seemed to be her Winter Aspect previously. How did Winter decide which to keep?

- I recall a post or comment from long ago that erraticerrata mentioned that Assassin had been in the story already, and I always assumed it was as a hardly mentioned background character like a lieutenant or server or something. Now I'm thinking he actually meant that some of the main characters have been Assassin in disguise. Any ideas of who? Besides Scribe, who seems the most likely contender?

- Do we think that Ubua's soul vessel/child is going to be related to a main character? Would provide more of a punch than just making it some random kid, no? Watch it be one of Sabah's children...

- I actually felt bad for Dumisai. I knew he would die, but he just seemed so likable. I mean, besides his support of his genocidally-minded daughter.

- Why did Black seem "warier" after Ubua confirmed she had a single conversation with the Wandering Bard? My guess is that he's worrying that she set up things to turn out this way, so he's still playing into her plot... could it be something else?

- It seems a little odd that Vivienne's true name is, well, Vivienne. I'd have expected something a bit... more? Like her last name too, at least? Maybe I'm just used to Dresden Files' take on true names.

- "Diabolist backed a way but /I touched her chest over her head,/ ever so slightly, and there was a quiet snap." I'm not really understanding what this means or what it pictured here. Ubua was backing away; did Cat suddenly teleport behind/above her? Did she fall down and Cat was standing over her? Did she trip ass-over-teakettle as Cat reached out?
