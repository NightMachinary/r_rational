The end reminded me of the ending of [[#s%20Cat%20as%20Tailor%20did%20became%20a%20monster%20beyond%20human%20understanding][Worm. (Worm spoilers)]]

Cat is about to transition into another name, I dont think Black Queen nor Black Knight fits. She is a Queen, a General and of Winter. I cant imagine what will be her new name.

edit. I just realized, akua got the classic ending of the evil mage that binds demons. The demon/monster/Cat escapes and the mage is crushed effortlesly. Wow, congrats erraticerrata, the end of the fight was both unexpected and obvious in hindsight. What an ending should be.
