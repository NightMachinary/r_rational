It's definitely not Duchess.

Thief is an old Callowan name, but Adjutant, Archer and Heirophant are all new names. Hers will be new.

Also she's already more than a Duchess, she's a Vice-Queen by mundane title, there's no situation where her name is less powerful than her rank. Ice Queen. Fae Knight. Lady of War.
