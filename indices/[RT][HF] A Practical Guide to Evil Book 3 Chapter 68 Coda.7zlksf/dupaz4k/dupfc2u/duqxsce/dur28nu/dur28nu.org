I think its less of an issue that past conversations could have been with Assassin then that Black was treating her as a pawn by not telling her his plan to swap with Assassin, or that it was even possible, and giving Assassin their code phrases. She was building up a level of trust with him an the belief that he treats her as an equal. This knocks her back down to how she was in the first arc where he ordered her around.
