  On the other hand it felt thoroughly unsatisfying. Too much of what happened felt like Black's plan flawlessly coming to fruition.

In terms of creation's narrative Cat was the one directly engaging Akua and winning, Black was more like having a reinforcement help at the last minute. That said I agree things went too well for him, I expect there will be some sort of cost. Maybe the swap with assassin was more costly than it seemed.

  What more do you need to do to earn that power? At what point did others bleed for it instead of Cat?

I think its more about the outcome than the power? Like when she was talking with Akua it wasn't about what she had t sacrifice to gain her name or title but about what she was willing to do to help Callow. So far she's been able to have it both ways with getting all the benefits of villainy without losing the moral high ground in her own head at least. I think becoming the dark inhuman fae version of herself means acknowledging she can't do that.
