I've got mixed feelings about this chapter.

On one hand it makes a lot of sense if you consider the scale of the opposition Akua has been tangling with. Capturing Black who has been killing Heroes for the past four decades is a tall order. Moreover, Black is a renowned strategist so him having a plan to eliminate Diabolist (or take advantage of her weakness) makes sense. In fact, many people predicted that Black let himself get captured or was a decoy somehow. So inside the universe this all adds up.

On the other hand it felt thoroughly unsatisfying. Too much of what happened felt like Black's plan flawlessly coming to fruition. A couple of chapters back we had Cat musing about how defeating a villain is a trial - a crucible that reforges a person anew - and this all felt too easy.

Even sacrificing her humanity felt a bit like pushing a button and there- you're now a demi-god. A couple of paragraphs of how she's been sacrificing her people instead of herself... which isn't really true? I mean, in Book 2 she turned herself into an undead abomination and withstood the judgment of an angel. I don't understand how she thinks she hasn't earned or hasn't paid for her power. She's been at the front lines of virtually every battle and she became the Duchess of Moonless Nights by defeating the Duke through cleverness and strength. What more do you need to do to earn that power? At what point did others bleed for it instead of Cat?

Maybe I'm forgetting something but this dilemma comes out of nowhere. It feels like a tacked on reason to sacrifice her humanity rather than something she actually struggled with in the past.
