  Why did Black seem "warier" after Ubua confirmed she had a single conversation with the Wandering Bard? My guess is that he's worrying that she set up things to turn out this way, so he's still playing into her plot... could it be something else? Ubua's role is to cause a great deal of noise but ultimately fail and die. She isn't a player, just a piece on the board.

He knows she has been getting support from someone and is ultimately being used as a tool to advance their agenda, knowingly or not.

Eliminating Bard as the suspect for who is using Diabolist means there are only two hands that could be moving this particular piece.

If it's not one side, the natural suspect is the other......

Malicia.
