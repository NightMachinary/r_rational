Something I noticed in the very first chapter: When Black and company meet up after the last battle of the civil war, he looks around for the 'fifth of their band', Ranger, with Scribe, Captain, and Warlock all present. Since Scribe is mentioned as not being an 'official' Calamity only a few chapters later, I think there's merit to the Scribe = Assassin theory.
