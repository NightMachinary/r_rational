Branching off of dinoseen's answer even further. I like the idea of the limit being on how many powers can be used at once. Basically no limit on which powers can be acquired, or how many can be in his "library", but limited in what he can use at any one time.

Sort of D&D wizard style. Downtime between swapping active powers, preventing changes mid-battle/mid-heist/etc. Maybe a short enough downtime that there could be some risk-reward scenarios where our protagonist has to decide whether it's worth it to spend x amount of time powerless (time they would most likely have to spend hiding, running, or stalling) to fine tune his current powerset to the current opponent.

So you'd still be able to have the protagonist grow in versatility/max power (by getting really strong powers, or assembling new combos). If you need faster growth than that, maybe allow for either a) increases in their overall cap (e.g. Strength took 10% of cap, Regen took 20%, but now Strength takes 5% and Regen takes 10%), or b) increasing efficiency of individual (e.g. through training, usage, or stacking on a second Strength power, Strength's cap usage drops from 10% to 5%).

Option B may be better for a munchkin-y type story as the protagonist may want to choose sub-optimal powers for the short term in order to improve their usefulness in the long term.
