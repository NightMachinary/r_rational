The other answers are good, but how about this: he has access to the last ~10 powers he's absorbed, but they get weaker the farther back in the chain they are. So he kills a foe with power 10 after having killed foes with powers 1-9, and now he has power 10 at 100% strength, power 9 at 90%, power 8 at 80%, etc. etc.

This means that if he defeats a foe with a really good ability, he'll have to be real careful about who he absorbs next.
