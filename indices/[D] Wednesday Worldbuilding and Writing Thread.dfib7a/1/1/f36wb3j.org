In addition to [[/u/TheJungleDragon]] 's suggestion which I like, there's the obvious idea of diminishing returns. Even if he keeps stacking up similar powers for greater potency it'll only get him as far as you want it to get him.

Another option is simply having all powers be accessible, but only a certain number of them at a time. Maybe Strength takes up 10% and Regeneration takes up 25% etc so there's like a balance going on and he can swap freely. This keeps things flexible both in the sense of access to interesting powers and ability for you to limit how OP things are.

You could also just combine a whole load of these all together, because unless there's a rather low power ceiling, than power stealing is OP.
