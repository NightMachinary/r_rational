One limit that I find very useful for things like this is just gaining a much weaker version of the power. As an example, our protagonist beats and gains the power of someone who can fly fast enough to break the sound barrier. In return, they gain the ability to hover slowly a small distance above the ground. They beat a powerful pyrokinetic, and can now snap their fingers to create a flame like that from a lighter.
