Balance question. In a world of being with complex super powers how would you balance a protagonist that could gain power from defeated foes? Options I see for limitations are:

1. only being able to get one part of a power per defeated foe (i.e. from superman you could get one of flight, toughness, speed, laser eyes, etc.),
2. Being limited to a certain number of powers
3. Not being able to have two copies of the same power (i.e. strength)
4. Must gain a power from a downed foe. If combined with 2 the protagonist could lose the oldest power at cap. If combined with 3 protagonist could gain undesirable weakness.
5. Must do something morally/physically uncomfortable to gain powers. Raw flesh really doesn't taste good. Admittedly this would mostly be a limiter earlier in a story. Killing someone to gain their powers would put a limiter on ethical powers to gain. Taking on some characteristica(personality/body) of the downed opponent would likewise limit feasible powers.
6. Only allow the protagonist to gain a certain type of power.

Other suggestions/feedback on limiters.
