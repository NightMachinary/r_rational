Mix of #1 and #3: Magic is like athletic ability. Training will help, but if you're born with weak joints and asthma you're never going to be a world-class marathon runner. And there will always be the Michael Phelpses and Williams sisters of the world who are head, shoulders and torso above anyone else in their given fields.

Added bonus, you can just say "magic is genetic" and you already have a perfectly rational heritance system as well as real-world statistical distributions to draw on.
