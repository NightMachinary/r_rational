What's your favorite distribution of magical ability in fantasy settings?

Some examples to get things going:

- Magic IS like calculus in that just about everyone can learn but some people have an aptitude for it.
- Developing your magical talent is purely limited by your continual consumption of certain materials.
- Magical aptitude is fixed and measurable with a massive difference between the top and bottom of the range.
