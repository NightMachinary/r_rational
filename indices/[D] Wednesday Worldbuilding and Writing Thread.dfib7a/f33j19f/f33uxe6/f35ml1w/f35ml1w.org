I prefer a variant on the second which approaches the first for anyone with enough power. Worth the Candle inspired me, and having many magic systems that you can snap up by fulfilling certain requirements, touching/consuming an item, or sucking up to a spirit really appeals to me. Having the eventually exploits of the magic systems baked into the story itself is something else that was novel at the time, so now anyone who does so can slurp up all the power that fuels the magic system they're exploiting, draining it dry so the same trick can't be used twice and ascending to godhood.
