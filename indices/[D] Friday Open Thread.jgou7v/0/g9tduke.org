My friends and I go to a corn maze every Halloween but can't this year for social distancing so I made a virtual one. We've done it already, so now I'm [[http://noisyowl.com/corn/][sharing it]] with everyone. Would recommend getting some friends together on some sort of voice/video chat and all trying at once.
