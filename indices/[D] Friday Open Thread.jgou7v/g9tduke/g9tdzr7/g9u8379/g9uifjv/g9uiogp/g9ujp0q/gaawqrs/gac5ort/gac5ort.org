I don't think I'd be satisfied with the level of quality on display [[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:275091/comments][here]] and [[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1962784/comments][here]]. Even the nicer looking one that's been painted still looks a bit plasticky. Also, several commenters mention some difficulties in getting their printers to actually print the pieces without breaking them.

[[https://shop.elenco.com/consumers/t-rex-skeleton.html][Something like this]] is only seventy-five bucks (sixty bucks on amazon) and it actually looks pretty good, but in a direct side-by-side comparison of [[https://dinostoreus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DS101-tyrannosaurus-skeleton.jpg][Option A]] versus [[https://shop.elenco.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/c1684f745bc47a048a41c4174101bd39/e/d/edu37329_h7fy40ylxrelroy6.jpg][Option B]] versus [[https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/c5/67/07/7e/fa/45CFD2DD-08E6-4B2A-92A6-E70843EAF785.jpeg][Option C]], you can tell that A is higher quality than B which is higher quality than C.

Now, that's certainly not saying that the other two look bad. C looks almost as good as B, and either one would absolutely be a cool A.F. thing to display in your house, but that's not what I'm looking for.

And at a quick glance, the t. rex was the only thing I saw that looked decent. And I don't want just one single t. rex. I want two t. rexes, two triceratops, one stegosaurus, one spinosaurus, two parasaurolophuses, one velociraptor, and one brachiosaurus (I don't understand why those last two have to be at a different scale than the rest of them), plus an assortment of skulls. It'll cost like thirty-five hundred bucks and it'll take like 7 years to accumulate all of them if I'm responsible and only buy one or two a year, but in the end I'll end up with a ton of pieces (most of them as big as or bigger than a cat - the spinosaurus is almost a meter long) that look classy A.F. That's my goal. I don't think 3D printing can deliver me to that goal. I don't want something plastic that looks "cool A.F.," I want something that looks /classy A.F./ Like, I want a room full of bookshelves with museum-quality dinosaur skeletons on them, that's been my aesthetic since I was like 7 years old and if I'm going to actualize it then I want to fully actualize it.
