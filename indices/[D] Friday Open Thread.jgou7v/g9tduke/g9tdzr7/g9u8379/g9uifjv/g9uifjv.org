As it should be.

I have several pages in a bookmarks folder, stuff in the two hundred to five hundred dollar range, exact replicas of the same T Rex "Stan" and "Sue" models they have in museums (the one I linked originally is a "Stan" model), along with lots of other dinosaurs, made of the same resin or whatever material they use for the replicas displayed in museums, but like 20 or 30 inches long rather than life-size. They no longer have the option to purchase them for some reason:

They still sell "resin kits" like this:

which you have to assemble yourself, so no. Also this:

[[http://stores.dansdinosaurs.com/tyrannosaurus-skeleton-miniature/]]

which is only seventy bucks but also only six inches long.

That "Dan's Dinosaurs" store is still fully operational and you can still add plenty of things to the shopping cart, but all the awesome ones like what I linked are labeled out of stock. It's been like that every time I've checked in for the last year. I don't know if it's permanent or if I'm just checking in when they happen to be out of stock.

After I made my comment, I went googling around, and I found this:

[[https://www.masterreplicasgroup.com/password]]

A placeholder "coming soon" page, but the google result said it was a page for Smithsonian fossil replicas.

And apparently that company has stuff on Amazon, like this is the same product mentioned in the description of the google search link that returned that "coming soon" page:

[[https://www.amazon.com/Nations-Statue-Smithsonian-Replica-Tyrannosaurus/dp/B07XWMM7QW/]]

So hopefully they'll have some full skeletons available as well. Because it's all well and good to fantasize about buying a life-size replica, but you can buy a scale model of the same thing that fits on your bookshelf.

Edit: I guess I could've looked more closely at the "Dan's Dinosaurs" listings to see who the maker of the skeletons actually is.

DinoStoreus's website sells all the same things directly, apparently at a very slightly higher price, but all their skeletons are listed as out of stock as well.

EDIT EDIT: "We really apologize for our unavailable products, and rest assured, we are doing everything possible to get all our out-of-stock dinosaur models back in-stock again as soon as possible."

Excellent.
