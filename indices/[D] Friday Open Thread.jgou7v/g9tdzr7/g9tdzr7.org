Are you aware that for only one hundred and twenty thousand US dollars, you can purchase [[http://www.bhigr.com/store/product.php?productid=46&cat=2&page=1][a full-size museum-quality fossil replica of a tyrannosaurus rex]]?

If your budget is a bit tighter, you can get [[http://www.bhigr.com/store/product.php?productid=48&cat=2&page=1][just the skull]] for only twelve thousand US dollars. What a bargain!
