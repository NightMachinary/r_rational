This is not the subreddit I usually post these things on, but for ideas as to what you can read now that is in some way similar to MoL, my suggestions would be, more or less sorted by how much I enjoyed them:

- [[http://www.hpmor.com][HPMOR]] by Eliezer Yudkovsky.

- [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/1-01/][Worm]] by WildBow

- The Martian by Andy Weir. If you are into audiobooks, this probably moves to the top of the list, the audiobook is bloody perfect.

- Surely You Are Joking mr Feynman by Richard P. Feynman. No link, but it is easilly searchable through google. chem.fsu.edu hosts a copy for some reason, for example.

- [[http://podiobooks.com/title/how-to-succeed-in-evil-the-novel/][How to Succeed in Evil]] by Patrick E. McLean

- Packing for Mars by Mary Roach.
