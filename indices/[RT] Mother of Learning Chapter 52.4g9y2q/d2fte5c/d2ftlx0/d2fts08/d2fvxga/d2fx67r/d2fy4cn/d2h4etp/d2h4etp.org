Zorian is really trying to hold onto his moral system, but I think it is clearly becoming more and more untenable. Just look at how arbitrary his "sparing" of non-aggro aranea is. He just chooses a random justification on who he can attack (fighting back) because he needs to impose some kind of morality to the need of learning mind magic skills.
