English comma rules are an arcane labyrinth, it's best not to look too closely.

You're thinking of lists which do make use of commas with three or more items. Coordinating adjectives, however, are separated by commas. In this case, the lack of comma would create ambiguity since the bones could have been dead for a long time or just long in general.
