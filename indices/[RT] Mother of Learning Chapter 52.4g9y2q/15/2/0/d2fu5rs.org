I've been thinking that the loop is in fact a pocket/splinter dimension. It probably forcibly terminates if it's connected to another pocket dimension, in this case, the Primordial's prison. To me the question is if the loop alwys ends at the peak of Alignment or if the Primordial summoning is always successful.
