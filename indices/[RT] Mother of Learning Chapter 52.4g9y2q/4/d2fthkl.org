Zach is back, baby. I'm anxious to see just how much the dynamic between the two has changed now that Zorian has his own bloodline to abuse and a fair amount of loop-exploited experience too. Zorian has done a good job of bridging the gap even without humongous mana reserves.

Also, a handful of typos:

#+begin_quote
  "Fire the living *mental* rounds."
#+end_quote

metal

#+begin_quote
  *long dead* bones
#+end_quote

”long-dead” or ”long, dead”

#+begin_quote
  need *theblood* of an existing shifter
#+end_quote

the blood

#+begin_quote
  Zorian *pain* close attention
#+end_quote

paid

#+begin_quote
  even if the cultists used something fancier, the *rests* would likely be the same."
#+end_quote

results?
