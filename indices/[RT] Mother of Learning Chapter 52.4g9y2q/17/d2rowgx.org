Adding a few observations, and a bit of speculation: The ritual needs not just one, but multiple shifter children. Raynie has a baby brother. For some unspecified reason (aside from Raynie's guess), Raynie is not allowed to go home during the summer festival.

It seems rather unlikely that the shifters are involved, but from a Doylist point of view, the fact that the ritual requires multiple shifter children is probably not without reason... Random speculation: 1) The cult could be aware of Raynie's brother. There might not be too many shifter children, and they must have done some research (maybe via Sudomir?) 2) The tribe might know something is going on (shifters worship primordials maybe? They also dislike outside influence, which could be motivation to be involved with the invasion). Still seems unlikely; who would reach out to them for something like that?

If 1) and 2) are combined, the refusal to have Raynie come back could theoretically be a murder attempt by her father. If I'm negative in the other direction, Raynie's supporters might want to get rid of an 'obstacle', and deal with the cult to get rid of Raynie's brother. If it is only option 1), maybe the tribe is aware that the boy is at risk (divination?), and if they don't know about the cult, Raynie seems like the biggest danger?
