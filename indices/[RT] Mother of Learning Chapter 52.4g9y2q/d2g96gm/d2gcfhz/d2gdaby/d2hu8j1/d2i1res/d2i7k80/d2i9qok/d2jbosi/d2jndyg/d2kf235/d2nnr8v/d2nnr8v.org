  what do they do that is worse

Well, there is a whole sub where people try to guess wherever something was said by a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/StormfrontorSJW/][neonazi or a self-identified SJW]], and usually people win not by guessing "well, this is clearly not what a %group% would have said, it's not what they stand for", but by analysing wording and style of text. Add to this [[http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/05/03/dc-gamergate-meetup-disrupted-by-feminist-bomb-threat/][bomb threats to silence political opposition]] and other shenanigans that happen, and you can see why people aren't all that hot for the group.

  people fighting for more equal world (that's my definition of SJW's) are bad on default
#+end_quote

Problem is, majority of people who call themselves SJW and identify with that crowd don't fight for that, hence the name being an insult of sorts.
