Alright, whatever you two's definition of "SJW" (pretty cool example of a word that is completely useless of giving any information. From what I've discerned, it now basically means "a person that disagrees with me") is, *what do they do that is worse* than a subreddit that stickies highly upvoted post about how single mother's are the worst scum of humanity, casually considers women as almost literally children and encourages emotional torture and manipulation?

Did I end up in alternative universe where misygonists and cruel manipulators deserve "rational" and calm discussion about whether what they're doing is bad or good, while people fighting for more equal world (that's my definition of SJW's) are bad on default?
