I just remembered that I completely forgot to reply to this, my mistake.

Sorry, it's a pet peeve for this story in particular, I just notice that a lot of people say exactly the same thing without noticing that others have said the same thing before. On the other hand, these threads really get out of hand (maybe the most commented threads on [[/r/rational]]?) so I'm sure I've done the same thing.
