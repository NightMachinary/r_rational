I THINK NOT!

2+6 = 8. 8 is the chapter where Zach showed Zorian the Hole. Primordials are summoned there. What else do we need for a summoning? 5 +chri+ shifter kids! Zorian met a two shifters in chapter one. (5 + 1)*2 = 10. The story was published on Oct 17, 2011, October is 10th month of the year. 17 * number of months of the year divided by 2 equals 102 and the author is nobody*103*. But who would want to appear to be nobody? THE LIZARD PEOPLE!

WAKE UP SHEEPLE!
