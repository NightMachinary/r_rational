Nah, he knows. Check out the few lines before that.

  "Oh," Zach said. "Still, that's... I never managed to do anything even close to that. How... how is it that you knew how to do that? You... are you..."

  "I need to go," said Zorian, rising to his feet.

  "Hey, wait!" Zach said, trying to rise up before wincing in pain and giving up on that idea. "You can't just ignore me and go- Zorian! Zorian!"

And this is after he already suspected that something had changed about Zorian, and after he'd known there had to be another time traveler, since all of the events were happening differently. Of course, before that conversation, he thought that the aranea were the time travelers, but he probably changed his mind here.

Either he's correctly guessed that Zorian is the time traveler, either he still believes that it was the aranea, but that Zorian is involved with them somehow. But after all of these restarts in which he's never once been contacted by the aranea, who were the ones who initially contacted him, he has to suspect that it's probably not the second option. And he probably also spent a restart or two in Cyoria, after the aranea were soul killed. He probably saw that Zorian was not there in that restart where he was facing RR alone and blew himself up in the Hole. That was probably enough to convince him.
