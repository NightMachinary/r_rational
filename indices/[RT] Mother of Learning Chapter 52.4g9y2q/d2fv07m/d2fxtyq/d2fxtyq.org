This theory has a certain flaw, however.

The time loop rewinds time at a precise time: 2 hours and 40 minutes after midnight (reference: [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/40/Mother-of-Learning][end of chapter 40]]). It is fairly improbable that invaders just happen to always summon He Of The Flowing Flesh 9600 seconds after midnight, so at the end of the month the time rewinds independently of the primordial's summoning. Which isn't terribly meaningful mechanic, if you are correct.

Albeit... It is possible the Noveda heir was supposed to terminate the loop manually, once he/she had made sure the primordial issue was dealt with permanently, without the danger of repeated summon a day later.

Yes, this theory looks solid.

Hm, I have a feeling the Weeping was not just your ordinary epidemic, though. Doesn't seem fitting. But I have nothing conclusive.
