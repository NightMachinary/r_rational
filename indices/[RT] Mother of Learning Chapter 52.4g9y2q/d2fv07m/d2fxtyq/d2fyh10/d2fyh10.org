I don't think the source can be interpreted to mean that reset happens /precisely/ at 02:40:00. If we interpret "a few seconds" as 5, it gives us 02:39:06 - 02:40:05 window for the exact moment of reset.

And yes, Novedas could have had some knowledge about their bloodline, but since everyone died before they could pass that knowledge to Zach, that meant he was thrown in the loop completely clueless.

As for the Weeping, it was said to kill off somewhat around 10% of the population I believe? If so, this isn't even close to real world epidemics, like Black Death, that is estimated to have killed 1 in 3 /at least/. It may, of course, be unnatural, i.e. biological warfare designed by someone (maybe even Ibasans?) but I think it's irrelevant for the time loop. The only thing that mattered is that a confluence of circumstances reduced Novedas to Zach. I mean the other factor is proliferation of firearms and that is entirely rational idea.

The biggest flaw in this theory is that it does not explain Red Robe. But then the only reasonable RR theory I saw (Daimen discovering ancient magic in ancient magical ruins) conversely does not explain Zach.
