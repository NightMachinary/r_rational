Betting on Quatach-ichl doing the /right/ thing? Uh... I'd take my chances with some random kid, honestly. And if we are talking about direct causation, that would be cultists. Problem is they are instagibbed by the primordial they have freed and don't see the actual consequences of their actions, and what's worse /they want the world end/. They worship the primordial evil aka The Dragon Below. They won't back off. Hell, they would double their zeal.

I agree, Zach is a weird choice. If I could pick a character from this story to loop, that would be Haslush. Maybe Alanic. But that's why this theory works: it picks a suboptimal person, Zach.
