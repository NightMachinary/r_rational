If that's the case about the loopers being all from Noveda blood, then would that not mean that Zach and Red Robe are related?

I can see how they wouldn't be, but if Zach is the initial key to the party, then how Red Robe got into the loop would be a major question. Perhaps Red Robe is, in fact, working against the Ibasans, but also for his own reasons/goals. What if Red Robe realized that Quatl-Ichl was always going to be the major threat, and was learning how he could fight the Lich, since damaging a soul is the only real way to permanently deal with a Lich?
