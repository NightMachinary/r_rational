Well, the prison design is clearly not perfect. But then, this particular primordial specialized in shifting, which lead to using his essence in shifters (not a very wise move, humans) which granted cultist a way to break the prison. Maybe other primordial essences are not useful, and were not recklessly used by humans for selfish purposes. That would mean that this primordial is the only one that can be actually set free, and it wasn't directly gods' fault. So... some redemption for their plan, I guess.
