It could also be something like Bravely Default, where a nigh infinity or parallel worlds are vaguely connected to each other but ultimately unreachable, unless specific conditions are met. This could also imply that what happens is not that everything rolls back, but simply that Zorian's soul, and that of the other time travelers, are transferred to the next parallel world, while the one they just left crashes and burns. It would also mean that once there are no more parallel worlds but the last one, they will be back in the normal flow of time, and the time loop will be over.
