I'm not so sure it was actually activated prematurely. Maybe primordial (or however it's spelled) is actually a giant black hole and it destroyed Cyoria, therefore Zorian and Zach both died and loop reset. On a more serious nore it should be noted that the invasion started early, and if left to play out the loop always ended during invasion. It's perfectly within the working parameters.
