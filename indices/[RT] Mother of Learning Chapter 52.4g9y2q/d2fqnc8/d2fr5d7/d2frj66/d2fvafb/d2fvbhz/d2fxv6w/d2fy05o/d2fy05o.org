No pls, I must keep my monopoly.

But actually though, don't ddos fictionpress. I only ping every 5 seconds, so you could theoretically beat me. If we changed it to have no delay, then that'd be nuts. Even worse would be optimizing libraries to make it faster, or even putting it on a server near both Reddit and Fictionpress. I wonder how well Reddit handles race conditions.
