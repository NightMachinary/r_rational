There is one big problem to your theory. Bloodlines tend to spread far and wide. For example, I personally have the blood of Charlemagne, but that doesn't make me part of any aristocratic family.

There would be branch families to the Noveda. I'd find it hard to believe that everyone would have stayed related to the family, and never ventured off. Never had illegitimate children, never married to a male member of another one of the great houses and thus taking their name, etc.

If it was so easy as having Noveda blood, then there should be a lot more time travelers around.

Edit: Unless, of course, the Weeping was truly a very focused disease made specifically to target the Noveda bloodline, and that that 10% of the population who died represented all of these branch families.
