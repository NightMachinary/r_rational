So it was, in fact, a work of love. Foreshadowing successfully spotted.

So, about the time loop. One of the running theories is that time loop has divine origins. This makes sense, since it is clearly stated that time loop is impossible via magic, but gods are, well, gods.

What did not make sense to me was that for a divine intervention some aspects of the time loop made perfect sense but some parts seemed poorly executed.

Namely Zach as the starting point of the time loop seems... stupid? He is not the right person to be handled this power. He is not the right person to avert primordial summoning, not because he is a bad person, but because he is woefully under-qualified.

But then the gods have been silent for some time and they are clearly not omnipotent.

Suppose gods had foreseen their exile from the world and therefore had created some contingency measure for primordial prisons, in case someone breaks them. It is now clear that invaders had succeeded in the restart Zero. They had summoned the beast even with premature invasion, with Eldemar forces on alert. No matter how 'uninspired' (Zorian's words) their assault was in the initial timeline, it was still bound to succeed. Hence the divine contingency measure was set off.

So the gods had to create a mechanism that would save the day, in advance. Like centuries at least. Suppose they decide to appoint a Champion and loop him. If the gods were exiled for some reason and had no way to directly appoint a Champion, they had to write a spell that would do that for them. So they create a bloodline that is destined for this task. The Noveda bloodline. Now, suppose the Weeping was not part of the plan. As far as we can tell a magical plague is not something extraordinary, for all we know the Weeping could be naturally mutated troll flu. Irritating for trolls, deadly for weaker bipedal apes. In the end, Zach was picked by the loop simply because there was no choice, he was the only one candidate alive. The Noveda bloodline also boosted his mana reserves because he became a focal point; normally it could be distributed evenly between all living Novedas. With, say, 5 people alive they get +10 starting mana, advantageous but not revolutionary. Extended mana supplies naturally leads to their specialization in combat magic. But with Zach being the only one alive he gets +50, which is inhuman.

How does RR fall into this? I have no idea. RR is the product of counter-contingency plan made by Dragon herself! Yep, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
