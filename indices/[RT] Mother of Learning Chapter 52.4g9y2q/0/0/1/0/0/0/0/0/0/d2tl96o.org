Eh, I think you're over complicating matters. I'm going with Occam in this one: the time loop resets when the primordial is summoned. The end.

Every other time that has happened, they carry out the ritual at the moment of alignment, and the reset occurs. He hasn't been able to see the ritual up until now because it happened in the Hole and he didn't have a direct LoS without a concerted military strike on their center.

The critical new information is:

A) the reset is tied to the primordial summoning

B) they don't need to wait until alignment after all - the ritual works just fine without it
