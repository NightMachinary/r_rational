Or cover for blood magic? We hear it mentioned that a blood magician would be easy to spot because of the number of deaths, a large scale plague that killed a lot of magic users would be a perfect cover then.

We haven't heard anything about the symptoms of the weeping, so we don't know how easy it would be to confuse it for another form of death. But lets assume its possible, either the weeping was directly tied to blood magic as some sort of deliberate weapon, or it was unrelated and red robe took advantage of the cover. Then he steals a bunch of magical power from one of the most famous bloodlines, gaining it for himself, and in the process tying himself into the looping.
