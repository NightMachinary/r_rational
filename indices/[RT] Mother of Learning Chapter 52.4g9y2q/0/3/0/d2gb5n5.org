I was thinking the same thing too; that red robe and Zach might be related. Obviously the loop is able to take more than one person back each time, so could it be that it was designed that way? What if the whole Noveda family is supposed to loop back together. The only reason Zach is the prime user, is because he's currently the Noveda elder. Or closest to the Noveda mansion when the first loop started.

In that case Red Robe could be some long lost family relation of Zach. Possibly even have ties with the Ibasan forces through adoption.

Also, bonus observation, it would suck if you would have to spend years looping, while your spouse was unable to. The soul marker would have to be designed in a way that it could be shared with others through marriage. Maybe through a special ritual to induce a soul bond.

Now, tin-foil hat. Red robe is just someone that Zach married in one of his crazy loops. Possibly while under-cover with Ibasans.
