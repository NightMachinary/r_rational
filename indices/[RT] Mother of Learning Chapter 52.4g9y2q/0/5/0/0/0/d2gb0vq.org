  You're loading quite a lot into that one question.

I mean it is reasonable to rank a hypothetical person that frees a primordial as lowest of the low. Why would you bet goodwill of such scum?

  Or Red Robe

You mean he is down there, sacrificing shifters each restart?

#+begin_quote
  Or Red Robe ;-)

???

Doesn't that kinda prove my point? If Red Robe was connected to primordial summoning in timeline zero (which is not that likely, but whatever), then we can definitely conclude he doesn't change his mind. Instead he uses the time loop to optimize the invasion, like a proper adherent of the Cult would do. Bet on the goodwill of the villain, lose.
