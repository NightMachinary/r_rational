The one problem I have with the divine contingency theory is the selection of someone to stop it. The natural, obvious candidate for the person to be looped is the person that /causes the primordial's release/. They see the effect, see reality break and get sent back in time. Now they know not to do it. Why loop some unrelated person hundreds of times over? Why depend on luck for the bloodline even being alive or near the primordial in question?
