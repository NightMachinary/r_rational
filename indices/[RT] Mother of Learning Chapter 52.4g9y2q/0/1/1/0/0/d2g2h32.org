Re-reading the story, I realize I've probably gotten it wrong. Primordial's don't cause the wells of power, but they might be attached to them. Otherwise, why place one next to a giant, magical beacon, which is pretty much guaranteed to attract people to settle next to it? Why not just bury them deep underground, with no tunnel?

My guess is that the primordial we know about is either generating the well of power (and the story about the dragon below generating magic is wrong), or if the story is true, it was placed there because its prison requires magic to power.

Either way, my guess is that all wells of power have primordials sealed in them. The author has explained warding schemes in detail, explicitly noting that more powerful ones either require huge batteries (which eventually drain), or large amounts of ambient power (thus being next to the wells.)

If neither of these things are true, I don't see why the gods wouldn't have sealed the primordials deep underground, or on the moon.

P.S. This is what i'm basing my theory on, BTW

  According to Ikosians, the world was originally a swirling, shapeless chaos, inhabited only by the 7 primordial dragons. One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World -- the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground. Far from being content with her fate, the Dragon Below still rages against her bounds, giving birth to natural disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes. Unable to strike back against the gods themselves, the dragon takes her anger out on their favored creations -- humans -- by utilizing her heart, the one thing the gods have not seen fit to take away from her. Pieces of it continually flake off from the main mass, giving birth to horrifying monsters whenever they hit the ground, at which point said monsters begin their ascent to the surface to terrorize mankind...
