I just don't think that "Door to an epic monster", "A really powerful source of mana" and "Source of all the non-epic monsters" just /happen/ to be in the same general place. They are probably related, and probably very close to one another geographically as well. Since 2 and 3 are deep underground as far as anyone can tell, it would make sense that 1 was as well.
