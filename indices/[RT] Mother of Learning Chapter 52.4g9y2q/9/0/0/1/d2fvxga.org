But Zorian was murdering things for experience just this chapter!

And ruining someone's soul is no worse than murder, since it stays in the loop: once the restart is over, the soul will be restored. This is one of the greatest advantages of time loop: the ability to commit an unlimited amount of inhumanly amoral actions at effectively no cost.

And Zorian declines to use it? Ugh. I hope he had grown more reasonable since chapter 16.
