I wonder if without the primordial blood one can come up with a method to make themselves a shifter that does not pass on their traits. It'd mean you could make yourself one of those dangerous shifter types without fear of the monster's mind damaging your children's. As a matter of fact you could prepare them as they grew up before giving them the method.
