I know what Zorian's side of the conversation will be, at least partially. He will tell Zack about suicide rings and how to use his marker (and discovering what the complete marker is like). Maybe Zorian will throw Zack at Xvim to learn mind-magic defense. This is not including about Zorian's information about the entire invasion. Really the only complete surprise is what Zorian will learn from Zack.
