Anyone else wondering now if the time loop was set up to be a competition? There's a bit in the incomplete message the matriarch left: "...can only ever be one winner in this game. I am truly..."

If so, perhaps RR and Zach were both in the loop from the start, and possibly even more people. But the others were eliminated, but instead of dying, it's as if they were never a part of it, which is why more inexplicably dead people aren't found at the beginning of the loop. And since Zorian and Zach share a marker, as long as RR loses, they both get to keep their "time loop modified" souls, where as the losers, including RR, will never know it existed at all.

Unfortunately, I'm guessing that RR cornered Zach in the past and made him forget the method to eliminate competitors, giving himself plenty of time to enjoy the benefits of the loop.
