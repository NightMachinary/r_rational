Well, Civ 5 is about 30$ canadian right now, and it's a pretty fun game with a decent amount of replayability. If you like JRPG's, its not a PC title but Fire Emblem Fates is pretty fun. And, you can always get an emulator for the older games, which would be free if you want to test the waters.

Then there's Dota 2, which if you end up liking you will probably end up with thousands of hours sunk into it (like me). It's got strategy, but its more of and RTS thats more focused on teamwork. It's also free, which is nice.
