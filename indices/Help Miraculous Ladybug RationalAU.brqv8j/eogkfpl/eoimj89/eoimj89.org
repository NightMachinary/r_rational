There is one way to benefit from a 'balanced' trade which varies in reward based on the perception of the user towards the trade, and that's to give someone who doesn't fully understand what they are doing the McGuffin. As an example, [[/u/CreationBlues]] said lower down in the thread that a dog level AI would be incredibly helpful for AI research. Now, if you were to tell an AI researcher to make that trade, they would presumably have to sacrifice huge amounts to create that dog AI, as they have an intrinsic understanding of the huge amounts of good that could come from that trade. On the other hand, give your average (trusted) adult who has different things to worry about the McGuffin, and order /them/ to make the trade, and they won't understand the full consequences of the trade they are making, and thus the dog AI gets made for much cheaper than it otherwise would have.

So if the protagonist wants to end death, if they can't do it in a roundabout way and have to do it very urgently for whatever reason, then maybe they talk to the town crazy who believes they have unlimited power over life and death. The protag gives them the McGuffin secretly and tells them to end death for whatever reason, then silently takes the McGuffin back. This would only be done in the worst case scenario, of course, and would normally take place after very carefully vetting candidates who are just the right combination of loyal, and uneducated in a specific area. Example: an adult who has received no formal training in physics is told to wish for a chunk of rock, using a gold bar as a sacrifice. Obviously the gold is viewed as much more valuable than the big chunk of rock, and thermodynamics has been violated easily enough.

And if the value of the trade is made from a static subjective position, like the average of human belief, then the plan still somewhat works - as the average human probably places about the same value on a dog AI as they would a living dog.
