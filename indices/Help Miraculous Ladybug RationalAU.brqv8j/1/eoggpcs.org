Considering the main villain is already opposed to death, maybe he realizes that he could potentially persuade the protagonists (one of whom is his son!) to his side by manipulating events in their lives. He could leverage the more powerful tool his McGuffin offers him - to surveil the emotions of others, rather than just use those emotions to corrupt them - to ensure the creation of a dystopian society that everyone would wish reformed.

​

Instead of creating supervillains who get instantly defeated, create superpowered agents (Lila, Nathalie) who manipulate society from the shadows, empowering them temporarily to make mundane changes to society's detriment and exaggerating the flaws of its selfish aristocracy (the mayor's family).

​

If Ladybug personally experienced death and suffering that she needs her McGuffin to fix, perhaps she could be persuaded that the status quo needed changing. The villain doesn't even need to know her true identity to influence her this way.
