I'm going to preface this with the idea that I'm not familiar with the media you're referencing, so I'm not sure how acurate my analysis will be.

Obviously, the goal here is to minimize suffering while maximizing return. An AI? Sure, humanity's cool and all, but a lot of what we want out of an AI can be had with animal level inteligences, for example, a dog AI would be massively helpful. Considering that an AI could be theoretically extended with high level modules that could handle things like memory and logic, and you find your bang for your buck starts going pretty far.

You could go pretty far with that. Livestock massively outnumbers humans, and even with a shitty conversion rate for life force, you get a fast and humane way of slaughtering them.
