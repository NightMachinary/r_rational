It's hard to help you on the "eliminating death" idea without knowing how "balance" is determined. It may be exploitable.

For instance, let's say that there are million sentient species in the universe. Could you sacrifice 1% of the lifespan of one species in the universe to make the human lifespan 1% longer? And then repeat that for every species in the universe?

1.01^{1,000,000} is equivalent to about 10^{4,321}.

And then you could sacrifice, say, a googol of years of the new human lifespan to extend the lifespan of each of the species you borrowed the 1% from by the same googol of years, costing you 10^{106} years of the new human lifespan, which doesn't even approach a rounding error.

I can't know whether that exploit, or one like it, would work, without knowing how whether a change is "balanced" or not is decided.
