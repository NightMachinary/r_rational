I am familiar with the source material. I've been thinking for a while on what I could advice you, but after seriously thinking about it I don't see any objection in letting the Villain try out using the McGuffins, and undo it if things went southwards (didn't know about the secondary effects of using their combined power though).

As best_cat said, the best option is to play it straight. Either have the MC be more worried about the possible fallout of allowing the Villain the single use of the McGuffins, or let her do it and deal with whatever happens afterwards, including any guilty concience in case of a massively horrible consequence. If you change the main conflict to the morality of the usage of the McGuffins, the Villain's methods to secure them can be changed a lot from physical to psychological. If the Villain can be open about his goals it can even produce additional conflict between the 2 MC's.
