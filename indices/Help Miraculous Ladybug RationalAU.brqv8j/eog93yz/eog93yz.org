One (extremely satisfying for me) option would be to play the moral choice situation straight.

The standard non-rationalist story sets up a choice between two moral options: Do we achieve some large (but impersonal) good? Or do we preserve our sacred values like "never leave a man behind" or "never use human lives as a means to and end".

The problem is that non-rationalist authors inevitably flinch.

Maybe we learn that the villain is actually just selfish and all of their utilitarian rhetoric is just a lie. Or maybe the hero gets lucky for reasons outside of their control and knowledge.

Either way, the inevitable non-rationalist outcome is that the Hero gets to preserve their sacred values, keep their heroic reputation AND ALSO achieve the large-scale good that the villain wanted.

I'd honestly just play is straight, but don't flinch, and spend a bunch of camera time on the "impersonal" people who the camera normally glosses over.

Like, in Chapter 1 the hero refuses to sacrifice someone to end a plague. They save the victim and secure the McGuffin. But then the plague gets out and kills 10% of the people in their city.

Chapter 2, and the rest of the story, would involve the aftermath. The heroes have the McGuffin, but now need to keep it safe from the many, many people who've been hurt and want to use the item for the "greater good."
