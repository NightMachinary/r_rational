I feel like the wish-granting ability works better as a background hook rather than a main focus, both because it hasn't been fully explained on screen, and because I'm a little tired of ratfic discussion centering around wish-granting and/or the risks of asking a UFAI to grant wishes. Not saying it can't be done well, just that it's been done.

As for Hawk Moth's emotion sensing abilities, there's one clear gap in his abilities: He can't break secret identities. He's never noticed the fact that Marinette's emotions disappear from his senses, shortly followed by Ladybug appearing on his radar in the same spot.

There are a couple of possible explanations for this - maybe it's magic, maybe he can't sense people when they're not thinking akuma-worthy thoughts (which Marinette rarely is), maybe he hasn't realized how much information he can get from the absence of evidence. But whatever the reason, it limits him to making short-term plans. He can't wage long psychological campaigns because he only knows what Ladybug and Cat Noir are thinking in the narrow window between when they show up and when they defeat the Akuma. That's probably enough to keep the heroes safe.

(Going with the third option - that he /could/ break their identity but hasn't yet figured out how to do so - could be interesting, since it sort of fits the series rule that Ladybug and Cat Noir aren't immune to the villains' powers and it's something you could build up to over a story.)

One other thing I think he could be doing better is re-using his Akumas. Ladybug and Cat Noir are slowly mastering their abilities, but Hawk Moth never has a tool on hand long enough to learn more than the basics of it. Yes, they become a lot weaker when Ladybug and Cat Noir already know their abilities, but combinations of their powers can be pretty damn powerful, and he can bring out new Akumas with no cooldown while Ladybug and Cat Noir need time to recharge. Gathering people like Lila and Nathalie who he can repeatedly send out gives him the ability to make long-term plans instead of starting fresh with each Akuma.
