The problem with balance comes down to a notion of "gains from trade."

I'll only make a trade if the thing I'm getting (a soda) is worth more to me than the thing I'm giving up ($1). Soda machines work because Coca-Cola and I /disagree/ about the actual value of a soda.

Maybe Coke can produce cans for $0.50/each, and the drink provides me with $2 worth of pleasure. That difference is valuations is what motivates us to trade.

If I'm offered a trade that's equal according to /my/ valuation, then I'm not doing to bother. By definition, it doesn't make me better off, so why expend any effort?

If the McGuffin uses some other valuation, then it can be useful, but at that point, we start looking for exploits. I'd more of less pick what I want to buy (eg. "a cure for my friend's cancer") and then start searching for the least-valuable-to-me thing that the McGuffin regards as a fair exchange.

For instance, if the trade is "a life for a life" then I'd head to the grocery store, buy a couple lobsters, and sacrifice the lobster's life for the life of my friend. (Then try bugs, or clams and see if I can heal everyone in the local cancer ward)

If we're restricted to human lives, then I'd cast the spell targeting people who are seconds away from death due to some natural cause.

I think the narrative problem here is that the things are too similar. If we do "life for life" then either we prefer one to the other, or we say that they're similar enough that the outcome doesn't matter.
