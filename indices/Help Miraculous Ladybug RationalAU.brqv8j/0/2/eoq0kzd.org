"The trade is positive-sum to me but from an outside perspective it's zero-sum" sounds like a negative externality. Clearly, Hawk Moth thinks that getting his wife back is worth any price, so the trade is beneficial according to his own valuation, but not according to the rest of humanity's.

(Although there's one person that I think he would consider an "equal" trade for his wife, such that he'd regret making the trade if that was the price. I suppose we won't know for sure until the series finale.)

Looking for exploits in the Miraculous's value function is theoretically possible, but risky. We don't know if the price is known or specified by the caster in advance, or if it just extracts whatever price it thinks is fair after you're done using it. Start small - maybe bring someone's pet back to life instead of a person.

On the other hand, neither Hawk Moth nor Master Fu has seen a wish made in person, as far as we know, so it's possible they're both wrong about how it really works. Plenty of room for a fanfic author to play around.
