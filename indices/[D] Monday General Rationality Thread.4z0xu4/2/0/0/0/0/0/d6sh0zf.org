Oh, I wasn't referring to the people who want to put Hugos out of its misery. I'm just surprised people were prepared to compromise the whole point of the awards just to spite political adversaries. Refusing to give out well deserved awards just because someone you don't like also thinks the work is deserving? Come on, that's beyond stupid.
