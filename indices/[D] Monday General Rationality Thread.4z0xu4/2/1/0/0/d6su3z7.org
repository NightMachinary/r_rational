Oh, interesting, I hadn't thought about it that way. Although I personally found the story interesting (as opposed to 50 Shadows of Gray), I could see how someone who was much a sci-fi purist might dislike that it got an award. As someone of Asian descent, I don't usually find it sticks out when there are Asian characters in a story, but I see how it could for others. I'm willing to let in most borderline things to count as sci-fi even if the ideas aren't fully explored, but I can see how a purist might not like the central conceit in that short story.

Still, it seems like the point I made holds true for novels (which are the biggest awards), and the anti-Scalzi stuff in the top-level post of this thread doesn't make sense at all. /Redshirts/ doesn't feature gay people or people of color, and like the other winners it was at least nominated for the Nebula (which Ancillary Justice /won/). And, whatever you might say about /The Water/, it's still a good piece and nominally a sci-fi piece. People talk about the Hugos like they're a joke, but the awarded stories seem uniformly good reads. There's always some sort of bias with any award, especially one determined by voting.
