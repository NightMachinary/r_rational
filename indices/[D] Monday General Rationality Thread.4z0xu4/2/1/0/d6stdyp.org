  The Water that Falls on You from Nowhere is one of my favorites as well. It involves a gay couple, which I guess upset some people?

The primary criticism was that the speculative elements were almost entirely superfluous, leaving many with the impression that it won as a means of giving an award to a gay!PoC!story, even if that story only qualified for a /Hugo/ by a generous fig leaf. Personally, I liked the story well enough as a character piece, I just thought it wasn't really SF/F.

Imagine if 50 Shades of Gray had been a slightly different story. In the actual book, the protagonist meets Gray because her roommate got sick. If she met Gray because her roommate came down sick with /lycanthropy/, and that was the only remotely plot-relevant instance of lycanthropy, or any kind of sci-fi or fantasy element, or any exploration of that phenomenon beyond some trite social class signalling, then, irrespective of any arguments about quality, would you accept the story even qualified as SF/F to begin with?

The water has no purpose in the story beyond stripping the protagonist of agency, and a cheap shot at "frat guys", and it spawns a thousand actually interesting questions that are never brought up at all.
