I will say that I've never noticed any major problem with the Hugos. Looking back, reading the novel that won (and often winners of other categories) has almost always satisfied me. Here is what I recall from the past few years of reading:

I enjoyed /Redshirts: A Novel with Three Codas/ from 2013, and consider it one of the best "portal fantasy" novels (and one of the few "reverse portal fantasy" novels) ever. I highly recommend it for any reader of sci-fi, and anyone who finds portal fantasy interesting. It's not really a deconstruction of portal fantasy, but it's more like, before /Redshirts/, I thought I had many good portal fantasy stories. Afterward, I realized I never had before. Although it didn't win the award, /Immersion/ by Aliette De Bodard was very good, especially to anyone who has anti-establishment ideas.

In 2014, /Ancillary Justice/ was great, and I really liked the ideas of artificial intelligence and collective identity / group intelligence that it explored. It wasn't quite as strong as the 2013 and 2015 novels, which is why I think people complain about gender stuff in /Ancillary Justice/. I didn't notice the gender stuff until people brought my attention to it after I finished the novel. While reading, just figured "oh these people have an unusual culture" and never thought about it deeply; my friends who excitedly brought this novel to my attention later seemed to find a lot more meaning in this than I did. /The Water that Falls on You from Nowhere/ is one of my favorites as well. It involves a gay couple, which I guess upset some people?

In 2015, /The Three Body Problem/ was astonishingly good. I think it has even been posted in this subreddit. As with /Redshirts/, this is literally one of the greatest novels I've read. It got several of my friends who aren't big sci-fi readers into sci-fi; my parents, who have been reading sci-fi for ages, like it. I like it. I think it's one of those really enduring sci fi novels. I can't really comment on the winners of the other categories; it seems like "No Award" won a lot.

I haven't read /The Fifth Season/, the 2016 novel winner yet, but given how good my experiences have always been reading Hugo award winners, I see no reason not to use the Hugos. Most of the time, they line up with the Nebula awards anyways. For example, /Ancillary Justice/, which I suspect is what people are complaining about, /won/ the Nebula in its year. Other winners got through the nomination problem, too; /The Three-Body Problem/ was nominated, as was /The Fifth Season/. The fact that Scalzi's /Redshirts/ didn't get nominated for a Nebula in 2013 mostly makes me think that the Nebula people dropped the ball there. /Redshirts/ is great. I read /Binti/ recently and enjoyed it as well. It's good to see it got some recognition. This one seemed to directly address themes related to race, species, power, and war, so I could see how people might dislike it, but it's also just a great sci fi novella, definitely worth a read.

Edit: given how good /Redshirts/ was and the fact it doesn't address themes of race or gender, I'm surprised people are getting up in Scalzi's business. It seems there are more explicitly leftist works to critique.
