  EDIT: I've read Totaled. It's not bad at all and it's certainly not trash. It's not a very original concept but the execution is good. I haven't read as many short stories that received hugo awards compared to novels, so I don't have as much of a frame of reference. Of the few I read, it's definitely not as memorable and original as Flowers for Algernon, Exhalation, Robbie and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream but execution is good.

So the claims that it didn't receive a reward for political reasons at least have a chance of not being nonsense. Not the definitive evidence it would have been if something on the level of Exhalation was passed up, but then again, you don't see something like that every year.

In the end, I don't think this is a reliable way to judge the quality of the awards before the puppies started their campaign. Totaled was nominated when the politically motivated voting was at the all time high, after all.

If you're interested in more works that the sad puppies thought were deserving you can check their 2016 list [[http://file770.com/?p=28038][here]]. I'm not sure I could honestly imagine anyone who was protesting that list of nominations as being motivated by anything other than politics. I mean, when rabid puppies nominate stuff like space raptor butt invasion they are definitely up to no good, but it looks to me like sad puppies are actually interested in submitting worthy works, SJW usage and media smear campaigns notwithstanding. Not like it's going to matter: people who were interested in trying to reform the awards peacefully have pretty much given up at this point, it looks like.
