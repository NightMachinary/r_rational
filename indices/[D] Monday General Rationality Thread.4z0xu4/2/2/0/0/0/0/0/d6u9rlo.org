  Regardless, if the system can be gamed so that trash can be nominated, then there's a real problem.

That's what I was getting at from the very beginning. I don't know why you're so fixated at the final voting stage (although I have an uncharitable suspicion again). If the worthy candidates fail to even get through to the final voting stage (and thus the voters feel there is no choice but to vote No Award), then obviously the system is fucked. And the reasons for the system being fucked are clearly political. That's it, there is no need to take sides or anything, it's a simple observation that the correspondence of the awards to the quality/popularity of the works has been compromised.
