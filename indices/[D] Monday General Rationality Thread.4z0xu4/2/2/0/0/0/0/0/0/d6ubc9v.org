I do not disagree with what you are saying. However, to alleviate your confusion, I would note that there is a common saying in the rationalist community that that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][politics]] is [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kkp/politics_is_hard_mode/][spiders]]. This is easy to forget!

It's very easy to say "ah, right, politics is spiders" when you're not talking about politics. It's hard to actually remember politics is spiders when you're covered in +spiders+ politics. I suspect the reason there seems to be a lot of point count fluctuations in this thread are the politics-spider attacks. I've given everyone below +1 an upvote to try to smooth things out a bit, since I don't think anyone is actually negatively contributing to the discussion.

In any case, if you discuss something related to politics, even if you're making a super benign observation, don't be surprised when spiders show up.
