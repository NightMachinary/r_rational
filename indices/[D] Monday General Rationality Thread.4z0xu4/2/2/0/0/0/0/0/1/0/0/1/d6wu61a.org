Just a small update. I've been reading the rants some more (it's a bit of a guilty pleasure for me) and have upon more works that should/shouldn't have won according to Vox:

- Pierce Brown apparently didn't even get nominated. Might be worth checking out.

- According to Vox, /The Fifth Season/ is undeserving of the award it received. Another opportunity for you to read a (hopefully) decent book and see if the claims of people giving out undeserved awards hold any water.

This is less relevant, but apparently they also refused to give an award to Jim Butcher last year, although they relented this year.
