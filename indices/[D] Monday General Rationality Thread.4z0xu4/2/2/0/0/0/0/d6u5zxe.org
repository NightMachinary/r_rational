Well, what I meant is that I've looked at the results in 2016. There were two categories that received No Awards and since I haven't read the works, I do not know if the nominated works should have gotten an award. But for example, in the case of the short story I linked to, then yes, a no award is absolutely better than that short story since it's clearly trash and should have been nominated in the first place (did you read it? there's no way that this could be called a deserving work).

Now, I've looked at the 2015 results since I made the previous answer and I do see more categories that received "No award" and it looks a lot weirder in that the titles that have been passed over don't seem to be trash (like that vox short story). I haven't read any of the works that have been passed over so I do not know if they are good and I would need to read them to form an opinion... Do you have any specific stories or novels that have been passed over that you can recommend?

Regardless, if the system can be gamed so that trash can be nominated, then there's a real problem. The no award is either a consequence of that or it's people voting against things for political reasons, I cannot know that until I've read the work (which I would have done if I were voting).
