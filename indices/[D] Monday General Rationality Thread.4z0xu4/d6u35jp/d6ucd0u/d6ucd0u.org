I'm confused as to why you think money is too abstract to represent a 'real cost' - what's more real than the amount you pay for something?

I can imagine trying to handwave local issues, purchasing power, costs (or benefits) to third parties... but economists call that "ideal prices" (mostly) and it's a lot more abstract.

For googlefoo, look up "embodied energy solar panels" - it depends on the exact technology and location, but typically it takes 1-4 years to return all energy used in production and they have a life of ~10 times that afterwards.
