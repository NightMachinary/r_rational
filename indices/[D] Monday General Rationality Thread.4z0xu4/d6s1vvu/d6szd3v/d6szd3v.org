That short story was nominated but didn't win (obviously)...

It's been my experience that discounting anything from people using the term SJW is a good heuristic to have, so I have difficulty believing their claims that the Hugo were gamed before and I'd need a non-biased source for me to consider it.

That said, over the years, I've read quite a few novels who won the Hugo awards and I've found them to be consistently above average although admittedly I've read much more novels from more than 20 years ago so it speaks more of the quality of the Hugo awards in the past...

Of recent novels, I agree with blazinghand's assessment of the best novels awards from the past 3 years:

- Redshirts was a very good reverse portal fantasy.. It's not hard SF which is what I prefer but it's the best example of reverse portal fantasy I've read
- The Three-Body Problem is really good and a must read
- China Mi√©ville The City and The City is a cool concept

Ok, now we really need a yearly rational award. One that judges:

- the best rationalist original story
- the best rational original story
- the best rationalist fanfiction
- the best rational fanfiction
- the best almost-rational novel

It'd be fun to vote for this every year :-)
