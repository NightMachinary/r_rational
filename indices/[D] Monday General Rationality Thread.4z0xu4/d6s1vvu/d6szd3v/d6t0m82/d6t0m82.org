  It's been my experience that discounting anything from people using the term SJW is a good heuristic to have, so I have difficulty believing their claims that the Hugo were gamed before and I'd need a non-biased source for me to consider it.

Well, they aren't lying about last year seeing more No Award results than the whole previous history of the awards, right? I think the obvious conclusion is that any award that's influenced by politics to such a degree is going to be shit as an unbiased indicator of popularity.

In my opinion, it doesn't really matter who started it, what the sides are, and what kinds of terms are being thrown around, the simple fact that the results are very significantly influenced by politics is undeniable.
