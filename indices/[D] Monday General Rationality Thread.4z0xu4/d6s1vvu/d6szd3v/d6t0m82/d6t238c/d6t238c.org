I don't consider No Award results as a sign that the award is influenced by politics.

For example, if you look at this [[https://voxday.blogspot.ca/2015/06/if-you-were-award-my-love.html]] which has been nominated for Best Short Story, there's no way any judge with integrity would give an award to this because it's just not worthy of an award not because of political reason but because it's of extremely poor quality and not a SF Short Story.

I haven't taken the time to look at the Best Related Work submissions but if you just look at some of the titles "SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police", "Safe Space as Rape Room", I think they're probably not deserving of an award regardless of the political content.

What I do agree with and that Sad Puppies/Rabbid Puppies have demonstrated is that the nomination process is heavily gameable but I don't think they've proven anything else.
