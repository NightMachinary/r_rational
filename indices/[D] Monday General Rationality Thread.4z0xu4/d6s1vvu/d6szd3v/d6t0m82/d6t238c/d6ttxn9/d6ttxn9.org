  I don't consider No Award results as a sign that the award is influenced by politics.

The very year that this political clusterfuck started reaching crescendo the awards had the most No Award results than the whole previous history, but you don't think that was a sign that results were influenced by politics?

  What I do agree with and that Sad Puppies/Rabbid Puppies have demonstrated is that the nomination process is heavily gameable but I don't think they've proven anything else.

Every bit of decision power exerted in service of politics is a bit not serving the actual purpose of the awards. The actual final results would have been very different if no politics were involved, ergo the results were influenced and have turned into something they weren't supposed to be. They are no longer a good indicator of what fandom likes. Puppies nominate stuff which the old guard doesn't want to win, so the old guard votes No Award rather than voting for the stuff the actually like. Each No Award represents a deserving work not being honoured due to politics. If that's not politics influencing the results, then I don't know what is.

This is a bit uncharitable, but it looks to me you are motivated more by desire to oppose people using the "SJW" term, rather than desire to be factually correct here.
