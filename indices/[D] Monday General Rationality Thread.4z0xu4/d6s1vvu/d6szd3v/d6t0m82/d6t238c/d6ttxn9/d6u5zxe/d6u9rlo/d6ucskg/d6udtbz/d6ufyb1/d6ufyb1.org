  I agree that we've been kind of talking past each other here. Personally, I don't give a crap if what the puppies say is true myself, although I'm mildly inclined to believe their claims about cliquishness. I'm just observing that, regardless of who is correct, the last couple of years the awards are unrepresentative politically-influenced crap. I'm not really interested in whether they were crap before puppies started deliberately fiddling with them, since I haven't actually ever used them for anything.

Well, that's exactly where we really differ. I used the Hugo awards to decide which books to read in the past but mostly for awards in the distant past. Knowing if the awards given before the whole puppies thing started could be useful in finding good books is what I'm interested in.

I'll read Totaled and report back here... It will be a good test.

EDIT: I've read Totaled. It's not bad at all and it's certainly not trash. It's not a very original concept but the execution is good. I haven't read as many short stories that received hugo awards compared to novels, so I don't have as much of a frame of reference. Of the few I read, it's definitely not as memorable and original as Flowers for Algernon, Exhalation, Robbie and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream but execution is good.
