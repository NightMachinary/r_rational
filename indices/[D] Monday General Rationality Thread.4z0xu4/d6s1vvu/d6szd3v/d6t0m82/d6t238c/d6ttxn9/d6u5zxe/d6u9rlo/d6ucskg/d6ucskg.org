I did say in my second message that the nomination stage has been blatantly gamed in the past few years.

So, either we have a situation that is created by the Sad/Rabbid puppies crowd by gaming the nominations but that is corrected by the final voting stage. In that case, the puppies crowd which is complaining is the one at fault. And the Hugo award for the years before the Puppies started is a useful indicator of what fans like.

Or, we have a situation where the puppies are right, they nominate good quality work and that work is passed over because the rest of the voters vote against it regardless of the quality of the work (and without reading the work in question according to the puppies group). In the second case, the award then amounts to nothing and is suspect even in the years before the puppies came to scene.

I believe that it's more likely that it's the first situation (and this is due to my bias against groups using the SJW term) and that would mean that the award is still useful as long as any trash that gets nominated gets a no award and awards are still delivered to quality work. So, in that case, the question is if the no award system saves the quality of the award which is why I'm fixated in the second part of the voting. As an example, in 2015, the three body problem got the votes despite the sad puppies campaign and having read that novel, I think it clearly deserves it and having 'no awards' compared to awards given to work that doesn't deserve it means that while the hugo awards are less useful than if the nominations weren't gamed, they still are useful.

If, however, we're in the second situation and the puppies are right, then the hugo awards have been useless for years and a better award system would be good.

I cannot determine for sure if we're in the first situation or in the second situation until I've read works that were in categories where "No award" was voted and see if they are really good quality work that deserve to be voted (and that would still be rather subjective). This is why I asked if you knew any good quality work that got passed over? I would then read them and form an opinion.

So, I think we've kind of been talking past each other. For me, my concern was against or not what the puppies say is true or not. That's what I meant by what you first quoted. I'm just skeptical of the puppies claims and motivations for trying to destroy the award.

I also agree there's a problem. I never said that nominations have not been gamed. And I see the No Awards given to categories as the group as a whole fighting back against bad nominations.
