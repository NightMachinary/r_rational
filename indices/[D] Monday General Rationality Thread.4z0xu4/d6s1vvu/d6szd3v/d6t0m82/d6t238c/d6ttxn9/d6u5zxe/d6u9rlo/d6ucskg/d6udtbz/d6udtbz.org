  So, either we have a situation that is created by the Sad/Rabbid puppies crowd by gaming the nominations but that is corrected by the final voting stage.
#+end_quote

I think I disagree on this (almost technical) point. Not that the nominations are being influenced (which they clearly are), but the fact that the final voting stage corrects them. See, if there were no political shenanigans, then the nominee list would be different and people would be free to actually vote for what they like, instead of strategic voting, which is taking place. The final results would be different from what is actually happening. Since the results differ from the counterfactual results in hypothetical politics-free hugo, I can't really say that the votes correct anything when the shortlists are bad. The old-timers are fighting back against "bad" nominations, but if the best they can do is No Award, then we may as well just stop running the awards altogether.

  I cannot determine for sure if we're in the first situation or in the second situation until I've read works that were in categories where "No award" was voted and see if they are really good quality work that deserve to be voted (and that would still be rather subjective). This is why I asked if you knew any good quality work that got passed over? I would then read them and form an opinion.

I'm not really a part of that community myself, so I can't offer anything from my personal experience, but Larry Correia was complaining about Totaled by Kary English last year. Haven't read it myself yet, but you can take a look at that at least and tell us what you think of it.

  So, I think we've kind of been talking past each other.

I agree that we've been kind of talking past each other here. Personally, I don't give a crap if what the puppies say is true myself, although I'm mildly inclined to believe their claims about cliquishness. I'm just observing that, /regardless/ of who is correct, the last couple of years the awards are unrepresentative politically-influenced crap. I'm not really interested in whether they were crap before puppies started deliberately fiddling with them, since I haven't actually ever used them for anything.
