  I'm willing to let in most borderline things to count as sci-fi even if the ideas aren't fully explored, but I can see how a purist might not like the central conceit in that short story.

I didn't mind the conceit that much in itself. I was /really/ bothered that absolutely no one had a comment or thought about the end of water scarcity, the implications for conservation of mass and energy, societal implications of /always-on perfect truth-detecting/, etc. Instead we just get a cliched bit about LOLStupidFratGuys, and I can't help but suspect that if the butts of that joke had been hipsters or hippies, it would never have won.

Haven't read Scalzi or Justice, so I can't comment. As I understand it, the complaint from the Sads had always been primarily about /cliquishness/ with a veneer of political snobishness, and that the issue hadn't been so much about the broader culture wars until Vox and the Rabids starting setting out military grade SJW bait. Scalzi was emphatically part of the clique. I think it was for a different con/award, but I just saw a SS of tweets from Stephen King where he claimed that a con insider had told him that if he came, and /sat at the right table/, he could be guaranteed an award. That sort of thing was the heart of the accusations against Scalzi. He paid his dues, and sat at the right tables, so he got his awards. That the (primarily white/straight/progressive) people at those tables were the sort to judge each other by conspicuous displays of interest in diversity was the spark that was fanned into the current clusterfuck.

  People talk about the Hugos like they're a joke, but the awarded stories seem uniformly good reads.

I hadn't paid attention to the Hugos before the drama. I was just vaguely aware that it was a thing sometimes mentioned on a cover. My main takeaway from spending too much time reading about all this is that in many categories, over many years, the number of nominations submitted in total was so pathetically small as to render the whole notion of The Fan Award meaningless. It was little better than a SurveyMonkey poll organized by an insular book club. And now that there are actually sizable numbers of nominators/voters involved, the whole thing has devolved into a politicized disaster, complete with vote-buying schemes.

I'll stick to picking personal recommendations, or going by cover blurbs, I think.
