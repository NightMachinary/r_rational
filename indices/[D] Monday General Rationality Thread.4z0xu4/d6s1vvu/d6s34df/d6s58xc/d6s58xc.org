[[https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/08/post-hugo-analysis.html][This page]] provides a better explanation of the situation. The Rabid Puppies' /objective/ was to bait the Hugo clique into giving out "No Award"s--so, they won to at least some extent:

  We were only able to burn two categories this year, but we reduced their choices to X or No Award in 5 other categories.

  We're not casting the awards into disrepute, we are highlighting the fact that the SJWs in science fiction have already made them disreputable.

  In the movie, Larry Correia [leader of the Sad Puppies last year] is the cop who tells the perp that if he'll just admit what he did wrong, they'll go easy on him. He tries, and the perp just laughs and spits in his face, so he sighs, gets up, and leaves. Then in walks Vox Day [leader of the Rabid Puppies] with the night stick.

  I mean, last year was their chance to prove everybody wrong and show some integrity, but they just refused to, and now the only people who still care are the [[https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/chorf-its-a-word-now][CHORF]]s and the guys who want to burn it down.

The Rabid Puppies want to /destroy/ the Hugo Awards (even further than they've already been destroyed), forcing everyone to abandon the Hugos for less-corrupt alternatives (e.g., [[http://awards.dragoncon.org][the Dragon Awards]]). The Sad Puppies of last year hoped to /reform/ the Hugos from within--but last year's Hugos [[http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/08/24/sad-puppies-3-looking-at-the-results][showed that reform was unlikely]] and [[http://heatst.com/culture-wars/interview-the-rabid-puppies-and-vox-day-bite-the-hugo-awards][radicalized most of the Sad Puppies into Rabid Puppies]].
