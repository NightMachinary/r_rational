  But HPMOR also showed that people dont really act like they believe in an afterlife

I really don't think that HPMoR "showed" anything of the kind. It talked about the subject, but that's just talk. And really not all that much talk.

If one of my immediate family was offered their dream job, and would therefore be permanently moving overseas to a scenic and culturally rich location, sadly without phone or internet access - I'd be happy for them having the opportunity, but I'd still miss them.

The Longbottoms' case is simple enough to answer. They're neither dead nor mindless. Very injured, yes; but without far greater understanding of the mind, it's really not possible to say what degree of consciousness and free will they retain. And /with/ that understanding - it might be possible to cure them. My own opinion is, as long as someone still has the potential of /thinking/ and /making decisions/ - not a vegetable, in other words - their life has value. The Longbottoms' potential is too hard to judge, so I would err on the side of keeping them alive - the reversible decision, in other words, rather than the irreversible one. Besides which, if I really had to judge it based on such limited knowledge, I'd say that they're still thinking. If you decided to euthanise them and approached from the front with a knife, I expect that they would react and try to run or defend themselves.
