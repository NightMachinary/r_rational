I think a part of the answer there is that there is a category we might call "mystical experiences" that are a function of neurochemistry/mindstate, and that many religious rituals like prayer or meditation are conducive to putting a person in that mindstate.

And I suspect that many converted atheists are reluctant to be blatant about it because they are all too aware that they were already wrong at least once, and have a degree of sympathy for those who still hold to their religious beliefs. That latter part will vary depending on how much pressure they experience as a result of their (de)conversion.
