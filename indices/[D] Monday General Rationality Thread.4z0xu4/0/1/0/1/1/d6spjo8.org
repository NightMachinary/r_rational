I am currently an atheist, but I was raised Christian and considered myself a rational Christian from the age 8 (when I decided to identify of my own volition instead of by default) to 16 (when I deconverted).

I had had what I, at the time, thought of as religious experiences. It was only when those experiences abruptly stopped once I started questioning my faith that I realised the atheistic explanation (that I had only ever felt what I'd expected to feel and had misattributed the cause) was far more probable.

Perhaps atheism is genetic, but if so it seems odd that its rise would be so quick. The timescale suggests a cultural explanation.

In my case, the cause was increasing education and the ensuing scrutiny of my religious beliefs. That broke the feedback loop of "religious experiences → confirmation of beliefs → religious experiences", which led naturally to atheism (and eventually to "hard" atheism, i.e. "there are almost certainly no gods").
