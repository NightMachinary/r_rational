  Why do people say they don't want to live forever?
#+end_quote

When people talk about why they don't want to live /a long time/, the answer seems to be the fear of aging, enfeeblement, senility. Now it's probably not likely that most people think "live /forever/" means "re-enact the myth of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonus][Tithonus]]" but there's certainly the imagined stress or boredom of ages wearing down on one---even Christianity has to posit a world absolutely free of suffering to go along with its immortal future existence, and that's a much harder problem than just making humans immortal.

To put it another way... it seems they'd rather have the fifty years of torture than the 3^^^3 specks of dust.
