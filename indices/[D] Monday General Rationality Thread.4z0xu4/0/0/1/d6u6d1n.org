That said, in a world where immortality is available to the masses, I would expect standards of life to be much higher than they are now.

For instance, I just don't have much visceral reaction to the idea of death anymore; in fact, it sounds pretty chill most of the time. But I anticipate that I will strongly prefer to be alive in the future.
