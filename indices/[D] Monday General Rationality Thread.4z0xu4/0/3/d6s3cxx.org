A variable mix of sour grapes, a desire to avoid seeming unrealistic, and a failure to seriously analyze the situation.

Only semi-related, but I'm also left baffled by how many people value their autonomy in choosing whether to die more than they value not dying. I think someone can only really have the thought "well sure, I'd like to live indefinitely if possible, but I'd want the means to end it if I change my mind" if they've literally never experienced a suicidal urge. Anyone who has ever wanted to die and currently doesn't want to die is implicitly better off for having not gotten their earlier wish. Your self a million years in the future who's totally happy with their life is much better off for your self a hundred years in the future being unable to kill themselves.
