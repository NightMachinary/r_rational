  Only semi-related, but I'm also left baffled by how many people value their autonomy in choosing whether to die more than they value not dying.

I don't think it should be easy, I just want it to at least be physically possible.

  Your self a million years in the future who's totally happy with their life is much better off for your self a hundred years in the future being unable to kill themselves.

You aren't really imagining the worst case scenario... what if human minds partially break down after thousands of years of usage for reasons that are deeply and intrinsically a part of them (as in not just the neurons, but the algorithms the neuron implement, so that even brain uploading can't prevent this). You then continue to exist till the heat death of the universe in a state with just enough awareness and cognitive ability to suffer but not enough to do anything enjoyable or meaningful.

That is a very particular scenario, but there are a lot of intermediate scenarios that are similar if not quite as bad. There should be some kind of escape mechanism to allow you a way out of scenarios like that. As the question about immorality is posed to people, they often think of a magical absolute condition, so they are rightly cautious of scenarios like I posed. For something more plausible considering real world physics, consider mind uploading implemented by an AI that always views human existence as a net positive and wouldn't let you die, even if you own internal perspective was continuous suffering for internal reasons related to your mind operation that the AI wasn't allowed to modify.

I am not saying the suicide switch should be easy, just that there should be some way out.
