A random discussion with a friend of mine resulted in the question: What are good measures for "Real costs" of things as money is more abstract?

We didn't come up with a particularly good answer, but one suggestion was energy.

We're not photosynthetic, nor do we have star trek replicators where you can input energy and output objects, but I'd imagine it's likely a component of any measure of real cost.

Which lead to the discussion of post-energy scarcity. Renewable are the only thing that don't inherently require us to expend X to get energy, though they do require the production and maintenance of things that allow us to do so.

Which led me to wonder if something like a solar panel ultimately produces more energy over it's life time than is invested in creating it, and if it and other renewables are net gains in "real cost," whatever that is.

My googlefoo failed me on checking energy investment vs. energy returns on solar panels, though.

This is kinda a rambly post, but there's a lot of stuff here I'm interested in seeing discussion from in this community.
