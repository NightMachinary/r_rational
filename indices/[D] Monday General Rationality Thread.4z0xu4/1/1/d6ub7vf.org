I think you'd need a better term than "real cost" for the concept you seem to be reaching for. Perhaps "total energy cost"? It would be meaningfully useful to distinguish it from "price cost" since they're measuring different things. "Total energy cost" would be something like the raw expenditure of effort required to bring some good into usable existence, whereas "price cost" subsumes "total energy cost" into a desirability/opportunity cost analysis.
