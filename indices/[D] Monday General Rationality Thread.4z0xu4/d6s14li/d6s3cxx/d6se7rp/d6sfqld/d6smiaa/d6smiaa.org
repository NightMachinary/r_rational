Well, I am positing a worse case scenario, so in the worse case, the mental breakdown isn't a result of failing substrate but rather a fundamental flaw in the psychological makeup of human beings. As a worse case, the breakdown is just bad enough for extreme suffering, while still ensuring you are sane enough to be "you" as you suffer.

The point isn't whether any given scenario like this is probable, just that the option to die is a good thing to have for extreme cases like this.
