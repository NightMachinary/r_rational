I'd still prefer that there not be /something/ allowed to suffer, even if that something isn't meaningfully me. This is why I am entirely for euthanasia for those diagnosed with dementia. Late stage you can definitely make the argument that they aren't themselves any more, but they're still suffering, and shouldn't be forced to continue in that state out of our misplaced mercy.
