Looked into the claim that religious people are more charitable briefly. It looks like the main study that people seem to be citing is including donations to the religion itself as "charitable", which may be somewhat disingenuous, as that money isn't necessarily going toward the poor or needy (but some of it could be).

Need to get back to work, so I can't dig into this in detail, but this [[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/11/28/are-religious-people-really-more-generous-than-atheists-a-new-study-puts-that-myth-to-rest/][article]] has an analysis. Not saying that article is going to be a perfect view, either, it's just interesting.
