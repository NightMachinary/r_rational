But HPMOR also showed that people dont really act like they believe in an afterlife - they are sad when their loved ones die, no-one does mercy killing on the senior Longbottoms etc.

So that argument doesnt hold up. HPMOR also argued that its motivated reasoning to deal with the terribe reality that is death, IIRC, which strikes me as the much more reasonable explanation.
