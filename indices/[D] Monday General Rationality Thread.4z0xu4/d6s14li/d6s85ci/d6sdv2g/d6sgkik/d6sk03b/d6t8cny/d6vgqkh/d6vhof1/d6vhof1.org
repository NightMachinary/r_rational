Yeah, when it gets right down to it, the hard part about evaluating claims of divine revelation, at least in terms of how they're observed by the recipient, is that we genuinely don't understand enough about neuroscience, mental illness, and cognitive science to actually evaluate the marginal probability of the evidence.

I mean, God being God, He could find some very evidentially clear way to make Himself heard /if he really wanted to/, so I continue to range my religious opinion between "there are no gods" and "the gods are mysterian dickwad philosophy sophomores who deliberately spite our everyday reasoning about evidence and likelihood".
