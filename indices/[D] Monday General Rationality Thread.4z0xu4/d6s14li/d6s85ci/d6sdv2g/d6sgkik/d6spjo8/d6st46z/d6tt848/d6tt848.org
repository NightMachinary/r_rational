I think there are two distinct groups of atheists here, which may be causing some confusion.

One group, who you see a lot of on the internet, are often people who have always been atheists. They have never had religious experiences or felt the touch or voice of God, for the most part. Some never have any spiritual experiences. When they do have spiritual experiences, they don't attribute it to God. We all know this group.

Another group, who you may see on the internet as well, were once theists and believed in God. Some former theists haven't ever felt the voice of God, and so basically belong in the group above. However, many of them have had religious experiences, or felt the grace or voice of God. For example, the youtuber Evid3nc3 details his experience going from being very religious to being an atheist, and talks about hearing the voice of God in his autobiographical videos [[https://youtu.be/V-q8WZ1Ibso?t=1m20s][(link)]]. I have some friends who fall into this group, who spoke in tongues and felt the touch of the Lord on their souls, and still became atheists later, even if they felt these religious experiences from time to time.

Believe it or not, there are many formerly religious people who are like this; they tell stories about past religious experiences that sound /quite a bit/ like the stories about religious experiences that religious people tell. It's hard to say that all these formerly religious atheists are lying when they tell stories about religious experiences that sound the exact same as what religious people say. Although there are tons of atheists who don't understand faith, many others spent quite a lot of their lives being earnestly and truly religious. I also know former theists who never /really/ believed-- often because they never had religious experiences or felt the voice of God--but this is not true for all atheist converts, perhaps not even for most.

I do agree that in the past, people who became atheist, whether they had once felt God or not, would be unlikely to say they were atheist out loud compared to today.
