My personal theory is that atheism always existed, but wasn't publicly accepted in western culture until recently so those who didn't believe kept quiet. I'm curious about atheists who can claim to have once believed, but no longer do, since it was my hypothesis that they never actually believed. It was because of rationality, and it's preponderance of atheists, that I adopted such a belief since I frequently got the impression that atheists didn't understand faith and probably couldn't. If that is false, then I'd definitely like to know.

In my case, education did not impact my religious experiences, it simply defied my mental model that explained them. As a practitioner of New Age, I was distraught when I discovered how many of my beliefs were based on bad science, paranormal hoaxes, and the statements of people who were more likely to be deceptive than earnest. However, none of that stopped my religious experiences from occurring, it just left me very confused as to how and why they were.
