I didn't say it was rational to feel the way that I do, just that it is the way that I feel and I have difficulty feeling differently because it is the way I have always felt. I admire HJPEV's goals and his resolve in pursuing them, but I have accepted death as inevitable and sometimes even admirable even if I support the extension of life.

In his sequences, Yudkowsky talked about how rationalists shouldn't think of religious or spiritual ideas any differently from the scientific and material world, but I think atheists don't understand religious belief because they've never felt it. I've heard of evidence that (a)theism may be genetic, and I am inclined to believe that is the case.
