I like the way HPMOR explained this, people who believe in an afterlife have a different view of mortality than people who think life ends with death. I believe that my conscious experience will continue, if not improve, after my death. Perhaps this allows my to perceive death as an acceptable part of existence rather than an obstacle to be overcome, but I can't know for sure since I can't cease to follow my belief system.
