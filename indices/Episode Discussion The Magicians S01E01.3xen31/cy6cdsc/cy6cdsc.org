I am a new to The Magicians universe completely, having started with the pilot and never having read the books, though I am now very interested.

As such I have no prejudices, and I have to say I really enjoyed the pilot. I see some people complaining about having aged the characters up, but I actually think the idea of a graduate school version of Hogwarts is really interesting though. I saw theirs ages as a feature rather than a flaw. This also may be influenced by the fact that I'm the same age as the protagonists. I think treating magic as a graduate level area of study makes a lot of sense.

It was exciting, and introduced a lot of interesting elements. I loved all the characters.
