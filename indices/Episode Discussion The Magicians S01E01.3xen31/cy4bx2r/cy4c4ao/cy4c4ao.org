I think it must have been a real challenge for whoever wrote the script, because the number one complaint about the first book is that the primary protagonist is depressing and unlikeable. That was one of the things that I loved about the books, because the character was rendered so well and I could relate to him so strongly.

But if you put a depressing and unlikeable character front and center without much magic, a large number of people are going to get to the end of the episode and just think, "I'm not sure I'd care if he dies".
