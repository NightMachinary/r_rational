My feelings are the opposite of yours here. I loved the setting in the books but hated the characters and their childishness so I love the fact that this adaptation is trying to age them a bit more. I don't like kids and find the standard coming of age narrative that focuses on the concerns of children annoying and trivial.

Also, as someone that uses to suffer from depression as an adolescent but has been healthy since, all whiny sadsack characters do is remind me of how much my teenage years sucked and how much time energy I spent obsessing over stupid crap that does not matter. I certainly don't want to relate to characters that constantly remind me of how screwed up I used to be.
