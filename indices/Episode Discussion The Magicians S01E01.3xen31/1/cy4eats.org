/The Magicians/ got itself a TV adaptation?

I don't even know how I feel about it. To me, that story was not only unique and memorable but also very easy to hate. Things like the structure of the second book, the revelation about what happened to the girl, and the way it all felt like a commercialised Narnia fanfic made difficult taking it seriously --- the moment you tried criticizing it as a standalone work, it started crumbling apart.

What made this story special to me, in contrast to all these drawbacks, was Quentin's inner monologue, which demonstrated how even the most beautiful environments provided or most unique chances given can be poisoned when the observing mind itself is depressed or unhealthy. That, and the scene where they accidentally summoned a God that routinely devoured one of his classmates.

These were the things that felt very real about this story; and such an effect should be very difficult to achieve through the medium of television. I haven't seen the pilot yet, but I think it's going to be like the ecranisation of Ender's Game.
