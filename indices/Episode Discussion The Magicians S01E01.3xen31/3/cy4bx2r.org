As most people who reviewed the pilot said, it felt rushed. We are thrust very quickly into the events without much character development along the way. As a result, I didn't find myself very attached to the people in the story -- if the altercation which marks the end of the first episode were to kill off most of the main characters, I'm not sure I could bring myself to care all that much at this point. Hopefully future episodes will flesh them out more.

I think this can be an issue for a lot of fantasy-themed writing generally -- its very easy to lose yourself in "Isn't Magic Cool?" -- and forget that truly memorable stories are, at heart, about people and their relation to each other.
