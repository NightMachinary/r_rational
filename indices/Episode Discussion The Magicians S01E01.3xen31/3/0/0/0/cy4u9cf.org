  I don't like kids and find the standard coming of age narrative that focuses on the concerns of children annoying and trivial.

If you're talking about the Chatwins, they're a /subversion/ of the standard coming of age story.

[[#s][Major spoilers for The Magician's Land (and presumably the series as well)]]

Needless to say, this doesn't work if Martin Chatwin is a veteran of the first World War, as he appears to be in the pilot episode.

(Quentin and the others only seem to have been aged up a small number of years, making Brakebills into the equivalent of grad school instead of college. But that's less important, because the story was always supposed to be about people who already should have "come of age".)
