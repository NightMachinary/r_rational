The books were almost entirely defined by the theme of growing up and I'm a little bit worried that the show is already missing that. The Chatwin children were aged up by a large amount, making them into young adults instead, which bugs me to no end. The whole thrust of the first book (and arguably the series) is about the bridge between childhood and adulthood, the endless disappointment of adult life after the promises of childhood fiction. If you age up the Chatwin children you're changing a large part of what the series was about and incidentally removing some of my favorite moments.

I also think the Fillory reveal is going too fast, which means that they're missing more of the thematic elements that made me love the books; Quentin lacking purpose and drifting through life even after discovering magic was /the point/. Making him a clear and obvious chosen one just shits all over that.

That said the pilot episode was better than I expected from Syfy, and for all I disliked some of the changes to one of my favorite series, maybe the show can do its own thing.
