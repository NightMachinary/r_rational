My initial back-of-the-envelope math told me that the energy release from 4096 atm suddenly decompressing would be enormous. Enough to launch cannon balls at suborbital velocities.

Also, a magic item that created tiny balls of shrunken air would probably allow for selling them at arbitrarily low prices. Since D&D/Pathfinder magic items have no maintenance and in this case, the units would have no material cost the marginal cost of the compressed airballs would be zero.
