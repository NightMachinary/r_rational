The rules do not specify how rapidly the item is shrunk, or how rapidly it returns to normal size. At most, I could see a DM justifying a 3 second shrink/expansion time. That gives you your standard action to cast the spell, shrink something, and then pick it up with a move action. Obviously, this still means that any shrunken object placed inside of a sealed container will create a bomb, but at least it's not a bomb of unspecified and potentially infinite magnitude.

Assume that the volume and mass increases linearly over 3 seconds, so you're adding about 41 cubic feet of gas at standard temperature and pressure per second. You should now be able to work out your options in terms of exploiting a contained, pressurized gas system.
