Of course shrink item cannot actually work like this. If it did, the spell would be called "fireball" instead, because that would be the observable effect.

I mean, if you are trying to create an explosion by magically compressing something, why restrict yourself to gasses? Water is usually modeled as incompressible because the energy required to compress it even a little bit is well beyond the scales that typically show up.

Going to extremes, Osmium has a Young's modulus of about 500GPa, which if I understand correctly, means that if you shrink it to substantially less than it's usual size, it should be at about 500GPa of pressure (of course it becomes non-linear at some point, so this is a crappy approximation). This means that the total energy of decompression is about 500 GPa/2 ft^{3} ~ 2.8/10^{10} J, or about 5 tons of TNT, which I guess is a pretty large bomb.

But the point is that if shrink item actually worked like this, you would get a similar result from shrinking basically /any/ solid item.
