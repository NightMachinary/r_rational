Thanks for the help. I actually don't know the math that we'll and have been using Google to try to piece together the answer. The story I'm working on isn't the usual "person from our world with a scientific background gets access to magic" but more of a Leonardo da Vinci type who is experimenting without any prior knowlege.

He starts this experimentation when his son shoots a spit ball at him through a reed. As far as compressing non-gasses I'm wondering what the magical interactions might be. For instance Enlarge Person states that if there isn't enough room for the targets new form, than nothing happens. But there's (essentially) ALWAYS room for a gas. I'm basically assuming the spell itself can't perform work outside of what it's already doing.
