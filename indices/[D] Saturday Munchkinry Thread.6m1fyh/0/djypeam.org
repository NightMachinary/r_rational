So, I think I've found the /one/ Shrink Item abuse that hasn't been explored before. It should be possible to shrink down a 5-foot cube of air into a clothlike form that is effectively under 4096 atmospheres of pressure.

I've been trying to do the math, but not being an engineer, I haven't been able to determine if a D&D style world would be able to produce a system capable of utilizing that much pressure.

So would pneumatic cannons be feasible? Would you have to make them out of adamantine? You could probably bleed off some of that pressure so your materials could handle it, but how much would you have left.

Lastly, if you created magic items that produced tiny balls of shrunken air at various equivalent pressures, what technologies could you create using this as a power source?
