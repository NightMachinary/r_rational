It's been forever since I read animorphs, and I never really got into it so correct me if I'm wrong on the details.

IIRC, the main enemy in animorphs are alien worms, which are utterly blind and helpless and easily killed. Yet when they crawl into people's ears, they can mind control them.

So it occurs to me that the simplest solution is to just destroy everyone's ears. Or put poison in them to kill any worms that enter. You would need to capture a lot of alien worms to experiment with so you figure out what poisons kill them but not humans, but that shouldn't be too hard. Test biological poisons that hurt alien worms but not humans, then morph into the animal species that produce those poisons, produce them en masse. Then put them into people's ears, by force if you have to. Or stealthily, using small insects to carry those poisons into their ears.

Or better yet, the MCs can also morph into the alien worms iirc, so just take over the people in power and then mind control them to pass laws forcing people to stuff their ears with anti-alien poisons. Or just chop them off and cauterize the wounds.

Yes, you may lose your sense of hearing, but now you're immune to mind control, and so the aliens are now screwed.

Then again, if the aliens had even the slightest amount of intelligence, they wouldn't keep being foiled by a few teenagers who barely even leave their country. (Cause you know, you could just mind control the world leaders that aren't being guarded by the teenage MCs. Fire nukes at MCs, no more animorph resistance.)
