So the Yeerks have basically already won, and humanity is practically livestock? With shepherds hidden among the herd to make sure that the human farm is operating smoothly? And if the Yeerks start taking too many losses they can simply wipe out humanity at any time with their planet destroyers? Wow that's bleak. What are the MCs even trying to do here? And how the heck are they still happily enjoying their teenage romance/drama when the situation is this bad?

Hell, given the odds, it might be better for the MCs to be the ones triggering thermonuclear war. Or hijacking a planet destroyer. At least with the human farm destroyed, other alien races in the universe would have a slightly better chance of surviving a Yeerk invasion.
