Again, I'm really missing out on a lot of the details here. If the books have given answers for why these ideas don't work, you can just say so, no need to be rude.

Let me explain my thought process here. First, my assumptions:

1) Humanity is under attack from a species called Yeerks. 2) Yeerks in their basic form are helpless creatures. Utterly defenseless little worms that can be easily killed in all kinds of ways. 3) The Yeerks' main method of attack is to mind control humans, which requires them to crawl into a human's ear. Hence humans with destroyed ears cannot be mind controlled. 4) The Yeerks' technology is not significantly better than human technology (otherwise, humanity should already be destroyed). 5) The Yeerks are not omniscient, they need time to learn about humanity (including our technologies), from their mind controlled hosts.

With these assumptions in mind, I first considered the Yeerk perspective. What is the most effective way to beat humanity? Well, that seems pretty straightforward to me: mind control the people in charge of firing nukes. Fire nukes. BOOM. Humanity crippled by nuclear war, Yeerks now move in and swallow up the remnants of human society, too feeble now to mount any resistance against the Yeerk invasion.

Why hasn't this happened yet? I assume it's because the Yeerks simply haven't figured out nukes yet. But they could do so any moment now, and once they do... BOOM.

Now I consider the human perspective. Since the Yeerks' best move is to trigger a nuclear war, as soon as they learn about nukes, humanity's best move should be stopping that. How? By making absolutely sure that the people in charge of firing nukes don't get mind controlled. This needs to happen ASAP, before the Yeerks learn about nukes. Well, how can we do that?

Simple solution: Destroy everyone's ears. Cut them off and cauterize them. Yes, we will probably become deaf as a result, but that's an acceptable sacrifice compared to the alternative of nuclear war. Being deaf does not make one "completely fucking useless". We DO have a written language to communicate with, not just audio languages. There are plenty of deaf people around that are still productive members of society capable of doing all kinds of jobs.

Plus, once you have ensured that humanity can no longer be mind controlled, you now have a large human force with a very good understanding of their own human technologies, vs a relatively small amount of infected humans with still rudimentary understanding of human technologies, and a bunch of helpless Yeerks with no more human hosts to infect. So humanity becomes pretty much guaranteed to win the war. All for the relatively cheap price of our sense of hearing.
