I see.

There are a few flaws in your plan with the understanding you already have (it's more effective to safeguard the nuke system than to go on a massive impossible project, how would Yeerks take guarded humans with nuclear codes anyways if they're helpless) but yes, the Yeerks already have alien hosts and planet destroying spaceships.

Although you were right, there was absolutely no need for me to be rude.
