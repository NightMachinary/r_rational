It's been a while since I've read the books as well. But, to answer a few of your points:

- Yes, Yeerk technology /is/ ahead of Human technology. /Way/ ahead. In fact, if they wanted to obliterate every human on the planet and boil the seas for a thousand years, they could. But they don't want to, because there is one thing that they want from this planet; human host bodies. Human host bodies in /staggering/ quantity, in order to win another war with another alien race.

- The Yeerks already have a lot of the people in power. Maybe not Presidents - but they have near-total control over the media (which they use to make sure that news of their invasion doesn't get out) and plenty of other, apparently harmless people, including loads of police officers. Again, if they wanted to turn this planet into a ball of radioactive slag, they /already/ have that capability. (If anyone went around cutting off people's ears, he'd find himself quickly hunted down by the police and hauled off to jail)

- The Yeerks don't require a complete ear. Just access to the ear canal. Cutting off the ear won't help.
