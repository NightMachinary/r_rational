Assuming it's the same mechanism as in the books, it's analogous to an allergy. Most people have zero, but some people have one or more (I don't recall the term the books used, so let's call them) "morph allergies". When you acquire a morph you are allergic to, the mechanism you use to morph freaks out as described above eventually spawning a clone of the morph in an attempt to (if I recall the books correctly) expunge the DNA that you're allergic to. I don't recall exactly how specific the allergy is (that specific alligator, any of its family, alligators as a species, etc) but it's specific enough that you can't prompt "allergic reactions" for arbitrary morphs. There is no guarantee that the other animorphs will have an allergy at all, let alone one you could eventually discover, or a useful one. Rachel can probably create an unlimited number of alligators, assuming she's willing to go through the whole unpleasant process each time, including risking her life when an adult alligator appears in close proximity to her.
