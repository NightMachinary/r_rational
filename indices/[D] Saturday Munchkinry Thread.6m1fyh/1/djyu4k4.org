OK guys, indulge me here:

In Animorphs, Rachel morphs an alligator and then all of a sudden she starts morphing at random, out-of-control times and in out of control ways (e.g. she'll be a half-elephant half-wolf monstrosity). This culminates in her essentially having a /full size, live alligator/ bud off of her body like she's a yeast or something.

According to the author, Animorphs: The Reckoning won't include this in its plot. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to work out how a rational animorphs team could use Rachel's "condition" in an advantageous way. I'm not sure there's much use for it, but I know you lot are as crafty as they come.
