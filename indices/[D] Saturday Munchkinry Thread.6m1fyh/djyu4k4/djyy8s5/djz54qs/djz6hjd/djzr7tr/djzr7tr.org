There are several flaws in your base assumptions, which means most of your conclusions you derive from them are wrong, even if they're based on sound logic.

1) The Yeerks primary goal is to enslave humanity, not destroy them. Yeerks are weak and helpless without hosts, so they go around conquering other species in order to have more bodies so that every Yeerk can have their own. They could wipe out 99% of humans and then slowly allow the humans to repopulate, but they're confident enough that they're winning anyway, and probably saving that as a last resort.

2) The government, and pretty much all humans do not know that the Yeerks exist, aside from said 6 teenagers. The teenagers do not have the ability to convince or force all humans to destroy their ears, and they do not know who in the government is already being controlled that they could go to. Doing mind control themselves is also hindered by the fact that they cannot stay morphed as something for more than two hours in a row or they get stuck as that permanently and lose the ability to morph. They do mind control people at some point in the story, but only for short tasks and afterwards they have to leave and the person is aware they've been mind controlled.

3)The Yeerks have advanced technology, laser beams and space ships and stuff. I'm sure they know how nukes work. But don't use them for reasons 1) and 4)

4) The Yeerks do not know that they are being harassed by teenage humans. The beings who invented morphing abilities are Andalites with advanced technology and combat skills and have been at war with the Yeerks for a long time. The Yeerks believe the animorphs are a strike team of Andalites, and presumably have some sort of hidden base and space ships and a large backup force somewhere. The animorphs try very hard to stay stealthy and maintain this misunderstanding for most of the series. The Yeerks can't nuke them because they don't know where they live or if they're even on Earth.

There are plenty of irrational things going on in the series, but for the most part your solutions don't work for either side. The animorphs lack manpower, and can't act openly because they are being stealthy and can't trust anyone who might be mind controlled. The Yeerks lack information about the animorphs, and are also being stealthy and are hiding from humanity.
