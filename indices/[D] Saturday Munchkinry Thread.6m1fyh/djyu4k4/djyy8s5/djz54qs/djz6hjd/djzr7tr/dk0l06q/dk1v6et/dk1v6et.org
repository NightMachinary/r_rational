It's been a while, so I don't remember why the Yeerks are moving so slowly, but as far as I can recall, they don't have like all of the leaders of the governments controlled yet, just some high ranking members and various people scattered around here and there. The war isn't quite lost yet, but basically humanity is in the process of being infiltrated and has no idea and will lose without a fight if nothing changes.

I think part of it is that the main force is out in other parts of space waging war against the Andalites so this is more of a side objective setting up as an investment to create more war potential. Presumably their planet destroyers are all busy in the war, but if the humans did all rise up against them then perhaps might spare one for little old Earth. The MCs are trying to save Earth and the humans, I don't think they're selfless enough to sacrifice Earth if they think they can save it. Which, come one, they're teenagers AND they have superpowers, of course they think they can save it.

The excuse for them enjoying their teenage romance/drama is that they have to pretend to be unaware so that the Yeerks don't realize the guerilla force harassing them are actually humans and decide to nuke their city. There are infested humans around, including the brother of one MC. The Yeerks are somewhat oblivious, but if all six of them vanished to go make a war base and a police investigation occurred the Yeerks might finally put two and two together.
