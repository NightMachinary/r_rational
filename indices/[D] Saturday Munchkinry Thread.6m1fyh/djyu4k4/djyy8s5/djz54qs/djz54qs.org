... This is the worst post in this thread I've ever read oh my god

A) Even if this were a good idea, by what mechanism would the Animorphs /convince the population of Earth to cut off their ears/? Even if they could, future children would still have ears that could be taken advantage of, and the Yeerks could breed clones from DNA samples to make pristine humans. And if humans somehow managed to render themselves completely fucking useless, the Yeerks would just destroy the planet.

B) The Yeerks have a huge headstart in resources, manpower, and time. They can kidnap "people in power" and impersonate them far more effectively than the Animorphs can and would easily win in any such battle of intrigue.

C) If you could discover a poison that kills only Yeerks and is safe to be applied to the inside of human ears, that's great. But even if you can design such a substance, you have to distribute it to an impossible number of humans and even /then/, Yeerks can just sanitize hosts' ears before entering.

D) I reread your post, apparently your suggested mechanisms are /forcibly/ poisoning people's ears or using /stealthy insects/ to deliver the poison. Genius.
