Hmm... I get something different.

Released energy is the integral of pdV, right? Unfortunately, p scales like 1/V. So we really have the integral from 2ft^{3/4096} to 2ft^{3} of 1atm /V dV. But the dV/V integrates to a log(4096), which isn't all that large. My calculation puts the total energy at

1 atm*2ft^{3} * log(4096), which Google tells me is about 47kJ, or about the energy of 10 grams of TNT, which is a bit more than whatever this page calls a heavy firearm: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy]].

Also, as for cost, you need a 5th level or higher wizard to cast the spell, and they will only get a couple castings a day. Training a wizard is expensive, and since there are relatively few of them (and a lot of other uses for their spell slots), it may well end up being pretty expensive. I mean maybe the marginal cost is 0 in some sense, but the opportunity cost is large, as is the cost of the initial investment.
