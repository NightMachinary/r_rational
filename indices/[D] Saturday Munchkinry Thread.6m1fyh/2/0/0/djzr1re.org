  What if some person "knows" the wrong answer to a question I ask?
#+end_quote

I assume it's some sort of "view from nowhere" and not dependent on what people who are wrong on facts like Napoleon being alive thing. Far more subjective facts may fall in the range of "no clear answer"

#+begin_quote
  What if two people are convinced of respectively a mathematical fact like P=NP and its negation?

Hm...this is where I don't know what the author means by "cannot be figured out by a non-Thinker". One could say that certain questions are just too hard? I dunno.

I assume you get the answer actually corresponding to the real world fact? Like, if you were in the past and there were strong arguments about heliocentrism or geocentrism you get the actual correct answer.

If there's a case where we have theoretical constructs that are both /kinda/ true...you're SOL?
