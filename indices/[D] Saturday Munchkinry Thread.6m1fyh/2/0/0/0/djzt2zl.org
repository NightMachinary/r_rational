If it doesn't pool the information of all alive non-Thinkers, there are many possible places the information comes from. Maybe it spawns a simulation where you're mastered into trying to find the answer, and reports your findings. Whatever it ends up being should be something the Entities can do.

Depending on what "cannot be figured out by a non-Thinker" means, you could ask "What answer to this question will most satisfy my values?" and output 5 bits of Simurgh-Song a day. You could write the corresponding ASCII text down and see if it has any advice, if that's the best way the power finds to influence the world for the better. For example, if it says "ZIP" in the first 5 days then that might be a hint to compress large bodies of english text, then use the compression header to uncompress further bits. If it says "STOP", that's the poor guy trying to tell me he's not a Simurgh :P
