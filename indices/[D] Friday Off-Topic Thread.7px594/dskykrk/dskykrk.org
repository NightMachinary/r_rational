I've started taking melatonin to help me sleep better. It's definitely working, but has a side effect of weird and awesome dreams. The most notable one, that made me want to post here, featured Malicia and Cat standing in my childhood bedroom, whereupon Malicia /ripped out and devoured her own heart/. Somehow, while I watched this most metal scene, I was aware that the heart devouring was an issue of Ethics, which is not really a word to pair with either character. So, that was fun.

But double thumbs up recommendation on the melatonin, if anyone else is the sort of person to toss and turn until 2AM.
