Depends on what happens to what was previously the future after a time travel event, on whether or not 'possible futures' exist in any meaningful sense, and on the restrictions around the use of an assumed possible-but-not-necessarily-easy-to-use ability to time travel.

If the outcome of any time travel event effectively creates a new timeline separate from the old, the old timeline never sees any of the effects. The terminator fanfiction Branches on the Tree of Time follows this.

If time travel is possible, but only as far back as the invention of the first time machine, then the point in time the AI can show up is limited to be the earliest time any civilization invented time travel plus the duration of travel necessary to reach somewhere from that civilization.
