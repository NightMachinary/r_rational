I wrote a story kinda like this. I tried to make it Rational (the main character is not sciency enough for it to be full-blown Rationalist), but I'm pretty sure I failed, especially toward the end.

It's a setting with physical gods and the like, which is the only reason it lasted beyond part 1. We're talking more Zeus than YHWH (what would Zeus do about a time-traveling AI, anyway?). So it's more fantasy in the vein of /Star Wars/ than anything.
