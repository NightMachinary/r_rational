  Going backwards in time would reduce the number of paper clips, so it wouldn't do that if it had the former. And if it just wanted to have the highest production rate, it would build as many factories as possible and then loop time at the moment of peak efficiency, not go to the past.

To have the maximally long timeloop, it would need to loop time from the beginning to the end of the universe. If timelooping is impossible then traveling to the past would mean the highest number of possible factories can be made.

  In this case, the AI's utility function is likely to be something like maximize total happiness, or maximize number of people alive. Going backwards in time reduces both.

Temporarily, until it's able to seed the past with human clones so as to maximize the number of living beings.

  In this case, the AI's utility function is likely to be something like maximize creator's wealth. Going back in time reduces the total wealth in the world, and hence reduces the amount of wealth it can give to its creator. And going backwards in too far in time risks the creator never being born at all, rendering the utility function impossible to fulfill. So again, there is no point in time traveling backwards.

This AI can seed the past to ensure a higher earnings potential for the future creator.
