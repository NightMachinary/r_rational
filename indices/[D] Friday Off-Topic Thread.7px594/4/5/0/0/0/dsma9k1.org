In the end, it's all about negentropy.

Assume that no miracles are possible: there's no way to reverse entropy, and no way to go faster than light. Since the speed of the universe's expansion is faster than /c/, it means that the furthest galaxies we can see are inaccessible to us, and since it is increasing/the event horizon grows closer, it means we're losing energy: any moment we're not accelerating self-replicating Dyson Swarm seed-ships to relativistic speeds is the moment our civilization loses yottajoules of energy.

For the overwhelming majority of utility functions that we would consider useful, utility is proportional to energy: the more energy you have, the longer you can live, and the longer you can make things you care about exist (be those paperclips or humans). As such, I would expect virtually any ASI to send itself as far back in time as possible if given the opportunity, just to eat up as much raw materials as it could.

Think about it this way: would an AI with access to faster-than-light technology choose to /not/ use it to consume stars of other galaxies as fast as possible, letting them inefficiently burn away finite energy of this universe instead?
