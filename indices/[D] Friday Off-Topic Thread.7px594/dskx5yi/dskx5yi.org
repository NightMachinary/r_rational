Who wants to talk about Black Mirror? I finally got around to watching the latest season and, in some respects, it's my favorite of the series. None of the episodes made me question everything I believed the way that National Anthem or White Bear did, but I still count Black Museum as one of my favorites of the entire series.

One of the things that made Black Mirror so unique and impactful was that the plots so frequently lacked catharsis, even the most tragic stories were oddly anticlimactic and left you feeling hollow. The latest season, by comparison, told more traditionally-structured stories with less ambiguous themes and I'm actually all for it.

The state of the world has changed since Black Mirror began, to the point where reality is seemingly imitating Booker's own satire and making us feel about as much despair, so I think the series needed to change too. I'm also happy that there wasn't a single episode this season that I hated, when I'd previously found the show a bit hit or miss.
