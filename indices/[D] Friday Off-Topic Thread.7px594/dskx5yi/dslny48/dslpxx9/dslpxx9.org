I'm okay with more happy endings because I feel crushing despair every day, so it's nice to get some hope from someplace I didn't expect. Most of the episodes this season I found to be just okay, but there were things about each one that I enjoyed and I can see how they'd resonate with certain people.

Metalhead was definitely my least favorite of the season too. It's perfectly okay as a thriller, the problem is that it's /just/ a thriller and that's not what I want from this series. I like the fan theory that the robots are actually cookies gone rogue, but that was never even hinted at in the show.
