Metalhead was one of my favourite episodes this season, not because of the plot but because I can't stop thinking about what it'd be like to live in that world. Like, what was playing on the TV when the person in the house shot themselves? How suddenly did the dogs take over? Are other nations okay?

I relate this episode a lot to that passage in Meditations on Moloch about 'in the end Moloch may ask one final sacrifice from us'. I imagine the world is the aftermath of a war where both sides used autonomous killing machines on the other, each successful in their annihilation. This is a world where Moloch /has/ taken sentience.
