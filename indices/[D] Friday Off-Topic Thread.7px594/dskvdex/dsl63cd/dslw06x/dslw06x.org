  On a side note a great side effect/prerequisite is improved dream memory retention, and if anyone wants to try it, this might just be worth it by itself, because some dreams are like super awesome action movies with incredible full immersion special effects in absolutely fantastic environments and cracky plot.

Yes, this. The most annoying failure of the past year is that I stopped writing these down, when I'd been keeping record since first grade with minimal interruption.

I've found that full lucidity tends to kill dreams, even if I don't wake up almost immediately thereafter. As in, there are no people or events if I'm paying too much attention to my mind for them to happen. So the most successful bouts of lucidity were more brief, and targeted toward correcting one big problem so the dream could continue normally.

The best example I can think of is one where I noticed the dream, and realized I was about to wake up, so I tried a technique I'd read about to keep it going long enough to resolve the plot (I was in a mansion and the army came in and killed everyone and I was trying to survive/drive them out, whatever). In this case, I focused visually on details to keep the setting stable, and audibly, played through the most appropriate song I could think of on short notice, until I was confident that the dream was back in full.

One thing I found that helped once or twice when I was too lucid for anything to happen was opening a portal to somewhere else. This works only if I have just enough to expect from going through it for the dream to build on. I've tried it without anything in mind other than "this dream is stalling; let's open a Gateway", and nothing happened.

Basically, lucidity is like cheat codes. if you find yourself trapped in a shrinking elevator, remember how dreams work and scene-shift out of there, but if you leave debug mode on too long, you're not really playing anymore, unless you have a plan and the skill to execute it.
