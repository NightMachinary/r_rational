I post on several forums (and posted on plenty more), especially Sufficient Velocity's quests. It's what I mean by speaking to the ocean- people speak about one topic, even replying to one another, but there is just never a personal connection. Also it's just often harder to remember who said what. (Text from PersonA looks just like text from PersonB. There are no voices.)

Even with friends, text... it creates a lot of room for imagination, mostly the bad kind. If they don't respond fast enough- did I offend them? Am I boring them? Am I doing anything right? Are they honest about anything they say? It's so easy to edit out your initial angry outburst and replace it with something else, and... it's just inferior. Not completely useless, but inferior to a face-to-face conversation. After all, you cut away near entirety of non-verbal communication. Also, it's... just more tiring, typing just to read more words.

I mean, take /this/ very conversation. Reading, considering my response, typing all that out, posting, deleting the response to make adjustments, constantly editing, then considering what I did wrong (once you respond, or /not/). It's especially potent here, since the only things I /can/ see is the response, like/dislike from /someone/, and response time- all of them are a potential source of worry.... it's *TIRING*, time consuming and not really fun, even if it (partially) fulfills that craving for socialization. I mean, /compare/ it to how it would go in a spoken conversation. A world of difference, and far less time spent.

There are probably hundreds of things I am doing wrong, and I do sound petty, but... there's only so much I care to try before it's too bothersome and I come back to comfortable isolation and doing nothing of value (solving the second problem did not solve the first... not above small-talk, anyway).

(Also I may try the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discord though. Discords I did try were too big for anything to happen through them, but this one may be different.).
