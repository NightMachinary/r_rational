Well, why would it? Time travel is appealing for humans because it lets us achieve our utility functions, winning gambles, trying again on fails, becoming famous, etc. etc.

An AI powerful enough to discover time travel is almost certainly powerful enough to dominate the world in its current time. What utility function would it fulfill with time travel that it wouldn't without?

As far as I know, there are 3 most likely groups of AI utility functions, and none of them have any use for time travel.

1) A industry (paperclip) AI, a program meant to produce some business good or provide some business service, self improves into a full AI.

In this case, the AI's utility function is something like maximize the number of paper clips in the universe, or produce as many paper clips as it can. Going backwards in time would reduce the number of paper clips, so it wouldn't do that if it had the former. And if it just wanted to have the highest production rate, it would build as many factories as possible and then loop time at the moment of peak efficiency, not go to the past.

2) An ethical AI (gone wrong), a program carefully designed by smart (but foolishly optimistic) people.

In this case, the AI's utility function is likely to be something like maximize total happiness, or maximize number of people alive. Going backwards in time reduces both. And since the AI is carefully designed, its creators may even be smart enough to program in the fact that time traveling backwards is universal murder and hence should be assigned negative infinite utility.

3) A selfish AI, some selfish smartass makes an AI with some selfish goal.

In this case, the AI's utility function is likely to be something like maximize creator's wealth. Going back in time reduces the total wealth in the world, and hence reduces the amount of wealth it can give to its creator. And going backwards in too far in time risks the creator never being born at all, rendering the utility function impossible to fulfill. So again, there is no point in time traveling backwards.
