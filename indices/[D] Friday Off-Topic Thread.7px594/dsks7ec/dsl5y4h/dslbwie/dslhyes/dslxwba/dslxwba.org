  Why would it need a maximally long timeloop though? That's only necessary if the limiting factor on the number of factories is building time, which seems rather unlikely. It would almost certainly run out of stuff to build factories out of before it runs out of time. And if it can send stuff back in time it could just send the factories too.

  Also, doesn't the ability to travel to the past mean that time looping is possible by definition?

Fair points.

  Why would an AI choose alternative 2? That will almost certainly result in a smaller number of people for the same amount of time/effort.
#+end_quote

The AI would start with less people in the past but it would have time to play catch-up and thereby perhaps exceed the number of people it would've had to start with otherwise.

  asteroid mining

Well for example with asteroid mining in particular it's pretty obvious that the farther back an AI goes the more asteroids it can get for its creator.
