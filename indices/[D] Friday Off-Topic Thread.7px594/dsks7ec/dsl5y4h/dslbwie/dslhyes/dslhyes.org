  To have the maximally long timeloop, it would need to loop time from the beginning to the end of the universe. If timelooping is impossible then traveling to the past would mean the highest number of possible factories can be made.

Why would it need a maximally long timeloop though? That's only necessary if the limiting factor on the number of factories is building time, which seems rather unlikely. It would almost certainly run out of stuff to build factories out of before it runs out of time. And if it can send stuff back in time it could just send the factories too.

Also, doesn't the ability to travel to the past mean that time looping is possible by definition?

  Temporarily, until it's able to seed the past with human clones so as to maximize the number of living beings.

Let's compare two alternatives.

Alternative 1: Starting from it's time of creation, spend X time to multiply the population of 10 billionish people by a factor of Y.

Alternative 2: Time travel back thousands of years, spend X time to multiply the population of 1000 people by a factor of Y.

Why would an AI choose alternative 2? That will almost certainly result in a smaller number of people for the same amount of time/effort. Actually even more time and effort since back in the past humans haven't extracted the resources from the earth or built extraction/manufacturing tools yet, so the AI would be forced to do those things first before it can construct the technologies it needs.

  This AI can seed the past to ensure a higher earnings potential for the future creator.
#+end_quote

But why would it? The earnings potential of its creator, no matter how high, won't give its creator as much money as an AI could give its creator directly, via stock manipulation or asteroid mining or printing indistinguishable counterfeit money or just enslaving the rest of humanity to make them acknowledge that its creator has infinity dollars and owns everything. Its creator's earnings potential is utterly dwarfed in comparison to infinity dollars, so seeding the past to improve it really doesn't affect the AI's utility function in any meaningful way.
