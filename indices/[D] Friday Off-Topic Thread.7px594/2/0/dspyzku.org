I'm a bit disappointed by the latest season of Black Mirror. I prefer the more ambiguous themes and more general demonstration of how technology will affect our lives. Although I agree that with reality going through the looking glass, it might be good for Black Mirror to change.

My main complaint is that too many of the episodes in S03 deal with emulated minds, and I've read /The Age of Em/, which makes almost all of it fall flat. They're not exploiting the technology to the fullest.

Black History was fun, but still has the /Em/ problem. I like that they did an anthology again, but I feel that /White Christmas/ was woven more tightly together.
