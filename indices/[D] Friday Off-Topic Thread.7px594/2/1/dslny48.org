I was really disappointed with the season but Black Museum was so good it redeemed the entire season IMO.

I like the way that black mirror made me feel, and I didn't feel that way about a lot of the episodes this season (except Black Museum, which I felt in spades). For example, the episode with the "dogs" - it was just so completely pointless and the ending was trying to make it have a point but it just made the whole thing feel hollow and not in a good way.

That and there were too many "happy endings" for my taste.
