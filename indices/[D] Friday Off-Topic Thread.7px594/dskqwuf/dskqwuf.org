Every so often, I come across a job that I never would have thought existed, or never would have thought was feasible. For example, you can make a respectable amount of money by walking dogs. Pet masseuses are a thing, too, and there are enough people who sell handcrafted lightsabers that they have their own forum to talk shop in.

1) What are some jobs that you've come across, that are odd but not unique to one person?

2) There wouldn't happen to a subreddit or something that collects these things, would there? "Weird jobs" actually doesn't turn up as much useful material as you might think (and it feels like most of those articles are stealing half of their material from each other, anyway).
