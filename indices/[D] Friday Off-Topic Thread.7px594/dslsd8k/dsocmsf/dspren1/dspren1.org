What are you talking about? [[/r/relationships][r/relationships]] is great for sane, entry level advice. (especially stuff like "maybe don't stay with girl who keeps insulting you, punching you and cutting you off from your friends")

Higher level advice is a bit more hit and miss, but does happen too.
