Kidding. I would say look towards friends/family (specifically older people, not like 20 years older but 5 years older) that you know have been on the dating scene for a while. A mix of men/women would be preferred. Ask them their opinion on whatever you feel the need to, but keep your questions as consistent as possible. After a few rounds, compare the answers you've received and go with the ones that were recommended by multiple people.

E.g. If you talk to six friends/family members. One of them says you should try to get as muscular as possible. All of them say you should ask out more women and try to learn to deal with the possibility of being rejected. Your best bet is the latter piece of advice.
