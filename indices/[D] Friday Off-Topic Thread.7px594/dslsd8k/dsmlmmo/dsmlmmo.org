In what areas do you feel yourself deficient and in need of advice? What's useful for someone struggling to land a first date is different from what's useful for someone struggling to get a second is different from trying to keep the spark alive 10 dates in, etc. Is it a matter of you meeting lots of people and constantly getting rejected, meeting lots of people but never making it past the one-night-stand stage, never meeting anybody, meeting lots of people and failing to summon the confidence to ask them out, or what?
