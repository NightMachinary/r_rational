I have a huge podcast addiction. I'm going to avoid the obvious/popular ones since you might have heard of them already, but here's some I like that are coming off the top of my head right now:

- Uncivil (it's about the civil war... I'm not American and I find it fascinating, highly recommended)
- Rough Translation (a bunch of stories about things that happen in other countries, I don't know how to describe it, you just need to listen to it it's wonderful promise)
- More Perfect (about the US supreme court; ditto)
- The allusionist (about words and language)
- RHAP, if you like reality TV
- Oh no ross and carrie (hosts have great chemistry; they got and investigate various pseudosciences and report back. they even did scientology!)
- Food for thought (food / ethics podcast)
- Reply all (a podcast about the internet. huge favourite)
- The pitch (think shark tank but in podcast form. Very good)
- Really, Gimlet has a bunch of good ones so check them out
- Memory palace (short podcasts on a variety of topics. Very good.)
- Quick and dirty tips podcasts: whole bunch out there on a variety of topics
- Criminal (about crimes but it's "light").

If you really want I can grab my phone and list every single one I listen to. I listen to a lot of science/skeptic podcasts and true crime as well as the ones above.
