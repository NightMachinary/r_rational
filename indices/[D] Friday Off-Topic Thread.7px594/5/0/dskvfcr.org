My favorite podcast is The Mixed Six for its intellectual drunken discussions, My Brother My Brother and Me is my go-to comedy show (start with the first episode of this year), Trends Like These helps me keep up with the news, NPR Politics and On The Media bring me great analysis, Heathcare Triage is the one source that makes sense of healthcare politics, and Welcome to Night Vale has surreal humor mixed with cosmic horror.

I listen to a lot of RPG actual play podcasts as time filler because they tend to put out a lot of (long) episodes, so I'd be happy to recommend One Shot for comedy, Friends at the Table for drama, Role Playing Public Radio for horror, and The Adventure Zone for fun pulp fantasy that gets more emotional than it has any right to.
