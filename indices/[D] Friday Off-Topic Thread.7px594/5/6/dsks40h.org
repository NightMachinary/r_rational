Are we promoting subreddits? I don't subscribe to anything I moderate but bigger numbers next to the subscribe button on my subreddits make me feel more important. Also I think reddit would work better if lots of people quickly found out about alternatives to shittily moderated subreddits in [[/r/bettereddit]].
