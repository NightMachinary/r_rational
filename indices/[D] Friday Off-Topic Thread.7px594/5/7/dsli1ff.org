  I have 6-10 one-way commutes a week each 1.5 hours long that I need to fill with interesting podcasts, or phone conversations with interesting people (not interested in tons of heavy topics, more games/books/movies/life). Any recommendations or takers?

I might be open to phone conversations, but my schedule is being overhauled at the moment. What's your commute, and in what time zone?
