I strongly prefer season 1 of Stranger Things. Season 2's plot just wasn't as tight, it was all slow buildup, too little butter spread over too much bread, whereas season 1 had like a hundred different things happening each episode and the plot was constantly moving forward.

Babysitter!Steve was really the only thing I liked about season 2. Well, no, I liked Bob. And Noah Schnapp made great use of his increased screen time. Damnit. I loved (almost) every individual component of season 2 in spite of the fact that I was dissatisfied with season 2 as a whole, if that makes any sense.

My least favorite thing about season 2 was finding out what happened to Eleven at the end of season 1. That whole thing was built up as being, like, a big deal, almost like a [[#s][Spoiler]] or something, [[#s][Spoiler]], and then we find out that [[#s][Spoiler]].

There's also the fact that they resolved the love triangle at the end of the first season, but then not only reignited it in season 2 but added two additional ones (the blatant kids' one and the more subtle Hopper/Bob/Joyce one); and the fact that Joyce spends the whole season being concerned about Will again; and the fact that Joyce eccentrically covers the interior of her house with unconventional decor again; and the fact that they just took the monster from the first season and made it smaller and quadrupedal (which IRL would probably make the thing /more/ dangerous, not /less/) and had there be a bunch of them instead of just one (which counterintuitively makes them /less/ of a threat for some reason); and the fact that the monster escape happens because the Department of Energy Lab screwed up again; and the fact that the season ends with Eleven fixing everything by looking stern while holding out her hand like Neo again. Hell, they even rehashed the "Lucas not wanting Eleven to join the Party" through-line using Mike and Max.

Speaking of Max, what a waste of a character. The actress did a great job of /being/ that character, they just didn't give the character any reason to exist other than to give Lucas and Dustin their character arcs for the season. Is that a thing we still do with female characters in 2017? Also, what a downgrade for both of them. Season one started Lucas as a Doubting Thomas and then ended with him accepting Eleven, and Dustin's was more subtle but can be summed up with the D&D games that bookended the season where in episode 1 he urges Will to cast protection and in episode 8 he says "fireball the son of a bitch." And look at her brother Billy. That's what I expected Steve Harrington to be in season one, and then they gave him a character arc and made him an empathizable human. Billy was a walking trope, a cardboard cutout without anything remotely resembling an arc.

Also, the fact that Jonathan and Nancy spend the entire season on a meta arc responding to "Hashtag Justice For Barb," even though season one gave a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the town didn't go crazy searching for her the way they did for Will (Nancy's the only one who saw her car before the Lab people moved it to a bus stop and made it look like she ran away from home).
