Patook is a friend-finding website. Basically a dating site, but platonic. Fill out a profile, like people, see who liked you back, chat.

And it failed to produce any long-lasting conversation. Or to make the conversations good- write your piece, wait half a day for a 20 word reply with no lead in for further conversation. That's for /all/ of them, even for people you'd think would /know/ how to talk! (okay, there were longer pieces too, but they suffered the same problems)

The conversation I /did/ find on Omegle were actual conversations. They had appreciable response times, they were somewhat engaging, they had an end (mostly) instead of cutting in middle of a longer conversation and you wondering what went wrong.

Chatroulette was kind of like that, except mostly shorter but more /fun/ to have. It felt like I actually communicated with human beings for once! The joy! You could /feel/ the difference.

I will try the Matrix thing though, as well as encrypted ones, though the latter look like they require friends in the first place, which is kind of my main problem.\\
Actually- could you give a few examples of chatrooms and Matrix rooms? I am not quite sure where to start, frankly.
