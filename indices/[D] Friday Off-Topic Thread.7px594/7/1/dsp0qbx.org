Maybe you've been to the wrong places for chatting. Finding someone to talk with on Omegle is like winning the lottery. And I don't know what Patook is.

Chat roulleteing sucks. The way to do it is to get in group chatrooms and make friends.

There's a chat protocol that's getting very popular, it's called Matrix and it's designed to bridge several popular chatting protocols/services together, such as IRC. For instance, you can access an IRC channel from [[https://www.snoonet.org/][Snoonet]] using Matrix: [[https://matrix.to/#/#_snoonet_#casualconversation:matrix.org]]. The Matrix client Riot supports video chat using WebRTC.

And when you find that special someone and you want to have an /encrypted/ conversation with them, you can ask them to use [[https://tox.chat/][Tox]] or [[http://retroshare.net][Retroshare]], both of which support video/audio chat.
