Just in case anyone bothers to read this thread...

Been looking for a relatively easy way to meet people online. So I used online chatting websites, like Omegle. It failed. Then I used more specialist websites, for making friends, like Patook. It failed horribly on every front.

Then I realized- text chatting is useless. Conversations with it... they are empty, hollow, doomed to fail. Wherever I chat, it's either a passing conversation about nothing, or speaking to the ocean, talking in one direction, but not really to one another (like here or any other forum...).

So I wish to ask- any video chatting services without atrocious amount of dicks or people looking for live porn?
