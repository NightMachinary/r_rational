  Then I realized- text chatting is useless. Conversations with it... they are empty, hollow, doomed to fail. Wherever I chat, it's either a passing conversation about nothing, or speaking to the ocean, talking in one direction, but not really to one another (like here or any other forum...).

I cannot disagree more strongly, with regard to myself. A lot of my closest friends I talk to with text, and have never or seldom speak to them on voice comms.

As far as finding an easy way to meet people... have you checked out the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discord? I like the folks there myself, though some are abrasive at times. There are also communities that spring up around stories -- Marked for Death has its channel on the r/r discord server, OliWhail has his own server for his story, etc.
