Not necessarily. I went through this whole process about two years ago, set up a dream journal, messed with my sleep schedule, did all the exercises, gorged on glycine, etc. Achieved intentional lucidity in about two weeks for maybe ten seconds, after which I woke up. A month later I gave up because while frequency and ease of lucidity increased, I just kept waking up right after becoming lucid, every single time, multiple times a night, unable to actually do anything interesting in there.

On a side note a great side effect/prerequisite is improved dream memory retention, and if anyone wants to try it, this might just be worth it by itself, because some dreams are like super awesome action movies with incredible full immersion special effects in absolutely fantastic environments and cracky plot.
