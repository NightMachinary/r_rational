I have managed a few lucid dreams, that I can recall. I won't go into detail about it but in order to do it I spent roughly an hour before I went to sleep meditating. I hadn't read anything about lucid dreaming so it was all I could think of. It worked. I basically spent an hour running through the basic types of situations a dream will throw at me and repeating to myself, in a kind of mantra, "you will recognize the situation for what it is, a dream, and the you will have control". It has always worked for me. And the dreams were fun. But I haven't really bothered doing it regularly.
