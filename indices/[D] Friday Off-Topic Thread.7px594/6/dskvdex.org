I've been researching into lucid dreaming and to be a proficient lucid dreamer you need a firm grasp on reality, a constant self awareness of your surroundings noticing whats real and not real, and many reoccuring "reality check" tests you do on yourself to test if you are in a dream.

Now my thought is, many intelligent rationalists mcs should be excellent lucid dreamers. I would go on and say that the superhuman intelligent ones should not be able to have any normal dreams at all being the rationalists they are understanding fully what the universe is capable and not capable of.
