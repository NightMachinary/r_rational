As a belated observation, seeking comment from other lucid dreamers in this thread, within the last decade I've become increasingly aware of the fact that the 'special effects' often cut out when I'm making certain 'lucid-level' edits. It's acknowledged narratively by the dream, but the visual effect as experienced within the dream is missing. Does this happen to anyone else?

Example: Dream me is completely confident that I can gesture at a dying companion and said companion is GOING TO BE FINE. This is accompanied by a vague expectation that there will be some visual component to the emanation of this innate ability, and this expectation fails to be met but the companion gets up and is okay. Dream me reacts to this with a 'huh, that's odd', and if numerous instances of this rack up within a single dream, and I start to consider the -why- of this disjoint, then I wake up.
