My experience with lucid dreaming is that actually conscious levels of thought--the ability to consider my situation--almost always resulted in my waking up immediately afterwards. For me, instead, the best results have come about--not from adopting a frequent 'reality check'--but from a frequent 'Things will turn out the way I want them to' assumption.

I'm not quite certain how to put it without it sounding like a descent into narcissism or delusion. Clearly, demanding things go my way doesn't work all that well in reality. Nevertheless, when confronted by nightmares, NO, of COURSE I have the ability to smite the horrible monster. Of COURSE I can escape the catastrophe by just willing it to part around me. NATURALLY I can jump tall buildings in a single bound.

At no point in there do I become aware I'm dreaming, these days. It's just kind of standard for my dreaming self-image?

And I completely agree with eternal-potato about dream memory retention being awesome, with incredible immersion special effects and fantastic plot.
