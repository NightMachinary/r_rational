This community may not be the best place for that, but two very general tips (if you are an independent adult with some amount of disposable income):

- *Take good care of yourself.* Try to build habits of superior grooming, diet, exercise, self-care, and living space maintenance. One's first efforts should go into improving one's circumstances. I found my attractiveness to women was better when I paid more attention to how often I shaved and got haircuts, and got a bit more trim. Having a well-organized (or at least not obviously messy) living space will be important. I also paid attention to dressing more fashionably.

- *Find activities where you'll meet women.* Join a book club with people your age in it, get involved in pick-up beach volleyball, start going to open mic night, go to the dog park with your dog, or find some other group activity that you enjoy. Make sure it's something you like that fits you, so that people you meet there are more likely to be compatible with you.

Some other low-key good advice is: don't shit where you eat, don't be afraid to ask women out (getting rejected is normal and not the end of the world), and don't forget about your own standards for who you want to date.
