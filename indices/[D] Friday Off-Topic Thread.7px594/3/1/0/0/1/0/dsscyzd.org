Ah, small towns. That's unfortunate; a lot of what I feel would be recommended simply won't work due to population density then.

I honestly can't speak towards how to go about forging connections in small towns. From what I can tell; most of the connections are forged from simply living/growing up there. Neighborly type stuff. Barbecues, school events, etc.

For a new, unattached, 20-something year old from out of town? I can't even really begin to advise on how to get involved. Volunteering is a good way to at least fill up your time and I'm almost sure that the shelter at least accepts some sort of volunteering. Even if it's just 2 hours every Saturday or something.

If you don't mind me asking; why are the bars not a good idea? I grew up in a small town and can say that social activities revolved around drinking was far and away the best way to socialize with people. Of course, they're only fun if you're drinking too, obviously.
