Yea, you hit pretty much all the reasons I thought it'd be a bad idea. Thanks for the second opinion.

  I suggest finding a few friends before throwing your line out there.

I've tried looking for clubs etc., but the town I live in is virtually devoid of anything of that sort. Between the fluctuating economy that comes from being an oilfield town and the city council's shortsightedness, there's not a lot here. Hell, even the local Walmart left at one point. They came back eventually, but you get the idea.

This isn't just me failing at research, either. I've had coworkers who've been here anywhere from a couple months to six years complain about how there's nothing to do here.

The only real options for socialization that I'm aware of are going out to the bars (which is a bad idea for multiple reasons), some sports teams at the gym I go to (they're not at times that work for me, and I've never really been into sports in any case), and volunteering at either the library or the animal shelter (which I'm hesitant to do both because I have so little free time and because my job sometimes has us working weekends; that's if they even accept volunteers, which I haven't looked into yet).
