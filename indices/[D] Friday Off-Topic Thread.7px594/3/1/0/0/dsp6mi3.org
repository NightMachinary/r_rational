I'm no psychologist but I would say dating with no support network is a bad idea because you end up putting /way/ too much pressure on your partner inadvertently. That person is suddenly the provider of all of your socialization and that can be rough for the both of you because they can feel as if you're being clingy and you can find yourself acting in unhealthy ways such as feeling left out when she leaves your company to hang with others.

Plus that's to say nothing of the potential for emotional damage if you have a fight or breakup. You have no one to turn to to talk things through with or help you get over it or distract you.

Having no social network already puts you in a delicate place psychologically (if not an outright depressed one) and dating comes with a lot of mental and emotional stress that you have no human outlet with which to mitigate said stress. So I feel that it is an entirely legitimate concern to worry what impact dating could have on you.

Friends are both easier to obtain and maintain than a significant other and the experience you get with them will inevitably improve your chances once you do put yourself out there. I suggest finding a few friends before throwing your line out there.

Of course, you may well be emotionally and mentally healthy enough to handle dating with no social support; some people are just like that. But it's unlikely, to say the least. And you don't want to sacrifice your mental state for nothing.
