Was kinda trolling; [[/r/relationships][r/relationships]] is fine, I guess. It's just that the advice there is usually pretty one dimensional. Which isn't necessarily bad; I suppose I've just outgrown it and sort of look down on it as a result, much the same way you might look back and scoff at a band you liked as a preteen or a movie you thought was amazing and deep (but turned out to be anything but in reality)
