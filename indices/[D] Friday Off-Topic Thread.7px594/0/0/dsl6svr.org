Out of curiosity, what dose are you taking? I was on melatonin for awhile, but had to stop because of the vivid dreams which often became vivid nightmares. After doing this twice, I was informed that the common dose for OTC melatonin was 3mg, while the effective dose is 300mcg. In other words, the average pill is ten times stronger than it needs to be. After switching to pills that had a tenth the amount of melatonin, I was able to use it to get to sleep without the messed up dreams.
