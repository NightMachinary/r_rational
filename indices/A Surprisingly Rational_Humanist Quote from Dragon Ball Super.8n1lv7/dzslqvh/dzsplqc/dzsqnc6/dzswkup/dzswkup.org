  If it's personal and specific to him though why did they call his existence inevitable? Doesn't seem very inevitable to me, since he's deviant to the norm for gods and such.
#+end_quote

Beerus isn't deviant to the norm, at least not to /his/ norm, which is what matters here because he's been around basically forever and no one's managed to beat him. So as far as the character speaking is concerned, Beerus's continued existence is inevitable.

  Overall I don't see how these quotes from OP are "surprisingly rational" or inspiring in any way.
#+end_quote

It may not be surprising to /you/, but it's certainly surprising in the context of a mainstream anime. To quote hpmor:

"If people were hit on the heads with truncheons once a month, and no one could do anything about it, pretty soon there'd be all sorts of philosophers who found all sorts of /amazing benefits/ to being hit on the head with a truncheon once a month. Like, it makes you tougher, or it makes you happier on the days when you're /not/ getting hit with a truncheon."

A lot of anime tends to have the attitude of these philosophers. So it's surprising that, in a mainstream anime, there is a character portrayed as good and wise who directly rejects this attitude.
