It's very pre-Christian in philosophy. In the West it used to be like that too, then Abrahamic religions came around and replaced all that with a single omnipotent God that's always on our side (be it the Christian God or Allah, later). Think of the Greek gods, or worse, the Norse ones. Total utter dicks, the only reason to worship them was that they were the guys in charge. I feel like it says something about a shift in our attitude towards nature that those pagan religions ended up replaced with religions focused on human beings, and with a perfect, moral God that brings order and justice into the world instead of embodying its chaos. We probably started feeling like we could tame and /shape/ the world to our liking instead of being passively subject to its whims, and that's where our religious and philosophical attitudes changed.
