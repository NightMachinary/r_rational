Well, mostly because by the time the "modern" times roll around, there's just no external threats to mankind any more, in Greek mythology. So what would they protect them from? In the Gigantomach√≠a, when the giants rise from Gaia to avenge Chronos and the Titans, Zeus and the other gods fight against them next to Heracles, a human. But the main threat was to them, not to humans, so yeah.
