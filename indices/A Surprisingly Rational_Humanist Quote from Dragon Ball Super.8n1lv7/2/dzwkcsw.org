A lot of Super's theme seems to be "Gods are dicks, but what you gotta do, they're Gods". Their portrayal, while mostly in jest due to the lighthearted nature of the series, is all but flattering. They're either incompetent and weak (Shin), total assholes (Beerus, Champa, Quitela, the list goes on), crazed psychopathic fanatics (Zamasu) or drooling childish morons who can't even begin to appreciate the horrifying magnitude of their actions (Zen-oh-sama, namely the God of All). The only reason why people cope with these entities is because they have to, since they're mostly too strong to kill. They're basically anthropomorphic forms of the forces of nature: sometimes they could favour you by accident, sometimes they will kill the fuck out of you, neither time they will care in the least about your fate.
