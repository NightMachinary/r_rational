I can't help but disagree with... whoever is saying that there is no meaning in what he does. "Destruction" is directly tied with life in almost every aspect. I'm not just talking about the inevitability and utility of human death (that's a discussion for another time, it gets hairy) but of death in all aspects. Cell death, for example is extremely important to all living creatures. Without cell death, cells with corrupted DNA can become cancerous. Many life forms die so that their offspring may live. The death of members in one species brings balance to their role in the lives of other species. You prune and kill branches off a bush to raise the health of the entire plant.

I wouldn't go as far as to try to kill half of all life to try to bring balance, but even if we somehow discover immortality, we will still have an intimate relationship with death and destruction in some capacity. This isn't mysticism, this is reality.

Although I haven't watched the show so maybe this guy is just a dick and likes killing. Who knows.
