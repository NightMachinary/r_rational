Ah ok, that makes a lot more sense. So he's /supposed/ to be this god of death and balance, but he's misbehaved and thus there isn't a lot of meaning in what he does. If it's personal and specific to him though why did they call his existence inevitable. Doesn't seem very inevitable to me, since he's deviant to the norm for gods and such. Overall I don't see how these quotes from OP are "surprisingly rational" or inspiring in any way. They are just a dude saying this god is good for the service he provides and another dude saying nah man, don't confuse what he should be with what he actually is.
