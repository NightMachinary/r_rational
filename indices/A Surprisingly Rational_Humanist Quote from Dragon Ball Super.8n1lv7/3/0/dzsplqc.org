It's more of the latter than the former, by far. Beerus, the force of destruction in question, is supposed to be working with the supreme kais in dealing with threats to the universe and working to improve the civilizational development, or mortal level, by carefully pruning existential threats and (on rare occasion) destroying civilizations and species that have gone too far towards evil. The gods are supposed to utilize the minimum direct intervention possible, although this approach does cause some problems that end up getting addressed in the series.

Beerus, however, is lazy, arrogant, enittled, and callous, and as a result does essentially none of this. He becomes an indiscriminate force of destruction in the universe; his first two onscreen appearances are him destroyign half a planet because the food a group of chefs gave him wasn't up to his gourmet standards, and his second is him destroying another planet because one of its people had the nerve to try and stop him from stealing their food. He alsoe fails at the other half of his task, and as a result causes many of the previous problems in the series; Maijin Buu came within a hairsbreadth of destroying the universe three times as a result of his laziness, Zamasu succeeded in destroying the future universe as a result of his actions, and indeed he almost causes the end of the universe himself in his introductory movie.

"No! There is no reason at all. The inevitability of his existence does not give meaning to what he does" isn't entirely accurate because he doesn't do it /at random/, but it's essentially true. I think the connection the Op drew is actually quite insightful: Much like real death, even if you accept that some destruction is necessary, that doesn't make all the deaths any less pointless and tragic. He's also capable of a veneer of civility and normality, and is essentially immortal and unbeatable.
