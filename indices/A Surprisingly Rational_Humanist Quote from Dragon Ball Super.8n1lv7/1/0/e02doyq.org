  One thing a god of destruction might be important and necessary for is to destroy threats like Majin Buu. Maybe they ignore universal tyrants like Frieza, but it seems to be within their job to destroy threats that just want to annihilate everything (like Kid Buu).

I'm not 100%, but I could have sworn this is explicitly stated at some point. Something along the lines of "Beerus should have killed Buu, but he was too lazy."
