It's still kind of unclear why each Universe has a God of Destruction. However, it's somewhat suggested that their purpose is to assist with the normal other gods in order to cultivate universes to produce lots of stable life.

One thing a god of destruction might be important and necessary for is to destroy threats like Majin Buu. Maybe they ignore universal tyrants like Frieza, but it seems to be within their job to destroy threats that just want to annihilate everything (like Kid Buu). They should also be destroying and keeping an eye on anyone who commits any extremely serious crimes like time travel or anyone at large who just seems to be gaining massive amounts of power.

It's worth noting that Beerus is generally considered an incompetent God of Destruction who spends way too much of his time sleeping rather than doing his job. This is also kind of the case for most of the Gods of Destruction in the end and one of the reasons for the entire Multi Universe tournament in the first place... lol
