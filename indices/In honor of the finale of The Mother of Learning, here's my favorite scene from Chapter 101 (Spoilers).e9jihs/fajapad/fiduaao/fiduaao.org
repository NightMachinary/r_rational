So, a question. Do you want me to add this to the list of fanart on my site?

Also, I'm not sure what the attribution procedure for commissioned artworks should be. I though about crediting the artist (Aslovefromlies) as the artist, and you as the one who made a commission. I usually ask the artist for permission, too, but I'm not sure how that works in the case of commission - I assume it's now up to you to give such permissions?

Anyway, tell me your thoughts about this.
