  We've seen that, though it might not work exactly as our narratrix describes, consent protection is definitely something people worry about
#+end_quote

We have no evidence that the spiking Rocks, the first source of the seed-ghosts and whoever created the various Succubus-related magical rituals are all following the same prime utility function to a tee. For all we know consent is the ultimate goal for the Rocks even though the Succubus species was created with more important priotities while some of the rituals have specifically the goal of undermining the Rock detection system in a deep and fundamental way (like, say, removing the ability to not consent and rewriting the mind of a now former non-consenter).

  How might this be consensual?
#+end_quote

If she lost abilities she wanted to have, didn't expect to lose and doesn't know exactly why she lost them (or even if she does, doesn't agree) then it can't be consensual. At least not as far as informed consent goes. And uninformed consent is worth crap.

  What's the evidence that she's disallowed from telling him?
#+end_quote

Mostly the fact that she hasn't even though she loves him and it limits the ways she can show her affection and it bothers her. That and some of your subtle comments in previous threads like this one. I know that isn't definite evidence, but-

  Against?
#+end_quote

I have none. Having no evidence for one hypothesis and some evidence for the other makes me skew towards the one I do have even slight evidence for.

#+begin_quote
  If she's able, why doesn't she say anything despite multiple opportunities?
#+end_quote

From the very beginning she seemed to have trouble explaining stuff without prompting. Even before the first ritual. Sometimes she slips but she seems to think that's a bad thing. From my judgement of Jack's character it doesn't seem to be his specific kink to not be educated by his beloved property through her own initiative. And if it is that would be a pretty shitty character flaw that would honestly make me think less of him.

But if I'm right and it isn't then the source is something else. It might be whatever makes a Succubus (Sade only?) into a Hench if that is something beyond mere in-post classification of preferences. It might be some other supernatural thing. Or it might be something else entirely with a source genuinely coming from Lyra's experience and education. Like for instance not wanting to scare Jack or turn him off and knowing that learning about some side effect of all this ritualism without time to acclimate and preparation can cause such things in new humans. But if that's true then she deliberately acted to make /Jack/ agree to things without informed consent, which would be a whole other can of worms.

  Does this madness have a goal? Is it just stray magic or a developmental quirk of some kind? If this is 'for' something, what might it be trying to accomplish?
#+end_quote

Can't compute due to lack of information. The only evidence for the existence of a greater goal is some of your previous comments and the meta-fact of this being a story posted only in the [[/r/rational]] subreddit, which by now has developed its own little set of tropes.

#+begin_quote
  Based on how it seems to work on her speech, have we seen it modify her behavior? If not, why not? What else is it doing than word replacement?
#+end_quote

I don't know. We haven't seen her do a single thing not somehow explicitly to Jack's benefit in quite a while now. But then neither have we seen much evidence of her wanting to. So this may well be due to more deeply rooted stuff than this (relatively) new and superficial mental block.

But a block on verbal speech only would be very weird. Except if for some reason the ritual (whichever one it was) was created specifically with the "feature" of replacing all of her euphemisms for her master with "Master". In which case I would call it weak-to-medium evidence that either the ritual wasn't created by some form of nigh-omnipotent utility maximizer or that said nigh-omnipotent utility maximizer is crossing off an arbitrary list or working towards a specific fantasy world rather than having one or more simple and logical end goals.

#+begin_quote
  The only thing I can say really without spoilers is, how do these things overlap? What types of combination make sense?
#+end_quote

The lack of knowledge of almost any label other than those that would apply to Lyra within each taxonomy rank makes this hard to answer for now. We know that there are more Houses but we know next to nothing about any but the Sade. We don't know if the Overlord/hench dynamic is found in other houses. We don't know if things like Dres or Capricorn are exclusive or even in the same taxonomy rank as Overlord and Hench. About Hollow Heart we know nothing other than that Lyra is one, Jack probably is one, many others in this new community aren't, that it isn't always easy to be one, that there is direct metaphysical stuff involved with being a Hollow Heart and that there is /something/ called the "Hollow Heart Abyss". We don't even know if there /is/ anything similar in the same taxonomy rank slot or if it is a simple thing of everybody either being Hollow Heart or not being Hollow Heart.
