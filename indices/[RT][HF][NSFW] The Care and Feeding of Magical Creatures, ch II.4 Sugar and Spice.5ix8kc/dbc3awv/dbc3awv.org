This speech (and behavior?) block thing is getting more and more fucked up. She wants to call her maker-lover "baby" and she has no reason to think that he wouldn't like it and yet she can't, and it seems like she can't even tell him that she can't. That breaks all the meanings of consensual.

And even if Jack could release her from it, how would he ever know to do so? Judging from everything else so far she would be unable to tell him about this problem or even hint at it. I mean being made to serve is already iffy enough but this thing creates actual dissonance!

When did it start by the way? Was it after the stone raft session, was it when she became an extension of his in a super-improv claiming in order to be able to use his sword or was it during the quickly thrown together ritual of summoning? The last one was, according to her words, supposed to last only for a few hours, which makes it even less consensual if whatever mind alteration happened there turns out to be permanent.

On a different note, I'm really curious about what all the classifications mean and what the hierarchy between them is.

- Demons/Spirits is the largest, including all kinds of stuff and Succubi seem to be an intelligent type of Demon.

- Succubi are sorted into (four?) Houses, probably since before birth, more like a blood line than something you really choose are get chosen to? At least as far as I understood her very ghost-seed was a Sade ghost-seed and chose Jack in part /because/ of his kink, so the master/slave stuff is not solely the fault of his subconscious.

- Sade Succubi seem to sort themselves based on their preferences. The Overlord/hench is a clear D/s thing. I don't know what Dres and Capricorn are or if they are Sade exclusive.

- On top of that Lyra is a Hollow Heart which seems more metaphysically important than her Hench identity label. It seems that humans may be Hollow Heart too (people are guessing Jack is) but again I don't know if that is a Sade and Sade-incubator thing only or if Hollow Hearts can be found all over the Succubus Houses. We also haven't seen any other types in this hierarchy level yet. Just that according to the captain they are rare enough that staying out of their business is feasible and that Lyra could have a "no one understands me" phase meaning that most of her friends are probably also not Hollow Hearts. Then again, there is something called the Hollow Heart Abyss, which I /think/ is an actual physical location, which in turn would point that it either is a Sade thing only or that it is located somewhere where the areas of several houses overlap. With several trillion Sade existing the second one sounds impractical at first but Succubi seem to learn fast travel and teleportation pretty early on.

How much did I get correctly? And could you shed some more light on the classification hierarchy without spoiling anything important?
