I can't answer too much without being spoilerriffic, but you're asking the right questions about whatever is messing with her speech. Some other interesting ones:

- We've seen that, though it might not work exactly as our narratrix describes, consent protection is definitely something people worry about. How /might/ this be consensual?
- What's the evidence that she's disallowed from telling him? Against? If she's able, why doesn't she say anything despite multiple opportunities?
- Does this madness have a goal? Is it just stray magic or a developmental quirk of some kind? If this is 'for' something, what might it be trying to accomplish?
- Based on how it seems to work on her speech, /have/ we seen it modify her behavior? If not, why not?
- What else is it doing than word replacement?

As for classifications, think multiple overlapping independent taxonomies, but you're on the right track overall and don't really have anything /wrong/. The only thing I can say really without spoilers is, how do these things overlap? What types of combination make sense?
