IMO, half the point of Three Worlds Collide is how, compared to the vastness of conceptual space, very /small/ differences in values can still be incompatible, and that values are complex. Like, it's pointed out how similar children are psychologically, how we could have gone down the Superhappy path, how we share literature and art with the Babyeaters. It's more salient to think of something /nearly/ like us with infanticide as a terminal value, than it is to think of a paperclipper with no terminal value crossover whatsoever.

Of course they're still very alien, compared to other fictional aliens. It's just not the point to have them far removed from human.
