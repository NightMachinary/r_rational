One that I often see posted when people start talking about alien aliens are the Tines from Vernor Vinge's /A Fire Upon the Deep/. They're dog-like pack animals that use sound to form a coherent organism made of individual members - very inventive, and very cool. Also the Skoderiders, which are a plant-computer hybrid if memory serves.

Also, the obligatory plug for [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y5/the_babyeating_aliens_18/][/Three Worlds Collide/]], where I believe half the point is to have aliens with values systems that are far removed from human.

The relevant trope is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens][Starfish Aliens]], also see [[http://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1kr9p1/genuinely_alien_aliens/][this thread]] from [[/r/print_sf]] (though most of those novels are just science fiction and not actually that rational).
