I think Banks does a decent job of creating some distinct aliens in /The Algebraist/ (with references to other species that we can't even really communicate with). I actually am curious if the Dwellers' attitude towards their offspring was a partial inspiration for Yudkowsky's /Three Worlds Collide/.
