Wang's carpets, from the story of the same name, by Greg Egan, which was then integrated into the novel /Diaspora/. Ted Chiang's "Story of Your Life" is also really fascinating. It is largely about a linguist in a first-contact situation and ends up at least partially a story about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
