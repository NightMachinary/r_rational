The better question is whether he could avoid it if he tried. The way relationships stats in RPGs work is frankly bizarre. Because of levels you never /stop/ growing closer unless you break off things completely so eventually you're simultaneously fulfilling the role of everyone's soul mate/personal messiah. Persona 5 in particular makes several hints that the protagonist might just be a teeny bit of a psychopath if they can shift gears between what different people want so easily. High level SOC gets into scary territory regarding trust and whether someone you can perfectly control even counts as human any more. That way lay the path to Anas√ªrimbor Kellhus .
