if you look at it as skill levels being a roll modifier, then even deception level 6 doesn't save you from rolling a 1-5/20 on a deception check. I think that's the most plausible explanation right now between the gap of his skill levels and inconsistent moment-to-moment results (i.e. low level rifle skills, shooting a sniper behind cover in the head from a moving vehicle). That doesn't address the apparent lack of interaction his real abilities have with the system stat display though (knowledge, prior experience with guns, etc.).
