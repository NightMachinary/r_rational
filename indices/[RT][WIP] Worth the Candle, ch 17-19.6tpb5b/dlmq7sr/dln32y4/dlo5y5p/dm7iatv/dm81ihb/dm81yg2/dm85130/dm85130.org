This?

#+begin_quote
  Aerb was about ten times larger than Earth, flat instead of a sphere, and shaped like a hexagon. If you went far enough north, you would end up in the south, and it was the same in any direction.

First sentence clearly states that Aerb is hexagonal and is 10 times the size of Earth (I assume by surface area). The second one implies infinite tiling of said hexagon. What is unclear?
