The hexagon is tiled, effectively forming an infinite plane, so the gravity would be directed 'down' into the plane at all points. It would also not get any weaker with distance.

But this is all irrelevant, since this is a videogame. The gravity is implemented via constant force 'down', sun is just a circle on the skybox and a directional light source, and coordinate wraparound is not very hard to implement either.
