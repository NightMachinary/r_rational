Maybe, but Amaryllis' general attitude toward Juniper seems to be more one of cultivating an asset to be used in her own larger plans. She's distinctly manipulative and guarded with information, seeming to see it as leverage, or a means of influencing Juniper by controlling the picture he builds of Aerb.

This might all just be a deconstruction of tsundere's, but I really haven't picked up on any hint of Amaryllis being attracted to Juniper.
