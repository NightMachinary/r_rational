Loyalty 5? Granted, we don't really know how this "loyalty" works. The game couldn't be tricked, exactly, but it certainly could "play along" with any sufficiently competent or dramatic manipulations or betrayals in the making. Among other evidence could be her lines about Juniper being "a very decent person" and apologies for leaving him, but obviously it's even easier to fake than loyalty.

That said, it's mostly irrelevant. We know /Juniper/ is attracted to her, which means she counts. This is an advanced RPG we're talking about, why wouldn't there be optional romantic subplots for every companion?

Oh, by the way, I'm reasonably confident that her beauty is abnormal. Reread the relevant paragraph from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25816869][chapter 2]]:

  Imagine that someone spent a few years studying your likes and dislikes, running through video of your every private moment, somehow surreptitiously hooking up EKGs to measure your physiological responses without you know. Then imagine that they sat down with that data and the best photo manipulation artists in the world and made the absolute perfect picture to cause your heart rate to spike, a jolt to run up your spine, butterflies in your stomach, and a cold sweat on your palms. Then imagine that they did this again, over and over in slight variations, until they had a full 4K 60fps 3D movie to show you. That was what it was like watching her.

It's not normal, it's either some glamour magic, or the DM-entity deliberately putting Juniper's dream girl in front of him; neither implies good things about this whole arrangement.

Oh, and the term's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kuudere][kuudere]].
