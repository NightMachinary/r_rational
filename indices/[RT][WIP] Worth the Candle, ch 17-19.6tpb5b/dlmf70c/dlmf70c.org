  Worth the Candle is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.

If you haven't read any of this, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][here's the link to the full thing]].

I am back from my week away, here are the three chapters I wrote while I was without reliable internet. These chapters are somewhat slower and more character/worldbuildy in preparation for the meat/action of Book II.

Thanks to everyone who has helped to make the numbers for this story become larger numbers, and to all the people who have responded to me on the weekly worldbuilding posts, on the [[/r/rational]] discord, etc.
