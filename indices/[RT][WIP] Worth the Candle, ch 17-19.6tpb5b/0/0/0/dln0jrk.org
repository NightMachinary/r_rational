Huh, I've never played Dwarf Fortress. I thought I was being somewhat derivative of the tinker trance from Worm, though I didn't realize that until after I'd been running a D&D campaign with it for a few months. That mechanic is basically a way to circumvent the "why don't people just reverse-engineer it" problem and the "why don't they just mass produce it" problem in one fell swoop.
