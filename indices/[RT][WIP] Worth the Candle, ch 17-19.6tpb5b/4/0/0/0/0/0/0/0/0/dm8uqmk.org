You /can/ go on forever in the same direction, while the landscape and everything else will be infinitely repeating. If you could see far enough with your line of sight perpendicular to the edge of the hexagon, you'd see the back of you head. Same way you would on a spherical planet it you could see around the horizon. Except tiled hexagon is the surface of a torus, not a sphere.

You can also think of it as a single hexagon with three pairs of infinitely tall portals, located at opposite edges of the hexagon. Walking into one causes you to walk out of the opposite one, likewise for everything else, including light, which means there is no discontinuity. It isn't even possible to tell where the edge actually is, only that stuff repeats in hexagonal pattern.
