If it was a infinite plane you could go on north forever, but he says if you go north you end up in the south. Not entirely sure what that's about, but my guess would be some magic thing that returns you to the opposite side so you can't escape the hexagon.

But I guess it could potentially extend forever (or up to a arbitrarily large point) and the magic barrier just limits them to one hexagon.
