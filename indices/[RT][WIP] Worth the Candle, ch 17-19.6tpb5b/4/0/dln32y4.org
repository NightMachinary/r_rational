I wonder how gravity works. Presumably the hexagonal world is made out of some very strong material so it doesn't crumple into a sphere -- but if one is near the eastern edge of the hexagon, does one feel a strong westward gravitational force? Or maybe the hexagon is spinning fast enough to prevent this...

Or maybe the answer is just "magic."
