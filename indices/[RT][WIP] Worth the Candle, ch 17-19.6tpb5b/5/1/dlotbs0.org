[[/u/PositivePeter]] is correct, but I did at least check that Elvish had those sounds using this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya#Consonants][consonant chart]]. I think the sketchiest bit is probably the [mp] bit, which I think gets more classically Elvish as [mb] or even just [n]. But for /Worth the Candle/ I'm using my own version of Elvish +with blackjack and hookers.+

(In my head it's wahm-pa-tare with a trilled r.)
