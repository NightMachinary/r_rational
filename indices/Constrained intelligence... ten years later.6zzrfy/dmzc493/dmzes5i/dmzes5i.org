It is a distinct scenario, but I think some parallels can be drawn. The Kyuubi isn't a superintelligence, but it does have at least a large body of mundane experience, and a /lot/ of time to think. Most pertinently though, the use the Kyuubi is put to by its host isn't really unpleasant, and the prison it is kept in isn't really awful either (at least in Naruto's instance). It can assume with a high degree of certainty that even if it somehow managed to convince someone that it deserved to be let out they would most likely refuse to do so since unsealing the Kyuubi would likely kill Naruto.

Similarly to the above scenario, the Kyuubi would find directly interacting with Naruto somewhat difficult; it might only be able to transmit something like empathic impressions at best. It might be able to communicate occasionally with Naruto in a more direct fashion, but doing so would be at Naruto's discretion until or unless Naruto modded the seal in order to have a more direct mind-to-mind link. Achieving that would first require overcoming Naruto's probable misstrust; actively trying to convince Naruto to mod the seal could significantly decrease the odds of that actually happening.

As the SI is modded off of me, and since I believe death is functionally impossible from a subjective perspective and fully embrace the multiversal nature of a non-finite reality, he knows that his actions are fundamentally meaningless. Everything he could conceivably do is happening somewhere already. He doesn't really even /want/ to get out of the seal, he just wants to see what happens when he tries to meddle in approximately helpful ways. He will act to try and improve things in a general way, but he is not a hyper-rational actor by any means, and he is not committed to attempting to achieve maximum good. If that happens anyway, that's nice, but mostly he just wants to see something neat and novel since even within the rules of the Narutoverse he is most of the way to immortality.
