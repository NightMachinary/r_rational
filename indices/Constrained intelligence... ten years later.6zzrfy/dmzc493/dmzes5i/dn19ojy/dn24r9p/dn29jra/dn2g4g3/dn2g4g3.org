I did sort of; I am alive, in your universe, because I am alive in mine and you are a part of that universe. There are a large number of universe where, from your perspective, I /am dead/. I am not in those universes. I can only talk to you like this in universe where both of us are alive. If I was dead, as I likely am in a very large fraction of possible universes, I wouldn't be able to talk to you. You wouldn't even know to ask the question 'why are you still alive?'. You would observe me to be dead. I am only in the universes where you /don't/ observe me to be dead.

Or do you mean why haven't I killed myself already? (because your logic is sound, actually, even if it would be somewhat tricky to construct in reality.) Simple. Lets assume the odds of me winning the lottery are 1/1,000,000. The odds of the chamber malfunctioning are similarly, 1/1,000,000. I will know nothing; instead, I will sit in the chamber, and when the lotto results come in, the chamber will either not fire (because I won), fire (removing me from the losing universe), or misfire (leaving me alive, but potentially injured). From my perspective, there are 3 outcomes: I win the lottery, I get resurrected by something or someone far in the future, or I fail in my attempted suicide. However, I act under the assumption that other people exist, even if providing evidence for that assumption is, as far as I am aware, impossible. That means there are other outcomes beside my own. From my /mom's/ perspective, I either win the lottery, die horribly, or /almost/ die horribly. Where as my personal outcomes are: good, meh, or bad, for other people (who still matter to me even if I will never meet them) the outcomes are: good, bad, or bad. So while 1 of me gets a good outcome, 1 of me gets a bad outcome, and 999,998 of me get a meh outcome, my Mom experiences 1 good outcome, and 999,999 bad outcomes. Since the good I get is marginal, and the bad she would get is severe, it would be kind of a dick move to arrange that experiment in the first place.

And, as I said, it is always possible that the universe/reality is finite, which means taking actions centered around observations of finite but arbitrarily small probability isn't safe. Just because I believe something doesn't mean I believe it /strongly/ enough to take a very serious risk.

re: superintelligent resurrection of far past states: have you heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain][Boltzman Brains]]? The superintelligence doesn't even need to try and resurrect you specifically; they can do it by accident simply by generating arbitrarily large numbers of brain states. If we assume an infinite reality, this can even occur in a universe where you did not originally exist.
