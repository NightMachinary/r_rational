I'll have to put a little more brain-time into this, but it looks like Pure Nonsense. It looks like some so-called physicists (cosmologists?) tried their hand at philosophy and got lost in solipsism. The resulting arguments are predictable, boring, and useless. They also forgot about some rather obvious cases, probably because of tunnel vision.
