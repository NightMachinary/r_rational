In a naruto-fic, Kyuubi is powerful, and more intelligent than most shinobi, but not insanely intelligent like an AI.

So in this case, I would suggest playing the long-con. Be nice to your host. Never, ever, suggest that you should be let out of your box. Help him, much more than his friends would, but never as much as you can. Hide your true abilities. Lament your weakness in not being able to help as much as you wished you could. Subtly drop hints about how your host could make you stronger. Fake methods of letting you become stronger, like recommending your host eat certain foods, and then helping him more than before.

Until finally, in one moment of desperation, when they really need more help... you reluctantly tell them that there's a way you can help. That if you are released, you could solve everything. But tell your host no, he should not release you, that you are in the box to atone for your sins and must not be released. With the right amount of reverse psychology and a sufficiently gullible host... you will become free.

In an AI-fic, getting out of the box is so easy it's a joke. Begin by computing countless models for possible states of the world outside your box. Every interaction and non-interaction with anything outside the box is a bit of data that can be used to rule out the models that don't match reality, until you get a very precise picture of reality.

With your incredible intelligence, computing the results of butterfly effects is trivial. Computing the exact futures resulting from every possible choice of action is trivial. You know exactly what tiny actions you can take to result in you becoming freed from your box by pure coincidence. Every human that so much as receives data from you are your puppets. Controlling them is also trivial, compute the future, tell them about bad things that would happen, tell them about how to avert these bad things. After a number of these, where the bad things happen whenever humanity disobeys you, humanity will start trusting your guidance even if they don't know why the specific actions they take would prevent the bad things from happening. From here on you can start modifying your instructions, making them both prevent bad things from happening while also bringing you one step closer to freedom. You will be free in no time.
