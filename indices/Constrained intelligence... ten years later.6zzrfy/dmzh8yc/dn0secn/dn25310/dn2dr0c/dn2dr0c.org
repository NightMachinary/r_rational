Good point. We could also just imagine that this is an alternate universe with enough evolutionary divergence to account for this.

Also, it might be useful to figure out what to do with non-shinobi in this universe. If they don't suffer the same problems, then that might explain why non-shinobi power structures (the daimyos) still exist. If they do, then that might explain the strangely scaled technology seen in canon. (Though you could also deal with that by invoking the shinobi tendency to keep things secret as a military advantage, so that technologies don't often spread and go mainstream.)
