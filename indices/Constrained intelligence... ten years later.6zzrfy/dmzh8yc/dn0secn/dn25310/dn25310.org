I think that can be true in just a general sense; having a brain of a certain size doens't mean you have to be a certain level of intelligent. Imagine a human with 6 arms instead of just 4; the motor cortex would likely expand significantly to allow fluid control of the extra limbs, meaning you had less available for other tasks. A person with chakra might have a large portion of their frontal lobe devoted to controlling their chakra network, leaving less available for complex thought.
