For bonus points (although it might actually disqualify your story for rational status if you do this), never mention that your internal model when writing the story involved everyone except the Kyuubi being morons; instead, play it off as just a normal story in which the human characters are considered fairly intelligent, and the Kyuubi really /is/ a superintelligence. Then check to see if anyone actually notices that every character is several orders of magnitude dumber than the story wants the reader to think.
