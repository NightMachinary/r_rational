There's no better kind.

  In practice ... An AGI would be able to approximate reality several orders of magnitude better than any human.

Oh really. I have not seen this definition. You may be thinking that since an AI is based on hardware, it can just allocate more processing power at will, and run more simulations. Turns out humans already do this, and the results don't scale as you would expect.

- Try taking something "simple" like the atmosphere, and predict how its state will advance over time. If you've seen any of the hurricane forecasts from the last couple weeks, you'll know how hard it is to do this with any accuracy.

- Now think how hard it is to predict a system composed of billions of individually intelligent actors. Welcome to macro-economics: Even Our Best Models are Badâ„¢. You can run simulations till the world ends, and never get close to predicting how things actually go.

Now why would you think an AGI would be able to do any better than humans? It actually /cannot/ devote more processing power to these problems.
