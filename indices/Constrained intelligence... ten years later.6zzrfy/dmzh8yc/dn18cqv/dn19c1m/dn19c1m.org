Technically, yes, you're right. No matter how intelligent, it is impossible to know reality exactly. So yes, I was exaggerating when I said you could know exactly what futures result from every action.

In practice though? An AGI would be able to approximate reality several orders of magnitude better than any human. And while Chaos theory says you cannot have exact predictions, you can certainly get close. So it is entirely possible for an AGI to be able to manipulate everything and everyone around it to steer itself to a chosen future with an unbelievable degree of accuracy.
