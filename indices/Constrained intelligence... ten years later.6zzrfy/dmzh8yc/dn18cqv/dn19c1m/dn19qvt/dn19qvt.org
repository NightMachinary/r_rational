This conversation is taking place in the context of a discussion of a fictional superintelligent AI. So yes, if you, as the author, wish to write about an AI that is so smart and powerful that it can effectively predict the future, fine. More power to 'ya.

However, I'd like to say two things. First, that makes for a pretty boring story, and second, I honestly don't believe such an omniscient AI maps well to reality, now or at any point in the future.
