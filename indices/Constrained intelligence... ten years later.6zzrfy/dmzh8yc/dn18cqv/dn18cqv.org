Hah! No. Chaos theory says you're wrong. More specifically, it states that even tiny fluctuations in the initial parameters lead to wildly diverging outcomes. And when you're dealing with an extrapolated model to begin with, which by necessity has minute differences between the model and reality, any model created thereby would be ultimately useless.
