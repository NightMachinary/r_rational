Well, because there is always the possibility I am wrong. It's like if you think you're living in a simulation, and if you die you'll get out into the 'real world'. Being reincarnated into another universe would be mild objective proof of the assertion that termination of unconsciousness is subjectively impossible; but I do not have any proof to confirm that hypothesis right now.

Also, asking why I'm still alive is a pointless question man, that's like, straight anthropic principle. If I die in one universe, an outside observer would observe me to die, even though from my perspective nothing would happen. I will always see myself /somehow/ survive even an inescapable doom, but other people have their own subjective experiences which include observations of my demise. /This/ branch is the one where I am still alive to reply to your comment. But in others, potentially hundreds or thousands of others, I tripped in the shower yesterday, or choked on a grape, or got hit by a bus or whatever.

So your question shouldn't be 'how are you alive?' but, as you said, 'how are you not a lottery winner?'

The answer to that is also pretty simple; the odds of me winning the lottery are small. So if I pre-commit to blowing my brains out if I /don't/ win the lottery, in most branches I will /attempt/ to do so, however, in those branches my subjective experience would have diverged from the branches in which I did win, so even though those branches would attempt to terminate their distinctness would be enough that they would count as not!me; they would perceive some random accident preventing them from dying, not become lottery winners. Only someone whose subjective experience of reality is identical to mine counts as me. However, my subjective experience of reality excludes /huge/ amounts of details. In some universes, a meteor just decapitated me. I wouldn't have been able to perceive that meteor before that point, so even though those universes would be different in a technical sense, meteor-verse!me and no-meteor-verse!me wouldn't notice a difference if you swapped us before that point. This can even be expanded to include what would be in principle highly divergent realities; like one in which I was a fish-person for example. While in theory fish!me and human!me are very different, in the right circumstances our subjective experiences of reality are close enough to identical that if you just swapped our brains and edited our memories of 'normal' anatomy, we wouldn't notice anything happened. And since reality is infinite, every possibility occurs somewhere, even ones which are ridiculously unlikely, such as a fish!me who had grown up in an identical fashion and had identical opinions and memories of significant events.

Think of it this way, if you like. If we don't come up with good uploading/life-extension/etc tech in the next century, you will probably experience biological death. In the far future, a superintelligence may resurrect you. From your perspective, no time will have passed. You will remember a honking noise from the bus about to hit you (or whatever), and then you will be in a banal hospital-like resurrection recovery room. You cannot perceive non-existence, so from a subjective perspective, you will never have died.
