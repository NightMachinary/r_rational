You used a lot of words to say nothing.

I asked a question from my perspective, not yours. How is it that /I/ perceive you to be alive?

I know why you're not a lottery winner: the odds are too small that you'll become one. "Why haven't you tried to win the lottery?" and "Why are you still alive?" are equivalent questions. It's simple: construct a chamber that will kill you unless your lottery ticket has the winning numbers. By use of this pre-commitment mechanism, the only realities in which you, or someone like you, exists, are those in which you are a winner (or some other event happened that prevented you from dying, but that's more a matter of mechanism design). If you had done such a thing, then from my perspective, you would probably be dead (in the vast majority of realities).

Of course, I understand not taking the big risk/reward challenge for something you're not entirely certain on. 99% certain doesn't balance out on the odds of losing the lottery. But if you truly had such a belief, I would expect behaviors that correspond to big risk/reward payoffs. Do you tend towards such behaviors?

This is not possible. At least, not within the context of any physics or science currently known. Maybe if you have your brain preserved when you die. Maybe. Odds are you hear that honking noise, your brains get splattered across 50 yards of pavement, and gg.
