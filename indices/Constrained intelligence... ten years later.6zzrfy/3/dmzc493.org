This is probably best off in the worldbuilding thread, but I am intrigued by this post in general.

(Naruto Spoilers possibly incoming, you have been warned)

1) How far departed is your SI-World from Naruland?

2) Kyuubi is a standard intelligent beast. No indication he's any more intelligent than a standard Shinobi. In fact, given his past, his experiences make him less likely to be more intelligent than a random human in Naru-verse.

With those two, am I correct in assuming the following:

It's a standard no-prep, blind SI.

It's in-character for all the individuals involved.

Naruto is the person inserted into, and it's an SI which begins at Naruto's birth, when Kyuubi is sealed into the child.

SI may have knowledge of various character's abilities.

--------------

Rules will need to be added as well, regarding the communication between Naruto and the Kyuubii - What it takes for Naruto to talk to the Kyuubi in the first place.

The AI in a box is a lot different than the Kyuubi scenario, but I supposed you already know that.
