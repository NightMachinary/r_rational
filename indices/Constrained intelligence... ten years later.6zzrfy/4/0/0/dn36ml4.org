Actually I haven't read Crystal Society, but I'll add it to the list!

The premise for mine is that this is the first general artificial intelligence, around the level of a human; as a result of the conflicts in the first third, its actions are significantly constrained (focused on survival and not drawing undue attention), so it intentionally doesn't go down the superintelligence route. This does come up later on in a sequel, but not in any of the main characters, so I won't have to try to write them from their perspective.
