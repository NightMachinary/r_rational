So I think a strangely effective depiction of a nonhuman intelligence is in /The Prince of Nothing/, which makes a ton more sense if you view the protagonist Anasurimbor Kellhus (and by extension, all the members of the monastic order he belongs to, though they only figure in the story as memories) as a nonhuman AI in a meat body. A lot of his weirder abilities look basically like superintelligence, so the analogy works well. You might want to try that for more inspiration. :)

Mind you, this is a world so crapsack, it makes /Westeros/ look appealing. Careful. :P
