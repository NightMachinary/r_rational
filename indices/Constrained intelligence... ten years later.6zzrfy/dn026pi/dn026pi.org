Since you are in the naruto verse, goal one is the same as all inserts into that universe: "Break the back of the village system". Narutos universe has insanely useful magics that are used in really bloody stupid conflicts, because the people who discovered them were essentially the medieval equivalent of mobsters.

All the villages are insanely self-destructive and non-innovative politically and magically, and stay that way because any village that starts to set up a social system which is actually functional is obviously a long term threat to all the other villages, so gets sabotaged into ruin. Ninja villages being really good at espionage and sabotage, this is horrifically stable.

So... suggested goals: Go not just missing nin, but "Presumed dead" nin. With friends and as much lore as you can steal.
