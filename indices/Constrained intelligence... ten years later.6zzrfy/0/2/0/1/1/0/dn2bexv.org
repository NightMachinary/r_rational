There are theoretical limits. In order to even begin to break those limits, an intelligence needs access to more computational resources. The whole point of the AI Box is /constrained/ intelligence. The *box* is a limited amount of resources. In order to break those constraints and limitations, the AI needs access to resources outside the box.

Box aside, yes, there are many things that we can already do that even an optimally super-intelligent AI wouldn't be significantly better at. We can solve Checkers, Chess, and Go (and by we, I mean human programmers; your AI might be able to write a more efficient program, but the problems won't be any more solved). How would your AI create a better prediction of the weather? Maybe it uses a superior atmospheric model? While reasonable, most of the intelligence needed is just number crunching, which /we already do/. Even with a better model, there are limits.

Of course humans aren't optimally intelligent. Our brains are slow and clumsy at many important tasks. Most of these problems can be circumvented by incorporating computers into our workflows. Many writers have imagined what we could do if we had those computers in our heads. Machine Learning is an active field of research in computer science, and it has helped us solve all sorts of problems already. It still requires crunching lots of numbers.

And of course humans don't know everything. Research still continues, and anything we may discover in the future may be discovered by such an AGI. This doesn't remove the fact that an AGI operating on finite hardware has limited capabilities.

What your asking for is an AI to tell you that the currently understood laws of the universe are not true. That is a pipe dream. No intelligence (super or not) can make the universe not be the way it is. And perhaps there are holes in our understanding of physics that could give us one of these failed dreams. But not even a superintelligence is a turing oracle. Even with limitless computational resources, there are still limits.
