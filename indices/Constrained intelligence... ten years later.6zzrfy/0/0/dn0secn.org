There is an idea that I've been tossing around that might allow you to act like a limited superintelligence. I have a running joke with a friend that the Narutoverse is populated by complete morons, and their 'geniuses' are basically people who just managed to cross into triple-digit IQ land. This was inspired by the rather terrible decisions that pretty much everyone makes in canon, and the way they don't seem to use even the most obvious hacks at all.

Then after laughing about this for a bit, I began musing about how to make this true, and came up with the idea that adding chakra systems to humans adversely affected intelligence in various ways, while granting certain weird savant skills -- e.g., somehow they can manage to control chakra emissions well enough to run on water in combat, or react ludicrously fast to incoming attacks, or even that unbelievable move where they bat away twenty incoming projectiles with a small blade in the space of a couple seconds -- /without/ any of the eye hax that are all over the place.

(This was somewhat inspired by /The Wiz Biz/, in which the inhabitants of the world the protagonist ends up in are really bad at abstract thinking, because making vague statements is dangerous due to large amounts of wild magic causing unforeseen consequences.)

So then your SI can be a genuinely smart person suddenly thrust into the universe as the Kyuubi. Not quite a superintelligence, but he might look like one to the intellectually stunted inhabitants of that universe. :P
