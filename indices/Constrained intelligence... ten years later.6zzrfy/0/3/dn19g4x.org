  In an AI-fic, getting out of the box is so easy it's a joke. Begin by computing countless models for possible states of the world outside your box. Every interaction and non-interaction with anything outside the box is a bit of data that can be used to rule out the models that don't match reality, until you get a very precise picture of reality.

Not just wrong. Very wrong. Even if you had a Turing Oracle in the box with you, it still wouldn't be possible. Not every problem has a solution. The real world doesn't conveniently have solutions like a problems on a math test would. The universe isn't composed of analytic functions: you can't build a Taylor's Series from one little piece and extrapolate the rest of existence.
