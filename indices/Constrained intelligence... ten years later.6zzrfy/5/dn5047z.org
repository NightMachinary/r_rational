Probably not particularly meaningful, but... One of the background pieces of info in my fic is that as a mass of Yin Chakra, the Kyuubi can store arbitrarily large amounts of information in chakra matrices. He stores important memories and can store other things in that way, with the Gedo Mazo acting as a backup for all the bijuu. He also uses it to restore Naruto's memories whenever he heals Naruto's head or over time as the regeneration factor slowly destroys and recreates Naruto's mind.
