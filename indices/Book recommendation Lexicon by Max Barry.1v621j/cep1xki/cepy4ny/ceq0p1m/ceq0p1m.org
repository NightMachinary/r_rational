Self-reply: Having finished the book, I like that 1) from above is somewhat addressed (but not as fully as I could have hoped for, and not for several specific instances it likely would have proved helpful). That said, I have come to the realization that most of the central plot of this book is /basically/ Snow Crash, which was more original, was better written, and is overall a stunning novel that I will treasure to the end of time. So if you haven't, go read Snow Crash, because much of the central plot of this book is a rehash of a few of Snow Crash's many ideas. That said, if you wanted something else in the same subject matter as some of Snow Crash (having already read that book) then you could do worse than to look at Lexicon.
