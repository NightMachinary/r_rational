This is quite a late response, but one thing that is left out of some early-level/entry-level (undergrad) English Literature courses is just how small the 'movements' were. Something can only be reactionary against something else when the latter is widespread enough that people will be influenced by and/or push back against it for what is seen as flaws in that approach; or points of interest that can be expanded upon.

To take Modernism as an example; the Modernist 'movement', at least in Britain, was literally a style espoused by one small group of educated friends who all happened to be writers and publishers. Because of the circles they moved in, they were 'influential' as such, but more because of monopolies and a lack of a diverse market at the time than because the movement unanimously seized public interest. And even then, their readers were largely from a similar, /niche/ background to themselves - leisurely, upper-middle-class, not dependent on work for income, and able to devote plenty time to literary criticism and airing their opinions. It's only in the more recent decades that such Movements have been teased out and put onto a timeline, and treated as if they were definitively influential and read by a large and broad amount of people from different backgrounds.

In terms of Postmodernism; although classified as a Movement, I personally think a large number of factors (educated society, less judgement, emphasis on personal choice, emphasis on people's choices and lives being shaped by variable outside forces beyond their control but of the natural rather than supernatural variety) that affect our lives in society has resulted in it being in many ways a default logical human position in our society, rather than a deliberate form of thought or thinking cap that one can put on. Although postmodernism is identified theoretically with deliberate criticism of institutions, I think it is also symptomatic of people of all classes' ability nowadays to engage with and criticise institutions that before seemed to be innate and unshakeable. But I can understand how to people /in the bubble/, such criticisms now levelled at them can feel like they must be deliberate and calculated to shake them, rather than expected as people try to rationalise unfamiliar institutions and modes of behaviour very different to their own lives. Whew! That was a long one.
