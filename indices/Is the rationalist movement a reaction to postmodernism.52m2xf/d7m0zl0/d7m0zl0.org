  they make it sound like every literary/cultural/philosophical movement/era/paradigm shift they talk about came about as a reaction to the previous one.

I mean, they all occurred in a literary/social context, plus causality is a thing. Of course any new movement (that gets widespread/academic acceptance) will be aware of the context of the previous dominant one, and in some way a reaction to some features of it.

Also, it's an idea that divides the world into "good" (progressive) and "bad" (regressive), and then puts you and the people you're talking to into the "good" category. You should be careful with that kind of thing -- in general, the idea that you and your self-identified groups are awesome and wonderful and on the right side of history should be treated as though it's covered in big glowing red 'MEMETIC HAZARD' warning signs.

A less bad way to approach this might start with first creating a measure of "progress"/technological improvement, and then graphing it's rate of change against a measure of popularity of literary movemens/paradigms over time, /then/ calculating their correlation. This way, you start with the facts and work towards an (unknown) conclusion.
