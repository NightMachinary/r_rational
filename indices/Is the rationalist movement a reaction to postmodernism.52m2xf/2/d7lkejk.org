I don't /think/ so.

I think it would be an easier argument to claim that it's a reaction to 1960-ish sci-fi, with their knowledge heroes, Hari Seldon, etc. If you want to coach it in literary terms, calling it a resurgence of classic sci-fi themes makes more sense.

Pure 30's era modernism, which postmodernism is a reaction to. It's just carrying on that tradition, because it never fully died.

But honestly, it's like [[/u/FugeofAnotherWorld]] said

  To my knowledge the rationalist movement is a reaction to insufficiently good truth telling methods, and the inherent fuzziness of normal human thinking.

Postmodernism doesn't really come into it. Although one could argue that "restoring a naive view of truth" is a direct reaction to postmodern theory. Still, most rationalists didn't get on the postmodernism bandwagon to begin with.

Do you think postmodernism affected the sci-fi genre a whole lot?

In reality postmodernism is so ill-defined as to be nearly meaningless. Show me a list of post-modernist tropes.
