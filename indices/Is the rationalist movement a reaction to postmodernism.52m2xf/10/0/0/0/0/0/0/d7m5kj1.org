It's not what I was looking for. Wikipedia says "this is a logical fallacy about assuming that other people are wrong and sticking logical fallacies on them", so accusing someone of it is a bit of an hypocrisy.

I was thinking more in terms of "using logical fallacies to argue your point may be accurate (and technically legal under reddit law), but it's super rude and you shouldn't do it".
