/[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/][Knowing About Biases can Hurt People]]/ talks about this. A good quote from the post:

#+begin_quote
  I told the one about the problem of disconfirmation bias and sophisticated argument, and lo and behold, the next time I said something he didn't like, he accused me of being a sophisticated arguer. He didn't try to point out any particular sophisticated argument, any particular flaw---just shook his head and sighed sadly over how I was apparently using my own intelligence to defeat itself. He had acquired yet another Fully General Counterargument.
