The "best" (in my opinion) version of post-modernism is actually pretty convergent with rationalist / lesswrong-y ideas.

The rationalist movement is pretty much people re-inventing everything, including post-modernism. That's not a criticism, the rationalist movement reinvents things in ways that are much more clear and concise than mainstream philosophy.
