I would say that the more rational philosophies are less a reaction to non-rational philosophies and more just a continuation of where the last rationalist left off. Yudkowsky based his sequences off of modern cognitive science and AI theory, but he also based them off of the writings of people like Feynman and Francis Bacon. He likely would not have had the opportunity to do that writing if he hadn't been raised in a post-enlightenment country.

I don't know about the other authors (if I remember right, it was Hanson that first started this on Overcoming Bias, and Yudkowsky joined in later) but Eliezer has written freaking mountains about what sources inspired him. The only other rationalist-sphere blogger I follow is Scott Alexander, and I think he was driven to rationalism by his anxiety and nerdiness.
