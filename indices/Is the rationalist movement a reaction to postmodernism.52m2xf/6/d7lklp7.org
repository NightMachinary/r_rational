I've seen the term 'metamodernism' applied to what seems to be congruent with the lesswrong kind of rationalism (which is more about intelligently applying empiricism + rationality to get correct results and win at life, not the older idea that everything can be divined by reason alone). Postmodernism is skepticism of modernism, which is in turn a sort of naive progressivism. Metamodernism critiques both.

The terminology is /really/ confusing, because 'modern' is (in the common vernacular) synonymous with being up to date and reflecting the latest state of technology and knowledge. Which is not precisely how the ivory tower intellectuals mean it when they talk about 'modern art' or 'modernity'.
