No. If it were a reaction to postmodernism, you would expect rationality to talk about how bad postmodernism is. As it is, it just ignores is, except where it grants that certain writers make good points.

If anything, rationalism is a sort of resurgence of Modernist or Logical Positivist thought that incorporates the objections of Quine in its approach to science and is similar to certain postmodern writers in how it regards the arbitrariness of many symbols relative to what they represent. Of course, rationalism is different in some other ways, too (e.g., the goal-directedness implied by the phrase "rationalism is systematized winning"), but these others don't strike me as deep philosophical characterizations. That's my take on it, anyway.

English literature is best regarded as art, and in art, one of the best ways to demonstrate that you are new and exciting is to cast yourself in dramatic opposition to the old ways. So it isn't true that every movement arises as a reaction to the previous one, but it might well seem that way if you're examining it through the lens of literature.

Meanwhile, it's probably unwise to think of the history of thought the way you've laid it out. For example, Romanticism really stressed the importance of feelings over intellect, but more technological advancement happened in the Romantic period than in the Renaissance, despite how you've categorized them. (The message to be taken here isn't that Romanticism+ and Renaissance-, it's that modeling history how you've done here isn't especially useful without a great deal more nuance, and so the model should perhaps be discarded for now. I would be happy to elaborate, if desired.)
