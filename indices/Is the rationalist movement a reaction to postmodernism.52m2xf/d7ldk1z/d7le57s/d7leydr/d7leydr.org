  I just followed the link, and that doesn't sound like what I'm doing at all. Nothing I said above implied that things HAD to go the way they did or that things always went from worse to better.

But you're obviously engaging in motivated cognition to find ways in which they do.

For example, I'd propose post-rationalism is a better candidate for the "reaction" case against postmodernism, of which rationalism is the tail end. And that the action-reaction model is a poor fit to begin with.
