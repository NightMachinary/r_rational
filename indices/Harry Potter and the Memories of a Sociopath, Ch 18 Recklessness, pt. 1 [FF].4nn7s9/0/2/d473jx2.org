Well, 'Black Cloaks, Red Clouds', for example, is a Naruto fic that has 58 chapters, ~433,000 words, and has been up since October 2012 and it only has 610 reviews. I don't know how valid this method is, but if you take the number of reviews 'Harry Potter and the Memories of a Sociopath' has and multiply it by the ratio of the words counts of the stories, and then by the amount of time 'Black Cloaks, Red Clouds' has been up in years, you get ~1000 reviews.

This approximation is /extremely/ rough, and isn't meant as an accurate model of the amount of reviews this story would have, but simply to compare it to a (in my opinion) very well written story that has comparatively few reviews for its length and age.

So I don't really think popularity is a great reason to be skeptical of a story's quality. Not to say that the most popular things aren't also often some of the best (just look at HPMOR or as a counter example 'Chunin Exam Day'), but that unpopular things aren't always bad. I just used entirely too many words to do so. Mind, I've not yet read this so I have no idea how good it is, it may be terrible.
