I've mentioned this story several times in several different Reddit threads but here goes anyway. True love loophole [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10983213][www.fanfiction.net/s/10983213]] Ever after high, boarding school for the children of fairytale characters. The fandom is mostly semi plotless fluff, some WAFFy, some angst, nothing really huge, maybe 10k words avg.

And then there's this. ~271,000 words, 900 page, epic love story, that takes some not-terribly-well thought out elements from canon, and tries really hard to make them make sense. She mostly suceeds.

Also happens to be in the top 3 for reviews in that fandom.

I usually go by length when browsing for a story; IMHO it's damn hard to write 60k words that go nowhere.
