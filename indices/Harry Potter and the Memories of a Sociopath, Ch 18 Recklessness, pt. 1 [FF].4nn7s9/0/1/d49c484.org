Reviews are definitely not the absolute arbiter of quality - just look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10130558/1/Attack-of-the-Deranged-Mutant-Killer-Monster-Dark-Lord][this obscure crossover]] with over 250 reviews. It doesn't even have a plot, aside from a rehash of the actual still-not-really-a-plot plot! Why did people even keep reading? And it's been abandoned for forever - I mean, if the author went through the trouble of writing 133k words of this plotless nonsense, he could have at least had the decency to finish it.
