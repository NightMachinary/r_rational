I haven't read this story yet, but just to say that number of reviews is not a good metric by which to judge a story.

As an example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395][Changeling]] is from 2011 and has only 127 reviews, but it's in my opinion one of the best written HP stories I've ever read. If you look at the reviews they're very complimentary, and many are by some of the best authors in the fandom.
