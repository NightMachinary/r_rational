I agree that reviews can be a somewhat inconsistent metric.

Here's my question though; what do you think leads to such a disparity? Like we've all seen awesome stories that don't get the respect they deserve. And we've also seen shit stories that get way more praise/popilarity than they deserve (Fifty Shades of Grey is the embodiment of this trope for me)

What exactly causes such a thing?
