I don't know exactly, but I think one factor -and probably the main one in the case of the changeling- is having few chapters. People tend to leave a review either when they finish reading a story or when they read the latest chapter. Having a 140k word story with only 6 chapters makes even conscientious readers leave less reviews.

It also probably makes it less likely that someone that subscribed to the story when it started will keep reading it when they get an alert 5 years after.

You know what's funny? I just noticed that the changeling has 3x more faves and 4x more follows than it has reviews, haha. Maybe those two are a better metric for quality? I don't know, I tend to find new things exclusively from recommendations.
