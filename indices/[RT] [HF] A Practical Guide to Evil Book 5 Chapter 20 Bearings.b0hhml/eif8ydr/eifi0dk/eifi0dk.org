Not relying on artifacts is a tricky rule. When foreshadowed properly, they are guaranteed to work at least once - which, for continuously used tools like swords and armor, means they are indeed ticking time bombs after the initial reveal.

However, the artifacts with discrete uses allow to actually keep track of those, meaning that one-shot trinkets like the blackwood wistle or the Stairway are essentially guaranteed to succeed unless the opposition catches the wind of them too early and turns it into a race to prevent their activation. Stuff like Akua's flying hellgate generator falls int the middle: the first deployment will go smoothly as planned by Akua/Malicia, but after that it has a giant target painted on it.

On that scale the "silver bullet' type of artifact looks rather formidable: both of those are meant for one specific occasion, so they will do the damage should Cat be in a position for it, though she'll have to come up with another workaround if the dawn-related miracles are easily accesssible.
