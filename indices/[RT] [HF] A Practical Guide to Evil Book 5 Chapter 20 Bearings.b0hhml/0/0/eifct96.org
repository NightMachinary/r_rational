I think that was alluded to with Akua's line about "opposing their miracles directly". The plan goes something like this, I think:

1. Cat starts a fight at night, because that's when the drow function.

2. The Pilgrim invokes the Holy Light, creating a magical Dawn, which strips Cat's Evil Army of it's power.

3. Cat unleashes the well, not to suppress the Dawn, but to cloak the drow in Dusk.

Using it to protect her own army is much more story-allowed than trying to oppose a Hero move like Dawn. The Hero army gets the Dawn just fine. But the drow still get to fight in the shade.
