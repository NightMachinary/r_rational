I very much question Cat's answer to both for the Pilgrim and the Saint. Making artifact of pure darkness is classic villainy and those tend to fail the villain during the hero's darkest hour for the heroic comeback.

Those would probably be better suited against the Tyrant and the Hierarch since they are villains as well.
