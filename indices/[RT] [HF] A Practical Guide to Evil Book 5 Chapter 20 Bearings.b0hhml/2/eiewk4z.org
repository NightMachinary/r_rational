So I'm kinda sloppy at keeping track of details in this story (in my defense, stuff often takes literally months or years to resolve and involves complicated narrative/magical triggers) but why is Cat no longer bound to kill Akua? Is it just cause she let go of Winter and is no longer magically compulsed? Did Akua's chase in here metaphysical basis for existence somehow void the oath? It seems to me Cat still has a duty based on principle to hold to the oath to off Akua once she's no longer useful, but I may have missed something.
