I think its clear that Cat's casual word or oath without specific moment, like her blood oath no longer has magical significance, since winter was stripped from her.

Weather her agreement to thief has narrative significance, especially with Vivian Dartwick likely transitioning to a regent or ruling name has Narrative significance, is not a trick I think Cat missed judging by her discussion of prices.
