Interesting. The 'wish' made a question mark pop up above my head (effectively, 'Why?' (did it work)); there's also the question of why/when it was written down. The strongest impression I got was that a lot near the beginning closely mirrored the start of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, particularly around the 'heartfelt speeches' memory. If you have a copy, it might be worth rereading that part and then separating the two.
