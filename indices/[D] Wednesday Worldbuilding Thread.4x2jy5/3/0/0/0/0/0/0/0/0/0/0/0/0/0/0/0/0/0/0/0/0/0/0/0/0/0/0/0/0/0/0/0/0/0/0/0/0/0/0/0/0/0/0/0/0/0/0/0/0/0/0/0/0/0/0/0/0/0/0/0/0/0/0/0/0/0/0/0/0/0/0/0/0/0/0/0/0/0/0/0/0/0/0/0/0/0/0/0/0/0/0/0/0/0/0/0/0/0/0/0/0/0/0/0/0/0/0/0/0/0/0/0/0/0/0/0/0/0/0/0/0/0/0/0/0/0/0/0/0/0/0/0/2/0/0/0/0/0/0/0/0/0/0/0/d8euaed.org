  Yeah. OK. I will put it in the back of my mind and hope I get used to the idea because it seems so... silly. Then again, there's folklore about them not being able to stand the sight of a cross, and how is the sight of the sun any different?
#+end_quote

It's not the sight; it's having the image somehow come into contact with the vampire. (Same thing would happen if they actually touched the Sun, but for obvious reasons no vampire has ever actually done that).

But there's precedence in stories about magic - specifically, sympathetic magic. The idea is that things that look alike have a certain degree of magical linkage, and the more alike they look the stronger the link. Harry Dresden used something of the sort when he created a scale model of Chicago to scry with; and the idea of the voodoo practitioner sticking needles in a doll to give the linked person debilitating pain is also linked to this.

In this case, the Sun is cursed - and very strongly cursed - where vampires are concerned; so things that share a sympathetic or magical link with the Sun (i.e. fire, gold (more alchemical than sympathetic, perhaps) and accurate images of the sun) are all harmful to vampires. And the stronger the link, the stronger the effect - gold that's /on fire/ will kill vampires faster than either gold or fire on their own. (Gold that's on fire and looks exactly like the Sun is just overkill).

  Yep. Let's hope the local university doesn't have a sunspot specialist whose adoring life partner didn't get a local nano-material printer to make her a special, gold ring for their 50th anniversary.

Honestly, the fact that it's gold is probably enough already... but even the wrong page from a modern astronomy textbook could have a nasty surprise if touched.

  I am now imagining that not handling your own money is a vampire custom that has survived more or less intact to this day, though it's beginning to get less adhered to.

...that makes sense, yes.

    would the drugs injected into the jannissary as part of the feeding process have a negative effect on the child?
  #+end_quote

  I'm going to say that the kids are probably a little less bright on average, and more likely to be stillborn or miscarried, but they suffer more as a result of their no doubt inevitably unconventional upbringing, and might come into the world addicted to feeding vampires the same way some babies come into the world addicted to heroin.

Okay, so negative effect, yes, but minor. Still, a vampire who goes to /that/ amount of effort just to get a child is going to want /everything/ to be just /pErFeCt!!!!/

...which means tht the surrogate can be neither jannissary or ghoul. And... there might not be another parent, the child would quite possibly be a straight clone of the vampire. (If there is another "parent", the selection process will be exhaustive, and he'll probably be a Nobel prize winner or Olympic athlete or both and might not know that his DNA has been harvested).

Options include:

- Kidnap someone. Jannissaries in local law enforcement will keep the investigation(s) away.
- The surrogate does not know that the backer is a vampire, she just knows he's really rich and willing to pay off all her debts in exchange for nine months of discomfort and having to follow the provided diet.
- The surrogate was briefly in a hospital where some of the doctors are jannissaries. She does not know the child is not hers (and may or may not be expending significant effort trying to figure out how there could possibly have been a father)
- The surrogate is aware of vampires (and that the parent is one) and has a very good idea of what will happen to her if she objects to anything. Fear keeps her obedient.

After the baby is born, I guess the surrogate might or might not be permitted to leave alive... in some circumstances, the surrogate might end up being a kind of foster parent as well (what vampire really wants to deal with dirty nappies?)
