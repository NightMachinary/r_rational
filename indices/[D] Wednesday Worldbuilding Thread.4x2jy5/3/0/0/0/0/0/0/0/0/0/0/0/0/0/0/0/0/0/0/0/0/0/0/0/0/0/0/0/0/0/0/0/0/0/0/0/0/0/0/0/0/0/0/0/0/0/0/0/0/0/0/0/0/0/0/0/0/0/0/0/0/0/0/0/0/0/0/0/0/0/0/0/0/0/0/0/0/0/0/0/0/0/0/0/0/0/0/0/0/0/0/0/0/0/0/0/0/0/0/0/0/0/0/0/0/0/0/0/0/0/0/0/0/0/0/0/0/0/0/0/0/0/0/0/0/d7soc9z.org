  I'm saying that [4D vision] /can/ work this way, and this neutralises a lot of the advantages. In short, I'm trying to suggest a way in which it can work, without giving free X-ray vision as a consequence.

Yeah... I think the problem is I want X-Ray vision. Being a gargoyle whose only wish in life is to protect whoever his master is at the time, as well as have a family every few hundred years does not put him in a very powerful position, plot-wise, if that makes sense. The tension is mostly from the vampire hunters vs his master (William), and the head vampire hunter has become a secret jannisary (of William) after a bungled sting operation, which means she's kind of sort of but not really delaying the capturing of the vampire even though they know a LOT about him, ultimately resulting in her taking big risks with a different vampire and getting another character (Red, William's former thrall) killed by a /third/ vampire as a result and thus ultimately turned into a vampire himself. (Not complicated at all, is it?)

  I don't know much about Calabi-Yau manifolds either. But one potential niggle strikes at me - if a 4D creature is locally untwisting one of these extra dimensions, then surely the following consequences follow:

  - Any magic [or 4D radar] dependant on this is limited in range to the area of the untwisted space
#+end_quote

My understanding is that the magic itself can untwist it. So, for example, if you're shooting a magic missile at someone 10m away, the spell uncurls your local space to have a projectile/force/etc in it, and then the spell also causes the missile to push itself forward until it hits real matter, maybe kind of sort of like a glider in the game of life? Similarly, the 4D radar could untwist locally.

#+begin_quote

  - As a consequence of the above, the 4D radar can only see another 4D being if they're close enough that their untwisted region overlaps the gargoyle's untwisted region, at which point they're both in range to throw untwist-dependant magic at each other.

Yes, this was one of the issues my husband raised (4D creatures can only see each other 'in range'), which is why I told him I didn't like the idea at first. I think there's a workaround, though, that has everything working.

    Yes, but the image of clowns is just +gold+ horrifying.

  Nothing to see here. Move along. Move along. Nothing to see here.

The world is full of mysteries........ I wonder what is there, lurking beneath the surface ?
