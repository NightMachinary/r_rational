  Ah, a classic dungeon bypass scene.

  (I take it the aliens didn't have throwable explosive weapons...)
#+end_quote

Umm. They must have, surely? But I don't recall any.

  Hmmmm. Transmit, yes, but (a) I see nothing about receiving, and (b) all that is means is that if you really want to isolate it, you need a faraday cage.
#+end_quote

Until someone figures out how to use a computer to transmit vibrations in the ground that can be picked up.... I just imagine AGI as being able to do literally anything because I'm probably not far off.

#+begin_quote
  Anyhow, this is all irrelevant the point (which wasn't as clear as it should have been, for which I apologise). Yes, you can simply say that Sufficiently Advanced Magic allows control of someone by having Control Particles hit the retina - but you can equally well say that Sufficiently Advanced Magic allows control of something by having Control Particles hit the cornea.
#+end_quote

If that's the case, then we're back to eye contact not actually being necessary - which could be fine, but maybe not.

    a medusa-like Gorgon wears a full on burka and dark glasses to operate in society. I always wondered if it makes sense. I suppose with mirrored glasses you don't see any of her....
  #+end_quote

  I am left wondering what her hair thinks about being trapped under fabric like that all the time. I'm imagining some seriously unhappy snakes.
#+end_quote

I'm now wondering if she just had a "haircut" and had some seriously dead snakes, or if the snakes are just.... friendly and chill with the arrangement? Actually, if they were kept cold, they might just sleep most of the time anyway. Assuming snake hair has any actual biological similarity to actual snakes.

  ...lack of political representation is probably going to keep things pretty bad for them, unfortunately. I mean, lots of people will say the right things, but with little actual personal stake in the whole thing, plus they get most of the advantage in terms of votes by simply saying the right things without putting much effort into doing the right things... well, I don't expect them to put much effort into the actual doing.
#+end_quote

Yeah. That's really depressing but all too true. We still don't have /gay marriage/ here so we're surprisingly backwards. That said we've effectively had compulsory gay (and poly) common law marriage since 1999 so.... we're not all bad?

  #+begin_quote
    Probably won't. Let's hope the aliens are nice when they come.
  #+end_quote

  Yeah, especially given that they're going to be several million years more advanced than us. (Maybe they'll have solved this problem already).
#+end_quote

We can only hope.

    I'm not sure about what the inter-tribal relationships in pre-colonial Australia were like. Generally speaking, we're dealing with nomadic people living on the land whereas it sounds like the Zulus and Xhosas had a lot more infrastructure?
  #+end_quote

  They had mud huts and cattle herds. They'd already pushed the Khoisan (and Khoikhoi) out of all the good spots and into the desert, and the Zulus were very much a warrior people (think Klingons without the technology and you won't be too far off).
#+end_quote

Yeah, apart from dingos (which are not actually native to Australia, they came with the aboriginies), the Australian aboriginies didn't domesticate anything. I'd be curious about inter-tribal warfare and that sort of thing. You'd imagine there'd be competition for resources if nothing else.

#+begin_quote
  The Internet might well have taken them by surprise.

"What? There's a forum where people are sharing their experiences? Someone has run a /controlled experiment/ on vombies and worked out that 24 carat gold produces the best results and silver does nothing? They've worked out that cammomile prevents restoration? How???"

    ...he probably turned a bunch of Cardinals as time went along, trying to get a group that did what he wanted.
  #+end_quote

  Maybe not. Maybe he doesn't feel that it's right to deny them Heaven, and he's really grumpy that he's been stuck here for so long.
#+end_quote

Oh god, you're right. "I have been damned and my soul has been destroyed. All I can do is make sure everyone follows the True Path". Maybe he ended up in one of the many christian offshoots from catholicism.
