OK, the shirt thing is complicated, and we worked out there were two ways you could do it: you could invent a physics explanation, involving transforming beings creating a localised "4D field" for wont of a better word, and that would result in the clothes tearing as you described. Or, without the particular physics explanation my husband thought was cool, you end up with what I described.

  This implies that it somehow 'sticks' to the three-dimensional surface of our world - and the occupant of those clothes, sliding four-dimensionally through them, is not going to provide anything like the force necessary to overcome that stickiness. Rather, the clothes will 'fall' around the three-dimensional body.

Basically, the analogy we had was imagine if you were visiting Flatland and you were using your finger as your Flatland avatar. You buy a piece of flatlander clothing to put around your finger, wrapping it around your finger and clipping it in place. Then if you move so much as a micron up or down, your clothing 'disappears', but it remains clipped to that part of your finger. Think of a rubber band.

If you wanted to have your finger stay in Flatland a lot and didn't want to go to the trouble of holding it exactly at the correct angle, you could grab a glove from the 3D world and put it on, so it would look like you were wearing a piece of flatlander clothing all the time. You could also ask a tailor in Flatland to make you a big piece of circular cloth with a slit cut in it, walk your finger into the center of it, and then repair the slit so your finger is "stuck" inside a disc of cloth. Then you pull your finger up and the cloth drapes around you, clipping it into place, to sort of make a "white sheet ghost costume" style piece of clothing for your finger. The 3D analog to this would be creating a sphere (out of something like diamond, probably) with a hole in it, climbing inside it, closing the hole in it around your body, and then moving in the fourth dimension so the sphere covers each 3D 'cross section' of your 4D body, morphsuit-style. You could then have someone paint each 3D 'frame' of the 'morphsuit' so it looks 'clothing-like' and cut holes in the head/hands/feet so it looks more socially acceptable, if you wanted to spend time on that.

If your tail appearing through a wooden door can push the door into the 4th dimension and then when the tail disappears again, the door 'snaps back', then moving 'up' in 4D space will push your clothing into the 4th dimension since it's fastened to you. Don't forget, a 4D being has so much mass that they have the momentum to do this.

It also means that you can kill someone by pushing them into the 4th dimension, or by having your tail go through them, etc. It also means that if you transform, anyone who is hugging you might asphyxiate.

  I'll trust his calculations, but if the mass of a 4D being is the mass of the entire 4D being and not just the current 3D slice, then the bat-form vampire is going to weigh exactly the same as the human-form vampire. And whichever way round you handle that, it just isn't going to work.

  I recommend going with the claim that there are no Higgs bosons in 4D space if anyone asks, and just treat the creature as if it were the mass of the slice currently in the 3D universe.

Yeah, I should have been clearer; this was always the plan. You can have a 4D 10^{13} -human-mass vampire/bat hybrid, but "in real life" they only weigh the amount that their 3D slice weighs - so basically exactly what you'd expect. It would mean, though, that when moving in the 4th dimension they have a lot of momentum.

  Done correctly, a normal, 3D human can stroll down there no problem, but no shapeshifter can squeeze in... and it's going to annoy vampires and werewolves like anything, because they can't see why they can't squeeze in.
#+end_quote

Oh my god.... yes. And most werewolves aren't aware they're werewolves, so there are "humans" with these "silent" 4D protrusions who won't be able to enter secret anti-vampire vaults. It also is a good way for "Our Heroes" to be able to protect themselves from vampires among other things.

  What happens if some of his programmed desires conflict? Such as, for example, if he has to protect a vampire but also has a lower-level compulsion to kill vampires? Does he take up hunting other vampires as a hobby?
#+end_quote

Possibly. I'd look at it as basically one of Asimov's classic robot stories; lots of room for interpretation. However, the gargoyle has free will, a family, etc. At one point, his master was about to eat his girlfriend (who was snooping around his master's quarters), and he attacked his master to save her - though canonically this happened right before the binding spell was due to be strengthened, so he was probably at an unusually high "free will" level.

Love those, thankyou! Especially the tuxedo and serving drinks. Such things are probably surprisingly important, especially when at a moment's notice he can become a giant death gargoyle and protect you.
