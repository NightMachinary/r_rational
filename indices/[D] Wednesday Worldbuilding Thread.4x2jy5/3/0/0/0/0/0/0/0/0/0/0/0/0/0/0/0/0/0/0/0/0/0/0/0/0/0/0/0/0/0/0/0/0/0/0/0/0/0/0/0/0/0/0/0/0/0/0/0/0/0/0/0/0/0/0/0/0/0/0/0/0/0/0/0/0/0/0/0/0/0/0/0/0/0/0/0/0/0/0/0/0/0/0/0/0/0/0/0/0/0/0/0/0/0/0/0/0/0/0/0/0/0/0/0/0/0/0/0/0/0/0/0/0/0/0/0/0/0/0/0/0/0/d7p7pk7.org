  After all, what self-respecting old vampire doesn't have a vombie in reserve? Surely William told Red (his baby vampire protege) about this?
#+end_quote

Makes sense to me.

#+begin_quote
  We're in [[/r/rational]] so I'm a bit loath to suggest a vampire would have put a vombie in a coffin without a stake through the heart to immobilise it
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] I didn't think of that, but you're right, it would be a logical precaution. So Red'll just open this box and there's William lying there with a stake through his heart.

#+begin_quote
  Yep. Containing the Vombie would be so /annoying/ for William, who had to stop writing one of his pages, and he has to start it all over again because the person he offended would be able to tell he didn't do the whole page in a single masterful stroke, and now, that won't do, will it?
#+end_quote

It really shouldn't have to be. I mean, the gargoyle's right there, right? And he's not /much/ of a vampire's bodyguard if he can't handle just one rogue vombie on his own. (It's not like vombies are at all intelligent about how they do things, after all).

#+begin_quote
  I don't understand what you mean like this. Are you saying he can't see through walls?
#+end_quote

Let's say that he closes his eyes, covers his ears, and so on and so forth; that he is, for a while, perceiving the universe /only/ via his 4D radar.

The universe looks like a flat sheet. A /perfectly/ flat sheet, with hardly a bump on it to stand out. There are, in fact, three bumps in the area; these being William, William's vombie, and Red - all being vampires, and thus 4D beings, lets them stand out a bit from the flat 3D universe around them. He can see their 4D shapes clearly, no matter what walls may lie between them.

But now consider a number of closed boxes, in the storeroom. /This/ box contains a number of books.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

/This/ box contains a supply of vintage playing cards.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

/That/ box contains a selection of antique cuckoo clocks.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

The box way over there contains a multitude of brightly coloured scarves.

To the gargoyle's 4D radar, the contents look flat and shiny.

...you see what I'm getting at? He can see around ordinary 3D walls, but ordinary 3D objects all look the same - flat and shiny - to his 4D radar. Until he actually opens the box, he can't tell whether it contains books or bricks.

#+begin_quote
  We'll see if it ever comes up.
#+end_quote

Okie dokie lokie.

#+begin_quote
  I can see it now; three guys dressed as clowns, with a huge bunch of balloons. Maybe not as stealthy as they'd have hoped though...
#+end_quote

Yeah, they're going to stand out a bit. The occasional whisper of "Don't drift apart so much!" from somewhere in their midst is only going to make it more difficult.
