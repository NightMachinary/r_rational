  Still, the same sort of "idea". Air and smoke are not as dense as glass. So it's just about having a certain density of material in between your eyes and the vampire's. Being behind a thin sheet of tissue paper might not protect you, but an ordinary piece of glass would.
#+end_quote

Okay, so a solid object or a serious amount of gas. A pair of glasses will prevent it; the air in a normal room won't, but if I'm standing on the top of a mountain and the vampire is standing down in the valley, then even if he can look directly into my eyes at that distance there's probably enough air between us to counter the effect.

That seems reasonable.

Of course, there's probably going to be a vampire hunter who thinks, incorrectly, that mirrored sunglasses are necessary, and considers it more evidence in favour of this hypothesis every time that the mirrored sunglasses /work/...

...actually, talking of mirrors, if the vampire and the victim are both looking at a mirror and the vampire's eyes meet those of the victim's /reflection/, does that work?

(Related to that, in mythology vampires don't have a reflection. Do your vampires have reflections? I don't think we've discussed that...)

#+begin_quote
  I will have to look into that, see what's around.
#+end_quote

I think some of the types of fake gold are merely alloys that include a little gold, but not as much as has been advertised. Or are gold-plated instead of being pure gold. And both of those are probably still effective against vampires.

...a bit of googling suggests that gold-plating is common when dealing with fake gold (presumably because then you're sure you have the colour right).

But copper is more plentiful and cheaper yet has very similar metallurgical properties to gold (same column in the periodic table). I'd be very surprised if there wasn't some alloy of copper that looked gold at first glance. (It would probably get the weight wrong, there's not many metals as heavy as gold)

#+begin_quote
  That said, at that point, Our Heroes might be under the impression it's silver that's the big boogey man, so it's like a double fake-out.
#+end_quote

...fair point.

#+begin_quote
  Nah, werewolves aren't vulnerable to anything in particular (I mean, bullets will hurt them just as much as you'd expect!).
#+end_quote

Okay, that different to the mythological werewolves. (Who would be hurt by silver, but were invulnerable to anything else).

(Actually that could be due to some ancient werewolves trying to spread the rumour that they were invulnerable - together with arranging suitable demonstrations that seemed to prove it - until one brave villager really /did/ genuinely attack with a silver knife and drove the pack away, leading to the legend that werewolves were invulnerable to anything except silver, an impression that the wolves themselves are in no hurry to correct)

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, all vampire hunting would be after hours, and she wouldn't have time for any hobbies whatsoever, so she could conceivably do both. She can also be "very dedicated to her job" and "stay back after hours" to "finish paperwork", AKA do half-assed paperwork and work on leads. Hell, maybe at one point she found some sort of (invisible?) demon who was happy to do her paperwork for her while she does "more important research things", like that fairy tale about the cobblers and the elves.
#+end_quote

That could work, but does the invisible demon have the necessary clearance to work on the secret stuff?

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, also, she's a pretty standard Action Girl archetype, has some decent MMA training, really good with a crossbow, etc, so I think it really would be a disservice to her character to have her "just" be a secretary.
#+end_quote

Secretaries have actually got incredible power. Especially when it comes to keeping the minutes of meetings (and /especially/ when the people doing the meeting are a little elderly and their memories are no longer all that reliable).

Plus it gives her an excuse to look at pretty much any bit of paper she wants to.

(It's also possible that the secretarial duties are the one thing that /nobody/ wants to do, and she keeps getting assigned them on the basis of her flagrant violation of uniform code with regard to coloured contact lenses which no-one notices except when it's time to decide who gets to fill in the paperwork)

#+begin_quote
  Yep. A kind of mutual understanding; and the Captain benefits because the slayer is doing /all the little things perfectly/, lest she draw attention to herself. Her performance reviews probably state she's a model employee but a bit impulsive and would still benefit from close supervision.
#+end_quote

Yep, that works.

#+begin_quote
  Cool! We have a lot of South African immigrants here for some reason.
#+end_quote

Politics. When the ANC came to power, a lot of people thought the country would go the same way as most African countries coming out of colonial rule, i.e. massive internal collapse because the guys in charge have little to no idea how to run a country and are enthusiastically getting rid of everyone who does know how to run a country.

There were a lot of people who left around then.

And, yes, there have been a few hiccups and problems since then, but /significantly/ less than anyone would have expected; Mandela played a big part in making sure the country didn't fall right off the rails but only wobbled a little. (Unfortunately, Mandela's successors have been nowhere near his level, but fortunately the vulnerable period had already passed by then).

  I used to work for one actually. That said, Stargate's Baal (Cliff Simon) was my teenage crush and his accent was just awesome.
#+end_quote

...I've seen the film, but I don't really remember his accent.

Have you seen /District Nine/?

#+begin_quote
  As does probably everywhere I guess!
#+end_quote

[[/twibeam][]] Probably!

[[/twismug][]] If you really want me to give you some stats that other countries can't match... we've got an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fynbos][entire floral kingdom]] enclosed within our borders. And it's the only floral kingdom that actually /relies/ on regular fires to propagate.

    And Equestria. (Yes, seriously. I've been there. It's nothing like the show, it's just a suburb that coincidentally has that name)
  #+end_quote

  ... Is it full of tourists (or was it) taking photos at the signs? Is it like a mini Fucking, Austria?
#+end_quote

Didn't see any. I don't think the brony fandom is /that/ ubiquitous.

  I asked him, he said that in undergrad you're often given descriptions of imaginary patients and asked what techniques you'd apply and how, what things you'd do differently based on their history, etc. They also do tons of clinical stuff if they want to go the clinical route. So it's probably similar to MDs - they are drilled on the material, they watch other people do it, they do it whilst other people watch, and then finally they're let off into the world with the mentors they've found along the way.
#+end_quote

Okay, that seems a perfectly believable level of caution, now that I see it laid out.

One might assume that a mind-mage in training would receive a similar level of care in his education. Even if there's only one other mind-mage in the world who can train him, and half /his/ time will be spent finding and training a successor...

  maybe catholicism from circa 400 CE is very different to modern catholicism.
#+end_quote

Different? Oh, yes, /very/ different. That would have been before the Protestant Revolution, before the Spanish Inquisition, before... oh, before a /lot/ of history.

...actually, perhaps he got involved in the purchase of indulgences, and thus believes himself immune to all sin, past, present and future? (There were certainly people who thought that [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Works_of_Martin_Luther,_with_introductions_and_notes,_Volume_1/Disputation_on_Indulgences#Albrecht][indulgences could do that]] in fact, that's one of the things Luther was complaining about).
