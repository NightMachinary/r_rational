  How much distortion can the image take before it stops being effective? How bent can a mirror be and still work?
#+end_quote

Hmm. If I say 0, then that means a vampire can cover his house with, say, funhouse mirror type glass and it'll be fine (right? Or would the tiny images of the sun still appear?). Does light get distorted under water?

I'd want a vampire to still get burned by light going through water, and light going through any sort of clear lens. No direct sunlight, however distorted. But does that ruin things for us again???

  Ah, good point - you need a family with a certain approach to wealth. You could still pick a surrogate with the right approach
#+end_quote

Yeah; basically, choose an appropriate family, and if they'd benefit from a bit of cash then it should be pretty easy to provide it.
