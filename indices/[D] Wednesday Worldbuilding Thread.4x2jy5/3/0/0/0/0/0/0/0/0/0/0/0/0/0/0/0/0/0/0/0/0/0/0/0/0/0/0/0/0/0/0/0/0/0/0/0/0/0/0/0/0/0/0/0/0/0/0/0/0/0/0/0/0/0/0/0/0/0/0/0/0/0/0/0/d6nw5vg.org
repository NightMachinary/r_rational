  there's probably trade offs.

Hmmm. The Atlantean mages would have liked vision-of-the-future, but not the side effects. This implies that perhaps his genetics are not /quite/ perfect - he is, in effect, unlocking one function of magic but doing it wrong. (Like holding a broken torch that shocks you when you turn it on - you push the switch, and get light /and/ a shock. But someone with a properly working torch would just get the light.)

I'm thinking the ancient Atlantean mage-kings would have had /all/ of the magical talents and /none/ of the negative effects. (Yes, yes, massively overpowered, but you can do that in the distant past.) Presumably even some control over what part of the future they see (or at least an understanding over what parts they could or could not see - that ancient war probably involved both sides seeing and then trying to steer the future to their advantage).

  Another character is at the 'above average reflexes' level, from a family of Chinese kung fu masters that are assisted by this magic, which might make the 'descendants of atlantis' theory less tenable (actually - he's the cousin of the magician, so atlantis could easily have been in ancient china....).

Nah, Atlantis was way, way, /way/ back. Before humanity left Africa at all. /Way/ before the Chinese got to China. Descendants of their mage-kings can be found in of pretty near all ethnic groups at this point (though the genes are massively watered down, further reducing available magical power), because they predate humanity's division into current ethnic groups.

See? Simple and straightforward.

  Magic not spreading hugely through the gene pool is a huge problem. Easy way out is to say the genes also have a negative effect on fertility.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Questionable utility. Even if magic reduces /your/ fertility, you'll use it to aid your sister's family; increasing the odds of /her/ children surviving and being successful, and thus increasing the fitness of genes very closely related to you.

It might be worthwhile to simply ignore this question entirely. Most readers won't ask it, and those few that do will note it down to suspension of disbelief. (The other strategy that can work is for the characters to ask the question, but be unable to find an answer, simply a consistent set of facts).
