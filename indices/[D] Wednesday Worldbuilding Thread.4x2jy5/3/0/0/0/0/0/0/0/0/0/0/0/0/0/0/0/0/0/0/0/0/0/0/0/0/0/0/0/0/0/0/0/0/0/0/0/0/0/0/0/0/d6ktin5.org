[[/shynervous][]] Well, like I said, when you get to the point where not only can you power up a jannisary to vampire levels, but you have enough mental energy to control several ghouls, there's probably very few vampires who would stand in your way anyway.

Why don't you get a younger vampire with the appropriate social mores to handle the day-to-day running of your estate? Give them a pack for one ghoul, and you'll have someone who can make all the appropriate social gestures for you, entertain any guests, maintain alliances throughout the country and the world at large, and you will have nary a care in the world.
