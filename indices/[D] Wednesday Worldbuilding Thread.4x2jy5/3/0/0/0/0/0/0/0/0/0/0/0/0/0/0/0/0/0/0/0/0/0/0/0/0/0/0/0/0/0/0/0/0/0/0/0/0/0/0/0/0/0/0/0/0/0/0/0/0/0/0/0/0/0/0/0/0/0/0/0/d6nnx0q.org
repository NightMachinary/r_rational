  Here's some new canon that this has given me:

Looks good.

  I look at it from the other way: what are the odds that a completely different star, with different spectral properties, a different relationship with the planet vampires evolved on, would be able kill them?

Things generally don't evolve /vulnerabilities/. Dependencies, yes - if vampires required an hour or so of sunlight every day, this argument would be a lot more compelling - but not vulnerabilities.

So. My thoughts. At the moment, you have vampires that can only be permanently stopped by two things; sunlight and fire. Now, a common feature of magic in fiction is the idea that a small thing can somehow hold the essence of a related big thing; Harry Dresden can scry on a model of Chicago; Harry Potter has the Marauder's Map. So it's possible that these two things are in fact one thing; that fire only burns vampires because it has a sympathetic link with the Sun.

So. You have an immortal, near totally invulnerable predator with but a /single/ weakness. Unlike, say, a lion, which can be killed in any of a thousand ways. Vampires did /not/ evolve naturally; they're too far advanced beyond anything else. No, vampires were almost certainly /created/, by some lost but magically powerful civilisation, as the magical equivalent of a nuke. (Let's call it Atlantis). Way, way back, Atlantis had magicians whose knowledge of magic has been all but lost in modern times, and they had a war; some remnants of their weapons survive to this day, though Atlantis itself does not (the war turned out to be apocalyptic and destroyed pretty much the entire civilisation, possibly even literally wiping it from history).

Perhaps vampires were originally created without the sunlight weakness by one faction; and another faction literally /enchanted the Sun/ into being deadly for these vampires as a defensive move. Or perhaps they were engineered with their solar weakness as a control measure. (Either way, this would imply that a suitably knowledgeable magical practitioner could work out a vampire-killing spell that used no sunlight or fire if he tried. Presumably actual magical practitioners are rare enough to make this a fairly negligible threat to the average vampire - though particularly paranoid ones might go so far as to deliberately hunt down and kill mages just to keep this threat level negligible).

  Thought: those frozen bodies they find in glaciers are vampires every now and again, with predictable results.
#+end_quote

Bearing in mind that (a) a glacier doesn't just require cold, it requires a whole lot of water and (b) the north and south poles each have close on /six months/ of complete sunlessness (and vampires presumably don't feel the cold) so they're probably vampire holiday homes (and vampires probably sponser arctic and antarctic research stations - or, as they refer to them, "snack boxes").
