Glad you enjoy the bed nets. I was worried I might be committing a reddit faux-pas, but I really am very appreciative of this conversation!

In re-writing a transformation scene, I realised something else: clothing. The second you start transforming, your clothes disappear. For modesty's sake, my husband and I worked out a system a 4D being could use to get what amounts to a morphsuit on their entire "length", which they could then cut holes in the head/etc for appearances, but it seemed so complicated that the average 4D being would prefer to either just have clothes on its two 'end forms', or buy the number of outfits necessary to fill out most of the intermediate forms, leading to an odd sort of transformation that might resemble a "one photo a day" transition timeline or something.

(Hubs also told me that 4D beings would weigh 10^{13} times their 'earth mass' unless they protruded only, say, 1nm into the 4th dimension, so I've decided to keep them 'short', which means that they wouldn't need too many outfits).

  A room just big enough to hold his human form and not big enough for the full thing. He starts to shift, and his tail appears as an apparently disconnected sphere outside the room. It extends towards the door, and... what happens when it hits?
#+end_quote

A twenty minute conversation with my resident higher-dimensions expert. We've worked out that it would be a 3D analog of what happens if you punch a hole in a painting and then press it back into 2 dimensions. Your tail is going to push the door until it breaks (a 4D creature has a huge mass as discussed before, so you have plenty of momentum to do this; also explains a vampire's super strength, that momentum, actually). The door is going to break like a karate board; the ends of it that your tail is pushing are still going to be joined in the 3D world. When you are no longer pushing the door into the 4th dimension, it's going to spring back. The end result will be, like I said, [[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/08/23E2F95E00000578-2865984-image-a-2_1418076655078.jpg][the 3D equivilent of a picture that's had a hole punched in it]] and then made flat again - so it'll look /mostly/ OK, but there will be some broken parts, and some jagged voids maybe in the inside of the door, uneven surface, etc.

  there's a whole range of possible doors to consider here - from flimsy wooden ones to thick steel safe doors...
#+end_quote

Very few doors are going to give something with a 4D creature's mass any problem, but it is feasible, especially if a mage were to build a magic, 4D door.

  He's sounding a lot like some form of artificial life to me.
#+end_quote

Yeah, he's a golem now I really think about it rather than a gargoyle. Canonically, he was carved in ancient egypt as a temple guardian or something; it's all vague enough that it can be modified. But he would absolutely work under some behavioral laws, and be 'programmed' not to mind them. They're obviously not /too/ rigid as he's had time for a family and hobbies and whatnot, but hey, who cares if the help have hobbies as long as they're there when the vampire hunters come, right?

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps he was intended specifically as a vampire killer. Since vampires are killed by sunlight and active at night, he only needs to be active at night.
#+end_quote

Probably a good idea; he was at one point the guardian of a large cathedral, and the resident vampire took a liking to him, 'reprogrammed' him by casting the right spell at the right time, and, well, the rest is history as they say.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps he is (partially) solar powered, and his stone form is covered in hyper-advanced solar cells; he's programmed to return to it every day in order to remain powered up.
#+end_quote

Probably the best idea. His power requirements can be so great that he really needs the full amount of daylight to be sufficiently charged, but in an emergency he can change with no problem. That said, he /is/ made of sandstone, and I'm not sure there's a universe in which solar cells could look identical to sandstone? (I guess in a universe where sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic?)

#+begin_quote
  if his (human, currently extra-dimensional) form grabs the bat form of a passing human-form vampire, then what can the vampire do? He can't see what's got him, he can't walk away, he can't change shape, and ooooh, how long until the sunlight coming in through that window gets here...
#+end_quote

This is probably one of the 'features' of him having a human form at all, which I still haven't got a super good explanation for. He's white and 7 feet tall - maybe I should give him a race lift, too many of my characters are white anyway, but his height is something I don't want to change and it would be damn conspicuous 5,000 years ago when he was supposedly created (maybe his 'creator' just wiped all his memories from the past 70,000 years so he'd work better? Maybe this guy has a wife from the demon world who he was with for 60,000 years who has been hunting him down for the last 5,000 and finally has found him today??? that's a worry)

#+begin_quote
  Right up until some idiot DEA cop breaks into the basement, thinks they're humans, and starts cutting them loose...
#+end_quote

I am getting so, so many plot hooks. VOMBIE INVASION.

#+begin_quote
  Also, I must admit, I was thinking faster regeneration.
#+end_quote

How fast would it be? Hmm. An arm weighs about 4kg, and takes two days to regenerate, so a, say, 80kg vampire can regenerate 2kg of arm a day. That's 0.025% of body weight per day, assuming the respiration/magic comes from the body as a whole. If the magic comes from the heart alone, that's a ~300g heart generating 2kg of flesh, so a heart can appropriately enough generate 666% of its mass in flesh per day - that's probably where we'd go.

So, let's say you have a 1g heart sliver becoming an 80kg vampire:

| Day | Heart Weight | Total Weight |
|-----+--------------+--------------|
| 1   | 1g           | 1g           |
| 2   | 7g           | 7g           |
| 3   | 44g          | 44g          |
| 4   | ~300g        | ~300g        |

So after 4 days you've got a full heart, and after 40 more days you've got an 80kg vampire. So yes, the regeneration is fast if you're already a full size vampire - 2kg of flesh a day is heaps - but if you're growing a vombie from a sliver of heart, it's going to take more than a month. It'll take 2-3 days for a beheaded vampire to grow a new head, though.

--------------

Also here's the transformation scene I wrote up real quick:

/And so, he begins to change. First, his clothes disappear, him standing naked in the middle of the room, seemingly unperturbed by this. Slowly, each part of him grows larger and minutely more beige in colour. Small hovering blobs appear behind his shoulders and near the floor, beginning to grow little tendrils, corresponding to ones in neighbouring blobs and on his body, as they get bigger, undulating ever so slightly before joining together to form a solid mass of wings and a tail./

/Naturally, he grows heavier; the floorboards creak as the weight that is on them changes; he holds his tail and hands on the ground in an attempt to distribute his weight evenly, but there's a soft crack as one of the weaker floorboards yields to his mass./

/He crouches on the floor, holding his head close to the floor so he doesn't hit himself on the roof. When standing straight, he must be fully 15 feet tall, not including the tail, which adds an additional fifteen feet to his total length. His fingers and toes are both tipped in wicked, curved claws; he doesn't have feet but a second set of dextrous â€˜hands'. He's a pale, sandy colour with some orange flourishes; the colour of sandstone. Folded at his back are a pair of batlike wings, each three times the size of his torso in area when fully stretched. His long tail snakes out from behind him./

and back:

/He begins transforming back; all his limbs shortening, his wings and tails turning back into spindly, floating sausages before disappearing, and his body becoming a more human shade. When he finishes his transformation, at the very last second, his clothes reappear, somehow unharmed by the whole process./
