  /Knowingly/. Vern the Vampire can presumably Control Tim to drink the liquid in this glass, which is totally not a super-acidic poison, honest.
#+end_quote

Absolutely. Or, you know, Vern can just run after him with his super speed. Tim doesn't have a chance!

It's like this scene in Stargate: SG-1:

#+begin_quote
  BRA'TAC: The shield generators are far below. There, in the very bowels of the ship. We must climb down several decks, through the length of the ship. Then, taking our weapons, we must...
#+end_quote

[O'Neill pulls the pins on two hand-grenades and drops them into the shield generators, blowing them up.]

#+begin_quote
  O'NEILL: Grenades.

  TEAL'C: This vessel is no longer protected by an energy field.

  CARTER: So that's it?

  TEAL'C: That is it.
#+end_quote

Why overcomplicate things?

  And even then, it's only a hole to the retina. The retina doesn't (usually) control the brain.
#+end_quote

What are the control problem people saying? Unfriendly AI could hijack your brain using a text terminal? Who knows what Sufficiently Advanced Magic could do by manipulating the retina. After all, you can give some people seizures that way. I mean, you can [[https://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio][transmit radio without radio hardware by using the system BUS]], thus in theory making isolating an AGI from networks futile, then I think all bets are off.

  Could the snakes look at Medusa's reflection without turning to stone?
#+end_quote

Must be able to, after all, they see her actual face on a regular basis. (Slightly offtopic - or slightly more ontopic depending on how you look at it - we have a mentioned-in-passing character who is a medusa-like Gorgon, and she wears a full on burka and dark glasses to operate in society. I always wondered if it makes sense. I suppose with mirrored glasses you don't see any of her....)

  "Hey, look, this course of action led to this /one good thing!/ Let's ignore all the bad things that came with it!"

People think like that.

  Have you tried electing a representative of the indigenous people as President? (It looks good on paper, but make very sure you choose the /right/ one).
#+end_quote

Indigenous representation in politics in general is pretty abysmal. I don't think there's any chance of an aboriginal being elected Prime Minister any time soon, I think there are two or three in our entire political system? Looking at the wikipedia page, we have 4, 5 if you count a non-indigenous person with indigenous ancestry.

Proportionally, we should have 6 in the Federal parliament. Apparently New Zealand has 7 maori seats, we have no such thing!

State parliaments look equally bad, except in the NT (6/25; indigenous people are 15% of the population there so they're actually over-represented if anything, but probably less so for their divisions as I'd imagine a lot of them are very rural).

    I think "done properly" you can have a first generation of lots of good and no bad. You know, fairytale version: we land in Botany Bay, we share our food with the aboriginies, show them how to use guns to hunt kangaroo, give them medicine for TB, and so on, society comes together from a meeting of equals and both cultures are maintained.
  #+end_quote

  That's the ideal. I'm not sure how it'll work in reality.
#+end_quote

Probably won't. Let's hope the aliens are nice when they come.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know how Australia worked, but I do know that when the colonists first landed in South Africa, they weren't exactly landing in a peaceful, enlightened civilisation where no-one is at war. Had they decided to simply give the Zulus guns, then the Zulus would almost certainly have turned them on the Xhosas - and vice versa, of course. (Oh, sure, they'd be used for hunting a bit as well, but what better time to kill those guys over there and take their cattle?)

  So... still loads of Bad, just different Bad.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure about what the inter-tribal relationships in pre-colonial Australia were like. Generally speaking, we're dealing with nomadic people living on the land whereas it sounds like the Zulus and Xhosas had a lot more infrastructure? Regardless, Australia had a [[http://www.abc.net.au/indigenous/map/images/indigi_map.png][/huge/ number of diverse language groups]], but I recall being taught in school they had no concept of property ownership. They're definitely not famous for being warlike like the maori, though I'm sure with that many language groups there's a lot of cultural variation.

    What elections? He's the /rightful king/.

Shhhhhh

  Maybe they just want to first kill off the guys who actually know what they are doing, and make sure that that knowledge is very properly and extremely thoroughly lost?
#+end_quote

That's true. Hard for knowledge to be lost in the days of the internet, though. They might have missed that boat. If nothing else, people today can strategise on a large scale.

    A cardinal does sound a lot more exciting, though, and you could see someone from circa 600 getting more and more annoyed as the church moves away from whatever it was meant to be. Soon they might stop teaching transubstantiation and then where would Catholicism be??
  #+end_quote

  ...he would /not/ have liked the Second Vatican Council.
#+end_quote

...he probably turned a /bunch/ of Cardinals as time went along, trying to get a group that did what he wanted. Many of them met the sun though and /finally/ the humans had control. Haha. I don't think I want a vampire catholic church but.... you know, it's pretty fun to think about.
