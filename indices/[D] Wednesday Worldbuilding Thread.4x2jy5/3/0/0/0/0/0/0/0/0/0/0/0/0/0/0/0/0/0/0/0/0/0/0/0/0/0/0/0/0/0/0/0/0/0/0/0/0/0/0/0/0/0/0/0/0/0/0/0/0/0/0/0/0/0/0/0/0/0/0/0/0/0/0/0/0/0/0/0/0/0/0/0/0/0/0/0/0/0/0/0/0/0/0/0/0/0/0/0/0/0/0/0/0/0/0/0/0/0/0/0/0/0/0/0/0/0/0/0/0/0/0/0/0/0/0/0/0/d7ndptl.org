  So [he'd wear] things that would be tight on gargoyle form. (That's probably most clothing).
#+end_quote

Probably. I wonder how thick his arms/legs/etc would be?

#+begin_quote
  Which implies that either he does his own dry-cleaning, or (more likely) there is exactly /one/ native 4D drycleaner in the Demon World, who charges whatever he wants because he has /absolutely/ no competition.
#+end_quote

Back in the day, his 4D spouse (wife for a 4D undulating creature is a bit too... precise for my taste) probably did it. Now, he probably makes trips every few dozen years to get his clothing dry cleaned, ironed, pressed and maybe to get a new piece or two made up. For the most part he just makes do with a variety of human clothing, since it's infinitely cheaper and more disposable.

      It's the same hand, it's just a lot more complex in shape than a human hand.
    #+end_quote

    Is it really?
  #+end_quote

  ...is this really anything more than semantics?
#+end_quote

Not really.

  When I poke my finger into Flatland, the Flatland natives see only a slice of it. They call that slice my finger, but it is not - it is a /slice/ of my finger.
#+end_quote

Yes, but to risk pushing the analogy until breaks, if you are using the valleys between the ridges of your fingerprint to grab things in flatland, if you push your finger an inch up, although they are still fingerprint ridges, they are probably /different ridges/ than the ridges that were being used as flatland graspers.

#+begin_quote
  When we see the gargoyle's hand, we're only seeing a /slice/ of the real thing, which we call his hand. Whether he calls the whole 4D organ a 'hand' or a - I don't know - 'meta-hand' or something else, it's still the same thing.
#+end_quote

Yeah OK, we're probably on the same page then more or less; only his 3D hands could all be parts of multiple different meta-hands and so one could act without impacting on another.

#+begin_quote
  I am seeing a distinct disadvantage here to having the shifters all only a few nanometres thick. The height distortion caused be her not being flat on the 3D universe seems to be limited to "too small to see".
#+end_quote

Yeah - Rule of Cool might require that the ones we want to try these sorts of shenanigans with be longer. Makes sense for Hyper Shifter With Lots Of Forms, since those forms take up /space/.

#+begin_quote
  With a very little amount of effort, she can presumably use this to mix-and-match parts from various shapes, so you could get a human with half a phoenix wing (disconnected, several centimetres from her back) and three-quarters of a lion's leg or something like that quite easily)
#+end_quote

Sounds cool.

  [eyeball scene]
#+end_quote

Very good! I love thinking of what words 4D beings would use to describe feelings that they have in 4D, and the concept of 'balance' being used in this way is neat.
