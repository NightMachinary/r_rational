  You can't make lying obsolete. Or storytelling.
#+end_quote

I don't know about that so much. There's a lot of mores about stories; for example, when we were learning about Hamlet we were taught that because of the moral attitudes of the time, any characters who committed a sin above a certain level would have to die by the end of the play, which is why it is such a famously bloody tale. That said, Hamlet still affected me a lot when I read it such that when I'm feeling down I like to read the "Too Too Solid Flesh" soliloquy, so maybe it is a bit more universal that I give it credit for.

Then again, a vampire writing literature for humans (or singing a ballad, etc) would probably result in a bit of a "generation gap" issue - I'm thinking of when big brands try to use memes on twitter and end up being cringeworthy, or the time my grandfather tried to write a young adult book series in one of his many get rich quick schemes.

It requires a lot of immersion in the culture to be successful, and when you're a vampire are you likely to keep yourself deeply immersed in human culture? Are you likely to know that people were worried about mutually assured destruction 50 years ago, and now everyone's worried about global warming? I'm imagining a vampire putting an anti-semetic novel into circulation because he was vaguely aware that humans are not fond of that one race of people right now, not realising he's behind the times.

Better to make this generation's JK Rowling or Walt Disney your ghoul, then there's no need to worry about actually writing for /humans/. You can write for vampires instead.

  [breeding humans]
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm wondering what the Underground bloodline of humans would be like. I'm imagining calm. I'm also wondering if they'd know language - foxP2 or whatever need not be conserved, after all, as they're being artificially selected. And you might end up with a situation like Genie, where the baby humans don't learn a language and never can. So I guess the Underground humans wouldn't have any sort of language, though they'd still be just as intelligent, and if you kidnapped a baby you'd probably be able to teach it.

Demons have their own language, with a spectacularly complicated writing system, and just hearing or seeing the language can give humans headaches or vertigo, so I don't imagine that livestock level humans would be picking /that/ up.

  quagga breeding project for an appropriate gift
#+end_quote

I can see it now: he did something to offend one of the more major vampires in his region, and it was a really serious gaffe (more serious even than drinking from the cups in the wrong order during a formal blood service!). Traditionally, the appropriate gift are three female quagga within a certain age range, who are the daughters of three sisters who each was bred with a different nephew of theirs. Of course, in the interest of practicality and much like with many bygone species from before, vampires have started giving and receiving zebras instead. However, the offended vampire is so old, and so traditional that the minor vampire doesn't want to take chances; and, hey, perhaps instead of merely being an /appropriate/ gift, the elder will consider it an /extravagant/ gift, and his reciprocation may include a particularly desirable little swath of territory...
