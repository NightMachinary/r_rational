  If the aliens /had/ throwable explosives, though, then their failure to design some sort of defence against them sounds like incompetence on the part of whoever designed those shield generators.

The "bad guy" aliens in Stargate: SG-1 were known for being theatrical rather than practical. They had a slave population that was completely subjugated, and just ran wars against each other using multitudes of servant classes, so they did not really require "good" weapons. This is a classic scene from Stargate: SG-1 to demonstrate this:

  ...simple solution - put the faraday cage on a space station. Have no other computer systems on board the station, apart from one very simple one that just maintains the orbit. Then there's nothing for it to vibrate /to/.
#+end_quote

I'm still terrified it will figure something out though it seems to cover anything that we know about in our current science knowledge. That said, they're much smarter than we are, and maybe it would be conceivable to disable the faraday cage in some way? Maybe communciate in infrared by heating itself up?

  We don't actually /need/ an explanation. We've got the rules for how it works - eye contact, separated by no solid objects and not more than twenty metres of air, and for five minutes the guy does what the vampire says.

You got me there...

  ...now I'm imagining that she wears a very elaborate headdress - under the burka - containing (among other things) a small amount of ice and a battery-powered cooling fan.

Brainfreeze!

    Yeah. That's really depressing but all too true. We still don't have /gay marriage/ here so we're surprisingly backwards. That said we've effectively had compulsory gay (and poly) common law marriage since 1999 so.... we're not all bad?
  #+end_quote

  Our constitution has - since 1994 - had an important line about not discriminating against anyone based on race, creed, gender physical disability, sexual orientation.

  The whole gay marriage debate isn't really that big a thing here, though.
#+end_quote

Not big because it happened long ago because of that nifty constitution, or not big because of the bigger fish to fry you were talking about?

  Google says there was [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-history-of-inter-tribal-warfare-in-pre-1788-Australia][a certain amount of inter-tribal warfare]] - most of which is not recorded because (a) the aboriginals had no writing to record it with, and (b) since they were hunter-gatherers, not farmers, they didn't have a firm enough base to stand firm against the British invaders and lost that war pretty thoroughly.
#+end_quote

Makes sense; you'd imagine there would be competition over resources. Almost a pity that they weren't more war-like. It's probably one of the reasons the Maori are ultimately more "successful" today.

  "As per our usual method, let's kill everyone who's been exposed to this information, burn all the paper, and wait a generation or two to see if it comes back. Jannissary, get us a list of everyone who might have seen this information."

  "Everyone, sir."

  "...everyone in the city?"

  "No, sir. Everyone."

  "...in the country?"

  "In the world, sir."

  "...no. No, that can't be right. Narrow it down a bit further for me, will you?"
#+end_quote

So the Jannissary - who happens to be a computer hacker - gets all the IP addresses who were on that forum and the vampire uses his connections throughout the world to have about ten thousand entire families murdered.

I'm imagining the post in [[/r/unresolvedmysteries]] now: "Over the course of two years, everyone who posted on a paranormal forum and their families has been killed. Coincidence or conspiracy?"

    Oh god, you're right. "I have been damned and my soul has been destroyed. All I can do is make sure everyone follows the True Path". Maybe he ended up in one of the many christian offshoots from catholicism.
  #+end_quote

  If he ended up in one of the offshoots - which is not unreasonable - then presumably he would have left the Vatican at some point and set himself up somewhere else...
#+end_quote

Yeah. There are so many offshoots. I'm now reading about orthodox christianity and trying to work out what "changed the least", though of course every single branch basically claims they're the "best". I'm now reading about the East--West Schism and wondering exactly what would align with William's values, though not his /current/ values but the vague values I assume he would have had in 1054. This.... is maybe not the best use of my time?

... I think William would most closely identify with Eastern Orthodox, because he /probably/ wouldn't like the modification to the source of the holy spirit or the elevation of the roman patriarch over the others (then again, he's never really one for equality, and the roman guy is closest to france and all... but it looks like the roman see wasn't meant to have that power originally, and, well, usurpers are bad).
