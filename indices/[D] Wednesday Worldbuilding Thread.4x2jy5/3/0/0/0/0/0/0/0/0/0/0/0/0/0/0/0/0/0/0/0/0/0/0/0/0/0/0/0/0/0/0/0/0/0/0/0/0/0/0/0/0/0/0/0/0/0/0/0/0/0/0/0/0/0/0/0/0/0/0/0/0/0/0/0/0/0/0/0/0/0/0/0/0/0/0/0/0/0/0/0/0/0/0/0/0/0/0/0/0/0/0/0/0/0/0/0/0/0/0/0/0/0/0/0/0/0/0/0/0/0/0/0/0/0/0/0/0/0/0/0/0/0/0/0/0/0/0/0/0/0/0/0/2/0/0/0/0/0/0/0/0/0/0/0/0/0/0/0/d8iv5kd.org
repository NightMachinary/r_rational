  Then again - if a vampire gets hit by the setting sun, or the sun during a solar eclipse, the "full image" of the sun doesn't hit the vampire, does it? Just a partial image that is part of the real whole. So I guess it makes sense. Hm.

Yeah... it all fits together.

Now, here's a question to consider; how much distortion can the image take before it stops being effective? How bent can a mirror be and still work?

  Nah, you'd want a wealthy family because they're wealthy/intelligent/stable and thus have the appropriate qualities to raise Your Special Child. For example, say you have some trailer park hillbillies - give them a few million dollars and they still might not send Your Special Child to the best private school or feed them the healthiest foods, and moreover they might just go the way of most lottery winners and end up worse off than before.

Ah, good point - you need a family with a certain approach to wealth. You could still pick a surrogate with the right approach, but who had recently (say) been made a pauper by a bad divorce and her husband having better lawyers and then pull the "wealthy uncle" trick if necessary - or if they're about to send your child to the second-best university because they can't quite afford the very best or similar - which means that attitude towards money is more important than actual access to money.
