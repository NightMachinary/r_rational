  But then you end up with things being too easy for an immortal demon with super strength, super speed, transformation capabilities and mind control.
#+end_quote

...you just need to push up the challenges to suit, then. Better equipped (and informed) vampire hunters. Other types of demons with their own magical abilities. Some of these being near indistinguishable from humans at first sight but immune to vampire mind control.

Maybe the vampire hunters have anti-mind-control contact lenses. Maybe blind people, or people with the right minor magic gene, are just plain immune.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, but making characters plan ahead when any step in the plan not going well could result in the whole thing coming tumbling very amusingly/horrifically down is awesome.
#+end_quote

Fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  A sufficiently motivated person can probably manipulate almost anything to happen anyway, especially with super speed, never mind mind control.
#+end_quote

I guess...

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. sigh. Better to leave the vampire ritual vague, and try and think of something that could be done to improve it. Then again, vomiting vampire tummy sludge into a heart and then sewing the whole mess closed isn't exactly minimalist, so it might not need to be changed.
#+end_quote

Yeah, it makes a reasonable vampirisation ritual as-is.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, ancient egyptian having the sun pulled along the sky by a dung beatle or whatever. Maybe vampires don't like beetles? Haha.
#+end_quote

Nah, they don't like dung. (Doesn't hurt them, they just tend to be neatness freaks).

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure if there'd be easy ways to find say the lore of the Samburu tribe online without potentially sifting through academic papers.
#+end_quote

Just google "Samburu legends". (First link's a PDF - I didn't download it, but it looks full of legends).

#+begin_quote
  You've got a point there. ... Hopefully feeling danger in non-traumatic situations would help the hypothetical person. Or not, and they'll end up constantly going into white vans with badness resulting.
#+end_quote

Yeah, you'd want to push the emotional content low enough that there's no trauma, but leave it high enough that white vans still trigger a fear response (at least enough to force the patient to think twice before entering one - once the patient is forced to think about it, you can probably trust the rational danger-avoidance mechanism)
