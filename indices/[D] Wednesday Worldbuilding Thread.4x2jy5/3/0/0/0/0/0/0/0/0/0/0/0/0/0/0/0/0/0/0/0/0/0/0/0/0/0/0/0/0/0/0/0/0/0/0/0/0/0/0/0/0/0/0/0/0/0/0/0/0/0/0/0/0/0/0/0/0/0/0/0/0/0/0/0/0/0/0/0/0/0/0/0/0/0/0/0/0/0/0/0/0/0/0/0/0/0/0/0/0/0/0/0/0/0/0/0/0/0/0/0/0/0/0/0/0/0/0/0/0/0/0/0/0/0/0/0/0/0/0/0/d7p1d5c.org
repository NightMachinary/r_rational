  The problem is, the gargoyle should be able to see the vombie in the coffin that looks just like his master just as clearly as we can see anything on a piece of paper.
#+end_quote

Yeah, he can /see/ it. So? Doesn't mean he knows what's up. (Yes, it looks like his Master, but his Master's over /there/ writing a letter - quite visible despite the walls and so on in the way - so /something fishy is going on/. Perhaps this other vampire is a threat to his Master and needs to be dealt with in some way? It should be more closely investigated, perhaps...)

Or maybe he does know what's up. And it's clear, it's obvious. He doesn't bother to point it out to Red because, hey, it's /right there/, it's /clearly visible/. And while he's busy trying to put a pile of stuff back /into/ a completely different closet on the far end of the room, Red opens the Vombie coffin, and a hungry Vombie instantly bursts out...

  The obvious way to limit this would be to say that he's got a limited range and acuity with his 4D vision in the 3D world.
#+end_quote

I'd suggest making it some kind of active radar instead of passive vision. That is, there are no photons outside 3D space - in order to see anything, then, he has to 'ping' in the required direction with some sort of 4D radar. Normally, he's doing this all the time, just in case (but he can turn it off if he wants). This has a few consequences:

- There will be a limited range. (You can pretty much set this where you want). This range can be extended with a brighter 'ping'.
- Anything else that's pinging in 4D space is visible even when he's /not/ pinging, and it's visible at at least twice the normal range (since the 'ping' only has to travel in one direction). Thus, one gargoyle staying silent can easily stay out of radar range of a gargoyle who's continually pinging (but the silent one is going to be unable to see anything /else/ 4D)
- He can't see outside the normal universe in /colour/. (He may be able to see in /texture/). So, if he picks up something interesting or unexpected, he might still want to bring his eyes to bear to get an idea of what it actually looks like in colour.
- Things inside normal 3D space just look like part of the same infinite flat sheet to his 4D sight. So he can't tell you what's inside the next room without opening the door, unless something in there is 4D.

  And, how does a creature the weight of a giraffe fly, and also be able to carry a few hundred kilos in payload? He has big wings, but I doubt they're big enough. Can we just say it's magic, or is there a 4D reason it could work? Had a brief discussion with my husband about it last night but it didn't go anywhere.
#+end_quote

Huh. The first thing I can think of is stilts. Have his human form standing on stilts, mostly outside the normal 3D world except a little twist at the bottom... that seems a touch silly, though, and limits him in height.

I'd rather go with sufficiently advanced Atlantean technology; he doesn't know it himself (due perhaps to the memory wipe), but he has built-in anti-gravity generators which automatically switch on when he flaps his wings.

#+begin_quote
  Another good point - it would probably serve the story to have him do it, whether it's a geometric requirement or simply because he feels more comfortable mirroring his 4D movements in 3D - perhaps because he thinks it's polite, for example.
#+end_quote

It's important to be sure which is which - if it's just polite, then he can drop it in an emergency (which is probably when you most want to show the reader what he is actually doing). So I'd probably go with geometric requirement, myself. But either could work.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, plus, the idea of hiding in a pocket is a bit silly to a 4D shifter. I mean, sure, she can see how it works on an intellectual level, but /she is CLEARLY */right there*/,/ she can't believe people really fall for this!
#+end_quote

Yes, but, importantly, people /do/ keep falling for it. And, well, if it's ridiculous but it works...

Of course, the needs of balance mean that she's still four eyeballs in a rough tetrahedron. With three allies moving in more-or-less unison, the three lower ones can hide in three pockets (it doesn't matter if one of them moves a few centimetres back or forth, but if he gets left behind he'll get dragged by his pocket) while the upper eyeball is floating well above most people's line of sight (where they can see it if they just look up, but most people /don't/ just look up... also, they can hide the upper eyeball by disguising it as a helium balloon...)

I am definitely seeing the possibility of Red opening the vombie coffin while the gargoyle is busy trying to repack something on the other side of the room.

And then getting a lecture (once the dust has settled) about Not Opening Vombie Coffins.
