  Hmmmmm - I assume to create a portal, you'd need to do some sort of ritual or spell in each "plane", so good luck making it in any place that you can't reach in your lifetime.

So the owner of such a portal, if it existed, would have to have been an original Atlantean.

  Though that said, it would be just as easy to say the portals have a finite range of, oh, a couple of light-seconds, and parallel universes don't add to that.

Make it a few light-minutes and you can have portals to Mars.

  Actually - how /would/ an immortal being make money, really?
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Well, immortality doesn't seem that easy to directly monetise. Unless you're doing the whole Harry Houdini type thing - dump the immortal, tied up, with weights on his feet, into a giant tub of water and watch as he miraculously survives what can't kill him!

So. An immortal can basically make money in one of two ways. Either by developing some skill (world's best chess player? He certainly has the time to learn) or selling some antique (hmmm... time to clean out the attic again...)

Both have downsides, The skill might become obsolete, either because no-one's interested anymore (watch the Human Calculator multiply two three-digit numbers in his head!) or because it's just generally useless (dodo breeder). The antique is no more likely to be valuable than the contents of your grandmother's attic (sure, there might be something there, but unless deliberate effort is made...) Worse, forms of wealth can change from time to time; what's worth a lot now can be worthless in fifty years' time. (A successful immortal, than, needs to change, and change often, to avoid simply becomig that grumpy old guy telling octogenerians to get off his lawn).

Another thought struck me recently. This alternate world; does it have a sun? And is that sun Sol? If not, then it strikes me that a 70 000 year old vampire could easily have survived to that age by simply staying hidden in the alternate world, where sunlight can't touch him...
