  I'd say that it can be a non-verbal command, however it has to be easily "read" by someone staring into your eyes.
#+end_quote

Okay, so there's no /direct/ mental link, but a vampire could still command someone by tapping on the back of their hand in morse code (assuming the victim knows morse code). Fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  You might be able to deliberately disobey (e.g. dropping your handbag rather than the gun you're pointing at the vampire's ally), but it would take a lot of guts, and the willpower to do so would be just below what it would take to just ignore the order in the first place.
#+end_quote

Okay, but can you deliberately /misunderstand/ (if, say, it's a genuinely ambiguous request)? Let's say the victim is holding a sandwich and a handbag and the vampire says "Drop it", and he's not /quite/ sure which one he means. (Or does he drop both, just to make sure he's dropping the right one?)

Of course, a smart vampire would simply give unambiguous commands, either way.

  In the myth, he kills Medusa by using her reflection in his shield to guide his blade.
#+end_quote

Ah, I see. (I seem to remember a variation where he tricked Medusa into seeing her own reflection in the shield, thus turning her to stone - that may have been a modern twist on the original myth, though.)

#+begin_quote
  Vampires are immune to mind control, so no. It also takes effort to do, so it'd be hard to come up with a situation where a vampire might try and control her reflection (though you could always throw a mirror in the way before they try and control you. But as I said, it's moot, as vampires are immune).
#+end_quote

Okay, that's simple and straightforward.

#+begin_quote
  I was proud of the aluminium fakeout though, because aluminium used to be so valuable so it would make sense as a gift given by a long-lived being, and now would be seen as a unbelievably cheap fake silver.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that does work out really well.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. I'm tossing up all my ideas for JaNoWriMo now I've decided that I'll do it. I can see a kind of rational prologue, with the hunters trying all sorts of things (mirrors, etc) could be fun. But I've been watching /Jane the Virgin/ and it's made me feel a lot better about romance as a genre. We'll see what gets me excited when I come around to choosing between ideas.
#+end_quote

Okie dokie lokie.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe. But we have the Sentinelese people and those uncontacted tribes out in the middle of Brazil, and they're left mostly alone. (Well, the Sentinelese people don't give us much say in the matter what with all the arrows). Then again, they also live in areas that are pretty undesireable, whereas Australia, the Americas, Africa all have gold, diamonds, vast tracts of land, etc.
#+end_quote

Yeah... I class that as mostly neutral. It's not like contacting them is going particularly well, it's simply that there is practically no contact. It's a lot better than some other tribes have got, and the isolationist policy isn't bad in and of itself (but it is very close to some /very/ bad policies if someone else decides they want part of the land), but it's also not really a /good/ policy, I think.

(Mind you, given what happened to most tribes that didn't chase away strangers, I don't think the Sentinelese have exactly the wrong idea).

#+begin_quote
  The considering is the bad part though. I don't know what the situation is like in NZ or South Africa, but Australia has a 10 year difference in life expectancy between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. Lower graduation rates, higher suicide rates, higher incarceration rates, higher rates of infant mortality, the list goes on. A lot of that is related to alcohol, smoking, and the fact that indigenous people tend to live in rural areas more often. A gap of 10 years is just appalling though.
#+end_quote

Yeah... we have absolutely horrendous rural medical systems. (Cities, no problem. Doesn't matter what race you are, if you can reach a good hospital you're pretty good; if you live out in the back of beyond, you've got problems). But then there are some racial groups more likely to live out in the back of beyond and others more likely to live in urban areas, so...

Took me a bit of googling to find actual stats on that, but suffice to say that we're doing worse than Australia. (If we can get a better handle on infant mortality, we'll do a whole lot better on that front.)

We've got great language policies, though. (Seriously, we have eleven official languages, and you can interact with any government department in /any/ of them. And the university I went to had a language policy of "if there's ten students who want to learn the subject in this language, and if we can find a lecturer who can teach the subject in this language, then we'll offer it in this language").

#+begin_quote
  Yeah well - well - check out this rock!
#+end_quote

That's a pretty impressive rock.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, assuming mages wouldn't bother training their powerful daughters. I suppose if they had a suitable son why waste the effort. You might end up with some very post-apocalyptic type scenarios if you were able to subjugate the erstwhile mothers easily enough. :(
#+end_quote

It works the other way round, too, with the daughters subjugating their husbands. It's less of a gender-induced split and more of a mage-versus-muggle split, really.

  "It all makes sense! The reason I'm so awesome and was able to get eternal meat-suit life is because God chose me for it. I'm going to go around collecting junk, watching plays, and maccing on dudes now. That is the life God would want for me"
#+end_quote

Well, of course. He's already perfect, so everything he does is by definition perfect, right? He wouldn't be put in that situation if he wasn't immeasurably improving it by his mere existence.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah.... I actually really can see it. He's just waiting for the veil of ignorance to lift and for France to recognise him as their rightful king so he can go back to ruling, only instead of basically being a war-chief he goes to a lot of meetings about agriculture and immigration and wonders where all the swordfights are.
#+end_quote

...I can imagine him making the meetings a lot more memorable by /introducing/ sword-fights.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, but, I gotta level with you - he loves Red and all, but his wife-whilst-human is waiting for him (or already with him? who knows!) up in heaven (surely! He bought her tons of posthumous indulgences!). Red can do what he likes, William's got a backup plan.
#+end_quote

I can certainly see that working, yes.

#+begin_quote
  William is going to turn the world upside down to try and find an authentic 5th (or really, 6th or 7th will do) century vampire priest to get all this down.
#+end_quote

Ooooh, that's going to be tricky.

#+begin_quote
  ... Maybe the Vatican has one?
#+end_quote

No.

That is to say, I'm not saying there are no vampire priests. But if there are any that still report to the Vatican, then they have to follow the Vatican's modern stance on indulgences, which means William is out of luck in his quest. (Worse yet, he'll probably be subjected to a lecture about why he didn't get what he thought he got with the original indulgences...) Even if they don't still report to the Vatican (e.g. they may have joined one of the Protestant churches) the odds are that they've abandoned the whole business of indulgences (this being a fair chunk of what the protestants were protesting against).

So, William's going to be having a really difficult time here.
