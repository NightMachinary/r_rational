What happens if the vampire, with the aid of explosives or a bulldozer, demolishes the house to the point at which it is no longer a house?

  I agree that with the vampires being created as weapons of war it logically follows without any trouble that the group creating the vampires would put a couple of limits

Oh dear. No. No, that does not follow at all. First of all, that assumes that the Atlantean concept of war vaguely matches the modern one (i.e. it is reserved for soldiers only). Historically, you'll find /plenty/ of examples which show that the idea of leaving civilians out of any actual war is a pretty recent innovation - through a fair chunk of history, civilians on the losing side of war had a /really/ bad time.

Secondly, it's only when someone is winning the war that they have the luxury of being able to take the time to finish the safety precautions; when they're losing, and it's a choice between releasing the dangerous superweapon /now/ or facing annhilation tomorrow, what do you think they'd choose?
