  the trousers might vanish gradually, the belt going immediately and the legs sort of peeling away from out 3D universe as the shape changes further - stop at the right moment, and you have a pair of cloth anklets that look like they're just /hovering/

That's really cool, I'm trying to picture it - the monster is undulating, changing around, parts appearing and disappearing and his pants are amongst them.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmm. Wouldn't that depend on the vampire? I can imagine a juvenile vampire who's decided that flying is the best thing /ever/ spending a lot of time as a bat
#+end_quote

Ah, my headcanon is that vampires can't turn into bats until they're more than 1000 years old, at which point they're too dignified to go joyflying - though I'm sure there are plenty such vampires that live as a bat to hide, or simply because they enjoy it, or whathaveyou, and would have the appropriate human-ish clothing.

    A gargoyle might though, preferring clothing that is tight and stretchy; kind of like the Hulk's magic pants.
  #+end_quote

  I don't think 'stretchy' will help much. The moment it's tight enough to need to stretch, he'll be dragging it into the fourth dimension.
#+end_quote

Yeah. Hmmm. I wonder what you'd need to fabricate in order to have pants that keep you modest. I doubt a 5,000 year old gargoyle cares much who sees his dingus though, so he's unlikely to go to trouble.

  the slice [of a torus being] that intersects with the 3D universe can do so on a tangent. This means that he always "sticks out" in the same direction, unlike the carrot-type vampire, who "sticks out" to the one side as a human and to the other side as a bat.

  Going back to the 4D anti-vampire corridor, if you take out /one/ of the two 4D walls (making your selection carefully), you can still keep the Torus Shifter out while allowing vampires or werewolves in (but only in one of their two forms).
#+end_quote

Thanks for the input about the torus; you're right. Probably a lot to worry about. I'm feeling wary of using the 4D world too much as it requires a lot of thought and trouble, but hey, it also provides a lot of cool plot points.

  Worse, [the vampire's Robe is] stuck /halfway/ along the transformation! Next time he changes to a bat, he can cut off more parts of the robe, but he still feels an odd tightness /somewhere/ (he can't quite figure out where) and, every time he shifts, he's encases in the tattered remains of a robe sleeve out of /nowhere/ for a moment mid-transform.

  And if /that's/ not bad enough, every time that gargoyle sees him, the stupid gargoyle starts laughing! What on earth does he find so /funny?/
#+end_quote

YES

#+begin_quote
  (I imagine this being eventually sorted out when the gargoyle steps up to the vampire, reaches out, his hand vanishes, there's an odd little tug in an indescribable place, and then the gargoyle's hand reappears, holding the ragged remnants of the sleeve.)
#+end_quote

I'm imagining the gargoyle's hand would not need to vanish for this to happen. If you were interacting with a flatlander in a similar situation using your left index finger as your avatar, you could use your right hand to pick the piece of flatlander fabric off their projection in 3D space, and then throw it onto Flatland in front of your finger, say. So the gargoyle could use one of his other projections (e.g. the 'cross-section' that's 'parallel' to the sleeved-bat) to grab the sleeve, and pass it 'down' the conga line of his projections into the 3D universe, which would result in the vampire feeling the odd tug, and a piece of torn fabric appearing out of thin air bit by bit.

  I don't know if you're familiar with a webcomic called Freefall? There are a number of characters (including robots and at least one genetically engineered wolf) who are constrained by Asimov's three laws. At one point, said wolf saw a human threaten a non-human friend of hers with a knife (a rubber knife, but she didn't know that) and promptly restrained the attacker because "running with knives is dangerous, you could do yourself an injury".
#+end_quote

That sounds really cool - I should check it out. It's been a long time since I've read a new webcomic.

Also, we have a new character concept now: you know eldritch horrors, how they're meant to be indescribable and make you go mad? They're clearly a 4D creature with a lot of forms that just doesn't stay still, the same way that if we stuck our finger in flatland we would have a really hard time holding it level and our finger would seem to change texture and size quite unnervingly to a native flatlander.

So the gargoyle's long-lost wife is such a creature, going looking for her husband. She has thousands or millions of forms with no, or very very thin, intermediate slices, including many of the biblical "angel" forms that are quite terrifying (one is apparently a [[https://www.google.com.au/search?q=ophanim&safe=off][wheel of eyes]]?), relatively normal creatures, human forms, demon forms, inanimate objects, etc. But none of it has any structure because she's moving between them too quickly to tell.

You can see the sort of things that would happen:

"Oh my god what the hell is that thing"

"I'm sorry, I forget your people can only see a fraction of my true form. Let me hold still."

(her form stops undulating and she becomes a perfectly normal looking box of petunias)

"How's this?"

"Much better, thankyou. I don't think I want to know how you can talk in that form."

"Oh, it's not that hard when you - excuse me a moment, sorry, I have a cramp."

(the box of petunias undulates, and is almost immediately replaced with a huge raven-like bird with eyes of fire)

"Ahhh. Much better. Now, have you seen my husband around here anywhere?"
