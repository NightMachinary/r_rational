[[/ajbaffle][]] Why would you offer orange juice to a vampire??? It's tasteless, uncomfortable to drink, and, from what I'm able to gather, probably full of microscopic robots that will kill me from the inside, or for extra style points maybe a nanofactory that will produce your blood cells instead of mine so that way "my" ghouls get habituated to /your/ blood.

  /From my canon document:/

  /A vampire is unable to eat normal food; he is able to swallow it, but lacks the ability to taste it. He also feels discomfort at having food in his stomach and must throw it up within an hour or so, or he will spit it up involuntarily./
