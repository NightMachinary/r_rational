/The famed vampire hunter, Arminius Vambrey, is closing in on the well-known vampire, Dracula. He enters the target's castle during the day, when Dracula will be asleep. He keeps his crossbow, loaded with a wooden stake, at the ready and places mirrors as he goes to direct sunlight into the castle. Eventually, he finds a coffin. With care and a crowbar, he levers it open. The vampire inside stirs! He recognises the infamous Dracula at once. With a rapidly placed mirror, he redirects sunlight onto the creature. It crumbles to dust and ashes! He leaves, in the knowledge of a job well done./

/That night, Dracula finds that his blank-headed decoy clone has been destroyed. He decided to quietly and quickly move someplace else and stay hidden for a decade or two./

Okay, so, invitations. It seems to me that this may not have been put in place by the vampire's original creators; it may rather be a limitation imposed by the same group who enchanted the Sun. But that's minor. There are more important questions.

What exactly counts as "freely given"? Can a vampire hold someone at gunpoint and obtain an invitation under duress? Can a vampire obtain an invitation under false pretenses ("why yes, small child, I am Santa Claus. May I come in so I can give you your presents?", "Police, sir. There have been noise complaints. May I come in?")? Can a vampire bypass the need for an invitation by killing the person who slept there (e.g. with a gun)?
