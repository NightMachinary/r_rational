    Here's a question: if we're going for the image of the sun, would touching a full page illustration with the tip of your finger burn you? Or would you have to stick your palm on a smaller-sized image?

  Hmmmmmm. I'd say that yes, it would burn a vampire - but the image has to be complete. Ripping the page in half and then touching the same part of the image will have no effect.

Would it, though? Naively it seems it wouldn't, because it's not a complete image of the sun, which is what the light from the sun becomes when it hits your skin.

Then again - if a vampire gets hit by the setting sun, or the sun during a solar eclipse, the "full image" of the sun doesn't hit the vampire, does it? Just a partial image that is part of the real whole. So I guess it makes sense. Hm.

  You don't need a wealthy family. Just pick out whichever family you want and, three months later, have them discover a "distant uncle" in Brazil who recently died and left a fortune to his closest living relatives

Nah, you'd want a wealthy family because they're wealthy/intelligent/stable and thus have the appropriate qualities to raise Your Special Child. For example, say you have some trailer park hillbillies - give them a few million dollars and they still might not send Your Special Child to the best private school or feed them the healthiest foods, and moreover they might just go the way of most lottery winners and end up worse off than before. Plus, if you go for a billionaire, you'll be able to have Your Special Child inherit their money in a few short decades and it'd be a pretty neat and tidy affair.
