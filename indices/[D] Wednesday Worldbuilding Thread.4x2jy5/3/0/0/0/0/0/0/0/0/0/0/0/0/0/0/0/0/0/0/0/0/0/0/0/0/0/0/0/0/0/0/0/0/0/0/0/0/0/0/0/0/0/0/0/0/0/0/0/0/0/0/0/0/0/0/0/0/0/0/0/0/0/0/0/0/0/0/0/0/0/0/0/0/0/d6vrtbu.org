Well, a vampire might demolish a house to get at the human inside if said human is a famed vampire hunter who's too close for comfort; that is, when there's a reward worth the risk.

  I suppose 'house' in the context of this would be a structure created by humans that is currently used for sleeping.

Okay. Now, imagine Thomas. Thomas is a wilderness explorer, a hiker, a traveller. He sleeps under the stars every night in a different place, tucked into his reliable old sleeping bag.

His sleeping bag is a man-made structure, intended to be used for sleeping, in which he has slept every night for the last ten years. Does it double as surprisingly effective anti-vampire armour?

  So, why did the atlanteans add the 'invitation' quirk?

Hmmmm. If they were being invaded, then presumably the invaders would not have slept in the local houses much (if at all), allowing them to drop vampires on their own cities with few if any casualties on their own side.
