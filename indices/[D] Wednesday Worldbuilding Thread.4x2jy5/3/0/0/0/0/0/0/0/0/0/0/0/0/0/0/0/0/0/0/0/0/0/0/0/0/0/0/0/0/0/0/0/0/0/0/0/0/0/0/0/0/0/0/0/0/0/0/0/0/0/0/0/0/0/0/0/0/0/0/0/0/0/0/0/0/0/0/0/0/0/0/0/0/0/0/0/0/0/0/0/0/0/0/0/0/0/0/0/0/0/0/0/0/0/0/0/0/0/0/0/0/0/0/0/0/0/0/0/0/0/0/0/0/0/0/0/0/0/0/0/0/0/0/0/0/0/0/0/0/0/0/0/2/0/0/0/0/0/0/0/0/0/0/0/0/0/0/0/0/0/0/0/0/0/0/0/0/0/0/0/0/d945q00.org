  Now let me see how I can exploit it.

[[/lyrahappy-r][]] I am so happy to read you type those words.

    The person remembers what they did, but aren't horrified by it.
  #+end_quote

  He'll make excuses to himself why it's acceptable to imagine killing his daughter. "I didn't actually do anything," he'll tell himself. "I just thought about it. As a hypothetical situation."
#+end_quote

I would have conceptualised it more as, he would still think imagining killing his daughter would be just as bad as he did before he did the imagining. Like, the fact he did the action has no bearing whatsoever on how he feels about it. Just like someone with OCD doesn't get "accidental therapy" from deciding that touching greasy tables is not going to cause the apocalypse, his attitude towards imagining killing his daughter is just as negative as it was before. The same way that, say, if he was drunk and hit his daughter for misbehaving (something he'd never do sober), when he was sober he'd look back on it and go "omg, never again", until he inevitably gets drunk again and hits her again.

  Next day, Vlad goes to Sally. He gives Sally some item of value (e.g. her mother's wedding ring) and Controls her. He tells her to sell the ring to his jannissary standing right over there in exchange for drugs, which she will hide in her room.
#+end_quote

Yeah, a vampire could definitely manipulate family members to kill each other. You could make a loving husband kill his wife by controlling her and getting her to have sex with a jannisary at the exact moment that Sam is looking through the window.

#+begin_quote
  And, every day, Sam is being Controlled and asked to spend five minutes imagining the benefits of killing Sally.

  In fact, just to desensitise Sam further, he might Control Sam and get Sam to kill a few total strangers - starting with borderline suicidal people who have been Controlled into begging to be killed and working up from there - just so that Sam is less horrified at the idea of murder at all.

  ...he still wouldn't do it on his own, but how long will it be until the rift between Sam and Sally is wide enough that Sam can be Controlled into killing Sally?
#+end_quote

I definitely concede that you can have a loving father kill his daughter through mind control, even if it requires waiting a few weeks/months to get the gap wide enough. I don't think there's a huge issue with this exploit because e.g. a semi-loving father could be controlled into killing his daughter with no problem.

#+begin_quote
  Now, second exploit - how to make someone do something both complex and long-term?

  Easy solution. Control their boss.
#+end_quote

Sounds like a perfect option. You'd probably need to control the boss semi-regularly (i.e. once a week have Mr Smith say "How is that money laundering project going?") so that way Tom doesn't move onto other priorities, or, worst of all, Tom doesn't say "Hey Mr Smith, that money laundering project, can I take time off my TPS reports to finish it up because it's taking a while?" and then Mr Smith would inevitably reply "Oh, no, it seemed really important at the time but just shelve it for now, the TPS reports should be your priority."

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Yeah. I'm not sure what sort of themes I'm looking to explore with vampires. It's probably more in line with the standard Supernatural Romance tropes; they're sexy and other and dangerous and wise, rather than being tortured creatures, though they kind of are.
  #+end_quote

  Eh, fair enough.
#+end_quote

Yeah. It's kind of embarrassing that I'm trying to rationalify (somewhat) something that is essentially a Twilight/50 Shades level of prestige. It's really "yaoi vampires kissing a lot", but hey, romance novels are very popular so why the hell should I be ashamed if that's my genre, and we won't be talking about quivering members.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmm. Even if there's no scar left afterwards, the only place I can see fire fitting into that ritual is to cauterise the wound when it's done.
#+end_quote

Hmm. I had William wrap Red in cloth; being wrapped tightly in flammable cloth which is then set alight could be part of the ritual (and make it pretty risky and impossible to do covertly), though not really sure of an in-universe explanation for that.

Cauterising the wound or setting a fire inside the body would make more sense.

Boiling the sludge is also a good idea but I just like the mental image of a vampire throwing up directly into their target's heart (it's totally disgusting).

#+begin_quote
  Of course. It might not even be the original purpose of the spell - a spell that causes (say) the smell of chamomile might just interfere with the nascent vampire's energies in just the wrong way.
#+end_quote

Oh goodie. I wonder what another major (or minor) magical / superstitious belief system is, that could get me thinking about that. I do like the idea of a smell interfering somehow. Indian is another big one, but I'm sure there's plenty of places in Africa and the Americas and Oceania too.

It could also be something specific about the "energy" of the place, though that might end up too much with feng shui and I want to stay away from Chinese now we've already stolen from it.

    we have no idea how memories are stored so how would a mage be able to begin to take effect iwth it?
  #+end_quote

  Magic has to follow rules, but it doesn't have to follow the same rules as everything else. And magic often works with high-level concepts.

  Or the idea that an inhabited structure prevents an uninvited vampire's entry. The idea of a structure makes sense, and so does the idea of an inhabited structure - but not so much on the atomic level. It's a high-level concept, but it /works/ with magic.

  So, I see no reason why magic /wouldn't/ work with the high-level concept of memories. It just has to do so in a consistent, rule-based way.
#+end_quote

Ooooh you got me there. Yeah. I don't like it but you're right.

#+begin_quote
  ...you don't want to remove /all/ negative emotions, though, because that leads to the horror story where the victim sees noting wrong in repeating the nightmare. Maybe just remove 90% of the negative emotions, to make it easier to deal with but still leave it as something to avoid.
#+end_quote

No, you can remove the negative emotions entirely and the person can rationally understand that strangers in white vans are very bad, assuming they're old enough. Sure, some people have to touch "wet paint" when they see a wet paint sign, but if you go to a mage to have a traumatic memory removed, the mage might say "ok, I am removing the emotion of you not liking what happened in the white van. Just remember that white vans are bad places to be, the things that happened were bad, and you should not let them happen again".
