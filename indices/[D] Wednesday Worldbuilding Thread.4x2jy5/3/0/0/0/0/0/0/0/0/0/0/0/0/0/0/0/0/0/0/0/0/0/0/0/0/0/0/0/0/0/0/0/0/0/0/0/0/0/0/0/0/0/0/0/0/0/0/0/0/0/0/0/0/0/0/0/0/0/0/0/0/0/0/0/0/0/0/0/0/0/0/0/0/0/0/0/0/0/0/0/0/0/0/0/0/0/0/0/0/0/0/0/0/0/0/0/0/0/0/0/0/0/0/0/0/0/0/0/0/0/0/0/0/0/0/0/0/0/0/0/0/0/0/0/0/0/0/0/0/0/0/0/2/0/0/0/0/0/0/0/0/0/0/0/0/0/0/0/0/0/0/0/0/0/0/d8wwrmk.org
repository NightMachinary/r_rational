RE Gold/metal, originally /originally/ it apparently met copper, so let's not look too closely at it.

I think I like the fire/gold damages the vampire permanently unless the vampire heals using water/earth, though I'm wondering if there's some way we can make vampires unable to cross running water, but I think that's probably getting a bit too far out there.

I think I'll keep the "fire needs to be used to create a vampire", because it makes it difficult to make new vampires, though I'm not sure how that would happen mechanically. If you threw a match at a recently dead corpse, they wouldn't catch alight, would they? Maybe you have to set the fire on the heart, or the slurry a vampire vomits into the vamp-to-be's heart is flammable and you have to light it on fire, close the chest cavity, and the heat + the slurry creates the magic. Maybe?

Will also keep gold creates blood -> gold causes vampire's flesh to turn into blood, which creates some pretty sweet gory scenes, probably.

Blood nourishes wood -> stakes soak up the blood and get all magically charged and can be used for ????.
