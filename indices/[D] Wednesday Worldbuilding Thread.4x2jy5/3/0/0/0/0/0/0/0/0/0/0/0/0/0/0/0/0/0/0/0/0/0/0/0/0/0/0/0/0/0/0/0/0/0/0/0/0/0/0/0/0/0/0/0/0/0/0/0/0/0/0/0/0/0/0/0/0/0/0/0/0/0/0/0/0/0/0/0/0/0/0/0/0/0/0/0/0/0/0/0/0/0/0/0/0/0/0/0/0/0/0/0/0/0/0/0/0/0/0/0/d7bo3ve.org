  Immortality with the catch of being a vampire's thrall with your will forever subservient to hers is not ideal.
#+end_quote

Vampires would hardly be the first to put only the benefits in the advert and ignore the downsides until much, much later.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, though the definition of "protection" and "chores" will vary from place to place.
#+end_quote

Naturally. Which also raises the possibility of a young "nomadic" vampire, wandering quietly from territory to territory, trying very hard not to anger anyone /too/ much, looking for a territory of his own... perhaps one whose previous territory was Hiroshima (and he probably still makes geiger counters go crazy...)

  Now, all that stuff people are saying about monsanto - terminator genes, infertile offspring, all the rest of it? That was started by a vampire trying to protect her bloodline. It works, too. You clone them or breed them with IVF and the children have the most noxious blood. Ugh.
#+end_quote

Ha! Yeah, I can certainly see a biotech firm as under vampire control.

#+begin_quote
  More stuff to ponder: can vampires gain and lose weight? Can they train to have buff muscles? Does their hair continue to grow?
#+end_quote

Hmmmm.

Mythologically, vampires can fly. This seems to imply some control over their own mass. Perhaps a vampire can change mass at will?

The mythological vampire is unchanging, frozen at the apparent appearance and age they were when turned. (This allows for the creepy little girl vampire as well). This implies they can't grow hair or lose weight; though if a long-haired vampire gets his hair cut it probably regenerates in the same way as if he gets an arm cut off.

#+begin_quote
  I suppose the cleanest way is for it to come out in their breath, but they don't need to breathe. Do they sweat it out?
#+end_quote

Tears, probably. When a vampire cries, he loses the extra blood mass. Sweat can work, but it seems a bit of a giveaway. Or when he takes his blood to keep his ghouls ghouled.

#+begin_quote
  When a vampirezombie (vombie? zompire?) grows from a piece of vampire heart, where does the extra mass come from?
#+end_quote

...I'm going to go back to "vampires change mass at will" here, I think.
