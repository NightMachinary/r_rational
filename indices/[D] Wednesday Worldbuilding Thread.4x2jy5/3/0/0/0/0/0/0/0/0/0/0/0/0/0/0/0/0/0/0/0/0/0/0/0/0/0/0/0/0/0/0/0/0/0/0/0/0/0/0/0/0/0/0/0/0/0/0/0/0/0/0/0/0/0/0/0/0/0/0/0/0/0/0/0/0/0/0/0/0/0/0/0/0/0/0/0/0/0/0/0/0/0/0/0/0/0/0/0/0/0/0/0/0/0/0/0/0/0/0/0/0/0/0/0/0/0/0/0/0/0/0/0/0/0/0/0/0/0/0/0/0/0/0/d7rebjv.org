  He's not /much/ of a vampire's bodyguard if he can't handle just one rogue vombie on his own.
#+end_quote

Absolutely.

    I don't understand what you mean like this. Are you saying he can't see through walls?
  #+end_quote

  ...you see what I'm getting at? He can see around ordinary 3D walls, but ordinary 3D objects all look the same - flat and shiny - to his 4D radar.
#+end_quote

Hmmmmmm. Not really. I can see that he wouldn't see colours, so he could see a book, but he can't see the title unless it's raised/embossed. Where my gap of knowledge starts is: I can read everything that's on a piece of paper, so why can't a 4D creature "read" everything that's on a "3D plane" within his eye range? It's because there's no photons that go from the 3D world to the 4D world, isn't it? Photons definitely don't travel into the 4D world or physics crumbles under the inverse cube law. (Also a reason that Atlantis couldn't be a 4D world and our world is a 3D offshoot universe - physics as we know it just won't work in 4D)

Had another unproductive conversation with my husband about how 4D eyes would see the 3D world, and has resulted in him convincing me that the 'terrible technobabble' explanation of 4D creatures causing one of the 9 dimensions from string theory to 'uncurl' a bit is /apparently/ not only super plausible but super elegant, and could be used to explain magic (he said that if you could change the 9D geometry you could do pretty much any magic you wanted, making light appear, moving things, transformations, etc). He said it was something to do with Kurosaki-yao shapes (just googled it - turns out it's this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold]] - I do not understand a word of the article so I have to take his word for it.)

I /think/ what my husband was saying is these Calabi-Yau manifolds mean you can have photons stick around to hit the 4D eyes, with some very localised physics breaking (which can also be used to cast spells), and you get the x-ray vision.

It's kind of annoying that x-ray vision is so tricky when to a "layman" like myself (i.e. someone with moderate experience with the implications of a 4D parallel world) the x-ray vision is something that should /obviously/ be there. My co-author/roleplay partner has little tertiary mathematics expertise (she's a biologist) so she's in the "true layman" camp and just thinks all the random consequences of the phyiscs are really neat.

I think I'm going to have to nut this out with him and maybe see if I can get him to help me write something canonical about how it all works as I've reached the very limits of my ability to comprehend. It's great that what is going to be essentially GLBTwilight will have lore based in string theory though, so that's something.

    I can see it now; three guys dressed as clowns, with a huge bunch of balloons. Maybe not as stealthy as they'd have hoped though...
  #+end_quote

  Yeah, they're going to stand out a bit. The occasional whisper of "Don't drift apart so much!" from somewhere in their midst is only going to make it more difficult.
#+end_quote

Yes, but the image of clowns is just +gold+ horrifying.
