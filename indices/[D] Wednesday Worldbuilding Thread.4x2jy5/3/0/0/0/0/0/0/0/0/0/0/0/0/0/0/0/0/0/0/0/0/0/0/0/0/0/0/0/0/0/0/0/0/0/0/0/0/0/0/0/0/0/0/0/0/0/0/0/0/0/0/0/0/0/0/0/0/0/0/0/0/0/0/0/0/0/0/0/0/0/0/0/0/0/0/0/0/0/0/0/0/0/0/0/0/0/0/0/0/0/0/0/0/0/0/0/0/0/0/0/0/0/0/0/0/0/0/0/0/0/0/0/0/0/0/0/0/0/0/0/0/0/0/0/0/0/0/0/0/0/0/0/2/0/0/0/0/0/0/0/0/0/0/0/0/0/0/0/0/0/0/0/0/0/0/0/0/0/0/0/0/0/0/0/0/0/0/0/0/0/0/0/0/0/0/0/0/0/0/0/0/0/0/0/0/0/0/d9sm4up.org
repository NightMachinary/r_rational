  ...did these other Even More Powerful Races invent their own weapons?

All sorts. The Asgard (greys) and Ori have "energy weapons", the Furlings are Mysterious And We Never Meet Them, and the Nox are complete pacifists who are able to raise the dead among other things. Humans, when they get starships, tend to use railguns mostly from what I can recall.

The Asgard had a problem with an enemy that wanted to destroy their new advanced flagship and went to the humans for help because we came up with creative solutions. Our creative solution? Get their flagship to self-destruct and take the enemy out. I am not convinced the Asgard couldn't have done better.

  It seems implausible, but I can see the risk - it could send out itself as data, and just hope that someone, /anyone/ picks it up and runs it to see what it is. Straight out of the box, no intermediate virus stage necessary...

Hey, if it takes ten thousand years for some alien creature to run the code, we still end up with von neumann machines turning everything into paperclips inside a million years. I for one welcome our new office supply overlords.

    Hey, our former Prime Minister was involved in a scandal during his time in office too??
  #+end_quote

  Your politicians have tame scandals.

They don't, really. Probably tamer than yours, but the onion thing was funny.

  ...vampire war with Humanity taking sides?
#+end_quote

Yeah. It would.... probably not end well.

    Moreso, they're already dead so killing us isn't a crime.

  "they're"? "us"? ...looks like he's not sure whether or not he's a vampire.

Shhh. I was writing it stream-of-consciousness. Or this vampire is part of the Red Tribe, and she wants you to kill the Blue Tribe vampires, so it IS an Us and Them type thing.

In JaNoWriMo news, I had dinner with my RP/writing partner and we've both gotten excited about it! We're going to have some serious roleplaying to do in the next couple of months so we have skeleton scenes to build up, and because we both have sets of characters who are basically a hair away from being full tulpas, we are going to also have to edit a lot of each others' scenes to make them work right.

I also kind of sort of explained 4D physics to her. She also expressed gratitude for your awesome work at helping me hammer this stuff out, she thinks we should write a "the physics of the verse" book about it.

But this is what we're going to do:

Me: Pretty straightforward romance story of Red and William. Act 1: They meet, fall in love (c. 1942). Act 2: Red becomes a ghoul, dynamic with that (c. 1950). Act 3: Red becomes a vampire, relationship almost strains to its breaking point (c. 2016). Act 3: Red is now a mature vampire, everything is perfect, the end (c. 2050). Probably going to have no or only minor antagonists. Good communication.

Her: Pretty straightforward friendship/action story with Jack and Gwyn. Act 1: They become roommates, wtf a vombie?!? Act 2: so we need to stop this vampire menace, wtf vampires are people with feelings?? Act 3: major antagonist. Act 4: Peace is achieved.
