  I'm thinking the ancient Atlantean mage-kings would have had all of the magical talents and none of the negative effects.

True, I can see there being a gene that makes you see the future and a gene that makes you more resistant to nose-bleeds, or gives you additional cognitive capacity to handle the stress of the prescience, or whatever - and you don't necessarily inherit them both together, or the two gene mutations don't happen at the same time.

  Nah, Atlantis was way, way, way back. Before humanity left Africa at all.

Nice and has no annoying racial consequences (either the 'magical black person' trope, which with the whole chinese thing and martial arts is pretty problematic), plus puts it even further back. Maybe the population bottleneck had something to do with the Atlantis war - though Lake Toba is about as far from Africa as it's possible to get.

I kind of like the idea of the vampire weapons taking over following the war, whittling the humans down to the 30,000 range through over-hunting, realising that this is going to result in their demise, finally deciding to farm them more sustainably and then feral populations of humans result. You could even say the lake toba volcano was set off by someone in the service of vampires, in order to obscure the sun somewhat.

I can only /imagine/ what a 70,000 YO vampire would be like though, if one survived to the present day to tell the tale of the ancient war. One character is about 5,000 YO and is considered to be at the very tippy top of vampire aged-ness (not the oldest, but top 5 or 10), another character is about 1,500 YO and and is somewhere in the world's top 100. Canon has rumours of vampires potentially being able to completely pass for human (down to sunlight and eating food instead of blood) after a certain period of time, but I'm not sure if those are just rumours or not.

  Even if magic reduces your fertility, you'll use it to aid your sister's family; increasing the odds of her children surviving and being successful, and thus increasing the fitness of genes very closely related to you.

Not if the magic gene also reduces your fertility; if your sister has the magic gene, she's got reduced fertility. If she doesn't, she's just as fertile as anyone else but she's just as non-magical as anyone else, too, so you don't gain much.

I can imagine magic powers being a drawback if you're untrained or not expecting it; someone with random visions of the future might just think they get prophetic dreams, cassandra complex, etc.

I agree that we don't /need/ to explain why after, say, 70,000 years the world isn't full of magical people, but it would be nice. We have idle dreams of publishing the stories and becoming fabulously wealthy on the proceeds, but that's probably not going to happen. I just like things to make sense in my own head.
