[[/batshy][]] Few /hundred/? Bah. Short-termers.

[[/sp][]]

[[/dashbat][]] I /have/ discovered a number of interesting new stimulants, by the way, compounds that make your average human faster, stronger, and tougher when ingested. Well, temporarily, at least, and the side effects mean you probably don't want to give it to your /favourite/ Jannissaries... I have yet to find one that makes them /smarter/, mind you, but I can dope up my humans to the point of being able to /physically/ match a vampire for, oh, ten, fifteen minutes?
