  sure, you become an expert botanist, but only to the extent that botany was understood in 1674 when you got your phD

Which means that, not only do you have to keep learning stuff, you also have to keep /unlearning/ stuff. You have to learn about continental drift and unlearn that the continents are static and eternal; so on and so forth. (And a lot of scientific paradigm shifts happened not because people came to accept the new theory, but rather because the adherents of the old theory all died with time...)

So it would either have to be something that's an inherently limited field (like chess - no-one's going to suddenly "discover" that a King can move like a knight) or something that retains its usefulness even in the face of new discoveries (writing novels, picking pockets, stage magicianship, Atlantean magic).

  [on the value of antiques]
#+end_quote

Of course, it's possible for the immortal to turn this around - to take an antique and /make/ it valuable. A sufficiently cunning immortal may recognise the potential of (say) Superman comics early enough to buy a #1 (may even have had a hand in making it so popular, somehow) and then gone on a careful, long-term plan to eliminate /most/ other copies.

Or he may get a job in a post office and, with care, obtain a never-officially-printed sheet of some stamp he expects to become extremely rare and valuable later (perhaps because he deliberately damaged the print after a few runs?)

  if vampires were created on Atlantis, why are they vulnerable to Sol, of all things?
#+end_quote

An excellent question. At some point, some one must have enchanted Sol for some reason. Maybe a minor Atlantean family, wanting a vampire-free back garden? Maybe thousands of suns in thousands of worlds were enchanted?

  Regardless, everything being underground in one city that's easily accessible from Earth means that a vampire could easily live there. I'm wondering whether vampires just don't tend to live down there, though - they're kind of like humans, and there's all that fantasy racism happening - but then again, vampires are damn powerful, much more intelligent than humans, have a /very good reason/ to live underground, and presumably can kick a centaur's arse if it comes to it.

Not to mention which, with that whole fantasy racism thing going on, they can probably just stroll down to the market and buy a human when they get thirsty.

The first thing I can think of, is that there is a /really/ ancient vampire there, who feels he's got a really good life, and he's not inclined to welcome any more. (He knows how to kill them, too; stake 'em and send 'em back through the portal. The other end of his Death Portal is in low Earth orbit, that'll kill just about anything... and that's /before/ considering that he might very well be old enough to know Atlantean magic first-hand)
