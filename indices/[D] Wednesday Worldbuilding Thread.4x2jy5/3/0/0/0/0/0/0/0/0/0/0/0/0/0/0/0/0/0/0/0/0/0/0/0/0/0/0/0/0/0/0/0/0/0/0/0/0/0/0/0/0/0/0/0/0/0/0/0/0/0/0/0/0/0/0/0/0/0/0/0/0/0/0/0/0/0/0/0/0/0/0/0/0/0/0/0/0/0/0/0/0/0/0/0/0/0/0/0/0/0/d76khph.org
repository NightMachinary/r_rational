  I'd imagine it would be quite disheartening to find decades of work superseded repeatedly, so one wouldn't put too much stock into expertise.

You just gotta put it in the /right/ expertise. You can't make lying obsolete. Or storytelling.

That makes a lot of sense, Some of them probably breed humans, too. (I presume making them jannissaries doesn't mess with their genetics).

Probably breed them for obedience, among other stuff.

  unsurprisingly this Vampire God has a herd of quagga that he obtained from his various gifts

Maybe he doesn't. Maybe the [[http://www.quaggaproject.org/][quagga breeding project]] was started by some minor vampire looking for an appropriate gift...
