  You buy a piece of flatlander clothing to put around your finger ... Think of a rubber band.
#+end_quote

Huh. I didn't look at it like that.

But there's still something else to consider. What you describe there is /tight/ clothing. Now, consider /loose/ clothing; a loop of Flatland cloth that encircles your finger but does not hold tightly to it. It follows your finger around, because as you push your finger back and forth you drag it along; but because it's not tight, it stays in Flatland when you move your finger up and down.

Considering these two analogies, it would seem to me that /tight/ clothing moves with the shape as you described, while /loose/ clothing is left in the normal 3D world. This has a few consequences:

- The gargoyle's clothing never tears. If he wears loose clothing and shifts, then the clothing stays in the normal 3D world as he grows inside it, /until/ it is sufficiently tight; then he drags it away with him. (This would presumably mean that different articles of clothing disappear at different times). On shifting back to human, the various articles of clothing are briefly visible at the points along the transformation that they are stuck on. (He can, with care, take them off and them put them on again in his human form)

- Vampires, who turn to much smaller bats, tend to leave loose clothing behind. Consider a vampire, dressed in a tight swimming costume, and over that wearing a loose robe with a hood. When he turns into a bat, the swimming costume will stay on his human form; while the robe will collapse theatrically around him. He can then crawl out of the robe and fly away; when he turns back, he'll still be wearing the swimming costume.

- If the vampire from the last bullet point turns into a bat, then crawls up the sleeve of the robe, then turns back, then at some point during his transformation the sleeve will count as "tight" and he'll pull the robe out of normal 3D space. Unlike the gargoyle, he's going to have a lot of trouble getting the robe back, because he's /not/ a native 4D creature... (Actually, come to think of it, he'll pull the /sleeve/ out, but if he's only pulling it a few nanometres out of the universe, then he'll only drag a little of the robe out of the universe with him; he's going to have half a robe following him everywhere...)

  Then you pull your finger up and the cloth drapes around you, clipping it into place, to sort of make a "white sheet ghost costume" style piece of clothing for your finger.
#+end_quote

This looks like what I'm thinking about loose clothing.

#+begin_quote
  It also means that you can kill someone by pushing them into the 4th dimension, or by having your tail go through them, etc. It also means that if you transform, anyone who is hugging you might asphyxiate.
#+end_quote

Important safety tip, then. Never hug a vampire.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, I should have been clearer; this was always the plan. You can have a 4D 10^{13} -human-mass vampire/bat hybrid, but "in real life" they only weigh the amount that their 3D slice weighs - so basically exactly what you'd expect.
#+end_quote

Okie dokie lokie.

#+begin_quote
  It would mean, though, that when moving in the 4th dimension they have a lot of momentum.
#+end_quote

Huh. That /is/ an important point.

Though if they're taking noticeable delay to move a few nanometers in the fourth dimension, they're going to have very low velocity; that'll reduce their momentum somewhat.

#+begin_quote
  And most werewolves aren't aware they're werewolves, so there are "humans" with these "silent" 4D protrusions who won't be able to enter secret anti-vampire vaults. It also is a good way for "Our Heroes" to be able to protect themselves from vampires among other things.
#+end_quote

Huh. Now you have a potential werewolf detector. (Paint a few fancy runes around the entrance and see how many people think it's the runes somehow keeping shape shifters out)

#+begin_quote
  I'd look at it as basically one of Asimov's classic robot stories; lots of room for interpretation.
#+end_quote

Probably a good way to handle it.

#+begin_quote
  At one point, his master was about to eat his girlfriend (who was snooping around his master's quarters), and he attacked his master to save her - though canonically this happened right before the binding spell was due to be strengthened, so he was probably at an unusually high "free will" level.
#+end_quote

If he has to protect them both, by his rules, then he /can/ attack the Master at any stage - free will or no - as long as he uses minimum necessary force to prevent the Master from damaging something he has to protect. (Asimov's robots could do the same - they could not /harm/ a human, but if Stabby Mcstabberton the murderer is trying to stab someone, they could certainly grab his wrist and take his knife away, even if this led to his wrist being lightly bruised, because preventing a stabbing is worth a light bruising).
