(sorry I took so long to reply, I've been sick as anything the past week and I like to be able to think clearly when replying to your messages!)

    The big problem with that is that vampires should still be burned through glass.

  Hmmmm. Which means you're limited to considering those frequencies that glass is transparent to.

Booo! It looks like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/26gzox/why_is_glass_transparent_to_visible_light_but/][glass is basically only transparent to the visible spectrum]] - which I'm not 100% sure about because I do embroidery as a hobby and I know glass that is opaque to UV to protect the embroidery (called museum glass) is /much/ more expensive than ordinary glass (i'm talking an extra $100 for an A3 size sheet) - but anyway... umm. This is a problem.

I suppose you could say it's the visible wavelengths that are the problem, and so a mirror will still kill a vampire (like I said, I don't care either way about mirrors, think passing through glass SHOULD kill, and reflecting off the moon SHOULDN'T), but then how does the moon not? It's just degraded or changed too much? We're really going back to the image of the sun, aren't we? Hey, if the shoe fits, maybe I should try it on... [[/sp][]]

  Have you ever wondered why so much gold is dug up and then buried in hidden vaults? With armed guards? Where no-one can get at it for the purpose of making anti-vampire weaponry?

  It would be very easy to postulate the hidden hands of influential vampires throughout history leading to that particular situation...

Sounds like Fort Knox is their modern attempt at it. And microchips!

  /Can/ vampires even have children? Mythology tends to be a bit wishy-washy on that idea - sometimes they can only reproduce through biting (since a corpse is unable to have children), but then you get other myths that involve half-vampires, which I don't see working with your vampires...

Nah, they can't; you can harvest sperm and eggs for however long you could harvest them from a corpse I guess. I was just thinking you could harvest eggs from a female vampire if you wanted to, but you probably couldn't with modern technology - although the eggs exist from birth, they still need to go through some changes to be 'ready' for ovulation. Same as sperm and the primary spermatocytes. So I think probably with the technology in say 50 years time (less probably) a suitably motivated vampire would be able to have some of their original germ cells extracted and matured in vitro to create a test tube baby with an appropriate surrogate.

Their human body is effectively completely dead, their digestive system just ferments the magical blood so it can be used to make the next vampire (by making an incision and vomiting gross goo into their aorta). All the work is done by the heart and brain.
