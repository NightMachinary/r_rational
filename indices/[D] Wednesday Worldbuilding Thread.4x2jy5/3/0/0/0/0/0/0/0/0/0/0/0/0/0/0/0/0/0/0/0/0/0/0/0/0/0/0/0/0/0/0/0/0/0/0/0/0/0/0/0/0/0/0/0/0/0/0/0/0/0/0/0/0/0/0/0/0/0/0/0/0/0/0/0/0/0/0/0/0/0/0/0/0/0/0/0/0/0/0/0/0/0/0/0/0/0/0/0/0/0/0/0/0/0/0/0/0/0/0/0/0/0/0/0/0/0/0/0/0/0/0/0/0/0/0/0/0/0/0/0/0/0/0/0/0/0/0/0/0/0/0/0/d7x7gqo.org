  So while I have problems with lying - in that I do it a /lot/ and really feel I can't help it sometimes - I think absolute unyielding honesty is a really great feature for a relationship, especially for what is literally a master/slave type relationship.
#+end_quote

I think you are right about unyielding honesty. And it's certainly a feature you want to build in when you build a bodyguard, therefore the gargoyle should have it.

#+begin_quote
  He not only allowed it but encouraged it, so I guess he mustn't see the vombie as the same person.
#+end_quote

Alternatively, he doesn't see staking a vampire as (significantly) harming it, since the stake can be removed at any time and the vampire's back up to full strength in moments. (This may have implications for William; if William gets /too/ far on the gargoyle's bad side, the gargoyle might be able to stake him and then guard his unconscious body without actually breaking his own rules).

#+begin_quote
  This is like the "would a vegetarian eat a pig on a desert island" question in that it would never happen in real life where that was the only two options; in the situation at hand, the gargoyle would be more likely to rip the trap out of the ground, William could cut off his own foot, etc.
#+end_quote

Exactly. This is about the gargoyle's character, not about a realistic situation.

#+begin_quote
  When the benefits are reasonably foreseeable, he'd have no problem with doing it himself or allowing someone else to, though he'd probably urge a more prudent course of action if he could think of one (i.e. ripping the trap out of the floor).
#+end_quote

Okay, that's straightforward enough.

#+begin_quote
  Not forced to, but able to, naturally. He'd take William's values into account and if William e.g. had a banquet to be at the next evening and being stuck under gargoyle wings all day would interfere with preparations/etc, he'd be more likely to err on the side of ripping his foot off than if e.g. William was going to compete in the vampire olympics sprint event the next evening when the foot would come in handy.
#+end_quote

That makes sense. It also implies that William's orders can change the gargoyle's actions in such a circumstance - thus William can, in at least a limited way, order the gargoyle to directly harm William.

#+begin_quote
  Definitely not aiming that high. "Readable and coherent enough that my mother will enjoy it" is what I'm going for, with "sells ten copies on amazon" the "OMG WE HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT THINGS" condition.
#+end_quote

Shouldn't be hard, with a bit of advertising.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. I think we use exposition as a device in roleplaying because it ensures we are both on the same page with how the physics of the world works. In a novel, that is not necessary - the reader just needs to know enough not to feel confused.
#+end_quote

I read an article a while back, centered around the idea that the ability of magic to solve problems for the protagonists should be directly proportional to how well explained it is.

That is to say, unexplained magic should only ever cause /problems/ for the protagonist. (Example; Lord of the Rings, Gandalf's magic is never really all that well explained, but how often does he use it to the benefit of the protagonists? And when he does - to stop the Balrog - there's a cost; Gandalf is immediately gone.) On the other hand, the protagonist should only ever be able to get out of trouble using magic that has been fully explained to the reader. In advance.

I think that's a good guide on when to or not to use exposition of your magic system.

  What sort of fanfiction?

Actually, here's a challenge - see if you can figure out what's going on before reading the chapter "Paradox Explained". (One guy in the comments already did, so it might be a good idea to avoid the comments at first).

Then, once you know what's going on (whether you read the "Paradox Explained" chapter or figured it out yourself) go back and see how many hints I left.

#+begin_quote
  That was also one of the greatest sci-fi writers of his generation, in what was widely considered one of his greatest stories, where the entire plot about time skips to an extent.
#+end_quote

You have a point.

#+begin_quote
  Asimov is also notorious for his hollow characters, and I think character development is what can really suffer during time skips, since you can have the plucky young detective all of a sudden become the hard grizzled detective and not get the satisfaction of seeing what caused it.
#+end_quote

Okay, if your protagonist is showing significant development during the time skip, then you shouldn't be having the skip. (Or, at best, that's a skip between Book One and Book Two).

#+begin_quote
  Penciling in January. Will probably write a story of Red and William's life as that will cover most of the characters and will put the "vampire hunting protagonist" in as an antagonist; that said it will mute the feminist themes a lot by having the main characters both be men. Regardless, watch this space, I guess????
#+end_quote

January? Fair enough. I'll try to remember to encourage you.

#+begin_quote
  Glycogen is basically sugar that is stored in your muscles so that it can quickly be used when you move them, without having to call on reserves from elsewhere in the body. When you get tired during exercise, that's because the glycogen stores in the muscles you used have run out (also not a doctor but that's how I remember it). It's basically your body's quick source of energy, while fat is the "slow source".
#+end_quote

...that sounds like it might be right, I guess.

#+begin_quote
  I love the trope of describing technology as "an ingenious arrangement of mirrors" - it is basically saying to the reader "this is what they are using, but please don't ask why".
#+end_quote

Yeah, "ingenious" is a great word for "it works, but we're leaving all the explanations off-stage".

#+begin_quote
  I remember a website that listed a lot of futurists' (Kurtzweil and I think Clarke or Asimov) predictions for the future and evaluated them, but it also had a really cool little page where they listed ways that you could use 1950s language to predict modern technology. Like, "if they had got it right, this is what they'd have predicted" sort of thing. I've never been able to find the page since though!
#+end_quote

That /does/ sound like a really cool page!

...I've tried googling briefly, but haven't been able to find it either.
