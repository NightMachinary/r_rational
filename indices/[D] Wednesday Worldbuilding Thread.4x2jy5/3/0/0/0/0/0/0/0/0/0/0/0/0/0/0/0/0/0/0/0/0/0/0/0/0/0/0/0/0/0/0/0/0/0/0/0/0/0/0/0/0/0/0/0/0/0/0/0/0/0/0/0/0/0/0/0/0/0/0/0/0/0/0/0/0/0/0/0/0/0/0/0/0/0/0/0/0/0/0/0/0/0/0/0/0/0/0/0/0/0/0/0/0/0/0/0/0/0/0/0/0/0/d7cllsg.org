  Yeah, I liken vampires to lions a lot in this way - with lionesses and cubs being baby vampires, and full-grown lions being very old vampires.

That... works surprisingly well, really.

  I don't think my vampires can fly, except as bats.
#+end_quote

Here's a question, then. When a vampire turns into a bat - or bat-like mammal - where does the extra mass go?

Or does one vampire turn into several hundred bats?

Or does the vampire turn into one ultra-dense bat and mess with gravity in order to be able to fly?

  Does that mean vampires cry blood?

That's what I was thinking, yes, but I like the idea that the vampire releases waste products into the blood when feeding. It ties in nicely with the whole jannissary idea - the waste products themselves are addictive (and will show up - probably as "unidentified narcotic" - in a blood test).

Actually, that raises a point - if a vampire bites an athlete before a major race, and that athlete is then selected for a random drug screening, does the athlete get disqualified?

And is there a drug lord somewhere dealing in a highly addictive narcotic only known as "vampire spit"?

  Even if we let vampires fly, I can see the pseudo-sciency handwavey part being that they stop the higgs field from interacting with the molecules that make up their body, so they're not affected by gravity like a normal person is.
#+end_quote

That works for flight, yes.

  ... actually, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are both plentiful in the air, as is water vapour. I'd assume the magic of the heart would work on the CO2, H2O N2 in the air, using that as raw material. So if you kept a vampire heart in a vacuum or nitrogen atmosphere you'd be safe from it regenerating, but in real life such controlled conditions don't exist.
#+end_quote

That... alright, that works out surprisingly well for vampire regeneration. Does this mean that if you have a vampire, and continually cut off his arm, you can start converting the atmosphere of (say) a sealed room into vampire arms?

How soon would this start causing a problem if you did it on the International Space Station?

Actually, could a vampire on the Space Station (who doesn't need to breathe, after all, and let's say he's somehow protected from sunlight) deliberately use this in order to asphyxiate the entire human crew?
