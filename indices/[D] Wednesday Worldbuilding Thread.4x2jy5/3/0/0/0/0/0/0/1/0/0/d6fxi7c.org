I don't think "graduating up the drug scale" is a thing just because I've heard of evidence against the existence of gateway drugs. I haven't studied addiction much either, though my impression of it is that after the initial high it's less about seeking out a high and more about feeding an irrational desire. Drug addiction seems to trick the part of our brain designed to incentivize beneficial behavior, so it's very difficult to resist.

Additionally, the kind of people who actively seek out drugs to get high probably aren't the kind of people vampires would want to work with. Peons have their uses, but the best people to have in your pocket are the ones who can open doors. Politicians, police officers, lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and professional criminals are all far more useful than random junkies off the street that the cops pay more attention to.

I just got an idea for some kind of independent jannisaries. The one advantage peons have is that it's easy to hide regular feeding, for VIPs you need to pay extra for privacy, so many of them could be used like gas stations for whoever is passing by. They're easy to manage and easy to replace. Some may even pay to get bitten as if it were a drug, though the more forward-thinking vamps prefer their food stay financially solvent so they don't have to find more.
