Light will get distorted under water, unless the surface is perfectly smooth. Ripples, waves, splashes, will all distort things. (Such distortions will be time-varying, though - sooner or later, and probably sooner, an undistorted image will get through and hit the vampire). This would mean that going through even a thin layer of rippling water would make sunlight far less effective against vampires, but wouldn't prevent it from working altogether (it just works randomly, and only some of the time).

  If I say 0, then that means a vampire can cover his house with, say, funhouse mirror type glass and it'll be fine (right? Or would the tiny images of the sun still appear?)

It /might/ be fine, I think, as long as he distortions were /complete/. As long as there wasn't even a tiny bit of the glass which was flat, or which formed a non-distorting lens, or which formed a distortion that could be countered in some way (e.g. a compressed image of the Sun could become an undistorted image by landing on the vampire at the correct angle - which stretches the image).
