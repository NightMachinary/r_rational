  If someone had a gun to your head and told you to "drop it", would you try and figure out what they meant or would you drop them both? I'd probably drop them both, because I'd know that dropping the wrong one could be bad. That's what I'd rule. Again, with sufficient willpower/motivation you could probably deliberately misunderstand, but it would be say 80% of the willpower required to outright reject the command.

Okay, fair enough.

New question. Vern the Vampire hands Tim a gun, tries to Control him to shoot himself. Does Tim do so?

Using the gun-to-the-head analogy, I'd think he wouldn't, regardless of his willpower - he comes off no worse for refusing that command than for following it.

  Maybe. In the myth he carries her head around in a bag and takes it out to turn a bunch of people into stone, so it probably wasn't stone. That said given her dead head had stone powers, maybe her stone head would have stone powers?
#+end_quote

I don't see why not.

The other option, of course, is that Medusa /knew/ that looking at her own reflection would stone her, and took the simple precaution of shutting her eyes. And Perseus, of course, shut his eyes... which put them on an equal footing. Only Perseus was armed and knew how to use a sword, so Medusa had no chance...

  Yeah, because those isolated tribes are probably dying of infectious diseases, high infant mortality, etc. So they probably do have a huge life expectancy gap that would put the ones in our respective countries to shame.
#+end_quote

Exactly, yes.

  Could.... could colonialism actually have improved the lives of the subjugated? I mean, bad times, separated from their families and all that, but they'd live longer. But they also would have their culture, language, and traditions which probably has some asimovian zeroth law importance....

[[/twiponder][]] Better medical care helps them. The trick is finding a way to get the better medical care to them without separating them from their families and stuff. It may well be that they're a good deal happier having full control over their lands than they would be living in a slum, I can believe that... but there must be some way of getting them the medical care (and electricity and stuff) without putting them in a slum.

And I can definitely believe that someone like Jacob Zuma (current South African president, and Zulu) is doing a lot better where he is now than if colonists had never visited South Africa.

So.... it's iffy. There's good and bad, and for the first generation there's a /lot/ of bad and not all that much good... but several generations down the line, done properly, there could be a lot of good.

  Yeah, the issue isn't so much that the doctors aren't treating people who need it, but that the system as a whole puts people in the wrong frame of mind (e.g. low food literacy => people won't cook and eat healthy food => diabetes)
#+end_quote

Yeah, education is important. People need to know things, and the most important thing that people can learn is how to learn and think logically about things.

#+begin_quote
  That's so cool! I kind of resent that I grew up in an anglophone country, because I feel like I have the sort of personality that would make me want to learn English to participate in the Wider Internet, so I'd be more motivated to learn a second language. As it is my French is B1/B2 level and I am working hard at it but.... there's no real concrete motivation.

Meeste mense hier is tweetalig (nie altyd dieselfde twee tale nie). My Afrikaans is nie te goed nie, maar ek kan dit praat.

Most people here are bilingual (not always the same two languages). My Afrikaans isn't all that great, but I can speak it.

(The only French I know is "Bonjour", though.)

I'm not quite sure what you mean by B1/B2 level...

  He'd never lose another election. Actual combat experience plus 1500 years of vampire powers? Then again, his vampire rivals might want France for themselves. Oh god, a future where the vampires out "out of the coffin" and decide to wrest back overt control of the world is.... awesome.

How would sword-fighting win him elections? I mean, yes, he'd win the fights (until someone challenged him to meet them in the city square at noon) but I'm not seeing how that translates into guaranteed votes.

...this might actually be the explicit aim of some vampire politicians. Reveal themselves to the public eye, then rule the world. Of course, before they reveal themselves, they've just got to kill off this irritatingly persistent sect of vampire hunters...

  I was more imagining the Vatican having a priest on retainer, in their famous ineffable catacombs, and that's why the Catholic church has a reputation for being so conservative (they /did/ preach in Latin in living memory, after all). That priest is /possibly/ a Pope from way back, and, well, the rest kind of writes itself.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure that a Pope remains a Pope as long as he's still alive. 'Alive' is a bit iffy in the case of vampires, and then there's the whole 'unholy abomination' angle to worry about... but I doubt there would be a vampire /Pope/ given that there are other Popes after that.

A vampire /cardinal/, on the other hand, is a lot more possible. But I don't see what he really changes insofar as the Vatican is concerned. All it means is that when all the cardinals meet, there's this one guy who'd been at every meeting for the last thousand years.
