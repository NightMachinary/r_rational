    how does the moon, which is lit up with sunlight, not kill a vampire?
  #+end_quote

  So how about if, instead of /light/ being what damages the vampire, it's the /image of the Sun/?
#+end_quote

That's an interesting thought - not sure if I go for it yet. It's very complicated, though it need not 'face the reader' as such.

It seems cleaner that the act of reflecting off the moon, someone's face, hey, even a mirror degrades the sunlight in some way (like I said, I don't think mirrors need to be allowed). The big problem with that is that vampires should still be burned through glass.

#+begin_quote
  This has a consequence, that a vampire will burn when coming in contact with a sufficiently detailed picture of the Sun.
#+end_quote

This is interesting. The sun does not just produce visible light, but infrared, ultraviolet, etc. Given this, there's no reason a picture of the sun that's accurate /solely in the visible spectrum/ would burn a vampire - the other stuff the sun produces is just as bad (though - do the sun's radio waves get stopped by the shadow of the earth at night? Its neutrinos certainly wouldn't, though those aren't electromagnetic radiation).

I think you could say that everything the sun produces - radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet, etc have to combine in just the right ratios - ratios that are unique to sol's particular elemental makeup - to kill a vampire.

Cool idea if the image of the sun thing can be tweaked to allow this. The gold might be enough (though nobody can afford a golden doorknob...)

#+begin_quote
  Incidentally, vampires are /very/ lucky that photons don't travel outside the normal 3D universe, or they wouldn't be able to hide from sunlight at all.
#+end_quote

... eep. Yes.

  #+begin_quote
    Let's back up - if we want a metal that is bad for vampires and can be used similarly to silver, can we, from first principles, think of something that would make sense?
  #+end_quote

  Silver is an element. As a general rule, if you want an "element with similar properties", look for other elements in the same column in the periodic table.
#+end_quote

Oo, I didn't mean it so literally; I meant, is there something you can 'use' in some reasonable way (like iron, lead, silver, gold), would be available to, say, bronze-age people (aluminium is a bad choice) and has scientific or alchemical properties that would lend it to being vampire bane?

Gold seems to work quite well though, for its sympathy with the sun and for its position near silver on the periodic table. Plus, it's kind of an interesting restriction to put on them.

#+begin_quote
  If gold is what's harmful to vampires, then some very forward-thinking vampires have probably been spending several centuries carefully corrupting the mythology - spreading rumours that it's actually silver which is used.
#+end_quote

Yep. I could also see, say, electrum being used to fight vampires, and people assuming the silver is what was having the effect. It would also have interesting connotations with vampires and money in ancient times. Hmmm.

#+begin_quote
  [[/dashbat-r][]] Silver and garlic. Oh, and crucifixes. If you want to kill a vampire, you need silver, garlic, and holy symbols. Seriously. Would I lie to you?
#+end_quote

[[/sp][]]

And counting. Yeah. They can't resist counting things, so just drop some poppy seeds, no vampire would be able to go past that.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Another interesting thought. Would have the side effect of mages having silver wands or whathaveyou.
  #+end_quote

  Not /pure/ silver wands, but wands with delicate traceries of silver running along and through them, looking kind of like printed circuitry, sending the magic where it's supposed to go.
#+end_quote

That sounds awesome. Yes!

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, relevance is important. If it's in the main story, then it needs to /contribute/ to the main story in some way. (The reader might only find out how it contributes right near the end of the book, of course - but it does need to contribute).
#+end_quote

I bet you that story about the spanish civil war was completely relevant to the actual story because the reviews I read of it spoke very highly of the metaphors and stuff. Maybe I was just a teenager who really wanted to read about the cool band and not the dumb civil war.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    I guess you could spin it this way: vampire society /is/ more conservative, only what they've conserved from their "original" (i.e. atlantis 70 000 BCE) society is what we find very liberal today.
  #+end_quote

  You could go with that. Or you could go with the idea that vampires no longer feel /constrained/ by human social mores - humans are little more than cattle now, and there's no need to /fit in/ anymore. Vampire society could have a decadent, unconstrained feel to it - a vampire does what he wants because there's no-one around who can stop him.
#+end_quote

No need to fit in with humans, but yes with other vampires, who have cultural baggage from before written language was rediscovered. I like that. Especially because you'd imagine that many vampires would spend a few decades at least, early on, doing all sorts of high risk activities that they never got the opportunity to do as humans. After all, when your family has been dead for centuries, and there's no need for you to marry and continue the royal bloodline - it's continuing fine without you, or it did until that pesky French revolution - then of course you're going to pursue those things that make you happy. You've done just about everything you could possibly do out of duty, after all!
