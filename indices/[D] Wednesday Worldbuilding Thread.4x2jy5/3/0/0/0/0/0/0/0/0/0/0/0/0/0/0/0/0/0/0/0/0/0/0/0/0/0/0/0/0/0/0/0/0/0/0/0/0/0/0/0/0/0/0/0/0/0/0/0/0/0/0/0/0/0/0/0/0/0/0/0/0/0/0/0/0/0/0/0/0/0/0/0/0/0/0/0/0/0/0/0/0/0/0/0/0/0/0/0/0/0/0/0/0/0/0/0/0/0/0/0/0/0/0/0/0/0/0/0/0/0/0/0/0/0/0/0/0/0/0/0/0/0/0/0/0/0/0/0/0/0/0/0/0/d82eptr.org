Ok, reading paradox now.

Up to chapter 3: I think they're in a self fulfilling time loop, probably. Pinkie clearly met time travelling twilight earlier in the day, and twilight probably had to say those random things to keep the loop stable. Didn't realise that the brass watch was a Dr who memory hiding thingy until I saw the chapter title for chapter 3. I am sure I was meant to conclude something based on the hoof polish but not sure what.

After chapter 3: Oh, so the bananas have a purpose. Interesting. Not sure what the Dr would want to kill twilight for. I think I remember the Dr having grey hooves under the polish, so I think it's a doppelganger, though the persistence of the polish is odd.

Chapter 4: So, I was right on the grey being suspicious, only it's just the future Dr not a new guy. Let's see what happens.

Chapter 5: More exposition. Nothing that gives me any ideas. Time will tell.

Unfortunately I have to head home and cook dinner so I will have to get back to the story later!
