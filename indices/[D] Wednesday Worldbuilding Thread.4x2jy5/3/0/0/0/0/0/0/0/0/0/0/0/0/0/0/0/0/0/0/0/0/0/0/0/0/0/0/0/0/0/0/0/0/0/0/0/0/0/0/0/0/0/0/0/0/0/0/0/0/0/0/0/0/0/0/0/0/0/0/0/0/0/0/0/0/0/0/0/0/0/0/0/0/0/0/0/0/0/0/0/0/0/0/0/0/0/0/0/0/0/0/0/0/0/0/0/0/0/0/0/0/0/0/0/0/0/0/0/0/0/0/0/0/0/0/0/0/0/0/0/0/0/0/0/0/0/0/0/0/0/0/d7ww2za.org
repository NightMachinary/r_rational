  It's worth considering that the emotional harm from finding out about the lies would almost always exceed the emotional harm prevented by the lies in the first place
#+end_quote

It's semi-autobiographical. My boyfriend informed me very early on that he won't lie to me, except when lying is part of a board game. We were having problems partly because of that horrible honesty, he wouldn't do the white lies that are sometimes necessary for a relationship to function. So I told him he could start lying. And he did. It lasted a couple of hours before I realised that as much as I hated the honesty, it was really, really great to be able to trust everything he said implicitly, and now he was explicitly able to lie I just couldn't trust a word he said anymore.

So while I have problems with lying - in that I do it /a lot/ and really feel I can't help it sometimes - I think absolute unyielding honesty is a really great feature for a relationship, especially for what is literally a master/slave type relationship.

  The interesting question here is whether or not the gargoyle would be able to allow the vombie to be re-staked.
#+end_quote

He not only allowed it but encouraged it, so I guess he mustn't see the vombie as the same person. Makes sense - if he was owned by a human who was an identical twin, it wouldn't make sense for him to obey/protect both of them.

  Consider what happens if William gets his foot caught in a bear trap shortly before dawn. If the gargoyle cuts off the foot, then William can get to safety before sunrise; if not, the rising sun will kill him.
#+end_quote

This is like the "would a vegetarian eat a pig on a desert island" question in that it would never happen in real life where that was the only two options; in the situation at hand, the gargoyle would be more likely to rip the trap out of the ground, William could cut off his own foot, etc.

But to answer it in the trolley problem spirit in which it was asked, the gargoyle is effectively a really, really good friend who wants what's best for William.

#+begin_quote
  Is the gargoyle:

  1. Unable to harm William by cutting off his foot? (Or, worse, constrained to prevent anyone else from doing so as well?)
#+end_quote

When the benefits are reasonably foreseeable, he'd have no problem with doing it himself or allowing someone else to, though he'd probably urge a more prudent course of action if he could think of one (i.e. ripping the trap out of the floor).

#+begin_quote

  1. Able to cause temporary harm now in order to prevent greater harm?
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote

  1. Forced to take a third option of some sort (e.g. wrapping his wings around William to block out all light before turning to stone for the day)?
#+end_quote

Not forced to, but able to, naturally. He'd take William's values into account and if William e.g. had a banquet to be at the next evening and being stuck under gargoyle wings all day would interfere with preparations/etc, he'd be more likely to err on the side of ripping his foot off than if e.g. William was going to compete in the vampire olympics sprint event the next evening when the foot would come in handy.

  (/Lord of the Rings/ is a very hard goal to reach. Are you paying attention to the phase of the moon throughout your story? Tolkien did...)
#+end_quote

Definitely not aiming that high. "Readable and coherent enough that my mother will enjoy it" is what I'm going for, with "sells ten copies on amazon" the "OMG WE HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT THINGS" condition.

#+begin_quote
  [Exposition] just shouldn't be over-done, but it's fine used sparingly.
#+end_quote

Yeah. I think we use exposition as a device in roleplaying because it ensures we are both on the same page with how the physics of the world works. In a novel, that is not necessary - the reader just needs to know enough not to feel confused.

#+begin_quote
  I wrote a fanfiction once with a twist and I thought I was broadcasting the twist like anything, and I asked before I explicitly revealed it, and... no-one had got it.
#+end_quote

What sort of fanfiction? I almost wish our story was fanfiction (it started as pokemon fanfiction a long, long time ago) because the community seems so awesomely supportive.

#+begin_quote
  "The Last Question" had about half a dozen [time skips], I think, and that was a short story. So there's really no hard limit.
#+end_quote

That was also one of the greatest sci-fi writers of his generation, in what was widely considered one of his greatest stories, where the entire plot about time skips to an extent. Asimov is also notorious for his hollow characters, and I think character development is what can really suffer during time skips, since you can have the plucky young detective all of a sudden become the hard grizzled detective and not get the satisfaction of seeing what caused it.

  Fine, then. Specify a month. In that month, you write fifty thousand words. Doesn't have to be November.
#+end_quote

Penciling in January. Will probably write a story of Red and William's life as that will cover most of the characters and will put the "vampire hunting protagonist" in as an antagonist; that said it will mute the feminist themes a lot by having the main characters both be men. Regardless, watch this space, I guess????

  ...I admit I'm no doctor, and I have very little idea about hoow the human body stores energy. But I don't think you want to run entirely /out/ like that, even if you can survive it.
#+end_quote

Glycogen is basically sugar that is stored in your muscles so that it can quickly be used when you move them, without having to call on reserves from elsewhere in the body. When you get tired during exercise, that's because the glycogen stores in the muscles you used have run out (also not a doctor but that's how I remember it). It's basically your body's quick source of energy, while fat is the "slow source".

  I remember one short story - Jules Verne, I think, or one of his contemporaries - wherein the protagonist (in America) calls his wife in Europe on the telephone - and, thanks to what is described only as an "ingenious arrangement of mirrors", is able to see her while he talks.
#+end_quote

I love the trope of describing technology as "an ingenious arrangement of mirrors" - it is basically saying to the reader "this is what they are using, but please don't ask why".

#+begin_quote
  (The same story had a newspaper office which had revolutionised the industry by having an office full of interns whose job it was, every morning, to phone their subscribers and read them the newspaper over the phone. It looks ridiculous at first, but it carries within it the kernel of the news website...)
#+end_quote

I remember a website that listed a lot of futurists' (Kurtzweil and I think Clarke or Asimov) predictions for the future and evaluated them, but it also had a really cool little page where they listed ways that you could use 1950s language to predict modern technology. Like, "if they had got it right, this is what they'd have predicted" sort of thing. I've never been able to find the page since though!

It was really cool because it made our technology sound so futuristic, written in that optimistic 1950s "visions of the year 2000" style.
