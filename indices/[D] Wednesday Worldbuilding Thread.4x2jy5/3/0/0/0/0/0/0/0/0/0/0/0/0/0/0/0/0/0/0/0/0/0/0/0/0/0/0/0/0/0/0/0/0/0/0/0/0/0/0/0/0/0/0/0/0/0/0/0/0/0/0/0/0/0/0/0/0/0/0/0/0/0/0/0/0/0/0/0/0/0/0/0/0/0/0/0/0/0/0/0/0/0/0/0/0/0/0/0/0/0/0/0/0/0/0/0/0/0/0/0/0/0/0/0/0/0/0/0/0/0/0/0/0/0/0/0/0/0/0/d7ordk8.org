So, I had another thought: the fact a gargoyle is 4D and therefore has x-ray vision beyond even what I think superman can hope for is kind of overpowered.

For example, we're starting the scene where the gargoyle and his friend stumble across the Main Vampire's coffin containing his vombie double while searching through his giant hoard of crap for a macguffin. The problem is, the gargoyle should be able to see the vombie in the coffin that looks just like his master just as clearly as we can see anything on a piece of paper.

The obvious way to limit this would be to say that he's got a limited range and acuity with his 4D vision in the 3D world. After all, if you open the average paperback at your feet you can see the pages but you can't really make out the text. So giving his x-ray vision a practical radius of a few metres, and an absolute radius of maybe 10 metres before it's all too fuzzy, seems like a good workaround. But does it make sense? Something to ponder.

And, how does a creature the weight of a giraffe fly, and also be able to carry a few hundred kilos in payload? He has big wings, but I doubt they're big enough. Can we just say it's magic, or is there a 4D reason it could work? Had a brief discussion with my husband about it last night but it didn't go anywhere.

  Different ridges, but (to take this to something that's not just semantics) can I move those ridges without moving the ridges that intersect with the 3D world?

Depends on how your finger is constructed - so, basically, whatever the plot would prefer I suppose.

#+begin_quote
  If he moves his hand outside the normal 3D universe, then his hand /in/ the normal 3D universe will also move at least slightly - in the same way as the tendons in your wrist move when you wriggle your fingers.

Hmmmmm. Good point. He probably also has some sort of biology, especially since, you know, he had a kid.

#+begin_quote
  Doesn't mean that the hand in the normal 3D universe is doing the same thing as the hand a little off to the side is (but that could be handy, since you can then describe what he's doing that can be seen in a way that allows an alert and knowledgeable reader to work out what he's doing that can't be seen, e.g. when writing from the perspective of someone else).
#+end_quote

Another good point - it would probably serve the story to have him do it, whether it's a geometric requirement or simply because he feels more comfortable mirroring his 4D movements in 3D - perhaps because he thinks it's polite, for example.

#+begin_quote
  I imagined the "single eyeball" shape to be about as stable as balancing on your toe. (And for pretty much the same reason).
#+end_quote

Yeah, plus, the idea of hiding in a pocket is a bit silly to a 4D shifter. I mean, sure, she can see how it works on an intellectual level, but /she is CLEARLY/ */right there/*, she can't believe people really fall for this!

Some drabble from the MacGuffin Quest, should it interest you:

/William has a very important letter to write. When he has to write these important letters, he'll seal himself off for up to a week and end up producing a handwritten document the size of War and Peace, written on vellum, naturally, complete with decorations in the margins. The reason was mentioned only briefly - it sounded as though a pair of rare birds he gifted the Marquess Conyngham a hundred years earlier produced only sterile offspring - but it was an infraction that was apparently worthy of such a letter, and so it was. This happened every year or two, and could not be rushed./

/In the meantime, Red and the gargoyle had been tasked with searching William's extremely large storage room - it is about the size of a football field - for an appropriate gift to accompany the letter./
