  What about a bullet through the brain, or the ever popular wooden stake through the heart?
#+end_quote

A stake through the heart paralyses the vampire, world of darkness style. This means that you can behead them at your leisure - or, if you're feeling particularly sadistic, leave them in an open area and wait for sunrise.

As for the bullet to the brain - it depends. If the bullet breaks the physical structure of the skull, head, etc and causes part of the brain to become... detached, then the vampire might heal 'around' it - perhaps giving you a sort of lobotomy, or simply a brain-dead vampire.

  On that matter, what exactly happens to a headless vampire? The magic nexus of the heart is still going, albeit undirected by any form of intelligence. Does the remaining body merely grow a new head (complete with blank, infantile brain) and go on a mindless rampage until it runs into sunlight and burns up?
#+end_quote

[[/aj17][]] I never thought about that before, but that sounds AWESOME. The canon does have 'vampires are comatose when the sun is up, but can resist it for several minutes with effort' going for it, though, which might make things tricky. Maybe it would be better if the brain-heart connection is the magic itself, it's a ying-yang sort of thing, once they are separated the magic is lost - makes things a lot.... cleaner.

  Does it have to be flame, or will any source of heat do?
#+end_quote

Flame, I'd say. Boiling water and lasers are no problem. I feel like lava should be a problem but I can't think how it would be a problem but none of the above would be, so, I guess vampires can chill around lava. That actually sounds kind of neat. I'm imagining a pompeii vampire getting encased in hard lava like the folklore tales of frogs emerging, alive and somewhat pissed off, from inside rocks that are split in mines.

  Third, sunlight. What is it about sunlight in particular that kills vampires? Ultraviolet light, some magical property, the sun's heat?
#+end_quote

The magic, 'spirit', whatever you want to call it of the sun. In my head it's Sol in particular; a vampire can watch the sunrise on Alpha Centauri with no ill effects, though a particularly ancient vampire would have to consult her star charts to ensure that Sol is not visible that night.

#+begin_quote
  Whatever it is, can it be blocked by a sufficiently thick layer of sunblock?
#+end_quote

Yes; if vampires can stay indoors and not get burned, there's no reason that sufficiently thick sunblock could not allay the effects. However, for practical purposes, the sunblock would only be useful for very, very young vampires. A vampire that would die after 5 minutes could put SPF 50+ and get maybe 5 minutes and 2 seconds. Sunblock doesn't even block all the types of UV rays, let alone any of the visible light, so the effects would be far more modest than what the SPF would have you believe.

  Is it possible for a vampire to still move, even taking in no new energy?
#+end_quote

Yes. It's quite concerning that they break the laws of thermodynamics.

The canon document actually specifies that a starved vampire can be awake for 60 seconds at a time in pursuit of prey it senses nearby. Obviously somewhere deep down I was thinking of this; probably I wrote that in because the magical justification would be that the bloodless vamp isn't going to go on an epic quest for a rat, it's going to give up if it's too hard.

Also, it lets us perhaps get away without breaking TOO much thermodynamics, maybe. Perhaps the heart-brain system, which uses human blood as a primary fuel, is also able to use a secondary backup fuel source more or less indefinitely? Or perhaps we shouldn't think too deep about vampires...
