  a vampire might demolish a house to get at the human inside if said human is a famed vampire hunter who's too close for comfort; that is, when there's a reward worth the risk.

That IS a problem. The canonical vampire hunters live in a big house together and don't seem to do anything to keep it a secret. One of them is a skilled magic user who has set up 'wards', so I guess that handwaves it well enough. Or maybe I should disallow the bulldozer stategy; if a vampire is not allowed to interfere with a human's sleeping place, that's a big deal.

  Does [Thomas' sleeping bag] double as surprisingly effective anti-vampire armour?
#+end_quote

A vampire can't enter the sleeping bag, that much is obvious.

If a vampire can use a bulldozer to destroy a house with a human sleeping inside, can a vampire also use her super strength to destroy the house brick by brick?

I wonder if a sleeping bag fits more into the category of clothing (like pyjamas - it makes no sense for a vampire to be stopped by pyjamas), but then you can turn the sleeping bag into a tent and it's getting interesting - does the ward fail to establish, does it move with the tent, or is it made by the earth itself getting involved in the magic somehow? Like, is the system causing the magic ground>structure>human, or just structure>human?

I feel like I err on the side of ground>structure>human system causing the magic. I kind of like putting a precedent for the ground being involved in the magic of everything, since I like the idea of vampires not being able to cross running water as well (though.... ground water basically kills this concept).

Other fun fact: some particularly old vampires can change into bats. Well, in my headcanon they're not /bat/ bats, they're just small, furry, winged creatures that look enough like bats that it seems like a sensible name for them. I think that's less weird than them being able to turn into an actual species of flying mammal.
