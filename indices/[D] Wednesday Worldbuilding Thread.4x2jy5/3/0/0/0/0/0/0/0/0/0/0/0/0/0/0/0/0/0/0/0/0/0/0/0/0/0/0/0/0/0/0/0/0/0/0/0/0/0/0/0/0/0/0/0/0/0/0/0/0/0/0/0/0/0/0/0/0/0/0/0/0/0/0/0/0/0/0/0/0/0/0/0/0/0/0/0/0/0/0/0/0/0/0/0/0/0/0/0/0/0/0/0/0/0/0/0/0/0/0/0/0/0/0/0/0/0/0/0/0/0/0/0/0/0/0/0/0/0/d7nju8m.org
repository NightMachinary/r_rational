  Probably. I wonder how thick his arms/legs/etc would be?
#+end_quote

I'm thinking thicker than as a human, or he's going to be a stick-figure gargoyle.

  Back in the day, his 4D spouse (wife for a 4D undulating creature is a bit too... precise for my taste) probably did it. Now, he probably makes trips every few dozen years to get his clothing dry cleaned, ironed, pressed and maybe to get a new piece or two made up. For the most part he just makes do with a variety of human clothing, since it's infinitely cheaper and more disposable.
#+end_quote

This seems very sensible.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, but to risk pushing the analogy until breaks, if you are using the valleys between the ridges of your fingerprint to grab things in flatland, if you push your finger an inch up, although they are still fingerprint ridges, they are probably different ridges than the ridges that were being used as flatland graspers.
#+end_quote

Different ridges, but (to take this to something that's not just semantics) can I move those ridges without moving the ridges that intersect with the 3D world?

#+begin_quote
  Yeah OK, we're probably on the same page then more or less; only his 3D hands could all be parts of multiple different meta-hands and so one could act without impacting on another.
#+end_quote

I guess this is really a matter of how he's put together. It makes sense to me that, if he moves his hand outside the normal 3D universe, then his hand /in/ the normal 3D universe will also move at least slightly - in the same way as the tendons in your wrist move when you wriggle your fingers.

Doesn't mean that the hand in the normal 3D universe is doing the same thing as the hand a little off to the side is (but that could be handy, since you can then describe what he's doing that can be seen in a way that allows an alert and knowledgeable reader to work out what he's doing that can't be seen, e.g. when writing from the perspective of someone else).

#+begin_quote
  Yeah - Rule of Cool might require that the ones we want to try these sorts of shenanigans with be longer. Makes sense for Hyper Shifter With Lots Of Forms, since those forms take up space.
#+end_quote

Due to 4D momentum, this means it's also a good deal harder to stop her from shifting, then.

#+begin_quote
  Very good! I love thinking of what words 4D beings would use to describe feelings that they have in 4D, and the concept of 'balance' being used in this way is neat.
#+end_quote

[[/ccpoint][]] I imagined the "single eyeball" shape to be about as stable as balancing on your toe. (And for pretty much the same reason).
