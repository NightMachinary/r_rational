  Maybe the vampire hunters have anti-mind-control contact lenses. Maybe blind people, or people with the right minor magic gene, are just plain immune.

Anti-mind-control contact lenses is a trope, but it's a good one that makes sense especially if eye contact is a requirement. I did have a character wear sunglasses to a meeting with a vampire, but was vague about whether it would actually have done anything since the vampire wasn't going to try anything (she was an emissary for an android that, through a series of hilarious misunderstandings, the vampire thought was an even more powerful vampire - one who could eat and go out in the sun, oh my! - so he didn't want to do anything to piss the uberVamp off).

I was thinking sunglasses might be a good compromise (between completely neutering a vampire's powers and being incognito about it), but then again, there's no reason anything to do with sunglasses can't be replicated by contact lenses, so it's kind of out.

My original character that I made at age ~13 for my vampire hunter included purple eyes (that's on a mary-sue checklist somewhere), so it'd also be a nice nod to her history as a character to give her a particular affinity for putting purple ones in. She's a police officer though so I'm sure she probably wouldn't be allowed to wear unnaturally coloured ones at work.

    Yeah, ancient egyptian having the sun pulled along the sky by a dung beatle or whatever. Maybe vampires don't like beetles? Haha.
  #+end_quote

  Nah, they don't like dung. (Doesn't hurt them, they just tend to be neatness freaks).

Vampires as having a sort of OCD is pretty common in folklore after all (counting knots, etc)

    I'm not sure if there'd be easy ways to find say the lore of the Samburu tribe online without potentially sifting through academic papers.
  #+end_quote

  Just google "Samburu legends". (First link's a PDF - I didn't download it, but it looks full of legends).
#+end_quote

Well watch me eat my words. I suppose the Samburu tribe is pretty big, well-known, and well-studied, right? (I only know the name because they used it as a tribe name in Survivor: Africa (which was filmed in Kenya, because Africa Is One Place)).

I'll have to have a look through all that. I'm a big fan of the TV show survivor so using Samburu folklore would be a fun little nod.

  Yeah, you'd want to push the emotional content low enough that there's no trauma, but leave it high enough that white vans still trigger a fear response.
#+end_quote

Man, the first few psychological manipulations a psychologist mage tries are going to end up /raw AF/, it's kind of horrifying and I kind of want to explore it. I suppose they'd start with people who are so unbelievably fucked up from trauma that it would be hard to make it worse.

Damnit, all this world-building is making me really want to hardcore explore all these elements. It's going to go from Twilight 2.0 to Harry Potter 2.0 or something, only with lots more smooching. And with an entire probably rather interesting /ancient war/ between /magical superpowers/ that /created sentient beings out of corpses/ to use as weapons, but let's /ignore/ all that, this vampire is falling in love with an American soldier...
