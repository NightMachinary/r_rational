  It seems cleaner that the act of reflecting off the moon, someone's face, hey, even a mirror degrades the sunlight in some way (like I said, I don't think mirrors need to be allowed)
#+end_quote

That's also reasonable, and it allows you to disallow mirrors.

Image-of-the-sun means that mirrors must work, but... hmmm. How reflective is the average mirror to ultraviolet, infrared, and other non-visible frequencies? You might need to use special vampire-hunting mirrors... or maybe a mirror image of the Sun doesn't work, and you need to use an even number of mirrors.

#+begin_quote
  The big problem with that is that vampires should still be burned through glass.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Which means you're limited to considering those frequencies that glass is transparent to. (And if the sunlight relies on some non-visible wavelength(s) that glass is transparent to, then special glass can be made that's opaque to those wavelengths, through which a vampire could in theory see the Sun (until a vampire hunter swaps out one of his panes of glass for regular glass, or smashes it at the right time, or...))

  though - do the sun's radio waves get stopped by the shadow of the earth at night?
#+end_quote

[[http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/121814/do-radio-waves-travel-around-the-earth-or-through-it][Yes.]]

There's a /lot/ of Earth in there, and a lot of it's very dense. Not much is able to go right through it.

#+begin_quote
  I think you could say that everything the sun produces - radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet, etc have to combine in just the right ratios - ratios that are unique to sol's particular elemental makeup - to kill a vampire.
#+end_quote

It can't be /everything/; a lot of glass blocks at least some ultraviolet rays.

#+begin_quote
  Cool idea if the image of the sun thing can be tweaked to allow this. The gold might be enough (though nobody can afford a golden doorknob...)
#+end_quote

Gold-plated. Or electrum-plated. It just needs gold on the outside (and preferably in a way that doesn't make it obvious to a vampire that it is gold, so he doesn't know to be cautious).

#+begin_quote
  Yep. I could also see, say, electrum being used to fight vampires, and people assuming the silver is what was having the effect. It would also have interesting connotations with vampires and money in ancient times. Hmmm.
#+end_quote

Have you ever wondered why so much gold is dug up and then buried in hidden vaults? With armed guards? Where no-one can get at it for the purpose of making anti-vampire weaponry?

It would be very easy to postulate the hidden hands of influential vampires throughout history leading to that particular situation...

#+begin_quote
  That sounds awesome. Yes!
#+end_quote

It also means you might have different wands for different purposes. This one for fireballs, that one for lifting things the other one over there to turn pumpkins into carriages...

Of course, rarest of all would be a /reprogrammable/ wand.

  After all, when your family has been dead for centuries, and there's no need for you to marry and continue the royal bloodline - it's continuing fine without you, or it did until that pesky French revolution - then of course you're going to pursue those things that make you happy.
#+end_quote

/Can/ vampires even have children? Mythology tends to be a bit wishy-washy on that idea - sometimes they can only reproduce through biting (since a corpse is unable to have children), but then you get other myths that involve half-vampires, which I don't see working with your vampires...
