You make some great points! I do love the idea of bringing vampires down into having a single weakness (namely fire).

I like the war story, the sun literally being enchanted as a weapon.

As for existing canon: mages exist, on a spectrum. What you'd think of when you imagine a wizard - casting spells with great acuity - is one in a hundred million and requires a combination of genes and appropriate schooling. Something more along the lines of a magician - able to cast a dozen or so spells to a decent skill level through practise and research, thanks to genes and schooling - is one in a million. One in a thousand are people with small quirks - predictive abilities, the sort you see on Hollywood psychics. One in a hundred are people are people who just seem 'above average', perhaps with really good reflexes, an astonishing memory, or an affinity for mathematics.

The above figures give about 70 top tier mages in the world today, which is not unreasonable IMO. Atlantis could have had better schools and a deeper mage gene pool (breeding programs, maybe? or just founder effect - perhaps it was founded by a few exiled wizards)
