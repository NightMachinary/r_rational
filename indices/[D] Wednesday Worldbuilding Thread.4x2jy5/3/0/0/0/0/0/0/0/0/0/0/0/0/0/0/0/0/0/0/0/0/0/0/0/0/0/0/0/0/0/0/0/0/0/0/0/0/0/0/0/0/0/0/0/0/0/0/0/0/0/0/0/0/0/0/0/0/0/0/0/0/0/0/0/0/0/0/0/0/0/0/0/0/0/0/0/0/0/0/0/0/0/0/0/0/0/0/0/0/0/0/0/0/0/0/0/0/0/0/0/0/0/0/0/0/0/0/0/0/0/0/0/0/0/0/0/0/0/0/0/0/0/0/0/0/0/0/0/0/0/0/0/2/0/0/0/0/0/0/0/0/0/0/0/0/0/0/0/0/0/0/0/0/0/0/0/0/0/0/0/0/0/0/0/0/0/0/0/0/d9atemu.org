    OK. I am putting in that /any/ sort of barrier to direct eye contact negates the orders, including ordinary corrective lenses or those stylish clear glasses that hipsters wear these days.
  #+end_quote

  Good start. What about cigar smoke? Air?
#+end_quote

... well, that's an interesting thought. You'd /think/ the designers of this feature would allow it to work in a smoky environment (e.g. near a fire set by an army sacking a village), but if that's the case why it would be stopped by ordinary eyeglasses (which though a reasonably recent invention, you'd assume the atlanteans had them also) rather than, say, working on sound alone is obviously an issue.

I guess you could say there's a /physical/ barrier, that the magic of the vampire eye contact is like alpha particles, it's not going to be stopped by smoke but a piece of tissue paper will do it. (Just looked up alpha particles - smoke detectors work because the rate of alpha particles is reduced by smoke blocking their path - oh, and they get blocked by a few cm of air though that's mostly because of the magnetic charge).

Still, the same sort of "idea". Air and smoke are not as dense as glass. So it's just about having a certain density of material in between your eyes and the vampire's. Being behind a thin sheet of tissue paper might not protect you, but an ordinary piece of glass would.

Does that make sense? Seems like the most logical way to have the same sorts of limitations/etc.

Vampire mind control doesn't /actually/ use particle radiation, just conceptually it's somewhere between alpha and beta particles (which need a few mm of aluminium) in terms of penetration ability.

    Yep. At the time it was written, it was silver not gold, and one of the gifts that the vampire gave to the robot to welcome her to the town was an aluminium necklace studded with jewels
  #+end_quote

  You get metals that look like gold but aren't. (You also get gold that doesn't look like it - apparently you can get purple or blue [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_gold][variants]] among others). Apparently iron pyrite can look very golden.
#+end_quote

I will have to look into that, see what's around. That said, at that point, Our Heroes might be under the impression it's silver that's the big boogey man, so it's like a double fake-out.

#+begin_quote
  ...werewolves are specifically vulnerable to silver, though, right? So if the android is often dealing with the werewolf, then it makes sense not to have any real silver around, either.
#+end_quote

Nah, werewolves aren't vulnerable to anything in particular (I mean, bullets will hurt them just as much as you'd expect!). They are big on family, nurturing, pack life, all that sort of thing, take in a lot of tortured souls. Essentially they are people who are sometimes wolves, but they can't control the transformation though it's pretty predictable (not related to the moon though).

    I'm trying to work out, canonically, how /good/ she is at her /actual job/.
  #+end_quote

  Hmmmmmm. Well, she's doing most of this vampire-hunting after hours, right? And she's doing a lot of on-the-job poking into files and things, but I'm guessing that she probably also needs to spend some time out of the office during office hours for plotting reasons...
#+end_quote

Yeah, all vampire hunting would be after hours, and she wouldn't have time for any hobbies whatsoever, so she could conceivably do both. She can also be "very dedicated to her job" and "stay back after hours" to "finish paperwork", AKA do half-assed paperwork and work on leads. Hell, maybe at one point she found some sort of (invisible?) demon who was happy to do her paperwork for her while she does "more important research things", like that fairy tale about the cobblers and the elves.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmm. Having her be the secretary and have to deal with all the admin is a great way for her to both pick up leads and have access to a lot of paperwork, but will tie her down in the office a lot.
#+end_quote

Yeah, also, she's a pretty standard Action Girl archetype, has some decent MMA training, really good with a crossbow, etc, so I think it really would be a disservice to her character to have her "just" be a secretary.

#+begin_quote
  It sounds like she's going to be doing a lot of skirting of the rules /anyway/, which means that there's two ways the Captain can deal with her. Of course he knows she's skirting the rules a lot - but as long as she's genuinely good at her job and manages well under pressure, he might decide that he doesn't Know unless someone brings it to his attention. If she's not, she's going to end up fired.
#+end_quote

Yep. A kind of mutual understanding; and the Captain benefits because the slayer is /doing all the little things perfectly/, lest she draw attention to herself. Her performance reviews probably state she's a model employee but a bit impulsive and would still benefit from close supervision.

#+begin_quote
  I'm imagining her as the person who gets sent in to the really dangerous situations - where there are hostages or the strong possibility of bullets flying or so on - because she handles that sort of tension /really/ well, and knows exactly when to break the rules to save a hostage's life.
#+end_quote

That's a good idea. I will need to write some drabble for that sort of situation.

#+begin_quote
  South. Way south. South Africa, in fact, so you don't get a more southerly country that's still in Africa.
#+end_quote

Cool! We have a lot of South African immigrants here for some reason. I used to work for one actually. That said, Stargate's Baal (Cliff Simon) was my teenage crush and his accent was just awesome.

    Survivor has also filmed in Gabon (S19), which looked much nicer (all foresty) than the desolate savannah-type place in Kenya they filmed S2.
  #+end_quote

  We've got foresty bits /and/ desolate bits in here.
#+end_quote

As does probably everywhere I guess!

#+begin_quote
  And Equestria. (Yes, seriously. I've been there. It's nothing like the show, it's just a suburb that coincidentally has that name)
#+end_quote

... Is it full of tourists (or was it) taking photos at the signs? Is it like a mini Fucking, Austria?

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Is it? I should ask. My boyfriend is about to do his phD/Masters (combined programme) in psychology, he would probably know this stuff.
  #+end_quote

  Yeah, he'll know better than I do. I'm just assuming that the first time you do /anything/ is when you're most likely to mess up.
#+end_quote

I asked him, he said that in undergrad you're often given descriptions of imaginary patients and asked what techniques you'd apply and how, what things you'd do differently based on their history, etc. They also do /tons/ of clinical stuff if they want to go the clinical route. So it's probably similar to MDs - they are drilled on the material, they watch other people do it, they do it whilst other people watch, and then finally they're let off into the world with the mentors they've found along the way. So you're /probably/ not going to screw a patient up, though you're definitely told to tell your patients to find someone else if you're not able to help them (apparently there's often personality conflicts. I had one really bad false start with a psychologist who just was not right for me, and so when I tried my third one I went for basically the best one that was recommended, and I said to her "I really don't like mindfulness" and she chuckled and was like, "I would not recommend mindfulness for someone like you, it would not suit your needs at all", which was the biggest relief ever...)

  Ooooooh. Hmmm. Vampire mythology suggests that a vampire trades their soul for their eternal life, and they've traded eternity for a few thousand years

  This is very much a case for authorial fiat. Does it make a difference to the story?
#+end_quote

It doesn't make a difference to the story; for some reason I decided William had a catholic worldview (my former faith so I'm not /entirely/ clueless), it seemed to make an odd sort of sense (canonically, he's Clovis I, first king of what is now France, and he converted to Catholicism at his wife's behest). Not sure /why/ he keeps those thoughts or beliefs after 1500 years, but it provides him with some different motivations and whatnot. He obviously has a way of justifying his clearly un-catholic behaviour (murder, pre-marital relations, not going to mass, not going to confession(? maybe he does every few dozen years) etc), and maybe that's because he believes he lived an honourable life until his death, and that's what matters, since his immortal soul is probably in heaven, or will never be able to be, he can just enjoy what he has since either way he's dead forever. Or maybe vampires have catholicism 2.0 now, or maybe catholicism from circa 400 CE is very different to modern catholicism.
