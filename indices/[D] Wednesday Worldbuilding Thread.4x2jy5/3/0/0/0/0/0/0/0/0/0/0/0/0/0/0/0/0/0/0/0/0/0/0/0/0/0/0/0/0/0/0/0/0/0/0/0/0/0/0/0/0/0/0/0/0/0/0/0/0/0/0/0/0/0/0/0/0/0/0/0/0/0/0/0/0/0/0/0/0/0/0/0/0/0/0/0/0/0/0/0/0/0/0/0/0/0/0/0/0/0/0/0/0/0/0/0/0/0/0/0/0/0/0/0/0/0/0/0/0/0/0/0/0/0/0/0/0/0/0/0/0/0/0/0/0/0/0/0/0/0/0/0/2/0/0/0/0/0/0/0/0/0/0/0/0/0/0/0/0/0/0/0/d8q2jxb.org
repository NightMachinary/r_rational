  I think I'm content with making the sunlight thing work with the image of the sun, but not officially declare it so anywhere
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's the best way to go. No-one in-universe knows that it works like that, and vampires are (for obvious reasons) not really all that involved in solar photography, so it's not likely to really come up often.

#+begin_quote
  (.... would a black and white image work? Probably not, right?)
#+end_quote

That one's entirely up to you. A greyscale image is a distortion (only of colour instead of shape) - it comes down to how accurate the colours need to be. It would make sense either way.

  If I decide to go full Rat!Fic that could be how Our Heroes kill the Vampire Menace; get tiny suns engraved on the tips of their arrows.

It can work, but they have to carve /really really accurately/. Might be better to fold a solar photo into a paper plane and throw that... assuming that a folded image is still effective.

Or just gold-plate their arrowheads.

  Wu Xing

  Fire creates flesh
#+end_quote

Fire injures vampires; it /destroys/ flesh.

There are two things in that table that fire destroys; wood, and gold. It might make more sense to cast the vampire's flesh under 'wood'...

#+begin_quote
  Gold chops wood.
#+end_quote

What kind of gold are you using? Gold's soft. It doesn't keep an edge. Attempting to cut down a tree with a golden axe will just get you a blunt axe (assuming you can even /lift/ the thing, gold is /heavy/).

...

Looking at the wiki page, it looks like the Chinese philosophy uses "metal" as a category instead of "gold" - which makes more sense here, because while gold is certainly a type of metal, most metals will chop wood.

...okay. Here's my thoughts. Mythological vampires don't just sleep in a coffin for fun, sometimes they actually recover by being buried in a grave. So "earth" already has a place in vampire mythology. As does water (especially running water...)

So. Vampires are harmed by two things in the list; fire and gold. They are put in suspended animation by one; wood. They have no negative reactions to two; water and earth.

Since the Wu Xing has this creation/destruction theme going on, it would be, well, symmetrical, if those last two items were somehow (mildly?) beneficial in some way.

Fire consumes wood; metal (gold) overcomes wood.

Wood consumes water; wood overcomes earth.

So. If we class the vampire as 'wood', what does this leave us with?

- Fire consumes vampires, destroying them, leaving wounds that do not easily heal. Perhaps would that do not naturally regenerate at /all/.

- Gold chops through vampires, perhaps slicing more easily through them, or messing (again) with their regeneration.

- The effect of water counter fire - a vampire leaving a wound (or a burn) under running water may speed up (or re-start) regeneration.

- The effects of earth counter gold; perhaps resting underground, in contact with earth, allows a vampire to heal faster.

- As for wood - if a vampire's body is magically similar to wood, then a wooden stake through the heart will mess with the system. Probably the animating magic flows easily into the stake - because it's wood - but then never flows out again, because it's the /wrong/ wood. It doesn't have the right channels, the right flow mechanisms.

Okay, so I just took the Wu Xing in a completely different direction to the direction you took it in.
