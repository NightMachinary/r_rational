You're probably right. The whole general set of rules comes from a mashup of World of Darkness, Buffy, True Blood and general folklore, and I think we got the term ghoul from there.

We invented the word jannisary (well, it's a type of turkish elite guard, and we're using the word), so I might see about changing 'ghoul' to 'thrall' or something else, because you're right, the connotation is wrong.

Plus, it makes me think of this stanza from Keats's ballard, [[http://www.bartleby.com/126/55.html][La Belle Dame Sans Merci]]:

#+begin_example
  I saw pale kings and princes too,   
    Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;  
  They cried—“La Belle Dame sans Merci    
    Hath thee in thrall!”
