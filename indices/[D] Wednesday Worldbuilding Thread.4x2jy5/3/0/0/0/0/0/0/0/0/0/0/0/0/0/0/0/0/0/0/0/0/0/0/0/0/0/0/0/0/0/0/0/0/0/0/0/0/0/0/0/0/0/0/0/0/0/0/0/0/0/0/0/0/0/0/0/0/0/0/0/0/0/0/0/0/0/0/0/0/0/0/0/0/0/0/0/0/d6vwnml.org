  I think at this point I need to ask; what is the fundamental basis of magic in your world? Is it structured along classic-elemental lines, or something else?
#+end_quote

The magic system is very unexplored, especially vis-a-vis the actual mechanics; not sure how much of that is because it's unexplored or how much of that is just in my RP partner's headcanon (I don't have any magic using characters). The witch has a staff, which she casts spells using and stores spells in, but beyond that I can't really say. Here's what we've got written in the canon document:

- Magic is something that is genetically inborn, and somewhat rare. There are mild psychics, people with good luck, etc, who make up the bulk of people containing the magic genes. People who can actually learn and wield magic successfully are in the top 10%.
- Magic is also different depending on genetic skill, and who it is learned from. As a result, no two magic users will cast spells the same way.
- People can learn magic from demons, from friendly spirits, passed down through the family, be self taught, from the Earth, certain churches, and from certain animals.
- Some people who show magic abilities (such as Kung Fu Family or Prescient Guy With Nosebleeds) could probably be better with it, but aren't as they have not had real teachers and have had to rely on natural ability.
- Magic can develop in people who have no genetic predisposition through possession.

  could they make it do that a vampire is unable to know anything about the house?
#+end_quote

Don't see why not, it seems like the most logical way for them to do it - have people not know the house is there, but not find it weird that they don't know a house is there. Would be a bother for receiving mail but that's why god invented PO boxes.

  when in [bat-like] shape, are they able to echolocate?
#+end_quote

I'd say not. They'd have eyes which are of acceptable quality for seeing stuff they need to see to be able to fly and whatnot.
