Now you mention the moon, something that bugs me - if I say a vampire would be burned by Sol when they were on alpha centauri, and if I say an ingenious system of mirrors could kill a vampire (which I'm not 100% sold on), then how does the moon, which is lit up with sunlight, not kill a vampire? It's not a dose-response as vampires get more sensitive to the sun with time. Does the moon have magical properties that removes the curse from the sunlight?

(Werewolves have nothing to do with the moon in this universe, so no need to worry about our lupine friends).

  Silver was associated with the moon, while gold was associated with the sun.

You know what - we're not wedded to silver being the vampire-killing-metal except by folklore. Maybe we can just retroactively make all silver into gold, then the alchemy kind of makes sense - or perhaps the alchemists got it backwards like you said. Gold makes anti vampire nets fabulously expensive, and, well, gold is pretty useless for things like daggers and knives because it's soft. If we go for gold, how pure would it need to be? I suppose the purer the more of an effect.

Let's back up - if we want a metal that is bad for vampires and can be used similarly to silver, can we, from first principles, think of something that would make sense? Iron might be an interesting choice as I think it's the heaviest thing that stellar fusion will produce before going nova, but it's also far too common - though giving iron magical properties will make anti vampire combat more.... accessible to the common man, and dangerous for a vampire.

  It could always turn our that silver is a sort of magical conductor (you'd have particularly ancient or powerful runes being made of silver) so that stabbing a vampire with a silver dagger is a bit like dropping a computer in water - it conducts all the energy to the wrong places and makes it stop working properly.

Another interesting thought. Would have the side effect of mages having silver wands or whathaveyou.

  I meant in terms of how necessary it is to understand the rest of the story. If you need to know all about William's history to understand why he does what he does in chapter seven, then (those parts of) his history deserve greater narrative prominence. If it has really no effect on the story one way or another, then it can be relegated to an appendix or a prequel.

You're making me remember this great novel I read as a teenager - /Asturias/ by Brian Caswell - that was about the trials and tribulations of a band, but also had these little interludes about the Spanish civil war - completely irrelevant to the story. I was always bored by the interludes and skipped them, and still loved the book. (Now I want to track it down and see if the interludes are helpful or not...)

  Vampire society would almost certainly be more conservative in just about every way, I think.

Yeah, that's what I'm a bit afraid of. They say scientific advances get accepted when everyone who fought against them dies. Then again, the underground society has different sexual and social mores, and vampires would be exposed to /that/ in short order, so they are not just influenced by humans, at least - and maybe finding out that centaur society has a 4:1 m:f ratio, and high ranking females have about 10 husbands, among other things, would have a certain influence on vampire society on its own too. Or maybe the vampires will clutch their pearls in horror; who knows.

I guess you could spin it this way: vampire society /is/ more conservative, only what they've conserved from their "original" (i.e. atlantis 70 000 BCE) society is what we find very liberal today. New vampires are quickly given a culture shock but eventually manage to fit in.

If you'll excuse the terminology: human society slowly deviated from vampire society to become more "right wing", because of slavery or farming or something, and has slowly been deviating back to "left wing" ever since, maybe oscillating about like a sine wave.

All the vampires were blending in fine three to five hundred years ago, and they get a bit set in their ways as they get older, and don't like to change... some vampires might /start out/ progressive, but give them a couple of centuries and society will progress faster than they do...
