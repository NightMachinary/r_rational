  if he's only pulling the belted part of his pants a few nanometres away from our normal 3D universe, then most of the legs are going to stay there anywhere, surely?
#+end_quote

Probably... I assume he'd pick clothing that doesn't stay 'stuck' on his gargoyle form in the way described above, because e.g. the rim of his pant leg could catch on something when he's flying.

  Refining that slightly, I thought of a poncho - too big on his human form, barely modest on his gargoyle form.

The gargoyle's son has been known to wear ridiculous outfits to hide his own wings and bat ears, notably including an 80s businesswoman style suit with padded shoulders and a top hat, a Queen's Guard uniform, and yes, a poncho and sombrero so a poncho sounds excellent.

  Then I thought some kind of robe, with straps and belts, which takes several minutes to put on in his human form - but pull the right cord, and it unfolds almost instantly into a gargoyle-sized poncho.

Going further, he probably has some sort of "formal outfit" that is produced by designers in the Demon World (who are likely 4D creatures themselves) that, when put on his 4D form, makes each of his cross-sections look like it's in a tuxedo, say. These would be rare and expensive and only for formal occaisions because can you imagine the dry cleaning bills, especially when you're around blood????

  It's the same hand, it's just a lot more complex in shape than a human hand.
#+end_quote

Is it really? If we use the "finger in flatland" example, each cross section of my finger is part of the same finger, but, say, the ridges in my fingerprint in one cross section are different ridges to the ridges further down, even though they're part of the same part of my 3D body and perform the same function.

  So I think she'd work better as a /complex/ multishifter.
#+end_quote

Thanks for that - not limiting her to a "spoke" 4D creature is an interesting idea. I even like the idea of letting her be at oblique angles. Can you imagine a human, but at a /slight/ 4D angle, so the proportions seem off somehow, but you can't quite put your finger on it? Or a human who is on such a severe 4D angle that they're barely recognisable as a human and seem to have, say, a huge gash showing the inside of their neck.
