  I think you are right about unyielding honesty. And it's certainly a feature you want to build in when you build a bodyguard, therefore the gargoyle should have it.
#+end_quote

Unyielding honesty /to his master/. To others: probably like celestAI, he's honest /almost all the time/ because to be otherwise would make him untrustworthy for future transactions.

#+begin_quote
  If William gets /too/ far on the gargoyle's bad side, the gargoyle might be able to stake him and then guard his unconscious body without actually breaking his own rules.
#+end_quote

I don't think the gargoyle would be able to do that; like I said, he's more a "friend who always wants what is best for you", and what's best for you is probably not having a stake in your heart for all eternity. Then again, if he got really pissed at William he might put a lot of effort into manufacturing a situation where the stake would be William's best option (set a chain of events so one of William's big rivals is in town; convince William that his choices are die nobly in combat or get himself staked somewhere secure and wait for things to blow over; encourage him to choose the latter; tell the rival that you have William in an undisclosed location, and as long as you promise never to harm him or find out the location, he will devote as much resources as possible to protecting the rival; bam! you basically have William comatose for all time, the rival in power and reasonably happy with the situation, and you can do whatever you want. Moral: do not piss off The Help.)

#+begin_quote
  That makes sense. It also implies that William's orders can change the gargoyle's actions in such a circumstance - thus William can, in at least a limited way, order the gargoyle to directly harm William.
#+end_quote

Pretty much. "beat me up real good so it looks like my story of being attacked was true" and so on.

  Shouldn't be hard [to sell 10 copies], with a bit of advertising.
#+end_quote

Advertising: $100

Gross revenue: $10

Being able to be smug: Priceless

;). Getting ahead of ourselves here. Geez if I'm serious about my Mum reading it I'd have to buy her a kindle.

#+begin_quote
  I read an article a while back, centered around the idea that the ability of magic to solve problems for the protagonists should be directly proportional to how well explained it is.
#+end_quote

That makes a lot of sense, actually. Deus Ex Machina is basically the antithesis to this as it offers no explanation. I will keep that in mind. I'm getting very excited about the thought of having all these deeply hidden well-explained mechanics in an otherwise pretty run-of-the-mill supernatural romance.

  [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/241986/paradox][Paradox]] (MLP/Dr. Who crossover)
#+end_quote

[[/dwfez][]]

I've recently read basically everything in the Friendship is Optimal universe, so I'm surprisingly down for another MLP fic. My Dr Who knowledge basically starts at the beginning of the reboot(? continuation?) and then stops at the end of Amy, so hopefully there's no big points of confusion for me.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, here's a challenge - see if you can figure out what's going on before reading the chapter "Paradox Explained". (One guy in the comments already did, so it might be a good idea to avoid the comments at first).
#+end_quote

I will be on the lookout for some sort of twist/background explanation. I'll have a chance to read your story over the next few days so I will let you know :)

#+begin_quote
  January? Fair enough. I'll try to remember to encourage you.
#+end_quote

January's good for me! No university, work will be relatively quiet, and all the Christmas stuff is over. Thanks for that. My roleplay partner will also be writing an action/friendship story from the same universe so we'll be editing and reading each other's stuff, which will hopefully be really good encouragement. I'll have to get an outline sorted, since there's a lot of history stuff I want to put in, questions to ask myself. Like, the story is about a vampire (William) who as a human was the king of the Frankish people circa 580 CE; we pick his story up in ~1940 when he meets a young defecting American soldier (Red), they fall in love, Red becomes a thrall, decides he doesn't like the implicit slavery, ultimately ends up becoming a vampire, because while dying he begs William to turn him, and they both have a hard time adjusting to that. I kind of want to have a prolog with William's life/death, or maybe use a literary device of flashbacks, or something, or should I just keep it from Red's angle of vision so we can start in the 1940s and not really delve all that much????

Just thinking alloud here. I think I'll probably write low-quality drabble for all the above, work out what I like best and then expand and edit it.

#+begin_quote
  That /does/ sound like a really cool page!

  ...I've tried googling briefly, but haven't been able to find it either.
#+end_quote

I also tried googling it to no avail. It was almost definitely featuring Clarke's 1964 predictions for the year 2000, I feel like the page was a sort of seafoam colour or maybe like pale purple, simple times new roman sort of text on that background, very late 90s looking, it wasn't part of a blog or anything like that. I lost it previously and it showed up in my Facebook memories and I read through it again and was so happy to have found it again, and then proceeded to lose it a second time. So, we've got a 12 month wait, unless facebook has a good search - OH MY GOD IT DOES!!!! I FOUND IT!!

Check how bad my prediction of its colour scheme was!! BUT HERE IT IS. There are links to evaluations of the futurists' predictions on the bottom.

(oh and I posted it on May 20, 2011, so we would have been in for a wait if we were waiting for my memories to come around again)
