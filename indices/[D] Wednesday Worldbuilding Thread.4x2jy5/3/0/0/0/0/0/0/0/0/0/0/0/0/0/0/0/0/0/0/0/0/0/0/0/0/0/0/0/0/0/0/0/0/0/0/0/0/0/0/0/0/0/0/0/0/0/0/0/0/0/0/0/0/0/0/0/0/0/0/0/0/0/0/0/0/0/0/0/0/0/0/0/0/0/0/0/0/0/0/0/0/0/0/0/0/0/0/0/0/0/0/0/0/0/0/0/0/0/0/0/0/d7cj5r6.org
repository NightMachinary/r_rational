  Which also raises the possibility of a young "nomadic" vampire, wandering quietly from territory to territory, trying very hard not to anger anyone too much, looking for a territory of his own...

Yeah, I liken vampires to lions a lot in this way - with lionesses and cubs being baby vampires, and full-grown lions being very old vampires.

  Mythologically, vampires can fly.

I don't think my vampires can fly, except as bats.

  Tears, probably.

Does that mean vampires cry blood? That seems too gross for my sensibilities.

Canonically, the vampire's digestive system fills with a horrible, dark, stinky slurry that is inserted into a freshly dead human's heart to reanimate them - I would assume the un-eaten blood would be used partially for that, though that's not very elegant.

Probably the most elegant solution is that as a vampire feeds, she releases her waste products into the jannisary or victim's blood in kind. Depending on how exactly a vampire physically processes her victims' blood, it could spread diseases, cause haemolitic disease if the blood types aren't compatible (suddenly AB+ janissaries are looking good!), or it could simply be excreted in short order by the human's kidneys.

It also has the pleasing side effect of a vampire who is not able to feed "naturally" getting sick, wasting away, and so on. Would explain why something like True Blood hasn't been invented - but I suppose a vampire could easily enough just excrete the nasties by effectively spitting or vomiting them out... but it's less gross than crying.

  ...I'm going to go back to "vampires change mass at will" [to explain where the extra mass comes from when they regenerate], I think.

I don't know. Even if we let vampires fly, I can see the pseudo-sciency handwavey part being that they stop the higgs field from interacting with the molecules that make up their body, so they're not affected by gravity like a normal person is.

To grow an /entire vampire/ from a scrap of a heart, assuming the vampire body looks like a human body on the inside, you're going to need carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and all kinds of trace elements. These can't be created from nothing, at least not easily. The fact the growth would be very slow is a bit of an out at least, because you can have it happen as raw materials become available. Looking around my house, there's wood, which would be a source of carbon, and probably dead cockroaches which would be a source of carbon and nitrogen both, and hydrogen's easy.

... actually, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are both plentiful in the air, as is water vapour. I'd assume the magic of the heart would work on the CO^{2,} H^{2}O N^{2} in the air, using that as raw material. So if you kept a vampire heart in a vacuum or nitrogen atmosphere you'd be safe from it regenerating, but in real life such controlled conditions don't exist.
