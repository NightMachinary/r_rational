  how does the moon, which is lit up with sunlight, not kill a vampire?
#+end_quote

Hmmm. It's not just the moon. Let us say that Tom Swift (human) is standing in the middle of a brightly-lit street at noon, looking at the vampire's mansion, and he sees the vampire looking out from a darkened, shadowy window. The vampire's not in /direct/ sunlight, but the sunlight hitting Tom's face is being reflected back at the window - surely the vampire doesn't die just because he can see Tom.

So. Thinking about this, what if it's not the light that does anything at all? The vampires are damaged by anything that's /associated/ with the Sun or solar magic (fire, perhaps gold). So how about if, instead of /light/ being what damages the vampire, it's the /image of the Sun/?

Direct sunlight, focused by a lens onto a suitable surface, produces an image of the Sun. So /direct/ sunlight, in essence, contains that image; any surface on which direct sunlight falls is being assaulted with millions of tiny pictures of the Sun. Even a small speck of sunlight. (Large areas contain millions of overlapping images). Reflecting it from a good reflector (like a mirror) preserves that image, and thus is still lethal to vampires; but reflecting it off the Moon (or Tom's face) destroys the image of the Sun, leaving just harmless light.

(Of course, the vampires themselves are - at least most of them - unaware of this subtlety)

This has a consequence, that a vampire will burn when coming in contact with a sufficiently detailed picture of the Sun. (Your average "yellow circle with rays coming out" isn't going to make the cut - as a rule of thumb, I'd say it needs to be detailed enough to make out the sunspots, which means that even an image taken with an ordinary camera will be insufficient, but (say) a poster hanging in an astronomy lab, showing a very detailed photo of the Sun, will burn a vampire that touches it (worse, if it's a small enough picture, then it leaves a burn on the vampire which is /itself/ a complete image of the Sun, so the burn itself keeps eating through him like acid until he cuts off that limb. I can imagine a completely oblivious astronomer who's gained an entirely undeserved reputation as a powerful vampire hunter, simply because he has a novelty doorknob that's an accurate carving of the sun, and every vampire that grabs it ends up dead unless he cuts off his hand (and the astronomer has no idea why he sometimes hears screaming outside his door, but there's always just a pile of ash out there when he opens it). Or maybe he has a gold ring, with a really accurate image of the Sun on it - in gold - in place of a stone (a gift from his faculty, perhaps) which causes similar problems every time he shakes a vampire's hand... which really frightens the astronomer because he has no idea why this guy's suddenly lying on the floor, grabbing his own wrist, and screaming, so he naturally calls an ambulance)).

Incidentally, vampires are /very/ lucky that photons don't travel outside the normal 3D universe, or they wouldn't be able to hide from sunlight at all.

  Let's back up - if we want a metal that is bad for vampires and can be used similarly to silver, can we, from first principles, think of something that would make sense?
#+end_quote

Silver is an element. As a general rule, if you want an "element with similar properties", look for other elements in the same column in the periodic table.

For silver, this means copper or gold. (Or Roentgenium, which is one of these elements which has to be created artificially and was only discovered in 1994, so we can discard that one, I think).

If gold is what's harmful to vampires, then some very forward-thinking vampires have probably been spending several centuries carefully corrupting the mythology - spreading rumours that it's actually silver which is use.

[[/dashbat][]] Silver and garlic. Oh, and crucifixes. If you want to kill a vampire, you need silver, garlic, and holy symbols. Seriously. Would I lie to you?

  Another interesting thought. Would have the side effect of mages having silver wands or whathaveyou.
#+end_quote

Not /pure/ silver wands, but wands with delicate traceries of silver running along and through them, looking kind of like printed circuitry, sending the magic where it's supposed to go.

  You're making me remember this great novel I read as a teenager - /Asturias/ by Brian Caswell - that was about the trials and tribulations of a band, but also had these little interludes about the Spanish civil war - completely irrelevant to the story.
#+end_quote

Yeah, relevance is important. If it's in the main story, then it needs to /contribute/ to the main story in some way. (The reader might only find out how it contributes right near the end of the book, of course - but it does need to contribute).

#+begin_quote
  I guess you could spin it this way: vampire society /is/ more conservative, only what they've conserved from their "original" (i.e. atlantis 70 000 BCE) society is what we find very liberal today.
#+end_quote

You could go with that. Or you could go with the idea that vampires no longer feel /constrained/ by human social mores - humans are little more than cattle now, and there's no need to /fit in/ anymore. Vampire society could have a decadent, unconstrained feel to it - a vampire does what he wants because there's no-one around who can stop him.
