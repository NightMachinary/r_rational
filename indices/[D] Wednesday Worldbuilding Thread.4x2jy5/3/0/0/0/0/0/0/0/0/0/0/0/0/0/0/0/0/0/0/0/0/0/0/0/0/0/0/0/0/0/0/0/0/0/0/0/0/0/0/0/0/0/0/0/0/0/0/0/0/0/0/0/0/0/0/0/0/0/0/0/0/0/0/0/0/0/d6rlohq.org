  True, I can see there being a gene that makes you see the future and a gene that makes you more resistant to nose-bleeds, or gives you additional cognitive capacity to handle the stress of the prescience, or whatever - and you don't necessarily inherit them both together, or the two gene mutations don't happen at the same time.
#+end_quote

Something like that, yes. (Though I imagine the future-seeing gene would have some limitations - even at full power, there are things it can see and things it can't - and the modern person with the gene doesn't know the limits).

  Maybe the population bottleneck had something to do with the Atlantis war - though Lake Toba is about as far from Africa as it's possible to get.
#+end_quote

Lake Toba wasn't the /only/ population bottleneck in human history. Atlantis could have been responsible for an earlier one. Neanderthals might have been the Atlantean genetically-engineered slave caste...

  I can only /imagine/ what a 70,000 YO vampire would be like though, if one survived to the present day to tell the tale of the ancient war.
#+end_quote

In seventy thousand years, he's almost certain to have been hit by a speck of sunlight at /some/ point. (Unless perhaps he maintains the knowledge of the Atlantean mage-kings, and can use magic to protect himself, in which case he's /really/ bad news - you'd have to cut off his head to prevent him re-casting the spell, then stake him through the heart and wait for the spell to wear off, then leave him out in the sun... and he's got /way/ more experience in combat than you do...)

  Canon has rumours of vampires potentially being able to completely pass for human (down to sunlight and eating food instead of blood) after a certain period of time, but I'm not sure if those are just rumours or not.
#+end_quote

I think leave those as just rumours. If you want a vampire able to walk around in sunlight, it's not merely due to age... it's because he knows the defensive spells that will protect him.

  Not if the magic gene also reduces your fertility; if your sister has the magic gene, she's got reduced fertility.
#+end_quote

Ah, but she might not be expressing the gene - it might be carried, but inactive.

#+begin_quote
  I can imagine magic powers being a drawback if you're untrained or not expecting it; someone with random visions of the future might just think they get prophetic dreams, cassandra complex, etc.
#+end_quote

That could be a better reason why they're so rare - because they /don't/ always give a fitness advantage.
