Yeah, the main vampire basically get obsessed with a pursuit for a hundred years or so and then moves onto a new obsession once he's had enough. Warfare, botany, architecture, cooking (with superhuman scent you don't /need/ to taste your food), and so on. I'd imagine it would be quite disheartening to find decades of work superseded repeatedly, so one wouldn't put too much stock into expertise.

Growing a garden, or, ever since the days of mendel, breeding a line of animals that pleases you is far more rewarding. That russian guy and his foxes? I've heard of a great vampire who has bred a species of miniature giraffe for his menagerie.

And, well, those expensive cats - not the ones that are some tiny part serval, the ones you've heard about only the wealthiest having, the ones that they say are just more serval than their peers, but they look a lot more like leopards than servals? Let's just say that a vampire with a breeding project of her own was running a bit short of money and realised that rich people will buy anything.

YES. Especially on stamps. "Oh? Misprinted stamps are valuable? Guess I'm becoming a stamp-printer's apprentice, a poor one at that, and then my 'great-great nephew' is going to find a trove of stamps in +my+ his attic."

I'm also imagining modern vampires getting the first printings of everything they can get their hands on. Some might be good calls - like pokemon cards. Others, not so much.

They're really going to turn out to be hoarders, aren't they?

Speculation: many hoarders are merely vampire's ghouls or jannisaries who have been /convinced/ to keep /everything/ because their vampire master might need it some day. That way vampires get to keep a bunch of crap, and not have to worry about storing it themselves.

  there is a really ancient vampire there, who feels he's got a really good life, and he's not inclined to welcome any more.

So.... you're talking about the God of the vampires? He lives in the part of town inhabited by many of the other gods, you see. Powerful enough to be on the level of any one of them. Not that many vampires worship him - some don't view him as a god so much as a boogeyman - but unlike most other gods he doesn't have big ceremonies where his worshippers gather. No. Each worshipper has one day every century or so where they can visit the god (bringing an appropriate gift, and you know how vampires are with gifts! No fewer than three jannisaries will do along with the usual works of art, rare animals, interestingly shaped gords and the rest of it - unsurprisingly this Vampire God has a herd of quagga that he obtained from his various gifts).

Of course, the vampire god's central tenant is that vampires are not allowed to settle underground. He's probably got some doctrine, like they need to be near the natural humans, the constant threat of the sun is character building, whatever. But he's the only one who lives there, and if someone spends more than a couple of days, well, there's a reason some vampires think of him as a sort of bogeyman. Many of his worshippers just give the tribute because they think it will endear them to him.
