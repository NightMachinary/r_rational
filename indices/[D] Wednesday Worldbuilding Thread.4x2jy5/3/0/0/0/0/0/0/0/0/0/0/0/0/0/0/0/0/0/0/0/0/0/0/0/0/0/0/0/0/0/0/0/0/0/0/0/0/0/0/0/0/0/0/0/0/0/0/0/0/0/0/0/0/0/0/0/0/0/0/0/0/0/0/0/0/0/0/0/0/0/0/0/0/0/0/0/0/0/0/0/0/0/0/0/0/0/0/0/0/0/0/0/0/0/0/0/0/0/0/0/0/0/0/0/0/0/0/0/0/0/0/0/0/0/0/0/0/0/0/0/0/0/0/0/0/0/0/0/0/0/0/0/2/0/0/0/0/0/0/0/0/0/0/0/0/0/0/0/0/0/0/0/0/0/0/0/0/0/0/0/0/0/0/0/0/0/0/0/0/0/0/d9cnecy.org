  A pair of glasses will prevent it; the air in a normal room won't, but if I'm standing on the top of a mountain and the vampire is standing down in the valley, then even if he can look directly into my eyes at that distance there's probably enough air between us to counter the effect.
#+end_quote

Exactly. Doesn't seem too easy to break, and insomuch as it can be it just makes it harder for vampires to do mind control - I should do the sums for the thickness of atoms in the plastic of a contact lens and find out the equivalent volume of air to produce the same thickness of atoms. I'm hoping for an effective "naked range" of 2-20m.

  ...actually, talking of mirrors, if the vampire and the victim are both looking at a mirror and the vampire's eyes meet those of the victim's /reflection/, does that work?
#+end_quote

Hmm. I'm not sure. I'd like to say not because Perseus, but mirrored sunlight still kills a vampire so it probably /should/. Doesn't matter to me/the story either way so let's say it does. Sorry Perseus!

#+begin_quote
  Do your vampires have reflections?
#+end_quote

Yes, no real compelling reason they shouldn't, and if we found one it would probably have so many knock on effects that... yeah.

#+begin_quote
  ...gold-plating is common when dealing with fake gold
#+end_quote

Yeah, gold-plating would be almost as good at killing vampires as solid gold, and better in some ways (lighter so more effective as a weapon/etc).

#+begin_quote
  I'd be very surprised if there wasn't some alloy of copper that looked gold at first glance.
#+end_quote

I don't know, if they tend to plate fake gold then either the copper alloy that looks golden is more expensive than gold itself (e.g. copper-platinum) or just doesn't look /right/.

#+begin_quote
  Okay, that different to the mythological werewolves. (Who would be hurt by silver, but were invulnerable to anything else).
#+end_quote

Basically, our werewolves literally are people who transform into wolves involuntarily under specific circumstances. They're surprisingly mundane, though they have their own little society.

#+begin_quote
  (Actually that could be due to some ancient werewolves trying to spread the rumour that they were invulnerable)
#+end_quote

Maybe, though as they can't turn into wolves at will or even predict the exact moment, it might make the demonstration a bit trickier to do.

#+begin_quote
  That could work, but does the invisible demon have the necessary clearance to work on the secret stuff?
#+end_quote

The invisible demon is kind of a stupid idea and I don't think I would want to go with it. She's probably "just" a real go-getter.

#+begin_quote
  Secretaries have actually got incredible power. Plus it gives her an excuse to look at pretty much any bit of paper she wants to.
#+end_quote

I didn't mean to say they didn't, I more meant the "origin story" we've more-or-less settled on (we're basically doing the origin story last, of course...) is that she sees a vampire during the course of her beat (or whatever) and shenanigans result, probably including a vombie which they won't understand and will just give them the impression that vampires are crazed beasts, so the discovery that William is a thinking, feeling being will be a nice twist.

The secretary angle reminds me that I had conceived as the vampire-hunting-mage as potentially the secretary at the police station, but I think we might put her somewhere else as her character's finally beginning to get more developed.

#+begin_quote
  (It's also possible that the secretarial duties are the one thing that /nobody/ wants to do, and she keeps getting assigned them on the basis of her flagrant violation of uniform code with regard to coloured contact lenses which no-one notices except when it's time to decide who gets to fill in the paperwork)
#+end_quote

Honestly just being a woman rookie in a man's world is enough to get you to do the secretarial type roles, so I can easily see her having to take on some light duties like what you're describing here.

#+begin_quote
  {colonialism and politics}
#+end_quote

Postcolonial stuff is so complex. Has there ever been a country that was "colonised" that /didn't/ completely fuck over their native populations? Like, I imagine if we discovered Australia today, we'd form a treaty with the aboriginals, maybe arrange some mining rights and whatnot, and settlement but "do everything right". New Zealand kind of sort of came close by signing a treaty with the native peoples, but it still ended up in a lot of war and attrition, though they seem to be coming out the other end better than Australia (and I'd imagine South Africa) is.

  ...I've seen the [Stargate] film, but I don't really remember [Cliff Simon's] accent.
#+end_quote

Cliff Simon plays a major antagonist in seasons 6-10 of Stargate: SG-1, the TV series. Very fun 90s sci-fi show, I really enjoyed it but I'm not sure if I'd enjoy it watching it for the first time today because we're kind of in a "golden age" of TV quality.

#+begin_quote
  Have you seen /District Nine/?
#+end_quote

I haven't though it's on my HUGE to-watch list.

  [[/twismug][]] If you really want me to give you some stats that other countries can't match... we've got an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fynbos][entire floral kingdom]] enclosed within our borders. And it's the only floral kingdom that actually /relies/ on regular fires to propagate.

I was going to say that the [[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/worlds-oldest-fossil-found-in-western-australia-20131114-2xicw.html][oldest-fossils-on-record are in Western Australia]], but it turns out that they [[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/australian-team-finds-evidence-of-worlds-oldest-fossils-in-greenland-20160831-gr5i3m.html][discovered fossils in Greenland]] that were even /older/ two months ago. :(

  One might assume that a mind-mage in training would receive a similar level of care in his education. Even if there's only one other mind-mage in the world who can train him, and half /his/ time will be spent finding and training a successor...
#+end_quote

You'd end up with some pretty crazy dynasties that way; because of the genetic component it'd be a lot of father training his son stuff. Probably a lot of incest too, to keep the bloodline "pure". Now I want to make Icelanders have a lot of concentrated magic, which explains all their crazy mythos about elves and stuff (my partner is Icelandic so it'd be a good nod to her heritage too).

    maybe catholicism from circa 400 CE is very different to modern catholicism.
  #+end_quote

  Different? Oh, yes, /very/ different. That would have been before the Protestant Revolution, before the Spanish Inquisition, before... oh, before a /lot/ of history.
#+end_quote

Yeah. Researching the, well, basically pre-dark-ages history of Catholicism and the state of doctrine back then is kind of... not as exciting as other things I could be doing with my time, but would probably be a good way to broaden the character. I'm sure he needs work!

That said, I do think he'd enjoy the whole "divine right of kings" concept, and though it has roots in ancient egyptian mythology, its appearance in the Western world was actually comparatively recent when I looked it up - 1600s or something. But maybe the French Revolution upset him so much he decided this whole divine right of kings was a good idea.

#+begin_quote
  ...actually, perhaps he got involved in the purchase of indulgences, and thus believes himself immune to all sin, past, present and future?
#+end_quote

That sounds like exactly the sort of self-serving, egomanical type of thing the man would do. He's probably feeling pretty secure about that immortal soul of his.
