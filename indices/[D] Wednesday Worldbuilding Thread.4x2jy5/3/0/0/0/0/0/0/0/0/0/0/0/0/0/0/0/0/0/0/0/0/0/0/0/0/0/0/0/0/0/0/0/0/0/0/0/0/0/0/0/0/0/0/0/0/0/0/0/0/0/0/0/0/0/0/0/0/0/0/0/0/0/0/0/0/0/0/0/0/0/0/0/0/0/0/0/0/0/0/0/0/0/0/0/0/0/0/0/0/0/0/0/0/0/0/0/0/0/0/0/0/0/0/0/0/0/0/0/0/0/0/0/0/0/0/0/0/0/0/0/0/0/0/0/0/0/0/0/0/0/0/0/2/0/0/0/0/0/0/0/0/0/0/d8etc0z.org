    We're really going back to the image of the sun, aren't we? Hey, if the shoe fits, maybe I should try it on...

  The nice thing about it is that it /works/, at least in terms of passing through glass or reflecting off the moon, and it does so for consistent (albeit less-than-obvious) reasons.
#+end_quote

Yeah. OK. I will put it in the back of my mind and hope I get used to the idea because it seems so... silly. Then again, there's folklore about them not being able to stand the sight of a cross, and how is the sight of the sun any different?

  And, better yet, it has completely unexpected consequences that will blindside all the characters if they ever happen to occur.
#+end_quote

Yep. Let's hope the local university doesn't have a sunspot specialist whose adoring life partner didn't get a local nano-material printer to make her a special, gold ring for their 50th anniversary.

Thanks for pointing out that ghouls and money pouches could help them engage in commerce in the real world. I am now imagining that not handling your own money is a vampire custom that has survived more or less intact to this day, though it's beginning to get less adhered to.

  would the drugs injected into the jannissary as part of the feeding process have a negative effect on the child?

What's the symptoms of being a heroin baby?

According to [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8735375][one study]]:

#+begin_quote
  The specific role of the in-utero heroin exposure in the determination of the developmental outcome of these children (if they do not have significant neurological damage), seems to be less important in comparison to the home environment.
#+end_quote

And [[http://heroinbabies.pbworks.com/w/page/17918342/FrontPage][a website]] says this:

#+begin_quote
  During pregnancy the use of heroin can lead to poor fetal growth, premature delivery, and still birth.
#+end_quote

I'm going to say that the kids are probably a little less bright on average, and more likely to be stillborn or miscarried, but they suffer more as a result of their no doubt inevitably unconventional upbringing, and might come into the world addicted to feeding vampires the same way some babies come into the world addicted to heroin.

#+begin_quote
  Either way, the child would simply have half the DNA of the human that the vampire used to be, and would be human in every way; no messing around with half-vampires.
#+end_quote

Exactly. If you're a weird enough vampire that the exact DNA mix is important to you, then go nuts I guess, you have weird priorities.
