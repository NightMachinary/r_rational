  OK. I am putting in that /any/ sort of barrier to direct eye contact negates the orders, including ordinary corrective lenses or those stylish clear glasses that hipsters wear these days.

Good start. What about cigar smoke?

Air?

  Yep. At the time it was written, it was silver not gold, and one of the gifts that the vampire gave to the robot to welcome her to the town was an aluminium necklace studded with jewels
#+end_quote

You get metals that look like gold but aren't. (You also get gold that doesn't look like it - apparently you can get purple or blue [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_gold][variants]] among others). Apparently iron pyrite can look very golden.

  What really happened was the android's lawyer - a werewolf - noticed that the town's big cheese vampire was assuming she was a more powerful vampire and naturally decided that it would be great leverage for her client.
#+end_quote

...werewolves are specifically vulnerable to silver, though, right? So if the android is often dealing with the werewolf, then it makes sense not to have any real silver around, either.

  I'm trying to work out, canonically, how /good/ she is at her /actual job/.
#+end_quote

Hmmmmmm. Well, she's doing most of this vampire-hunting after hours, right? And she's doing a lot of on-the-job poking into files and things, but I'm guessing that she probably also needs to spend some time out of the office during office hours for plotting reasons...

Hmmmm. Having her be the secretary and have to deal with all the admin is a great way for her to both pick up leads and have access to a lot of paperwork, but will tie her down in the office a lot.

It sounds like she's going to be doing a lot of skirting of the rules /anyway/, which means that there's two ways the Captain can deal with her. Of course he knows she's skirting the rules a lot - but as long as she's genuinely good at her job and manages well under pressure, he might decide that he doesn't Know unless someone brings it to his attention. If she's not, she's going to end up fired.

I'm imagining her as the person who gets sent in to the really dangerous situations - where there are hostages or the strong possibility of bullets flying or so on - because she handles that sort of tension /really/ well, and knows exactly when to break the rules to save a hostage's life.

  Ha, cool. Where abouts? (If you didn't work backwards from my antipode, I'm in Western Australia)
#+end_quote

South. Way south. South Africa, in fact, so you don't get a more southerly country that's still in Africa.

  Survivor has also filmed in Gabon (S19), which looked much nicer (all foresty) than the desolate savannah-type place in Kenya they filmed S2.
#+end_quote

We've got foresty bits /and/ desolate bits in here.

And Equestria. (Yes, seriously. I've been there. It's nothing like the show, it's just a suburb that coincidentally has that name)

#+begin_quote
  Is it? I should ask. My boyfriend is about to do his phD/Masters (combined programme) in psychology, he would probably know this stuff.
#+end_quote

Yeah, he'll know better than I do. I'm just assuming that the first time you do /anything/ is when you're most likely to mess up.

  Hmmm on that note, suppose, say, Catholicism is "right" in this universe. When a human dies and made into a vampire, is their immortal soul judged and sent to heaven or hell? Or does the soul stay in the vampire until it does? Or does the act of making a vampire completely torch the soul altogether, and you have traded heaven/hell for a paltry thousand years or so? I suppose that depends on so many things that you can barely begin to speculate.
#+end_quote

Ooooooh. Hmmm. Vampire mythology suggests that a vampire trades their soul for their eternal life, and they've traded eternity for a few thousand years. But you don't heed to stick with that. William could be right - he could be just the left-behind body while his soul has moved on. Or perhaps he still has his soul, and his continual feeding off people and addicting them to his spit is doing bad things to it.

This is very much a case for authorial fiat. Does it make a difference to the story?
