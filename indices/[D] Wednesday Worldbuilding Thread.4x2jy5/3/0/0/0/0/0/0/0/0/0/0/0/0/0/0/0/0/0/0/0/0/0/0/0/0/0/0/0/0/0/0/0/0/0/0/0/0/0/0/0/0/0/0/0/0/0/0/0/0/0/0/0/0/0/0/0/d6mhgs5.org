[[/twibeam][]] Right! I'll want to judge the consequences on your reasoning abilities as well, so we're going to discuss this in depth. One at a time.

First, you mention decapitation - that is, severing the heart-brain connection. But there are other ways to mess with those two organs. What about a bullet through the brain, or the ever popular wooden stake through the heart?

On that matter, what exactly happens to a headless vampire? The magic nexus of the heart is still going, albeit undirected by any form of intelligence. Does the remaining body merely grow a new head (complete with blank, infantile brain) and go on a mindless rampage until it runs into sunlight and burns up?

Second, fire. Does it have to be /flame/, or will any source of heat do? Could one (in theory) kill a vampire with a kettle full of boiling water? (Or several kettlesful?) What about an infrared laser? Molten lava?

Third, sunlight. What is it about sunlight in particular that kills vampires? Ultraviolet light, some magical property, the sun's heat? Whatever it is, can it be blocked by a sufficiently thick layer of sunblock?

Fourthly, let's consider the starving vampire. Is it possible for a vampire to still move, even taking in no new energy? Can I exploit this by chaining up a starving vampire in my basement, putting him in a giant hamster wheel, and dangling a rat in front of him (but out of reach) to get an infinite source of (environmentally-friendly) energy with which to power my lab?
