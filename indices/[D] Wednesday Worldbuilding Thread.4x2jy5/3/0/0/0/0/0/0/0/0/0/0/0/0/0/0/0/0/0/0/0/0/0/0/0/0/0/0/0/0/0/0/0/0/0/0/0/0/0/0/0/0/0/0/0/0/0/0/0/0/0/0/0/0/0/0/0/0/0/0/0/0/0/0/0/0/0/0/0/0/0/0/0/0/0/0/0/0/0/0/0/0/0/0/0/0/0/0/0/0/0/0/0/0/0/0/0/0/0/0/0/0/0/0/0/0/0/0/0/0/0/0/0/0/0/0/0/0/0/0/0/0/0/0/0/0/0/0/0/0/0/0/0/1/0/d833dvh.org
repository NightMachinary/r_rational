  Weird prediction: turns out twilight is paradox. I have no just for it, but I am anticipating a twist, so....

...okay, /that/ would have been weird.

Confirmation bias? I certainly didn't try to put that in...

  Pre Paradox Explained: Well, I haven't read the chapter yet and as you can see I've got no clue about the twist. I know that the doctor isn't paradox. I suspect it will be one of the three princesses, but only because it has to be someone featured in the story. I am not sure who would have the ostensible goal of killing twilight. The doctor may have been wrong or lying about the hoof polish being poison?

You're on par with all the readers so far except one. (Remember, I thought I was being obvious when I wrote this. Now that you know the twist, would you like to know how many hints I left in advance?)

He is. Very much so.
