  Adromeda Galaxy Portals

Hmmmmm - I assume to create a portal, you'd need to do some sort of ritual or spell in each "plane", so good luck making it in any place that you can't reach in your lifetime.

Though that said, it would be just as easy to say the portals have a finite range of, oh, a couple of light-seconds, and parallel universes don't add to that.

  Supernaturals using the black market to sell things internationally

Yep, that's probably a good way for the supernaturals to make money.

Actually - how /would/ an immortal being make money, really? I just take it as given that immortals have effectively infinite income, but it won't be as simple as opening a bank account 300 years ago and collecting interest because, well, it's kind of pesky to "die" and will it to yourself every fifty years or so. You hear a lot about them doing things like selling antiques, old books and the like, but would a vampire really want to keep a huge stockpile of random crap like a hoarder in the hope it becomes valuable some day? They probably have a very different perception of time, so maybe it's like stockpiling all your high-end soap during the year and then selling it around Mother's Day to maximise your profits, but they don't know whether people are buying their mum soap this year or whether they'd rather buy her a day spa voucher or brunch, and then all of a sudden you end up with 400 different things you need to stockpile.

I guess vampires, having the ability to mind control people, can simply steal money, embezzle donations, and all that fun stuff. But say an immortal with no powers beyond immortality - what would be the optimal thing to do?
