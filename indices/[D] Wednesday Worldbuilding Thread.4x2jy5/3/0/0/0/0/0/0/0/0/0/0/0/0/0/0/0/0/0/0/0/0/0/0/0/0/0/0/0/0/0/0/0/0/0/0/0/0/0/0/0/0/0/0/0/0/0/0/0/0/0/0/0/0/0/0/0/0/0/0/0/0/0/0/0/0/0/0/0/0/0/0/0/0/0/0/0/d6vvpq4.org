[[/twiponder][]] Hmmm. Depending on how 'wards' work - could they make it do that a vampire is unable to know anything about the house?

Alternatively, the surrounding area could have been deliberately designed to prevent bulldozers - perhaps by the aid of a ditch, or buried explosives...

  If a vampire can use a bulldozer to destroy a house with a human sleeping inside, can a vampire also use her super strength to destroy the house brick by brick?

Hmmm. Well, he can't put his fingers into the wall to get a grip. He might be able to punch the wall enough to make a hole, or do serious damage with the aid of a crowbar...

There's also then the question of caravans and houseboats to consider. I think at this point I need to ask; what is the fundamental basis of magic in your world? Is it structured along classic-elemental lines, or something else?

  Well, in my headcanon they're not bat bats, they're just small, furry, winged creatures that look enough like bats that it seems like a sensible name for them.

Important question; when in this shape, are they able to echolocate?
