  Perfectly flat water is only dangerous from one direction
#+end_quote

Ohhh, right. You have still lake water and you can see the perfect reflection of the trees at the other side of the lake but you can't see the sun unless the angle's right.

Had a discussion with my boyfriend about how the vampire "mind control" power worked, trying to make sure it wasn't too exploitable. I figure it's /basically/ the same level of motivation as having a gun to your head - so you could have someone do almost anything, but, for example, if you asked a loving father to kill his daughter, he might be strong enough to resist you. The effect lasts somewhere between one and five minutes, so you can't have someone attempt something complicated for you, and it only makes the person /really genuinely want/ to do what you've asked, so for example if a vampire ordered a person with OCD not to have intrusive thoughts, they would fail; but if the same OCD person was ordered to double numbers in their head, they'd happily sit there doubling numbers in their head for a full five minutes and probably not have any intrusive thoughts in that time.

The person remembers what they did, but aren't horrified by it. You could order a person with OCD to touch a filthy table, and then five minutes later say "how do you feel about touching filthy tables?", "oh no that's horrible", "but i saw you do it five minutes ago", "yeah but it felt right then/Vlad told me to do it and I trust Vlad/it seemed like a good idea at the time but I would never do it again".

So, say you order a loving father to kill a hooded figure; turns out the hooded figure is his daughter and he doesn't realise until he's chopped her head off. He would justify that as killing the hooded figure seemed like a good idea at the time, but it /totally ruined/ him when he realised it was actually his daughter.

That sort of thing. Doesn't change peoples' minds (with OCD, for example, just having someone experience that they don't die of SARS after touching a toilet seat can really help them recover), but lets vampires order people to do stuff and get away with it.

  (I just like the idea of every vampire having a very visible scar if you know where to look - somewhere that's easily hidden by clothing, so it doesn't stop them pretending to be human, but it kind of feeds into the idea of vampires being a twisted unnatural mockery of life, which is always going to be part of the undercurrent of a vampire story)
#+end_quote

Yeah. I'm not sure what sort of themes I'm looking to explore with vampires. It's probably more in line with the standard Supernatural Romance tropes; they're sexy and other and dangerous and wise, rather than being tortured creatures, though they kind of are.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmm. So, basically, sludge and readings in Latin.
#+end_quote

The readings in Latin are entirely the christian burial service that William is putting in because he's a religious guy. (Also because when he had it done to him thousands of years ago, he insisted on all that sort of stuff because he was worried about his immortal soul.) The only important part is really the sludge and closing the body up afterwards, so it can heal back together in one piece. That's why I'm thinking incorporating the fire would make things more interesting, as at the moment it's not clear exactly what's required.

#+begin_quote
  And it's known to not always work... interesting. I wonder why not? Perhaps there are some requirements to the vampire ritual that the vampires themselves have forgotten (something not hard to get right accidentally, but also not 100% certain - perhaps it requires a very specific range of air temperatures, or doesn't work if the humidity is too high, or something). Or perhaps there's something about certain people - it may be that the magic genes prevent vampirasation, or are required for it.
#+end_quote

In my head it was a combination of the time after death/the amount of sludge/the potency of the sludge/how intact the heart was, but I think a genetic component is also a great idea. Of course there's no doubt magic spells that prevent the magic reanimating a vampire from taking root in the area of effect.

#+begin_quote
  Having said that, I don't think it should just be a matter of waving a magic wand and all is well. There should be drawbacks and tradeoffs.
#+end_quote

Thanks for that. I think the drawbacks and tradeoffs were the things that were actually bothering me, since that's the way of, well, life. I'd also imagine you'd need a mage who was not only a one in a billion level mage, but a neurologist, to be able to do the sorts of things we're talking about. After all, if you can fix the brain with surgery then a neurologist mage can just as easily kill the improper bits of grey matter and pull them out through the nose. However fucking around with serotonin reuptake would require near constant awareness of the subatomic state of the brain, which would be very complicated, and we have no idea how memories are stored so how would a mage be able to begin to take effect iwth it?

#+begin_quote

  - Memories are intertwined;

  - The memories are removed
#+end_quote

My boyfriend proposed a spell that removes the emotional component of the memory. So you still remember the bad stranger in the white van, but the memory doesn't cause you negative emotions. (I think another reason I had such a problem with the idea is I was imagining a parallel version of me that had her memory of abuse erased, who would completely happily spend time with her abuser and let children in her care spend time alone with them, and that made my skin crawl because it would mean I would still have happened but I couldn't have /learned/ from it)

#+begin_quote

  - The spell doesn't remove the memories, merely hiding them from the conscious mind. Over time, the memories slowly seep back - mainly in dreams - and eventually (slowly) return completely.
#+end_quote

That's nasty. Eeep!

#+begin_quote
  If you are, or work with a competent psychologist, the magic can be used to complement a more traditional means of dealing with trauma... it's not going to solve everything with the wave of a wand, but it can make everything a lot easier (or, in some cases, possible at all) to solve /if used correctly/.
#+end_quote

Yeah. The reason I got onto vampire mind control is I was asking my boyfriend (severe OCD, hence all the OCD examples) about the issue and he was pointing out to me how a vampire could force people into therapy and give them effective therapy and wasn't that a problem too? I said vampires could force people to have sex with them and that doesn't mean I condone rape. Basically, the /author/ is responsible for what the /system/ allows, but /characters/ are responsible for their /actions/. Though having a system that allows vampires to rape people is.... not great, but as an author one can choose not to highlight that part of the world.

  Will [the super mage who casts lots of spells] notice the point at which the planet Earth is no longer populated by anyone with the ability to make their own decisions?
#+end_quote

Yeah. That's a problem you always end up with. I guess at the end of the day effecting neurons on a grand scale is a lot harder than making sunlight appear from nothing or a force bolt strike someone's brain.
