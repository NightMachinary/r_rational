    Yeah... I think the problem is I want X-Ray vision.
  #+end_quote

  I misunderstood something at some point.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I think the source was because I wanted to nerf the X-Ray vision so he doesn't have, like, complete vision of everything in the universe. Having it at low bandwith is a pretty good workaround.

  Eh, you can wring quite a lot of plot out of that, if he has main-character focus. For example, consider; he has to prevent harm to William. Does this include emotional harm? If so, is he required to extend a (lesser) degree of protection to William's friends, allies, and protege? And how do his internal subroutines identify William - is he constrained to prevent all harm that would be done to William's vombie?

  #+begin_quote
    (Not complicated at all, is it?)
  #+end_quote

  Not really, no. Though I presume it isn't laid out quite so straightforwardly in the finished work.
#+end_quote

That's the problem, we have ambitions of novellising it /at some point/, if only so our parents/partners/etc can read it, but it's hard when taking into account narrative structure and whatnot. Like, we're happy to yadda-yadda over two characters bonding and falling in love and just going straight into the conflict, but in a "real" novel you can't really just say "THREE MONTHS LATER" and skip to the action. And there's so many characters and the narrative just jumps around them based on who is interesting at the time. We probably need to work out an overall story arc, lay it out, write what each character is doing at each point, and then maybe hire an editor or something to help us slot it all in the right places.

  Okay, that makes sense. But it means that every time the gargoyle pings, there's going to be a fairly large area untwisting around him. That's starting to make the ping look somewhat energy intensive, especially if he's keeping it up most of the time.
#+end_quote

I suppose it depends where the energy is coming from. After all, a wizard can shoot a bolt of force at a bad guy, which takes a lot of energy. The wizard might feel tired afterwards but the amount of energy in a force bolt is more than would be in the average person's gylcogen stores.

Glycogen: [[http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/the-bodyrsquos-fuel-sources][about 1500 kcal is stored in the muscles]], a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy][rifle has about 2,000 Joules]] of energy. This is a factor of *3000* in favour of glycogen. If we assume a force bolt is equivalent to the biggest caliber bullet on that chart, the glycogen stores are still bigger by a factor of /200/.

Whether using muscle glycogen for spellcasting is actually reasonable, it's actually a large enough store of energy that the human body could pull it off. Wow!

(Of course it depends how 'easy' it is for magic to 'uncurl' the Calabi-Yau manifold stuff...)

Add in a 4D creature which has several orders of magnitude more mass than a human to store its 4D glycogen analogue and you really have no trouble with the energy requirements IMO, though I'd imagine he might only use his radar when he's actively moving or looking at things.

  #+begin_quote
    Yes, this was one of the issues my husband raised (4D creatures can only see each other 'in range'), which is why I told him I didn't like the idea at first. I think there's a workaround, though, that has everything working.
  #+end_quote

  Instead of the radar (or maybe along with the radar) how about some sense (presumably never fully explained) that allows him to pick up nearby untwistings? This also resolves the energy-intensive untwisting radar to some degree, because he can then use it only when he's deliberately looking at (or for) something.
#+end_quote

Yeah, he also had an idea that involved seeing reflected images. I pouted and asked why we couldn't just have ether that the 4D-photons travel through, but apparently that's anathema to the whole thing, so.....
