Oh, on the subject of ghouls - did I mention that ghouls stop ageing until they stop drinking blood? I probably, did, right? Makes perfect sense though it can mean your ghoul might need to be... weaned, lest it stops aging and loses its cover.

  Imagine a minor vampire ghouling (say) J.K. Rowling.

I can very much see the situation you described and I love it. Lots of potential for intrigue and interplay.

I do imagine vampires, though, as having huge swathes of territories, but major vampires have bigger territories that tend to completely encompass the territories of minor vampires. I guess kind of like predators in the wild; a lion pride will have a huge territory, and say two cheetahs might hunt in that same area, as well as 3 packs of hyenas, a dozen jackels, etc.

The city in the setting is run by a 1500 YO vampire, has a population of about 2 million, and about four or five other vampires live there - all under the age of about 300. But the entireity of Australia is probably split amongst about 3 major vampires - west, north east, south east. Somewhere like China, India or the USA would be split more finely due to the high population, though I'd imagine for example that California would be split three ways and some of the sparser states would all be under the control of one major vampire.

  He can just use his ghoul's credit card - perfectly traceable, it just doesn't trace back to him.

Yeah, but ghouls need to be replaced every 20 or 30 years for best results and who has time for that? If humans get onto this whole bitcoin thing, then, well, they'll be set forever.
