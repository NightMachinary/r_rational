  Unyielding honesty /to his master/.
#+end_quote

Well, yeah. Unyielding honesty within the master/slave relationship. He has to be able to lie to protect William.

#+begin_quote
  Then again, if he got really pissed at William he might put a lot of effort into manufacturing a situation where the stake would be William's best option
#+end_quote

Yeah. [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff1500/fc01452.htm][Never]] make [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff1500/fc01455.htm][the Help]] /that/ [[http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20090713#.V-ZBEZSxW00][angry]].

Rules only go so far.

Eh. You don't /have/ to spend money to get advertising. Send a free copy to your local radio station's book reviewer. Get friends and family to post reviews. That sort of thing.

  I've recently read basically everything in the Friendship is Optimal universe, so I'm surprisingly down for another MLP fic. My Dr Who knowledge basically starts at the beginning of the reboot(? continuation?) and then stops at the end of Amy, so hopefully there's no big points of confusion for me.

There shouldn't be any big points of confusion. You probably know more about Dr. Who than I do...

  I will be on the lookout for some sort of twist/background explanation. I'll have a chance to read your story over the next few days so I will let you know :)

[[/twibeam][]] Great!

  I kind of want to have a prolog with William's life/death, or maybe use a literary device of flashbacks, or something, or should I just keep it from Red's angle of vision so we can start in the 1940s and not really delve all that much????
#+end_quote

That depends, really. How important is William's history for the reader?

  Check how bad my prediction of its colour scheme was!! BUT HERE IT IS. There are links to evaluations of the futurists' predictions on the bottom.

...huh. I was expecting something... steampunkier.
