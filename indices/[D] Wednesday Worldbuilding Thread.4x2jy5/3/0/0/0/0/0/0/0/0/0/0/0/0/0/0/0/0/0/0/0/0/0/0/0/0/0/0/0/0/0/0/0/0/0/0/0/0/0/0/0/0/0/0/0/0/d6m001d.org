[[/applelaugh][]] And this is why nobody's heard your name before. Stuck in a lab, working on your own projects, not interacting with anyone else.

You wouldn't notice if there was an all-out vampire war. Why, if you had ambition, /imagine/ what you could do?

Maybe the most ambitious vampires, wanting to live as long as possible, opt for the safety of seclusion.
