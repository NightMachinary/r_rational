  (sorry I took so long to reply, I've been sick as anything the past week and I like to be able to think clearly when replying to your messages!)

I'm glad to hear I'm keeping you on your toes!

  Booo! It looks like glass is basically only transparent to the visible spectrum - which I'm not 100% sure about because I do embroidery as a hobby and I know glass that is opaque to UV to protect the embroidery (called museum glass) is much more expensive than ordinary glass (i'm talking an extra $100 for an A3 size sheet)

[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19614895][Apparently it depends on the glass]]

To quote from the article's abstract:

#+begin_quote
  Laminated glass totally blocked UVA radiation, while smooth ordinary glass transmitted the highest dose (74.3%). Greater thicknesses of glass implied less radiation transmitted, but without a significant difference. Green glass totally blocked UVA radiation, while blue glass transmitted the highest dose of radiation (56.8%). The presence of a sunlight control film totally blocked UVA radiation. All glasses totally blocked UVB radiation.
#+end_quote

I'm guessing what you're really paying for with that museum glass is the guarantee that /all/ UV is /thoroughly/ blocked.

  We're really going back to the image of the sun, aren't we? Hey, if the shoe fits, maybe I should try it on...
#+end_quote

The nice thing about it is that it /works/, at least in terms of passing through glass or reflecting off the moon, and it does so for consistent (albeit less-than-obvious) reasons. And, better yet, it has completely unexpected consequences that will blindside all the characters if they ever happen to occur.

  Sounds like Fort Knox is their modern attempt at it. And microchips!
#+end_quote

Not /just/ Fort Knox. Banks all around the world! And then, of course, vampires can't handle gold coins - once upon a time, this just meant that they had their ghoul carry the money pouch, but in modern times it's a major driver behind the development of paper money, credit cards, and the watering down of the amount of gold in coins. (Vampires do /not/ like the idea of a rich man having a pocket full of anti-vampire weapons)

    /Can/ vampires even have children?
  #+end_quote

  Nah, they can't
#+end_quote

Well, that's straightforward and sensible.

  I was just thinking you could harvest eggs from a female vampire if you wanted to, but you probably couldn't with modern technology
#+end_quote

It's worth remembering that we've already established that a given vampire might have access to technology (in a narrow field) a few years ahead of what's available to baseline humans. So a vampire who /really/ wants children and is willing to put in the effort in biology might be able to manage it (but do you let a jannissary be the surrogate, or would the drugs injected into the jannissary as part of the feeding process have a negative effect on the child? Do you have your jannissaries kidnap a surrogate?) But such children would presumably still be infants in modern times, because even a really motivated vampire hasn't had the technology /that/ long.

Either way, the child would simply have half the DNA of the human that the vampire used to be, and would be human in every way; no messing around with half-vampires. (Though a doting vampire parent would presumably change her child into a vampire before he or she dies of old age - whether this is done in infancy or whether the vampire waits for the child to reach adulthood first will depend on the vampire).
