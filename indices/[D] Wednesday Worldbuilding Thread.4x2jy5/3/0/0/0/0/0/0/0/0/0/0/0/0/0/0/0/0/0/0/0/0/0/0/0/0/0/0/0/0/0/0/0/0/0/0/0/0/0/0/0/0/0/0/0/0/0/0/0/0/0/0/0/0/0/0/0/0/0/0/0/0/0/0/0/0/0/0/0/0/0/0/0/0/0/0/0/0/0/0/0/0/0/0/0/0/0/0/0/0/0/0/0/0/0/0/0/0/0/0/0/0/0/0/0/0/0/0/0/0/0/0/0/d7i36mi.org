  I'll provisionally accept this, though I think tight encompasses anything that is securely fastened to the body.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's what I was thinking. (Though, in your example of trousers with a belt, it might be that the belt, and upper part, of the trousers are tight while the legs are loose; then the trousers might vanish gradually, the belt going immediately and the legs sort of peeling away from out 3D universe as the shape changes further - stop at the right moment, and you have a pair of cloth anklets that look like they're just /hovering/ and normal 3D people can't see what's holding it up...)

  For vampires, who transform to bats rarely, they probably don't base their clothing choices around it.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Wouldn't that depend on the vampire? I can imagine a juvenile vampire who's decided that flying is the best thing /ever/ spending a lot of time as a bat - and keeping a pair of fairly tight pants, a tight shift and a pair of securely fastened jogging shoes on in case he suddenly needs to be "some guy on a late-night jog".

  A gargoyle might though, preferring clothing that is tight and stretchy; kind of like the Hulk's magic pants.
#+end_quote

I don't think 'stretchy' will help much. The moment it's tight enough to need to stretch, he'll be dragging it into the fourth dimension.

  Also, my husband raised the possibility that rather than being a 'line', beings with transformations exist in a 'torus', so someone with 3 forms can go between any of them at will.
#+end_quote

I /think/ you're going to need to go at least 5D for this to work without him having to intersect the 3D universe in two pla-

...no, wait, the slice that intersects with the 3D universe can do so on a tangent. This means that he always "sticks out" in the same direction, unlike the carrot-type vampire, who "sticks out" to the one side as a human and to the other side as a bat.

Going back to the 4D anti-vampire corridor, if you take out /one/ of the two 4D walls (making your selection carefully), you can still keep the Torus Shifter out while allowing vampires or werewolves in (but only in one of their two forms).

  Sure, he'll have a robe surrounding him when he's next feeling batty, but it's not going to make him look ridiculous for the rest of his life.
#+end_quote

Worse, it's stuck /halfway/ along the transformation! Next time he changes to a bat, he can cut off more parts of the robe, but he still feels an odd tightness /somewhere/ (he can't quite figure out where) and, every time he shifts, he's encases in the tattered remains of a robe sleeve out of /nowhere/ for a moment mid-transform.

And if /that's/ not bad enough, every time that gargoyle sees him, the stupid gargoyle starts laughing! What on earth does he find so /funny?/

(I imagine this being eventually sorted out when the gargoyle steps up to the vampire, reaches out, his hand vanishes, there's an odd little tug in an indescribable place, and then the gargoyle's hand reappears, holding the ragged remnants of the sleeve.)

  Somewhat, but 10^{13} is huge. I should ask my 4D expert for whether the momentum would be "huge" or "negligable" which I'm sure it's going to wind up being one or the other.
#+end_quote

Nano is, what 10^{-9?} And let's say ten seconds for the transformation, and a 1nm transform thickness. Then you're talking 0.1nm/s velocity, thus [ 10^{13} * 10^{-10} ] or a momentum difference by a factor of 10^{3} or around 1000.

...okay, so it still works out to a huge difference. (But by juggling 4D thickness and transformation time, you can pretty much set that momentum to any value you want; put the 4D thickness in femtometers and you'll have a shapeshifting momentum that's horrible tiny)

  He doesn't have to protect his girlfriend - he just /wants/ to.
#+end_quote

Fair enough. If his preprogrammed rules just say "No harm may come to the Master" then he can still attack at any time, as long as he doesn't actually cause any harm - deliberate or not.

And yes, that justification works.

I don't know if you're familiar with a webcomic called Freefall? There are a number of characters (including robots and at least one genetically engineered wolf) who are constrained by Asimov's three laws. At one point, said wolf saw a human threaten a non-human friend of hers with a knife (a rubber knife, but she didn't know that) and promptly restrained the attacker because "running with knives is dangerous, you could do yourself an injury".

(At another point, she asks "I'm supposed to save any human in imminent danger of death, right? No matter how they got there? So... is it normal for me to fantasise about breaking into Death Row and freeing all the prisoners there?")
