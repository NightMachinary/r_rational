  Are there any celebrities, past or present, who were known for being nomads?

  More realistically I'd imagine usurping someone else's ghoul would result in retribution unless you were much stronger than them yourself.

You don't even need a local millionaire. You just need a local banker. (Hey, no skin off /your/ nose if /he/ is arrested for embezzlement, right? And then mysteriously dies in prison, after transferring a lot of money to an untraceable Swiss bank account...)

...depends whether cholesterol tastes good or not. Other than that, yes, that's probably right.
