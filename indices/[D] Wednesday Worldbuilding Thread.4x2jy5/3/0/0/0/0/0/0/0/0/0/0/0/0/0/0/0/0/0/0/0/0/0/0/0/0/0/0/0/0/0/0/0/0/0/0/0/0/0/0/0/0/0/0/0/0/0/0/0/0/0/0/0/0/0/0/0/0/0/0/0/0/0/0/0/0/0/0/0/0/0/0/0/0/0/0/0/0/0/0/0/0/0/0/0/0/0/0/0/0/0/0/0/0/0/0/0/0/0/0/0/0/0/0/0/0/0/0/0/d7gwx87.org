  In re-writing a transformation scene, I realised something else: clothing. The second you start transforming, your clothes disappear.
#+end_quote

Why? They're not glued to your body.

Clothing - normal, mundane clothing - consists basically of a series of tubes of cloth, which rest on your body and follow its movement in the normal three dimensions.

As per your earlier bullet points, a non-magical item (such as a shirt) does not normally move in the fourth dimensions. This implies that it somehow 'sticks' to the three-dimensional surface of our world - and the occupant of those clothes, sliding four-dimensionally through them, is not going to provide anything like the force necessary to overcome that stickiness. Rather, the clothes will 'fall' around the three-dimensional body.

When a vampire changes to a bat, this results in the clothes crumpling around him; when the gargoyle shifts out of his human form, this results in seams ripping and tearing and his trousers getting thoroughly ruined by his tail (so he, at least, probably wants to get undressed first, just to keep the cost of continually buying more clothes manageable).

  (Hubs also told me that 4D beings would weigh 10^{13} times their 'earth mass' unless they protruded only, say, 1nm into the 4th dimension, so I've decided to keep them 'short', which means that they wouldn't need too many outfits).
#+end_quote

This isn't going to fly. I'll trust his calculations, but if the mass of a 4D being is the mass of the /entire/ 4D being and not just the current 3D slice, then the bat-form vampire is going to weigh exactly the same as the human-form vampire. And whichever way round you handle that, it just isn't going to work.

I recommend going with the claim that there are no Higgs bosons in 4D space if anyone asks, and just treat the creature as if it were the mass of the slice currently in the 3D universe.

(Also, looking at your transformation scene, I notice you have the gargoyle's mass increasing as he shifts).

#+begin_quote
  We've worked out that it would be a 3D analog of what happens if you punch a hole in a painting and then press it back into 2 dimensions.
#+end_quote

Okay, that works well. (And even if the door is strong enough to resist having a gargoyle's tail slamming into it - I'm thinking a bank vault door or similar - he can still use the apparently disconnected end of his tail to feel for and pull the handle on the far side. Which also means that if the bank vault can be opened from the inside, then he can open it from the outside...).

#+begin_quote
  Very few doors are going to give something with a 4D creature's mass any problem, but it is feasible, especially if a mage were to build a magic, 4D door.
#+end_quote

A 4D door isn't going to stop an intelligent gargoyle for long, unless the room it's securing also has nice, strong 4D walls...

Come to think of it, a suitably knowledgeable mage (or an Atlantean) could create a corridor with 4D walls just a fraction outside the universe on both sides. Done correctly, a normal, 3D human can stroll down there no problem, but no shapeshifter can squeeze in... and it's going to annoy vampires and werewolves like anything, because they can't see /why/ they can't squeeze in. (I imagine it'll feel like some kind of invisible anti-vampire wall...)

#+begin_quote
  But he would absolutely work under some behavioral laws, and be 'programmed' not to mind them. They're obviously not /too/ rigid as he's had time for a family and hobbies and whatnot, but hey, who cares if the help have hobbies as long as they're there when the vampire hunters come, right?
#+end_quote

Sounds sensible. Plus, having hobbies gives him something more to fight for.

#+begin_quote
  Probably a good idea; he was at one point the guardian of a large cathedral, and the resident vampire took a liking to him, 'reprogrammed' him by casting the right spell at the right time, and, well, the rest is history as they say.
#+end_quote

The right spell being the Atlantean equivalent of "login: root password: ******** command: Protect me, maximum priority" or something along those lines, I take it.

What happens if some of his programmed desires conflict? Such as, for example, if he has to protect a vampire but also has a lower-level compulsion to kill vampires? Does he take up hunting other vampires as a hobby?

#+begin_quote
  Probably the best idea. His power requirements can be so great that he really needs the full amount of daylight to be sufficiently charged, but in an emergency he can change with no problem. That said, he is made of sandstone, and I'm not sure there's a universe in which solar cells could look identical to sandstone? (I guess in a universe where sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic?)
#+end_quote

Yeah, these are definitely going to have to be "sufficiently advanced" solar cells.

#+begin_quote
  This is probably one of the 'features' of him having a human form at all, which I still haven't got a super good explanation for.
#+end_quote

- He was intended as a protector for his builder's daughter. Like all little girls, she loved dressing up dolls, so the builder made sure he had a humanoid form, suitable for being dressed up.

- His builder expected that he would occasionally be required to wear a tuxedo (or equivalently formal outfit) and serve drinks.

- He was built with the expectation that he would be occasionally tracking down humans. His builder didn't want people to be able to escape him by running into an eight-foot tunnel.

- Most weapons and equipment are designed to be wielded by human-shaped limbs. His builder wanted to make sure he could use such items if necessary. (It's a pain to pull a trigger with a wicked, curved claw, after all).

(Note that none of this requires him to be anywhere near average human height... and as a security guard, being /huge/ is better for intimidation in any case).

#+begin_quote
  maybe his 'creator' just wiped all his memories from the past 70,000 years so he'd work better?
#+end_quote

Huh. Now, /that's/ quite a plot hook.

#+begin_quote
  How fast would it be? Hmm. An arm weighs about 4kg, and takes two days to regenerate
#+end_quote

...okay, I was thinking "arm-takes-five-minutes-to-regenerate" type horror-movie-monster regeneration. At your speed, yes, I can see how the bit of vombie heart could be safely used on a space station. (Still not quite sure how it helps, but at least there's no killer monsters getting loose anymore.)

Neat.
