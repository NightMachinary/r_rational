  Good thought, but I always worry about anything that puts magic genes further in the past and thus having even more time to propagate.
#+end_quote

If it's far back enough to have propagated to different ethnicities, then it's already far enough back that it's propagated as far as it's going to propagate. Moving it further back doesn't change anything in that regard.

  Agreed. Unless he's a recluse in a cave somewhere. I'd imagine you'd get pretty fucking enlightened after 70,000 years. I'll put 'extant group of mage-kings looking after an ancient vampire' in my head though.

Yeah, if it makes a good story, definitely put him in. But there's no necessity for him to be there unless you specifically want him.

  Question: do you think vampires need more, less or the same amount of blood as they age?
#+end_quote

Hmmm. I'm going to guess that they somehow gather some sort of energy (probably magical) from blood, which helps to sustain them. And perhaps powers some of their more supernatural abilities.

I'd guess that if the vampire's doing the same stuff, he'll need the same amount of blood. But will he be doing the same stuff? An older vampire might know lost Atlantean magic, which requires a certain amount of blood-energy to use; on the other hand, he would be able to better predict when and how to use his magic to best effect, getting the same result as a junior vampire but with less effort.

So the 70 000 year old vampire might use either more or less blood than a two-year-old vampire. But his physical age has nothing to do with it.

  I think for magic to work, having it require a constellation of genes that play off each other constructively AND also have appropriate teaching
#+end_quote

That looks like it would work well. Someone might be lucky enough to stumble onto training (and there might actually be genes /for/ luck, I've seen that used very well before) but that would certainly limit the propagation a lot.
