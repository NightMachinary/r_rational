  How widespread is magic use among animals?
#+end_quote

[[/dashieshrug-in][]] Can't help here, really sorry. That was my partner's addition and I have no head-canon for it. I'll ask her.

  Once someone has been possessed (and thus gained magic), does he retain access to magic if the possession is exercised? (Assume he has zero genetic disposition pre-possession) Does anyone possessed by the same spirit gain the same magical abilities?
#+end_quote

Again, not really sure; I'd imagine the magic skillz are specific to the spirit doing the posession, the human body is just a vessel (I believe you can be posessed by a spirit and not be aware of it, though - but that's all part of a plot line that was never explored and abandoned).

  On the house - it could just make the house supernaturally uninteresting. Yes, there's a house there, but it's so incredibly mundane that any hunters are surely elsewhere...

Basically, a Somebody Else's Problem Field? Love it!

  Do your vampires have the ability to become wolves as well?
#+end_quote

I don't think so; we have werewolves so that niche is filled.

#+begin_quote
  There are demons and spirits? Hmmmm. What's known about them?
#+end_quote

Spirits have very little explanation; demons are reasonably well fleshed out and my god are they complicated. Short form: basically every folklore demon, creature, cryptid etc exists in an underground world (or plane-shifted world; one demon character says it's under the surface of the moon, though in-universe it's mentioned he's wrong because of the gravity not being different). It can be teleported between by using teleportation booths. There are thousands of 'pure' demon species (e.g. centaurs, gargoyles, sirens, kelpies), and they generally live in this 'underground' world in their own version of society.

They can interbreed with each other, though it's rare (on par with getting pregnant from precum). If e.g. a centaur and a gargoyle have a baby, the baby is mostly human in appearance with maybe a horse tail and funky teeth and some claws. This is because the human state is considered to be the "base", "impure" state of all living things, and the individual demon bloodlines are "perfect", and this perfection fades away with interbreeding. A lot of mostly-human creatures from folklore are actually these half-breeds. Legend has it that humans were created when half breeds kept on interbreeding until the supernatural essence was almost lost. Regardless, demons and half breeds can breed with humans, which is where a lot of the 'magic genes' originated. (Two of the major characters are a half-breed and his dad, which is why there's so much detail here)

Demons ignore humans for the most part, though many keep them as pets, eat them, and the like - generally they're from stock that stays on the demon plane rather than from kidnapping from 'our world'. That said, many demons take humans who are in abusive homes on as pets, improving their lot. Still others fall in love with humans and keep them as "pets" because it's not socially acceptable to be in a relationship with a human. Still others have human "pets" and the humans are into it as a BDSM thing.

Racism against humans and half breeds runs deep in the demon world, too. Humans are /literally/ seen as on par with animals, and half-breeds are not considered all that much better (though half-breeds have all the rights a full demon has).

Also, demons have the sorts of powers you'd expect: a gorgon will turn you into stone, for example, and a dragon can breathe fire.
