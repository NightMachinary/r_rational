  Do you want "clean"?

Good point. No, I don't. I'm behind this; they can even be the zombie equivalents of this canon, as I can imagine that the link between vampires and zombiepires is not obvious to people inhabiting the universe. Here's some new canon that this has given me:

- A stake in the torso will freeze them until the stake is removed. It also has the effect of preventing any healing from occurring. It effectively puts them into a state of suspended animation; they will not require food. Some particularly desperate hungry vampires have been known to self-stake.
- Vampire limbs grow back when they're severed; the magic comes from the heart, and there are risks of starfish-like duplication if the heart is merely cut into pieces instead of burned. (Don't worry TOO much; if the heart is still inside the torso, it will join back together. But if your bullet to the chest splatters heart matter throughout the room? You'd better burn that shit down or in a few months you'll have zombie vampires on the loose.)

  - An arm will grow back over two or three nights.
  - Another huge concern is that a vampire body, after being beheaded, can actually grow an entire new head. The new head starts out bald but will have a decent head of hair after a night or two. The brain is blank, having only the most basic instincts - move towards and eat anything that is full of blood, and avoid bright lights.

- Slayers are advised to behead, stake, and drag vampires into the open to avoid this.

  Okay, backstory time; why Sol in particular? What's so special about this sun? What are the odds that vampires would live on a world whose sun is one of the very few things that can utterly, entirely, absolutely and easily destroy them?

I look at it from the other way: what are the odds that a /completely different/ star, with different spectral properties, a different relationship with the planet vampires evolved on, would be able kill them? The thing that's special about this sun is that vampires evolved on a planet that orbits it. I'm not tied to this idea, but I think that if someone was able to make something that exactly imitated all the properties of sunlight, it would not burn the vampire. I'm iffy on mirrors too, but I think that if it can burn through glass or even just /the atmosphere/ then mirrors can't be excluded. The danger is something to do with the 'spiritual nature' of the sun, whatever that means.

I'm also keen to hear your thoughts on this, in case I'm missing something awesome. I never thought that if a vampire could regrow a limb, then a vampire can regrow a /blank head/, and that's badass.

  A starved vampire simply needs to continually take in energy from its surroundings.

Love this. Great for thematic purposes, and vampires are naturally cold (but can probably will their skin to warm up when necessary to maintain their cover).

Thought: those frozen bodies they find in glaciers are vampires every now and again, with predictable results. Team hiking a glacier for science or for sport? Nice snack for an ancient, torpid vampire released from the icy prison of its own making. I'm also imagining a glacier being found in a location where it makes no sense for a glacier to be, with a creamy vampire centre.
