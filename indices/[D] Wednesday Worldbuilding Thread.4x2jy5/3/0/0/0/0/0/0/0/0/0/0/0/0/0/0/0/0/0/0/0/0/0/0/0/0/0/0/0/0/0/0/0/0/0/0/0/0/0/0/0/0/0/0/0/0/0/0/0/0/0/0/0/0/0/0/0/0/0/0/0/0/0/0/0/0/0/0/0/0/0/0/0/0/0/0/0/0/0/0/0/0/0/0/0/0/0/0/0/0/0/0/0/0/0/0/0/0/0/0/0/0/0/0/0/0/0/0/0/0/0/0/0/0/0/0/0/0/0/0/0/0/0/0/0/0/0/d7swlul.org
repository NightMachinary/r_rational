  Yeah... I think the problem is I want X-Ray vision.
#+end_quote

Ooooooh. Right. Never mind, then. I misunderstood something at some point.

  Being a gargoyle whose only wish in life is to protect whoever his master is at the time, as well as have a family every few hundred years does not put him in a very powerful position, plot-wise, if that makes sense.
#+end_quote

Eh, you can wring quite a lot of plot out of that, if he has main-character focus. For example, consider; he has to prevent harm to William. Does this include emotional harm? If so, is he required to extend a (lesser) degree of protection to William's friends, allies, and protege? And how do his internal subroutines identify William - is he constrained to prevent all harm that would be done to William's vombie?

#+begin_quote
  (Not complicated at all, is it?)
#+end_quote

Not really, no. Though I presume it isn't laid out quite so straightforwardly in the finished work.

#+begin_quote
  My understanding is that the magic itself can untwist it. So, for example, if you're shooting a magic missile at someone 10m away, the spell uncurls your local space to have a projectile/force/etc in it, and then the spell also causes the missile to push itself forward until it hits real matter, maybe kind of sort of like a glider in the game of life? Similarly, the 4D radar could untwist locally.
#+end_quote

Okay, that makes sense. But it means that every time the gargoyle pings, there's going to be a fairly large area untwisting around him. That's starting to make the ping look somewhat energy intensive, especially if he's keeping it up most of the time.

  Yes, this was one of the issues my husband raised (4D creatures can only see each other 'in range'), which is why I told him I didn't like the idea at first. I think there's a workaround, though, that has everything working.
#+end_quote

Instead of the radar (or maybe along with the radar) how about some sense (presumably never fully explained) that allows him to pick up nearby untwistings? This also resolves the energy-intensive untwisting radar to some degree, because he can then use it only when he's deliberately looking at (or for) something.

#+begin_quote
  The world is full of mysteries........ I wonder what is there, lurking beneath the surface ?
#+end_quote

[[/ppchangeling-r][]] There could be all sorts of things, hiding below the surface, avoiding notice, disguised as those you thought you knew... or maybe someone's been lying about their history... how would you ever know?
