  Anti-mind-control contact lenses is a trope, but it's a good one that makes sense especially if eye contact is a requirement.
#+end_quote

Yeah... tropes often gain that status /because/ they make sense. They're the tools in a writer's toolbox, the hammers and screwdrivers and spanners with which we construct our fictional worlds. As long as we avoid trying to use the screwdriver to hammer in a nail, we should be okay...

  I did have a character wear sunglasses to a meeting with a vampire, but was vague about whether it would actually have done anything
#+end_quote

Often the best way to present something; it keeps the reader guessing until it actually comes to crunch time. (I know that, in Artemis Fowl, the titular character used a pair of mirrored sunglasses to defeat the fairy's /mesmer/ ability, which explicitly worked on eye contact).

  she was an emissary for an android that, through a series of hilarious misunderstandings, the vampire thought was an even more powerful vampire
#+end_quote

Ooooooh. Yeah, I can see that happening - androids are just as non-living as vampires, near-immortal with proper repair, often equally fast, and far superior in their ability to handle gold and walk in sunlight.

  My original character that I made at age ~13 for my vampire hunter included purple eyes (that's on a mary-sue checklist somewhere), so it'd also be a nice nod to her history as a character to give her a particular affinity for putting purple ones in. She's a police officer though so I'm sure she probably wouldn't be allowed to wear unnaturally coloured ones at work.
#+end_quote

It might simply be a case of "technically not allowed, but the Captain has to notice it first" - and the Captain's ability to officially Notice it is inversely proportional to how much favour she has at the time. When she's just completed a case and got some robber in court, she can have purple and gold eyes and the Captain won't say a word - when she's just messed up and that Captain's coming by to yell at her, he'll yell harder because her eyes aren't blue.

  Vampires as having a sort of OCD is pretty common in folklore after all (counting knots, etc)
#+end_quote

Eeyup.

  Well watch me eat my words. I suppose the Samburu tribe is pretty big, well-known, and well-studied, right? (I only know the name because they used it as a tribe name in Survivor: Africa (which was filmed in Kenya, because Africa Is One Place)).
#+end_quote

I wouldn't know. I hadn't even /heard/ of the Samburu before you mentioned them, and I /live/ in Africa.

...admittedly, I don't live anywhere near Kenya.

  Man, the first few psychological manipulations a psychologist mage tries are going to end up /raw AF/, it's kind of horrifying and I kind of want to explore it
#+end_quote

Isn't that also true of the first few patients of any psychologist, though? Everyone will mess up on their early attempts. (They might practice in harmless ways at first, like trying to eliminate the emotional component from a volunteer's memory of the taste of liver or something like that).

  It's going to go from Twilight 2.0 to Harry Potter 2.0 or something, only with lots more smooching. And with an entire probably rather interesting /ancient war/ between /magical superpowers/ that /created sentient beings out of corpses/ to use as weapons, but let's ignore all that, this vampire is falling in love with an American soldier...
#+end_quote

...it leaves room for things to explore in the sequels. And prequels. And so on.

This is why some authors set a dozen or so books in the same universe.
