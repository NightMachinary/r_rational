  And what that means is that the Atlanteans didn't just tame magic; they pretty much created it from whole cloth.

Possibly, though mentioning demons made me think that perhaps the magic was introduced by demons, or was what created demons. I'm not sure how that could happen in a pre-technological society though.

  Now I'm thinking of a cult in tentative control of a spirit.

Awesome. Actually, maybe spirits are what created the magical atlantis civilisation, started the war, and created demons with their magic. Of course then the question is "where do spirits come from", which is just moving the goal posts of the above a bit further back, so maybe not.

  Do I go back to the same place, or do I turn up north of where I last was in the Shadow World?

The booths correspond with their 'partner' like a Stargate; so each Earth booth has a corresponding Underground booth, so moving the booths makes the entrances/exits (they're two way) work.

Setting up a booth isn't trivial, by the way, though I'm not sure exactly how it's done. I assume most booths are bought and sold as-is rather than created anew. A city of 2 million has about 10 or 20 booths in it, say.

A character has a booth hidden in an ordinary-looking Earth shop which he charges a toll to enter. I'd say in terms of luxury, having one would be on par with having a sailboat; possible for some but most people couldn't hope to afford one unless they made it a personal priority.

  Could the Shadow World be the far future (or past) of this world?
#+end_quote

It could be. The Shadow World (Demon World or Underground as we refer to it) is definitely smaller in size than Earth, because the 'wild' humans who one meets there are from a diverse set of countries and cultures. But maybe the Shadow World is as large as Earth and most of the portals simply go to the megacity / NYC equivalent of that world, and out in the sticks there are cliffs where Sirens and Harpies catch fish or something.
