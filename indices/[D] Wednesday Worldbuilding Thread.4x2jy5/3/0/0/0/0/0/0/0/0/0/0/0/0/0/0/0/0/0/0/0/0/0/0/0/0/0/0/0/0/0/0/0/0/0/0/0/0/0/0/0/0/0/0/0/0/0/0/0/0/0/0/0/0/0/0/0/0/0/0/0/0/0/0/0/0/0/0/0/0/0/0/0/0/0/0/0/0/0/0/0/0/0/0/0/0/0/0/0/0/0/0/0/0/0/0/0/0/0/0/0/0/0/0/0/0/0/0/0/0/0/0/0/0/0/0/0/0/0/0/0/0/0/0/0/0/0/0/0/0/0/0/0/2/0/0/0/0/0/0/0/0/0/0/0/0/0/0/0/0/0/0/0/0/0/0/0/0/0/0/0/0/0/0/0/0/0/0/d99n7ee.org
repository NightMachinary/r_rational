    Anti-mind-control contact lenses is a trope, but it's a good one that makes sense especially if eye contact is a requirement.
  #+end_quote

  Yeah... tropes often gain that status /because/ they make sense.
#+end_quote

OK. I am putting in that /any/ sort of barrier to direct eye contact negates the orders, including ordinary corrective lenses or those stylish clear glasses that hipsters wear these days. Really makes life hard for a vampire if all someone needs to do to stop you controlling them is to put on a cheap pair of reading glasses.

    she was an emissary for an android that, through a series of hilarious misunderstandings, the vampire thought was an even more powerful vampire
  #+end_quote

  Ooooooh. Yeah, I can see that happening - androids are just as non-living as vampires, near-immortal with proper repair, often equally fast, and far superior in their ability to handle gold and walk in sunlight.
#+end_quote

Yep. At the time it was written, it was silver not gold, and one of the gifts that the vampire gave to the robot to welcome her to the town was an aluminium necklace studded with jewels - since aluminium used to be more valuable than gold, making it an appropriate gift. The vampire hunter was poking through her things and saw a necklace that looked silver but wasn't silver, further cementing the idea that this android was a vampire who was hiding it with "fake" silver jewelry.

What really happened was the android's lawyer - a werewolf - noticed that the town's big cheese vampire was assuming she was a more powerful vampire and naturally decided that it would be great leverage for her client.

    She's a police officer though so I'm sure she probably wouldn't be allowed to wear unnaturally coloured ones at work.
  #+end_quote

  It might simply be a case of "technically not allowed, but the Captain has to notice it first" - and the Captain's ability to officially Notice it is inversely proportional to how much favour she has at the time. When she's just completed a case and got some robber in court, she can have purple and gold eyes and the Captain won't say a word - when she's just messed up and that Captain's coming by to yell at her, he'll yell harder because her eyes aren't blue.

I'm trying to work out, canonically, how /good/ she is at her /actual job/. She seems to spend a lot of time hunting vampires and such, and she picks up leads from her job (e.g. "bar brawl" was really a vampire wrecking shit up). She also probably snoops around files she's not technically meant to be looking at. Would she be the rogue police officer who is forever skirting the lines of what is acceptable behaviour? Or would her hard working, high achieving attitude that resulted in her deciding to rid Our Town of the supernatural menace once and for all give her the skills it takes to shine? Would she regularly get supernatural creatures to turn themselves in, in exchange for brownie points (after all, a vampire doing 5 years in prison with appropriate accommodations is not the biggest sacrifice)?

    Well watch me eat my words. I suppose the Samburu tribe is pretty big, well-known, and well-studied, right? (I only know the name because they used it as a tribe name in Survivor: Africa (which was filmed in Kenya, because Africa Is One Place)).
  #+end_quote

  I wouldn't know. I hadn't even /heard/ of the Samburu before you mentioned them, and I /live/ in Africa.

  ...admittedly, I don't live anywhere near Kenya.
#+end_quote

Ha, cool. Where abouts? (If you didn't work backwards from my antipode, I'm in Western Australia)

A year ago I started trying to memorise all the countries and flags of the world, but I'm quite behind at it. I do love that mozambique has an AK-47 on its flag. Makes Saudi Arabia's sword look old fashioned.

Survivor has also filmed in Gabon (S19), which looked much nicer (all foresty) than the desolate savannah-type place in Kenya they filmed S2.

    Man, the first few psychological manipulations a psychologist mage tries are going to end up /raw AF/, it's kind of horrifying and I kind of want to explore it
  #+end_quote

  Isn't that also true of the first few patients of any psychologist, though? Everyone will mess up on their early attempts. (They might practice in harmless ways at first, like trying to eliminate the emotional component from a volunteer's memory of the taste of liver or something like that).
#+end_quote

Is it? I should ask. My boyfriend is about to do his phD/Masters (combined programme) in psychology, he would probably know this stuff.

    with an entire probably rather interesting /ancient war/ between /magical superpowers/ that /created sentient beings out of corpses/ to use as weapons, but let's ignore all that, this vampire is falling in love with an American soldier...
  #+end_quote

  ...it leaves room for things to explore in the sequels. And prequels. And so on.

  This is why some authors set a dozen or so books in the same universe.
#+end_quote

Yeah. This might end up happening, especially if it's a roleplaying universe and we continue to do ~150 pages per year as seems to be our rate now we're grown ups with jobs and all that. (When we were 15 we used to do 5 hours on weekdays and up to 18 on weekends. I don't know how we went through so much material)

Hmmm on that note, suppose, say, Catholicism is "right" in this universe. When a human dies and made into a vampire, is their immortal soul judged and sent to heaven or hell? Or does the soul stay in the vampire until it does? Or does the act of making a vampire completely torch the soul altogether, and you have traded heaven/hell for a paltry thousand years or so? I suppose that depends on so many things that you can barely begin to speculate.
