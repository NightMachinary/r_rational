OK. I can get that water / glass / etc thing I suppose. It looks like funhouse mirror type glass would just be so fabulously risky, and vampires that are old and thus most wealthy and powerful are so extremely sensitive to sunlight that they wouldn't afford to take risks.

I think I'm content with making the sunlight thing work with the image of the sun, but not officially declare it so anywhere, as I don't think a vampire touching an image of the sun will come up. I suppose it likely /has/ come up in the past 50 years or so since we've had solar photography (.... would a black and white image work? Probably not, right?). So.... the past 20 years or so might actually be the first time that images of the sun have become dangerous. Hmm. If I decide to go full Rat!Fic that could be how Our Heroes kill the Vampire Menace; get tiny suns engraved on the tips of their arrows.

How/why do stakes work? They have to be wood. Looks like wood is an element in traditional chinese philosophy. So are fire and gold. This is... interesting and I think I'm going to try and run with it! We add earth and water to round out the set. Earth = vampire's body (flesh), which turns to dust maybe; water = blood, naturally.

Fortunately, though each element has a planet, none of them have the sun as their planet. Fire is associated with the heart though which is neat.

The philosophy has two phases: generating and controlling, which are on the left and right of the table below.

| Chinese               | Vampire              |  | Chinese              | Vampire             |
|-----------------------+----------------------+--+----------------------+---------------------|
| Wood feeds fire;      | -                    |  | Wood parts earth;    | Wood splits flesh   |
| Fire creates earth;   | Fire creates flesh   |  | Earth absorbs water; | Flesh absorbs blood |
| Earth bears gold;     | Flesh bears gold     |  | Water quenches fire; | Blood quenches fire |
| Gold collects water;  | Gold collects blood  |  | Fire melts gold;     | Fire melts gold     |
| Water nourishes wood. | Blood nourishes wood |  | Gold chops wood.     | Gold chops wood     |

* Nourishing

  :CUSTOM_ID: nourishing
  :END:
Wood feeds fire: self explanatory.

Fire creates flesh: implies that creating a vampire involves setting something on fire. I'm OK with this. It makes reproducing a dangerous thing for a vampire to attempt.

Flesh bears gold: ??? Maybe a parable about ancient mages making gold and the sun sympathetic to each other, thus "creating" the power of gold

Gold collects(creates) blood: Gold 'hurts' a vampire by causing bruising as the flesh turns to blood, maybe?

Blood nourishes wood: Rather than creating wood, blood from a vampire's heart soaks into the stake and so is unable to power the vampire's organs, creating the torpor. This also implies that a stake is somehow empowered by the blood in some way; maybe planting a stake soaked with vampire blood will make your crops grow? Who knows.

* Destroying
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: destroying
  :END:
Wood splits flesh: Pretty clear that the wood has a bad impact on the vampire's fleshy body due to the stake.

Flesh absorbs blood: The vampire drinks blood, to live and all.

Blood quenches fire: Not sure on this one. Perhaps this is meant literally, or, metaphorically, a vampire can survive in a fire (or sunlight, gold) as long as she can continue drinking blood?

Fire melts gold: Gold that has been burned is harmless to a vampire, perhaps; maybe flesh bears gold means that gold, once burned, is harmless, but once it touches human flesh it becomes dangerous again (too complicated. flesh means vampire in other places, why not here?)

Gold chops wood: Pretty self explanatory.

Probably most of the Wu Xing stuff can be thrown out. After all, no ancient society got it all right when it comes to magic, so why should the Chinese be any better? Things I like:

- Fire creates flesh: the final step in the ritual of creating a vampire is to burn the human corpse.

- Gold creates blood: a vampire is harmed by gold because it causes flesh to turn into blood, essentially it makes bruises and destroys muscle.

- Blood nourishes wood: a stake sends a vampire into torpor by essentially being a giant blood sponge. This causes the stake to have some cool magic properties afterwards.

- Flesh absorbs blood: vampires gotta drink blood
