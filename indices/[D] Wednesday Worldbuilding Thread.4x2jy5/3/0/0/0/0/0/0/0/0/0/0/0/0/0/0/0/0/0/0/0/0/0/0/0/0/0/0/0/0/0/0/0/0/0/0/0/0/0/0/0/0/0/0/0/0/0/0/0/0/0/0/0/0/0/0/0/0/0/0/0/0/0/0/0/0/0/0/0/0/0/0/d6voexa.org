  Can a vampire hold someone at gunpoint and obtain an invitation under duress?
#+end_quote

Nope.

  Can a vampire obtain an invitation under false pretenses?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Can a vampire bypass the need for an invitation by killing the person who slept there (e.g. with a gun)?
#+end_quote

Yes, provided they kill everyone who has slept there recently enough for the spell to have an effect. So, you could shoot Dad, but if Mum and the kids are out at the doctor's then the vampire can't enter the house without their permission, or, well, over their dead bodies.

I agree that with the vampires being created as weapons of war it logically follows without any trouble that the group creating the vampires would put a couple of limits, and when you're talking about war, prohibitions against entering a person's usual sleeping-place is a pretty good safeguard. I imagine the vampires came from human volunteers, who would have been screened for loyalty/etc, which also ensures they attack the enemy and don't go rogue (probably the mages have another killswitch for vampires in case they did, perhaps a spell lost to time)
