Thanks for all that, you've really helped me out! My roleplaying partner in particular is super into the idea of blank vampire heads. We like trying to differentiate our vampires from the mainstream and... yeah, it's just badass. I'm so excited to see how it shakes out.

[[/crain-r][]][[/hahaha][]][[/ohhi][]] I wonder if, for example, a vampire gets shot in the heart, and he heals himself up so he keeps his brain - do his zombie clones still grow? I assume they'd have to, the heart matter doesn't know it doesn't need to regenerate, otherwise starfish vampires wouldn't happen. So, could a vampire with some need for blank, easy-to-predict clones of itself create them? I suppose how useful are such clones, really? Maybe as a body double, but no-one will be fooled by that for long, but still, self-surgery, get a little bit of your heart out, put it in a secure cage, lock it, and let it grow in case you need it. Wow. I'm totally having a newly turned vampire find his mentor's double. That's creepy AF.

[[/freebooze-in][]] So! Invitations. That's another weakness vampires have. They need to be invited into buildings. It's related to the magic of a human sleeping - I guess the atlanteans wanted to avoid collateral damage when they made these weapons, so didn't want vampires to attack people in their homes?

- Vampires have to be invited into a residence. This is due to a type of magic ward that is formed by the mere fact of a human sleeping in it. The more regularly and soundly a human sleeps in the residence, the stronger the ward is. Same with an emotional connection.

  - Invitations can be revoked; doing so gives the vampire an intense desire to leave the house/room. Depending on the strength of the human's connection to the dwelling and the strength with which the invitation is revoked, the vampire might immediately walk out, or may have several minutes.
  - An invitation must be freely given (so no hypnotising to get the invitation)

- Examples of different “strengths” of effect:

  - A farmhouse that has been in the family for centuries will require a vampire receive a written invitation and that the vampire adhere to any terms on the invitation (e.g. “you are welcome at my house this evening from 7pm - 7:30pm”)
  - A normal suburban home will require a normal, but clearly stated invitation. “come on in”
  - A vampire with an invitation to enter a multi-person dwelling must get separate invitations to enter the bedrooms of each inhabitant, except for the one who invited her in to start with.
  - A hotel room will not require an invitation to enter, but the human can ask the vampire to leave and that will be required. This only works if the human has slept in the room.
  - Only humans are able to give permission, though it doesn't matter if they are a ghoul, werewolf, witch, etc.
  - A guest cannot give a vampire permission to enter a home unless they have been sleeping there for a solid month.
  - A landlord cannot invite a vampire into her tenant's house, because she does not sleep there.
  - In other words, the legal owner of the house is irrelevant to the magic; in fact, if a vampire leaves his own house for a few weeks, and a human squats there, the vampire is no longer able to enter without permission.
  - If a human has slept in a house for ten or more years, and later leaves, she retains some ability to give/revoke invitations.

Potential problems: what exactly counts as a house, among other things.
