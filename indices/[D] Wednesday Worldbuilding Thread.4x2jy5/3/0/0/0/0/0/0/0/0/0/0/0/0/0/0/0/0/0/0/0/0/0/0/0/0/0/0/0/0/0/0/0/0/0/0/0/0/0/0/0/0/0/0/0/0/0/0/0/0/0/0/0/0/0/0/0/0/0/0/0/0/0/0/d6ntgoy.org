  Even at the "small quirk" or "above average" level, that's enough to produce a slight evolutionary pressure in the direction of being more magical.

Ooo! I should say that one of the small quirk type guys experiences awful headaches and frequent nose bleeds in conjunction with his powers (accurate prediction of the future that's somewhat random, sometimes can be the entire strategy for an enemy attorney, sometimes is just the desire to buy a particular type of tea so that way, two weeks later when someone asks for it, he doesn't need to leave the office to get any for her). So.... there's probably trade offs.

The magician doesn't seem worse off for her powers, though.

Another character is at the 'above average reflexes' level, from a family of Chinese kung fu masters that are assisted by this magic, which might make the 'descendants of atlantis' theory less tenable (actually - he's the cousin of the magician, so atlantis could easily have been in ancient china....). The powers are passed down the male line, though they're not exclusive to men - a woman with the powers will have the augmented abilities, but will not pass them down to her sons, while a man will pass them down to his sons and daughters. So it's not just simply y-linked, it's somehow more complicated than that.

A lot of skill is related to teaching, though, so Atlantis wouldn't need to keep control of the genes - they could just seek control of the teaching. I think it's implied that someone could 'jump up a tier' just by having better access to teachers. Love the ideas of artefacts and lost knowledge, though!

Magic not spreading hugely through the gene pool is a huge problem. Easy way out is to say the genes also have a negative effect on fertility.
