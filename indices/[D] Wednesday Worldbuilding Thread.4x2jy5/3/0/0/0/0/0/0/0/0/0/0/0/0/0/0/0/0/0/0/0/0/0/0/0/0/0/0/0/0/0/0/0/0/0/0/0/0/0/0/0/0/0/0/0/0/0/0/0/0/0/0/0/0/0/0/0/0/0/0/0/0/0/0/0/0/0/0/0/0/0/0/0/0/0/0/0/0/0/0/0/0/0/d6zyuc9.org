  I'm not sure how that could happen in a pre-technological society though.

Atlantis? Pre-technological? No. Atlantis had /all/ the technology. Atlantis considered fusion power merely a single small step above fire, and one thy had passed beyond so long ago that no-one used it for anything anymore.

Arthur C. Clarke famously remarked that sufficiently powerful technology is indistinguishable from magic. The Atlanteans had passed /that/ point centuries ago. At the height of Atlantis, they had it /all/. Their empire spread through millions upon billions upon trillions of shadow worlds, and the shadow they cast on those worlds was vast indeed. Nothing and no-one could hope to stand up to the technomagical might of Atlantis.

And then the civil war came. Vast and powerful were the weapons wielded in that war - the self-replicating killer now known as a vampire was the minor weapon of a minor terrorist faction, brushed aside and ignored by the more powerful families. Families of medium power waged their wars in the past, sending back history eraser bombs the remove their greatest foes from the pages of history itself; the most powerful families, protected in arcane and powerful ways from such devices, used even more esoteric weapons (fictionalization bombs, defictionalisation bombs, and weirder fare).

What worlds shook and shattered under the might of their war we will never know; what we do know is that, of the trillions of worlds Atlantis had stretched over, there are but two still accessible; one of which contains many demons, descendants of the ancient Atlantean families who changes and twisted their own genes in their eternal search for perfection (and self-sustaining magical technology implants were always popular) and the other, which was probably a nature park or someone's back garden or something, ended up with a bunch of original-genome humans and virtually no demons. It's quite probable that the only reason these two worlds escaped the War largely unscathed was because no-one thought they were important enough to bother with.

  Awesome. Actually, maybe spirits are what created the magical atlantis civilisation, started the war, and created demons with their magic. Of course then the question is "where do spirits come from", which is just moving the goal posts of the above a bit further back, so maybe not.

I'm thinking that spirits are kind of like user interfaces for particularly complex bits of magical "code". Think Microsoft's Clippy, but less annoying, actually helpful, and displaying genuine intelligence. (If you have the necessary user authorisation, you can order them to do anything, but virtually no-one does anymore...)

  The booths correspond with their 'partner' like a Stargate; so each Earth booth has a corresponding Underground booth, so moving the booths makes the entrances/exits (they're two way) work.

Okay... so, by correctly arranging the journey, you can get from North America to New Zealand by foot in an hour or so if you're willing to pay the necessary tolls?

Useful, and I can imagine your character wth the shop to point out this advantage to people (in order to collect more toll money from tourists and smugglers). If the local police want to know why your passport's not in order, you're on your own, but you dodge /all/ the border guards.

  But maybe the Shadow World is as large as Earth and most of the portals simply go to the megacity / NYC equivalent of that world, and out in the sticks there are cliffs where Sirens and Harpies catch fish or something.

That works. Besides, you get some /really big/ cryptids (the Kraken comes to mind) and the Shadow World needs space for them.
