[[/ajbigeye][]] Has it made me suggestible too, because I'm totally about to start telling you how to /kill me/ and I don't have any second thoughts whatsoever.

There's really only three ways to kill a vampire, if you're doing it violently. Decapitation, setting them on fire, and of course sunlight.

Decapitation - the brain and the heart are the only important organs in a vampire body. The brain still does all the thinking. Unlike in the former human body, the heart doesn't work as a lowly pump - it's just... a magic nexus or something. Anyway, it's the source of the magic that keeps the course alive, so decapitation seperates the two. It's not enough just to sever all the veins and arteries; the capilliaries and even the interstitial fluid can transmit the 'life energy' from the heart to the brain. So a 'nearly headless nick' situation would be healable for a vampire. Once that last bit of skin is severed, though, brain death is assured.

Fire - For some reason, when a vampire is burned its natural healing abilities do not make short work of the injury. Injuries caused to a vampire by fire will take a long time to heal - longer, even than the same burn would take for a human to heal.

Sunlight - For their first six months or so of undeath, a vampire slowly loses her ability to be in the sun; their first day of unlife will only result in a sensation like a mild sunburn, but progressively they can stand less and less time in the sun. Many a person who can be found staring into the sun is a new vampire with a good mentor, who has told them to treasure the small amount of sunshine they will see over the coming months, because it will be their last. A ten year old vampire can survive in the sun for about two or three minutes; for an ancient vampire, a reflected ray of sunshine would kill them almost instantly. The physical symptoms are of burns but without fire.

Finally, if you're not being violent, they can also starve to death after a fashion - if they're not fed enough, they become mindless automatons searching only for their next meal. This invariably leads to them either getting a snack and returning to normal, or, well, following a rat out into the sun. Usually the latter.
