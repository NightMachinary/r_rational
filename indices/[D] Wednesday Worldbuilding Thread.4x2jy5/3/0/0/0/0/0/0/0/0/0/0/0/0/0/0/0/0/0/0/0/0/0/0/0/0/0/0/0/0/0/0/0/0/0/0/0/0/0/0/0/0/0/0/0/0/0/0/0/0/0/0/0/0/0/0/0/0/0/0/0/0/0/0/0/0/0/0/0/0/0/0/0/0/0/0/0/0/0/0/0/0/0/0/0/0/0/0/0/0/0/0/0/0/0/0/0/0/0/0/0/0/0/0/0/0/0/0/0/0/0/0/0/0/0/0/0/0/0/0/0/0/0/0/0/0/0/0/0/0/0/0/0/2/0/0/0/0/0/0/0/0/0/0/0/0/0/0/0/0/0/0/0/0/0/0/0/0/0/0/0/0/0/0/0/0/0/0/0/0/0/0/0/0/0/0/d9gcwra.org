  Okay, but can you deliberately /misunderstand/ (if, say, it's a genuinely ambiguous request)? Let's say the victim is holding a sandwich and a handbag and the vampire says "Drop it", and he's not /quite/ sure which one he means. (Or does he drop both, just to make sure he's dropping the right one?)
#+end_quote

If someone had a gun to your head and told you to "drop it", would you try and figure out what they meant or would you drop them both? I'd probably drop them both, because I'd know that dropping the wrong one could be bad. That's what I'd rule. Again, with sufficient willpower/motivation you could probably deliberately misunderstand, but it would be say 80% of the willpower required to outright reject the command.

  Ah, I see. (I seem to remember a variation where he tricked Medusa into seeing her own reflection in the shield, thus turning her to stone - that may have been a modern twist on the original myth, though.)
#+end_quote

Maybe. In the myth he carries her head around in a bag and takes it out to turn a bunch of people into stone, so it probably wasn't stone. That said given her dead head had stone powers, maybe her stone head would have stone powers?

  Yeah... I class that as mostly neutral. It's not like contacting them is going particularly well, it's simply that there is practically no contact. It's a lot better than some other tribes have got, and the isolationist policy isn't bad in and of itself (but it is very close to some /very/ bad policies if someone else decides they want part of the land), but it's also not really a /good/ policy, I think.
#+end_quote

Yeah, because those isolated tribes are probably dying of infectious diseases, high infant mortality, etc. So they probably /do/ have a huge life expectancy gap that would put the ones in our respective countries to shame.

[[/ajhorror][]] Could.... could colonialism actually have improved the lives of the subjugated? I mean, bad times, separated from their families and all that, but they'd live longer. But they also would have their culture, language, and traditions which probably has some asimovian zeroth law importance....

  Doesn't matter what race you are, if you can reach a good hospital you're pretty good; if you live out in the back of beyond, you've got problems
#+end_quote

Yeah, the issue isn't so much that the doctors aren't treating people who need it, but that the system as a whole puts people in the wrong frame of mind (e.g. low food literacy => people won't cook and eat healthy food => diabetes)

#+begin_quote
  We've got great language policies, though.
#+end_quote

That's so cool! I kind of resent that I grew up in an anglophone country, because I feel like I have the sort of personality that would make me want to learn English to participate in the Wider Internet, so I'd be more motivated to learn a second language. As it is my French is B1/B2 level and I am working hard at it but.... there's no real concrete motivation.

  It works the other way round, too, with the daughters subjugating their husbands. It's less of a gender-induced split and more of a mage-versus-muggle split, really.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and I suppose if Atlantis was a post-gender utopia, the mages might well be too. I'm just applying typical tropes to it, which probably isn't the best idea.

#+begin_quote
  Well, of course. He's already perfect, so everything he does is by definition perfect, right? He wouldn't be put in that situation if he wasn't immeasurably improving it by his mere existence.
#+end_quote

His ego was big enough before you put that bug in my ear.... You're right, though. He just mostly keeps it to himself.

#+begin_quote
  ...I can imagine him making the meetings a lot more memorable by /introducing/ sword-fights.
#+end_quote

He'd never lose another election. Actual combat experience plus 1500 years of vampire powers? Then again, his vampire rivals might want France for themselves. Oh god, a future where the vampires out "out of the coffin" and decide to wrest back overt control of the world is.... awesome.

#+begin_quote
  That is to say, I'm not saying there are no vampire priests. But if there are any that still report to the Vatican, then they have to follow the Vatican's modern stance on indulgences, which means William is out of luck in his quest. (Worse yet, he'll probably be subjected to a lecture about why he didn't get what he thought he got with the original indulgences...) Even if they don't still report to the Vatican (e.g. they may have joined one of the Protestant churches) the odds are that they've abandoned the whole business of indulgences (this being a fair chunk of what the protestants were protesting against).
#+end_quote

I was more imagining the Vatican having a priest on retainer, in their famous ineffable catacombs, and that's why the Catholic church has a reputation for being so conservative (they /did/ preach in Latin in living memory, after all). That priest is /possibly/ a Pope from way back, and, well, the rest kind of writes itself.

Then again, this becomes Dan Brown 2.0, the Vatican is a conspiracy, etc so maybe best just to ignore it.
