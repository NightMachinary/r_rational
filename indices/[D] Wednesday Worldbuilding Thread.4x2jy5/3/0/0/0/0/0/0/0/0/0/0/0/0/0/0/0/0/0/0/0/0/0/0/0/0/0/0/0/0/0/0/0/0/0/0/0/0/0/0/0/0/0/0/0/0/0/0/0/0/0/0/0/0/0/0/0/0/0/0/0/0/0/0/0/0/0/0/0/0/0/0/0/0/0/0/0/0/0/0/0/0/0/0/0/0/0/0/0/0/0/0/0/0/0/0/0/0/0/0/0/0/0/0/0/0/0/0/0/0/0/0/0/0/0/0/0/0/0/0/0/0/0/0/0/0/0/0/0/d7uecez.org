  Yeah, I think the source was because I wanted to nerf the X-Ray vision so he doesn't have, like, complete vision of everything in the universe. Having it at low bandwith is a pretty good workaround.
#+end_quote

That was probably it, yes. Low vision and lack of colour works for it, yes.

    Eh, you can wring quite a lot of plot out of that, if he has main-character focus. For example, consider; he has to prevent harm to William. Does this include emotional harm? If so, is he required to extend a (lesser) degree of protection to William's friends, allies, and protege? And how do his internal subroutines identify William - is he constrained to prevent all harm that would be done to William's vombie?

You quoted this part but said nothing - I don't know if you meant to say something and then missed it?

  That's the problem, we have ambitions of novellising it /at some point/, if only so our parents/partners/etc can read it, but it's hard when taking into account narrative structure and whatnot.
#+end_quote

Okay.

Ignore narrative structure, tell your story.

Make sure to follow the rule of "show, don't tell" as much as is reasonable. /Never/ outright describe how the magic works - rather have a behind-the-scenes set of rules and just apply them as necessary.

Always remember that what's dead obvious to you is not dead obvious to the reader. Unless you mention something /explicitly/, you don't need to go to much effort to hide it.

  in a "real" novel you can't really just say "THREE MONTHS LATER" and skip to the action.
#+end_quote

Yes you can. I've seen novels that say "SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS LATER". (Isaac Asimov's "The Last Question", is a perfect, albeit extreme, example).

And yeah, hiring an editor is probably worth the trouble.

Have you considered writing this as a Nanowrimo novel?

  I suppose it depends where the energy is coming from.
#+end_quote

We'd previously discussed the idea that the gargoyle's stone form during the day might be in order to allow him to recharge from solar energy. A lot of the energy could come from there.

#+begin_quote
  Glycogen: about 1500 kcal is stored in the muscles, a rifle has about 2,000 Joules of energy. This is a factor of *3000* in favour of glycogen. If we assume a force bolt is equivalent to the biggest caliber bullet on that chart, the glycogen stores are still bigger by a factor of /200/.
#+end_quote

Which means that is the wizard fires off 200 force bolts, he falls over dead. And even a single force bolt means he needs a good 7.5kcal meal to make up the difference.

#+begin_quote
  (Of course it depends how 'easy' it is for magic to 'uncurl' the Calabi-Yau manifold stuff...)
#+end_quote

Yeeeeeeah.... that's going to be tricky. I have absolutely no idea how much energy that would even theoretically take.

It's probably reasonable to make the amount of energy proportional to the area that gets uncurled, and the length of time it is uncurled for. So a mage who uncurls an entire tunnel, then fires a force bolt along it, will use a lot more energy than a mage who fires a force bolt that moves with a 'bubble' of uncurled space. (This implies a more skilled mage will get the same effect with less effort - also, the 'moving bubble' missile means the other guy can't fire a missile back up your tunnel).

#+begin_quote
  Add in a 4D creature which has several orders of magnitude more mass than a human to store its 4D glycogen analogue and you really have no trouble with the energy requirements IMO, though I'd imagine he might only use his radar when he's actively moving or looking at things.
#+end_quote

You have no problem with energy /storage/. You still need energy /input/. His sources are solar and food; if he's pinging often, then I imagine he'll need to eat a lot more than if he's pinging rarely.

#+begin_quote
  though I'd imagine he might only use his radar when he's actively moving or looking at things.
#+end_quote

That makes sense, but he /does/ need to be able to sense unexpected nearby vampires, so some sort of untwist-detecting sense will be extremely useful.

#+begin_quote
  I pouted and asked why we couldn't just have ether that the 4D-photons travel through, but apparently that's anathema to the whole thing, so.....
#+end_quote

Ah. I'm guessing that's because the ether doesn't exist before the dimensions unwind, and actually creating enough matter to fill up that 4D space will take significantly more energy than even the gargoyle's 4D body can store. (The radar sense needs to be able to 'see' using some means that doesn't require matter - much like light doesn't require matter, so some sort of 4D light analogue).
