Also, I forgot: vampires are vulnerable to silver as well as fire. A deliberate Achilles heel by the atlanteans, or did the early settlers of Earth merely enchant all the silver on the planet? Perhaps they cursed a few vampires to be vulnerable to silver, and they are all the common ancestor of the ones that sill live? Who knows....

  There shouldn't be any big points of confusion. You probably know more about Dr. Who than I do...

Well, I'm about to go walk the dog, and I intend to find a cafe to sit at and start and finish your story. The said it's 3pm now which is apparently the magic time all the cafes close, so we'll see if that eventuates.

  How important is William's history for the reader?
#+end_quote

Not very, but how important is anything for the reader? I mean, I write it because I find it interesting, and I find William's past interesting - but I've been invested in William in one guise or another for 15 years so, you know, I'm a special case.

He's a pretty tropey vampire though, except that he's a devout catholic - though non-practicing, and, um, a practising bisexual, so that's a bit odd. But he probably has very different ideas about love, relationships, and sexuality based on where he grew up and also the intervening 1500 years of immortality. Would vampire society be more socially progressive? My incarnation of it is very, very strict, full of symbolism, but with some red in tooth and claw stuff in there too. I suppose a series of powerful vampires would just keep on adding things to the list of rules, which most everyone is intelligent enough to remember, so you could build a whole bunch of crap like that up.

  ...huh. I was expecting something... steampunkier.

Yeah I probably built it up to be more than it was. But at least you know it was mildly disappointing rather than having to wait to find out, so that's something, yeah?

Looks interesting, though the old timey style is very... thick.
