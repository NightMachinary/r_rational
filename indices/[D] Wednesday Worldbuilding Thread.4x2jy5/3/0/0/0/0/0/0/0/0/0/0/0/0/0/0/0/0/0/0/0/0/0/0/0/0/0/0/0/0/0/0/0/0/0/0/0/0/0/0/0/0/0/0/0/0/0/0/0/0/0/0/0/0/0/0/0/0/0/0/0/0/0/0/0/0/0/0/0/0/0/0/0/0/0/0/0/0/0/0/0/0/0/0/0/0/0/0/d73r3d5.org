  So the owner of such a portal, if it existed, would have to have been an original Atlantean.

Yeah, I'd say the original portals between worlds were created by Atlanteans, but they've been imitated since.

  Either by developing some skill (world's best chess player? He certainly has the time to learn)
#+end_quote

Problem with that is kind of like in /The Man from Earth/ - sure, you become an expert botanist, but only to the extent that botany was understood in 1674 when you got your phD, and, well, we've discovered evolution now, not to mention genetics. Pretty much every skill becomes useless very quickly, unless you're constantly learning, and, well, that's too much like work.

  The antique is no more likely to be valuable than the contents of your grandmother's attic
#+end_quote

This is exactly where I got. Those antiques roadshow antiques go for a few grand, and that's, say, a month's salary at most, and that's for the /good/ ones. Then you have the problem of if you have an artifact from the year 800, it's going to be hard to find a private buyer for it and a museum can't afford it, and you're not going to know Van Gogh is a guy to buy your paintings from. It's just a terrible strategy unless you're going to put a lot of effort into understanding trends.

Then again, now I'm thinking the dutch tulip inflation was the result of vampire mind control.

  This alternate world; does it have a sun? And is that sun Sol?
#+end_quote

Well... that question made me think: if vampires were created on Atlantis, why are they vulnerable to Sol, of all things? Maybe a small offshoot of Atlanteans ran to Earth, scared and alone, and enchanted Sol to protect them from vampires, the hitherto almost unstoppable force. Probably this resulted in them mostly being exterminated by non-vampire members of the enemy faction, leaving the world today?

To answer your question: canonically, everything that has occurred in the alternate world has happened underground. It could still easily simply be a huge cavern on earth. I'm now imagining something like The Matrix, where nuclear winter or similar has rendered the surface uninhabitable so all the residents have gone underground.

Regardless, everything being underground in one city that's easily accessible from Earth means that a vampire could easily live there. I'm wondering whether vampires just don't tend to live down there, though - they're kind of like humans, and there's all that fantasy racism happening - but then again, vampires are damn powerful, much more intelligent than humans, have a /very good reason/ to live underground, and presumably can kick a centaur's arse if it comes to it.

Perhaps the underground realm has an anti-vampire measure that's more powerful than the sun? And our world and the underground realm are the only two places that are not knee-deep in vampires?
