I've been thinking about my vampires a lot this week, though I've never shared anything in a worldbuilding thread before. They're part of a roleplaying universe I co-created, so it's not rational per sae but I like to make it 'as rational as possible'.

The vampires are pretty typical, burning in the sun, needing to be invited into human dwellings, etc. They can also create ghouls by feeding them vampire blood, and humans who are fed upon become addicted to the rush of being eaten from, so many vampires keep a 'herd' of humans who are so addicted.

I've been thinking about their society. I definitely want them to have very rigid customs and social norms, with huge symbolism (e.g. the exact shade of red of the shirt you wear to a meeting has a very particular meaning). They also have a gift-giving culture, where you give gifts to your superiors and inferiors, again with heavy symbolism. For example, a vampire character incorrectly thought someone else was a vampire and gave her a suite of gifts. She didn't accept an ancient warhammer that had belonged to his grandson because she thought it was too extravagant a gift; naturally, the vampire took the refusal of the gift as an indication that she rejects his lineage and does not believe he is able to fight with his own two hands.

Also, vampires, being better than humans in strength, speed, etc I feel are also naturally better at thinking. They get stronger the older they are, and so I think they should get smarter the older they are.

With that background, here's my notes on vampire society in general. I'd love any criticism, input, expansions, or corollaries you guys might be able to input. In particular, given how intelligent vampires are, I can't figure out why they haven't just scienced the shit out of everything centuries ago and now we live in a post-singularity world.

- As vampires are naturally quite vicious and ruthless, prehistoric vampire society was kill or be killed, vicious.

- As time went on, society became more rigid. Enforced rules of politeness and restraint allowed vampires to function without killing each other.

- These rules became more and more complicated due to a vampire's high cognitive capacity, with different shades of meaning encoded in gifts, letters, handwriting, clothing, etc.

- Part of their dispute resolution process does involve combat. This is because they are stubborn and proud. Usually, the threat of death is enough to make one of the vampires reneg; in fact, that's generally how these things go.

- They tend to have a meritocracy/gerontocracy where the oldest and therefore wisest run the show. As a result, everyone likes to imply that they are older than they are.

- The rules and mores of vampire society spread easily, as vampires live a long time and have long memories.

- Vampires have art and music, far beyond anything a mortal can comprehend. One of the most famous vampire-composed operas goes for two straight weeks, and has over a hundred characters. There are shades of foreshadowing and meaning that slowly crystallise together, mostly by the viewer's own intuition; everything is implied very loosely and delicately.

- Some vampires are also interested in science; most modern scientific and technological advances were made by vampires, ghouls working on behalf of vampires, or were “accidentally discovered” (penicillin) because of vampires.
