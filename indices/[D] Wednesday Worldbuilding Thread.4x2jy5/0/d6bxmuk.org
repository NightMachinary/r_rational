#+end_quote

I stand by my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2txg42/metad_they_should_have_sent_a_poet/?ref=search_posts][earlier notion]] that a protagonist suitable for a ratfic of /Alice in Wonderland/ is a poet, even if one's immediate thought for "Rational Alice" is some kind of psychologist.
