Whichever way you slice it, eating sentient beings is morally grey at best. That's fine, it gives room for discussion. Most likely everyone will justify it to themselves differently.

- I refuse adamantly to eat Pokémon and you should too.
- I refuse adamantly to eat Pokémon but I respect your boundaries.
- I don't want to eat Pokémon but I don't have the energy to argue about it with you.
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, what difference will I make one way or the other?
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, I should eat Pokémon to fit in.
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, they can't all be wrong.
- Nearly everyone else in this world does it, so I never really questioned it.
- Pokémon are not really sentient so it's OK to eat them.
- I know and accept that this is evil, but they're delicious.
- I know and accept that this is evil, but I have enough problems of my own without worrying about Pokémon rights as well.

Basically, just rehash the reasons people think it's OK to eat meat and you'll get most of the possible justifications. That's what this is an obvious allegory for, anyway.
