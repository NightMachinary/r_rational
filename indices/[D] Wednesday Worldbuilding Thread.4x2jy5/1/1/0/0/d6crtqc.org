This is really interesting.

I was thinking about how difficult it would be to biologically produce currents complicated enough to encode audio information in, but then realized that I was comig at this from the wrong angle. The problem isn't "let's make an organism that can support a literal radio," it's "given an organism that can power two arm antennae and transmit through them: can it develop an effective language?" I think the answer is... /"Maybe?"/

Firstly, I think the sensitivity functions for humans would be highly variable, depending on arm length (pending a radio expert to confirm this is how antennae work), and may even homogenize height in successful civilizations. Depending on how sharply peaked (i.e. limited to a certain range of frequencies) the sensitivity functions are, you may get isolated settlements being unable to really radiotalk to each other. That would be like finding a group of people who speak in ultrasound!

Second, if we have dynamically rearrangeable antennae as transceivers... I don't really know enough about radio communication to say anything, but I can imagine you'd get some interesting things happening. I /think/ that having frequency modulation happen via arm movement would be the easiest way to get a simple biocircuit to be able to transmit enough information to have a meaningful language.

A fun point to think about, if speaking/listening require us to rearrange our antennae, the phrase "body language" takes on a whole new meaning.

Maybe some improvement on an individual's loudness and frequency range can be made through practice, but we can only do that with our voices because the system is so deliciously complicated. I fear that an implementation of the current-generating muscles that is complicated enough to work like human voices would be unrealistic to the point of being indistinguishable from a black box. As an aside, I'm under the impression that most researchers are baffled by the cochlea and would love to have a radio equivalent.

I'm still geeking out over this and I hate it.
