First, an apology. The first chapter of /Collateral Damage/ was supposed to have been up by August 6th or 9th, to coincide with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That simply did not happen. The plot was mostly fine, but it was causing tone whiplash. I'm still deciding if it's salvageable or not.

The bigger problem is the fact that I still feel like I know nothing about nuclear weapons, their history, properties, or broader things about nuclear physics. Maybe complete accuracy is a terrible standard to impose. I know it doesn't /really/ help the story, but I really, really wanted to keep actual, accurate physics in the story, and not only go halfway.

How do you worldbuild around such complicated topics in a timely manner? How much study and research is "enough" and how do you extract it from history and science books? I feel like someone who tried to walk across a frozen lake, fell through the ice, and drowned.
