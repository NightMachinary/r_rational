If there's one universe begging for fanfiction it's Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The setting is a world where literally all fiction is true. ALL OF IT! It's the ultimate crossover universe where any and every story is connected and ripe for rational analysis. The original comic even does it with its reimagining of classic characters and bizarre yet logical background where everything is true.
