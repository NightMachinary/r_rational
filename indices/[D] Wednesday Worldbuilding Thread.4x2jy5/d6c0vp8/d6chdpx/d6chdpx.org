I think that having things opened up too much is probably an impediment to fanfiction at /least/ as much as it is an aide. Writing in multiversal 'everything including the kitchen sink' settings are a lot like writing original settings - a setting where anything can happen and anyone can turn up, basically contains the same complete absence of information as a featureless void. You have to make the same decisions of what you include, what you don't include, etc. that you would if you were just straight up writing original fiction. Having everything in a setting means your setting is very poorly defined.

Another setting that does the same sort of thing (multiversal setting that includes everything and has basically no fanfiction) is the Chronicles of Amber (where literally all imaginable worlds exist, including Alice in Wonderland and Arthurian Myth).
