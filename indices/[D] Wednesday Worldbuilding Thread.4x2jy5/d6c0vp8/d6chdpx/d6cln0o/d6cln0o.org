[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10295381/21/The-Black-Dossier-Volume-II][This fanfic]] does a pretty good job with it by embracing the high concept absurdity. The chapter I linked to features Astro Boy and Speed Racer a fighting Cthulhu's army of mind controlled kaiju with magical reinforcements in the form of Sam from Bewitched and Rod Sterling from The Twilight Zone. I don't care if that sentence is so insane the character literally named the Cyborg Samurai seems mundane by comparison, simply reading it brings me joy.
