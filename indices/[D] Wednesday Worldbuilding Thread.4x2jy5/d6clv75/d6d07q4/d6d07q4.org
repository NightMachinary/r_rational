  In particular, given how intelligent vampires are, I can't figure out why they haven't just scienced the shit out of everything centuries ago and now we live in a post-singularity world.

They're ancient and mostly set in their ways. With their long lifespans, they don't much /like/ change and tend to nostalgically yearn for the "good old days" before all this pollution and overpopulation and other negative consequences of civilisation. While some of them do scientific research, and tend to discover things first, they are reluctant to share these things with mortals (on the basis that mortals already took the internal combustion engine and wrecked the countryside with it).

Also, humans dramatically outnumber them. A vampire may create an elegant design that works brilliantly and build (say) his own personal supercomputer - but their tendency to secrecy means that he'll only build one, for his own use; he won't build ten thousand and sell them (and hence vampires would never invent the internet). And he'll likely treat it as a mere curiousity, and not share the design with the other vampires (perhaps thinking they'll have more fun figuring out how it was done than if he tells them). Net result? A couple of hundred human scientists communicating and sharing results will outpace any amount of vampires, given long enough. (However, the vampires also get to read the humans' communication, so their technology is consistently about a decade more advanced than what anyone else has got - two decades when it comes to environmental friendliness).
