  Absolutely. Or, you know, Vern can just run after him with his super speed. Tim doesn't have a chance!
#+end_quote

Yeah, but sometimes you want it to look like suicide, so...

#+begin_quote
  It's like this scene in Stargate: SG-1:
#+end_quote

Ah, a classic [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass][dungeon bypass]] scene.

(I take it the aliens didn't have throwable explosive weapons...)

#+begin_quote
  What are the control problem people saying? Unfriendly AI could hijack your brain using a text terminal?
#+end_quote

I think that's more a matter of simply being able to model you accurately enough to work out exactly what to say to persuade you to do what it wants. (There's nothing special about the retina here - it can do the same over an audio link).

#+begin_quote
  I mean, you can transmit radio without radio hardware by using the system BUS, thus in theory making isolating an AGI from networks futile, then I think all bets are off.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Transmit, yes, but (a) I see nothing about receiving, and (b) all that is means is that if you /really/ want to isolate it, you need a faraday cage.

Anyhow, this is all irrelevant the point (which wasn't as clear as it should have been, for which I apologise). Yes, you can simply say that Sufficiently Advanced Magic allows control of someone by having Control Particles hit the retina - but you can equally well say that Sufficiently Advanced Magic allows control of something by having Control Particles hit the cornea.

  Must be able to, after all, they see her actual face on a regular basis.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  (Slightly offtopic - or slightly more ontopic depending on how you look at it - we have a mentioned-in-passing character who is a medusa-like Gorgon, and she wears a full on burka and dark glasses to operate in society. I always wondered if it makes sense. I suppose with mirrored glasses you don't see any of her....)
#+end_quote

I am left wondering what her hair thinks about being trapped under fabric like that all the time. I'm imagining some seriously unhappy snakes.

#+begin_quote
  Indigenous representation in politics in general is pretty abysmal.
#+end_quote

Ah.

...lack of political representation is probably going to keep things pretty bad for them, unfortunately. I mean, lots of people will say the right things, but with little actual personal stake in the whole thing, plus they get most of the advantage in terms of votes by simply /saying/ the right things without putting much effort into /doing/ the right things... well, I don't expect them to put much effort into the actual doing.

#+begin_quote
  Probably won't. Let's hope the aliens are nice when they come.
#+end_quote

Yeah, especially given that they're going to be several million years more advanced than us. (Maybe they'll have solved this problem already).

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure about what the inter-tribal relationships in pre-colonial Australia were like. Generally speaking, we're dealing with nomadic people living on the land whereas it sounds like the Zulus and Xhosas had a lot more infrastructure?
#+end_quote

They had mud huts and cattle herds. They'd already pushed the Khoisan (and Khoikhoi) out of all the good spots and into the desert, and the Zulus were /very/ much a warrior people (think Klingons without the technology and you won't be too far off).

#+begin_quote
  That's true. Hard for knowledge to be lost in the days of the internet, though. They might have missed that boat. If nothing else, people today can strategise on a large scale.
#+end_quote

I'm nt sure they'd have properly realised that, yet. The Internet might well have taken them by surprise.

#+begin_quote
  ...he probably turned a /bunch/ of Cardinals as time went along, trying to get a group that did what he wanted.
#+end_quote

Maybe not. Maybe he doesn't feel that it's /right/ to deny them Heaven, and he's really grumpy that he's been stuck here for so long.
