  Exactly. Doesn't seem too easy to break, and insomuch as it can be it just makes it harder for vampires to do mind control - I should do the sums for the thickness of atoms in the plastic of a contact lens and find out the equivalent volume of air to produce the same thickness of atoms. I'm hoping for an effective "naked range" of 2-20m.
#+end_quote

...I tried looking up "molar mass of plastic". I found out the [[http://www.webqc.org/molecular-weight-of-PLaSTiC.html][molar mass of PLaSTiC]], which wasn't exactly what I was going for...

Still, you can pretty much set that air distance where you want to. It's quite possible that contact lenses could be a third of the thickness and still work, or that hydrocarbons are a significantly better blocker than air. This is basically going to be a matter of what works best for the plot.

Next question. When controlling someone, does a vampire need to actually give a verbal command?

Let's say there is a vampire at a live concert (indoors, so there's no sunlight to worry about). He's in the front row, close enough to the stage, and he wants to, say, make the singer drop his microphone. Can he do so non-verbally, and thus without the people around him taking any notice, or does he actually have to say something like "Drop it!" (And if he does, is the signer able to misunderstand him and drop something else instead? ...let's just say he's holding something in his other hand as well).

#+begin_quote
  Hmm. I'm not sure. I'd like to say not because Perseus, but mirrored sunlight still kills a vampire so it probably should. Doesn't matter to me/the story either way so let's say it does. Sorry Perseus!
#+end_quote

...not quite sure how that hurts Perseus, but okay, that makes sense.

    Do your vampires have reflections?
  #+end_quote

  Yes, no real compelling reason they shouldn't, and if we found one it would probably have so many knock on effects that... yeah.
#+end_quote

Eeeeeexcellent. Next up; can a vampire, with the aid of a mirror, mind-control himself?

(I'm imagining this could potentially be very embarrassing, with the vampire frozen in front of the mirror, starring at his own eyes, until someone else comes and takes the mirror away)

  I don't know, if they tend to plate fake gold then either the copper alloy that looks golden is more expensive than gold itself (e.g. copper-platinum) or just doesn't look /right/.
#+end_quote

I've been looking into this a bit more, and apparently there's some types of brass that look /really/ golden. One, called Prince's Metal (or Prince Rupert's Metal), being 75% copper and 25% zinc, was apparently used to imitate gold in the past. (You won't fool a metallurgist with it, because the weight is all wrong, but it's the right colour which is what's really important).

  Basically, our werewolves literally are people who transform into wolves involuntarily under specific circumstances. They're surprisingly mundane, though they have their own little society.
#+end_quote

Okie dokie.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe, though as they can't turn into wolves at will or even predict the exact moment, it might make the demonstration a bit trickier to do.
#+end_quote

Eh, if the villagers have caught Tom changing before, then it's just a matter of Tom setting things up to look immune. And maybe being lucky enough to change mid-demonstration.

#+begin_quote
  The invisible demon is kind of a stupid idea and I don't think I would want to go with it. She's probably "just" a real go-getter.
#+end_quote

Okie dokie.

#+begin_quote
  I didn't mean to say they didn't, I more meant the "origin story" we've more-or-less settled on (we're basically doing the origin story last, of course...) is that she sees a vampire during the course of her beat (or whatever) and shenanigans result, probably including a vombie which they won't understand and will just give them the impression that vampires are crazed beasts, so the discovery that William is a thinking, feeling being will be a nice twist.
#+end_quote

Ooooh, nice.

#+begin_quote
  The secretary angle reminds me that I had conceived as the vampire-hunting-mage as potentially the secretary at the police station, but I think we might put her somewhere else as her character's finally beginning to get more developed.
#+end_quote

She could be a childhood friend of said secretary, I'm sure that'll come in useful.

  Like, I imagine if we discovered Australia today, we'd form a treaty with the aboriginals, maybe arrange some mining rights and whatnot, and settlement but "do everything right".
#+end_quote

I /hope/ you would, but I /doubt/ you would. It's hard to take people seriously when they can't send a negotiator who's got a university-level qualification, and it's easy to take advantage of people who don't know the value of what they're selling (especially if they're selling stuff they didn't even know /existed/ before they got to the negotiating table).

I'm not saying that war is inevitable or that you wouldn't do better now, but I'm sure there would still be problems and people taking advantage where they shouldn't.

#+begin_quote
  New Zealand kind of sort of came close by signing a treaty with the native peoples, but it still ended up in a lot of war and attrition, though they seem to be coming out the other end better than Australia (and I'd imagine South Africa) is.
#+end_quote

...I have absolutely no idea how well New Zealand is doing. I do know that we're doing very well, considering; and if we can just deal with certain corrupt politicians, we'll be doing even better.

  I was going to say that the oldest-fossils-on-record are in Western Australia, but it turns out that they discovered fossils in Greenland that were even older two months ago. :(
#+end_quote

[[/discordsmug-r][]] We've got the Cradle of Humankind. Not the /oldest/ human fossils ever found - apparently those were in Ethiopia - but some pretty old humanoid fossils.

  You'd end up with some pretty crazy dynasties that way; because of the genetic component it'd be a lot of father training his son stuff. Probably a lot of incest too, to keep the bloodline "pure". Now I want to make Icelanders have a lot of concentrated magic, which explains all their crazy mythos about elves and stuff (my partner is Icelandic so it'd be a good nod to her heritage too).
#+end_quote

Hmmmm... that's true. And then the father pushing the son to find a girl, get married, and then create and train the next generation. And the son, who knows /very well/ how to manipulate a girl's emotions in a variety of undetectable ways, has to /not do that/ and try to find a girlfriend the old-fashioned way... in the rare time between his lessons in mental manipulation.

And, at least in some generations in the past, the mind-mage isn't all that concerned about the girl's emotional independence, and he just finds one who looks good and makes her develop an attraction to him...

It's possible that that stopped when one of the wives found out and asserted her independence with a sword.

  That said, I do think he'd enjoy the whole "divine right of kings" concept, and though it has roots in ancient egyptian mythology, its appearance in the Western world was actually comparatively recent when I looked it up - 1600s or something. But maybe the French Revolution upset him so much he decided this whole divine right of kings was a good idea.
#+end_quote

In the old testament, the Israelite kings were specifically and deliberately /chosen/ by God. If William has an ego (it sounds like he does), he can easily infer from that that he was a divinely-chosen monarch even if he didn't realise it at the time.

#+begin_quote
  That sounds like exactly the sort of self-serving, egomanical type of thing the man would do. He's probably feeling pretty secure about that immortal soul of his.
#+end_quote

But he may be a bit more worried about the immortal soul of his American soldier. /Red/ didn't buy the indulgences, after all.
