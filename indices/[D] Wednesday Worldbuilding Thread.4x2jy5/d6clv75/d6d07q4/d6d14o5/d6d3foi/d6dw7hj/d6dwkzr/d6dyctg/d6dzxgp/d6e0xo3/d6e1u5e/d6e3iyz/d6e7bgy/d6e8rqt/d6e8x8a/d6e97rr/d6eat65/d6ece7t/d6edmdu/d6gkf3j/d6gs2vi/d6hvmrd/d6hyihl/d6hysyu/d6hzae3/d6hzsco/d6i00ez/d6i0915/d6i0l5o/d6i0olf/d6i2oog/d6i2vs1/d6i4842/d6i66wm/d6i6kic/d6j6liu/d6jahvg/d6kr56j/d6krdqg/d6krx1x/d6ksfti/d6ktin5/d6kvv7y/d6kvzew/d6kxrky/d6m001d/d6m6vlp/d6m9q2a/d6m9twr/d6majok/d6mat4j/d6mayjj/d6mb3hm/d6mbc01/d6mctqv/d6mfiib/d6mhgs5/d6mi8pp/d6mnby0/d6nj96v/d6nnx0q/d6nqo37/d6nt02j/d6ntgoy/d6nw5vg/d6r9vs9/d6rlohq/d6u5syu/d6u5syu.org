  Lake Toba wasn't the only population bottleneck in human history. Atlantis could have been responsible for an earlier one.

Good thought, but I always worry about anything that puts magic genes further in the past and thus having even more time to propagate. I suppose at the end of the day the exact timing doesn't matter, though I do like the imagery of humans being chattel that ultimately went feral. It kind of fits in thematically, too. In our universe, the world is pretty much a vegan society (in the background rather than a plot point, just like in Kung Fu Panda), so having humans in the position of farm animals kind of tickles me in that way.

  In seventy thousand years, he's almost certain to have been hit by a speck of sunlight at some point.

Agreed. Unless he's a recluse in a cave somewhere. I'd imagine you'd get pretty fucking enlightened after 70,000 years. I'll put 'extant group of mage-kings looking after an ancient vampire' in my head though.

Question: do you think vampires need more, less or the same amount of blood as they age?

  Ah, but she might not be expressing the gene - it might be carried, but inactive.

True. I think for magic to work, having it require a constellation of genes that play off each other constructively AND also have appropriate teaching (I can imagine a child with huge magic potential accidentally killing themselves or their parents/etc because they can't control it - like at the beginning of Frozen to an extent).

So a family with a good history of magic discipline would have worked out how to appropriately channel this: the kung fu masters who have slight prescience to predict an opponent in combat's next move probably teach their children from a young age how to move with it, trust their instincts, etc; if that same child was adopted by a family without a magical tradition might result in the child being anxious because s/he always has this weird feeling something's about to happen but can never be sure how to interpret it, or feel jumpy. I can imagine this would ultimately manifest in some quite debilitating anxiety symptoms - OCD or the like.
