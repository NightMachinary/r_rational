Thanks for the question! It's a good thing to think about and is another point in the "why don't they just have all ghouls all the time?" fridge logic column =/.

I don't know anything about the science of addition (probably something to research!), but I'd imagine the difficulty would be similar in kind but more severe in magnitude to whatever the 'most addictive'^{TM} modern drug. So you can get clean with enough effort and support (in fact, a plot line involves a main character trying to do so, though I'm not sure if she succeeds as of yet).

However, I'd imagine that jannisaries would for the most part be drug addicts looking for a bigger thrill, so they'd recruit each other (possibly out of a genuine desire to share a better high, possibly because the vampire encourages recruitment), or someone who graduates up the drug scale to the very top (is this a real thing?) and wants something better might seek it out.
