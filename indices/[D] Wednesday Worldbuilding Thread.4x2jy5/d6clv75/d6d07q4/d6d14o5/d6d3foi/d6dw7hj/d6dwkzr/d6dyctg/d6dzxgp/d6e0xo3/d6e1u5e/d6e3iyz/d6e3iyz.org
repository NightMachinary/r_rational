The ghouls are suggestible only to the vampire, so it's not too bad. Family and friends likely wouldn't notice anything is off.

[[/lyplay][]] And yeah, keeping ghouls fed while you're off at one of those two week long vampire operas is a bit risky, though obviously they have intermissions for such things as the requisite sleeping during daylight, having a snack, etc.
