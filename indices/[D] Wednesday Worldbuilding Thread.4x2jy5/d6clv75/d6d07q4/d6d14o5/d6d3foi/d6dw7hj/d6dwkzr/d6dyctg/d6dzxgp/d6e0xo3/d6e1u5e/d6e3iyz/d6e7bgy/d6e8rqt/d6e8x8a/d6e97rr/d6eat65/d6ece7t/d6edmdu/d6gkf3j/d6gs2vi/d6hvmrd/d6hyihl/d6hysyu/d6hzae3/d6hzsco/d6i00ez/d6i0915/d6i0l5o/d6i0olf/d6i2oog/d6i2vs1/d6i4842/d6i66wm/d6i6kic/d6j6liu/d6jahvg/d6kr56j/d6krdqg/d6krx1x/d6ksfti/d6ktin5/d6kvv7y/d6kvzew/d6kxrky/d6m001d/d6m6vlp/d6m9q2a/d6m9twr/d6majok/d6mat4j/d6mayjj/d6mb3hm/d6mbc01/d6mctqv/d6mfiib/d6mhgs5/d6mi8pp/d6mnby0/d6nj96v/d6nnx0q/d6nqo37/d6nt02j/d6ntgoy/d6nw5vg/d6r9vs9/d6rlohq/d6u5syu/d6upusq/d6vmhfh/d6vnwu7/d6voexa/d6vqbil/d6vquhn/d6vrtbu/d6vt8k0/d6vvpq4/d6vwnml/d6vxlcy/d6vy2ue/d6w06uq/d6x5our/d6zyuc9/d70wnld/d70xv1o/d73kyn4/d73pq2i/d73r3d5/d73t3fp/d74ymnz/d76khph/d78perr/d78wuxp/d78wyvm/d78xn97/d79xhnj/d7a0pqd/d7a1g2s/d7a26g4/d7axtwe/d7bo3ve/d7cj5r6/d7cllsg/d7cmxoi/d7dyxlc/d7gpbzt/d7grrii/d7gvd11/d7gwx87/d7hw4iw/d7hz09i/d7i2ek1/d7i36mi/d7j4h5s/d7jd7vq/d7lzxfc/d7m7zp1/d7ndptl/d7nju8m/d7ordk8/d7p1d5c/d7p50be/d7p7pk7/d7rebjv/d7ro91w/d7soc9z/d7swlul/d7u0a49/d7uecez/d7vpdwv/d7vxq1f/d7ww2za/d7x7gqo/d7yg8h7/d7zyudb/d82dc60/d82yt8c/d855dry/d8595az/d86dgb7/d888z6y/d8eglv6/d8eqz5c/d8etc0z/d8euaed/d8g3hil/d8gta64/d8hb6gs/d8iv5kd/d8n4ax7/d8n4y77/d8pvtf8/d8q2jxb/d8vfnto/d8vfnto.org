  It might make more sense to cast the vampire's flesh under 'wood'...
#+end_quote

But then what do we cast the stake under? Hmmm

#+begin_quote
  the Chinese philosophy uses "metal" as a category instead of "gold" - which makes more sense here, because while gold is certainly a type of metal, most metals will chop wood.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but (one of the) literal translations of the character that means "metal" - 金 - is gold, which I thought was /very very/ cool, from a worldbuilding perspective; originally the person who actually was on the right track about gold called it gold, but then everyone else fucked around with it, added their own stuff, and eventually the fact it used the character 金 was "just a metaphor" and "they really mean any metal" and "why don't you buy my feng shui consulting service?".

  So. If we class the vampire as 'wood', what does this leave us with?

  - Fire consumes vampires, destroying them, leaving wounds that do not easily heal. Perhaps would that do not naturally regenerate at /all/.
  - Gold chops through vampires, perhaps slicing more easily through them, or messing (again) with their regeneration.
  - The effect of water counter fire - a vampire leaving a wound (or a burn) under running water may speed up (or re-start) regeneration.
  - The effects of earth counter gold; perhaps resting underground, in contact with earth, allows a vampire to heal faster.

I like all the above, it's a pretty neat system. I'll have to work out which I prefer. I worry all the powers and counter-powers is going to get confusing, but at the same time, it's a pretty rich sort of tapestry and doesn't require much investment as it only happens at times when vampires are being torched and stuff by hunters anyway.

  - As for wood - if a vampire's body is magically similar to wood, then a wooden stake through the heart will mess with the system. Probably the animating magic flows easily into the stake - because it's wood - but then never flows out again, because it's the /wrong/ wood. It doesn't have the right channels, the right flow mechanisms.

Not sure I see this, will think about it.

  Okay, so I just took the Wu Xing in a completely different direction to the direction you took it in.
#+end_quote

Wu Xing is pretty cool isn't it? At least conceptually, it's got a lot of little things to hang hooks off of. Nice and convenient for all these different cultures to invent magic systems for us, isn't it?
