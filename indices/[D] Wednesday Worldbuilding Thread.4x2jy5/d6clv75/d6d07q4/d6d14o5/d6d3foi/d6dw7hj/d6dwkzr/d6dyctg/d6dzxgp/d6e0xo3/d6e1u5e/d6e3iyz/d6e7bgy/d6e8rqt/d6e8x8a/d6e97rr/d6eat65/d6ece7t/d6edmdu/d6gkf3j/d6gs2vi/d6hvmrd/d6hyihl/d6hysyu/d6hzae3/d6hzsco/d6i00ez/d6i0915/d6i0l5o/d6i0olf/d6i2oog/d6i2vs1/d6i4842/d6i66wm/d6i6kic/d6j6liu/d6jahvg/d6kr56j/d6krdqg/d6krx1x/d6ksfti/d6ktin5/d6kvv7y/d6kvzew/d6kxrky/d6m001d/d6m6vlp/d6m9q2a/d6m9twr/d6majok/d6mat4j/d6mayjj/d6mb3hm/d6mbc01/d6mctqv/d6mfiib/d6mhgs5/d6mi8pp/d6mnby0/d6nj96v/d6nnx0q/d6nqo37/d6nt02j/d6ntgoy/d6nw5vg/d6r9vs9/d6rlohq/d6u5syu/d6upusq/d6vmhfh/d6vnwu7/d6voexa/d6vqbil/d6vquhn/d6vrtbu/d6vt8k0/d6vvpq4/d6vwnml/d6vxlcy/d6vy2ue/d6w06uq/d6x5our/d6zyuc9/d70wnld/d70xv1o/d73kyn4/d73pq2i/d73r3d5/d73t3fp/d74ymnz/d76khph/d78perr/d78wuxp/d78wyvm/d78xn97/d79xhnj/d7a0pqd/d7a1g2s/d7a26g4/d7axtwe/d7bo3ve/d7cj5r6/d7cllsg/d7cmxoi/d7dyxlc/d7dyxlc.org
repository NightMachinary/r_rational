  transformation and additional mass is a glaring problem in this universe as it stands.
#+end_quote

...okay.

Try this, then. Imagine, for a moment, a two-dimensional universe. Like a flat, vertical membrane, on which two-dimensional creatures live and move. (Something like Flatland). Along with this, imagine a carrot. A normal, three-dimensional carrot. The carrot is poking sideways into the 2D universe.

Now, from the perspective of the 2D universe's inhabitants, the carrot is a circle. But the carrot can do one thing that the 2D universe's inhabitants /can't/ do, which is move in the third dimension. And whenever the carrot moves in the third dimension, as far as the 2D universe's inhabitants can tell, it either shrinks or grows.

Let's assume that the 2D universe's version of gravity only works in two dimensions. Then it only affects the part of the carrot that intersects with the 2D universe. As far as the 2D inhabitants can see, the carrot can grow (up to a maximum size) or shrink as well, changing its mass in the process.

Moreover, if someone cuts off a bit of the carrot at maximum size, it can shrink, and in the process it seems to instantly repair itself; though it still feels the pain, and if it returns to its old size, its injury becomes visible again.

--------------

Now imagine that vampires (and gargoyles) are kind of four-dimensional creatures. Your average vampire is a reanimated corpse on the one end of the 'carrot', and a bat on the other. (Notably, this means he's always the /same/ bat; if a conversationist puts a radio tag on a vampire in bat form, then the vampire becomes human and goes back to bat form, he'll still have the radio tag as a bat - despite not having it stuck to his ear as a human, and quite possibly not having it interact with the normal universe while he's in human form).

So, where does all this extra carrot-matter come from? Simple; vampires already regenerate from air, now they just need a bit more air to regenerate from.

Same idea goes for the gargoyle; though there, one end of the 'carrot' is a three-ton creature and the small end is at least human shaped.

Of course, this only works for a shapeshifter who's limited to two forms (and presumably any intermediate form, though that might be as difficult to maintain as balancing a ball on the tip of a pen instead of letting it fall to one or the other side). A multi-form shape shifter would either be some sort of caterpillar-like thing in four dimensions (a vampire who can shift to bat or wolf but has to pass through human form if moving from one to the other, for example) or something a good deal more complicated. It also means that shifting can give the /appearance/ of instant healing, but the original body remains injured and must heal (or regenerate) in its own time.

It also implies that shape shifters can interact with each other /outside/ the normal plane of the universe (e.g. two vampires in bat form meet each other; the outside-the-universe human form of one vampire can punch the outside-the-universe human form of the other vampire. To an external observer, the two bats approach each other, then one is suddenly, forcefully repelled away from the other for no apparent reason. This also makes the gargoyle a great anti-vampire guard - he can instant recognise shape shifters and even when he's in human form, he's still able to bring three tons of muscle down in a place that most shape shifters do not expect to be punched).

  Not unless the vampire spit has been identified as a PED, which, hey, maybe it has and we don't know it.
#+end_quote

Vampire spit might not just be /one/ compound. It might be half-a-dozen or more. Any one of which might be a performance enhancing drug.

  No doubt, and the DEA probably thinks it's the worst street name since bath salts. If only they knew...
#+end_quote

How does the drug lord /get/ the stuff, that's the question... does he have a bunch of vampire-zombies tied up in his basement that he milks every now and then?

  I was also going to propose it as an alternative CO2 scrubber, but it would just remove CO2 from the air and the oxygen would be lost because the ratio of C to O in the body is 1:2. How annoying, but still, it remains potentially useful.

I fail to see what sort of emergency could be so terrible that it can be made in any way better by introducing an immortal, feral, near-unkillable human-eating monster in an enclosed space with the crew.
