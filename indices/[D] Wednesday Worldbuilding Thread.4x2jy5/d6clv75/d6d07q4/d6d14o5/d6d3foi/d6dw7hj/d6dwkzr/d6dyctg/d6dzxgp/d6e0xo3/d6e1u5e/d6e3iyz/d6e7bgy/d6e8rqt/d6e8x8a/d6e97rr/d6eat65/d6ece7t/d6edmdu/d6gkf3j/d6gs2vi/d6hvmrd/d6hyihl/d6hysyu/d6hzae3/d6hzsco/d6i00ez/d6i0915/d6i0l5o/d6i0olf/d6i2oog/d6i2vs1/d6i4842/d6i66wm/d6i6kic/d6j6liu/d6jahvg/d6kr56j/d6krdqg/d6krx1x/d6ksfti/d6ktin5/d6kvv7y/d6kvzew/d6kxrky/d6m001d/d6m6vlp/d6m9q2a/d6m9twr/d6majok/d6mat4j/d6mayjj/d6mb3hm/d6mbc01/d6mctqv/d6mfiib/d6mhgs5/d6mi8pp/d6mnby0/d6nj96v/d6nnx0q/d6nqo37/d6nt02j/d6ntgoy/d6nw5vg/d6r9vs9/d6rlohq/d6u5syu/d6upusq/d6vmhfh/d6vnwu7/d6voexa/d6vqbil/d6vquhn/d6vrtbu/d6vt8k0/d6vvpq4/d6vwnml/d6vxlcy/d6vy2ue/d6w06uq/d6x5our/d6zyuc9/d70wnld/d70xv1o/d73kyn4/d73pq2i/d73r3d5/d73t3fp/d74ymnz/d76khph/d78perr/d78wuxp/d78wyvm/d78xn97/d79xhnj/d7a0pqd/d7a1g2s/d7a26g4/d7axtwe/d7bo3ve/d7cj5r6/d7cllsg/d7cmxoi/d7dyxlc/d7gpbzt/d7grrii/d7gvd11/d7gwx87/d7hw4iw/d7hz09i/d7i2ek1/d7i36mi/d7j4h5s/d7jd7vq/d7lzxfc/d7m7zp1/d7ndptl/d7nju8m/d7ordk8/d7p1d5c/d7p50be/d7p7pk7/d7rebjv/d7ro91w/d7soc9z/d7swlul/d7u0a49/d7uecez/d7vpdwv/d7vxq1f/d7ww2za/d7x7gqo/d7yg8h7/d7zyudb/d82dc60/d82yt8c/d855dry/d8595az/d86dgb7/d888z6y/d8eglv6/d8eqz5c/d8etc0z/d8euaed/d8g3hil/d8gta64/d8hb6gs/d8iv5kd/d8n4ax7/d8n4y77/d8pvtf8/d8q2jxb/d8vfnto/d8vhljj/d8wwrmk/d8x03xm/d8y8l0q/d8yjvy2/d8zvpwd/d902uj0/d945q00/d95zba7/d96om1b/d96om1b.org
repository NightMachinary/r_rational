  ...ah. I thought that not being horrified about having done it would generalise into a sort of gradual desensitisation.
#+end_quote

That's the problem, it makes logical sense for it to work that way too. In the end, I guess it doesn't really matter, because nobody will ever see it. But then you end up with things being too easy for an immortal demon with super strength, super speed, transformation capabilities and mind control.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, but it can be generalised further. Anything that someone would never do, even under Control, then becomes a matter of the vampire just setting up the right scenes for a while beforehand - it weakens from "he'd never do that" to "you have to plan ahead to make him do that".
#+end_quote

Yeah, but making characters plan ahead when any step in the plan not going well could result in the whole thing coming tumbling very amusingly/horrifically down is awesome. A sufficiently motivated person can probably manipulate almost anything to happen anyway, especially with super speed, never mind mind control.

#+begin_quote
  ...yeah, given how lethal fire is for vampires, I'm not seeing an in-universe explanation for this one, either. Especially as I'm pretty sure that if you get all the cloth on fire, you'll end up with a lot more ash than corpse out of it.
#+end_quote

Yeah. /sigh/. Better to leave the vampire ritual vague, and try and think of something that could be done to improve it. Then again, vomiting vampire tummy sludge into a heart and then sewing the whole mess closed isn't exactly minimalist, so it might not need to be changed.

    Oh goodie. I wonder what another major (or minor) magical / superstitious belief system is, that could get me thinking about that. I do like the idea of a smell interfering somehow. Indian is another big one, but I'm sure there's plenty of places in Africa and the Americas and Oceania too.
  #+end_quote

  ...I think Africa is more likely to give you other creatures to live in the alternate universe than vampire lore. Hmmm. Though the Sun will naturally take a major part in any mythological tradition, won't it?
#+end_quote

Yeah, ancient egyptian having the sun pulled along the sky by a dung beatle or whatever. Maybe vampires don't like beetles? Haha. Would feel kind of gimmicky going to ancient egypt a lot though, but I'm not sure if there'd be easy ways to find say the lore of the Samburu tribe online without potentially sifting through academic papers.

    The mage might say "ok, I am removing the emotion of you not liking what happened in the white van. Just remember that white vans are bad places to be, the things that happened were bad, and you should not let them happen again".
  #+end_quote

  Okay, fair enough, but the rational and emotional work on different levels. The emotional revulsion pulls you out immediately, before you even realise what's going on - the rational level only works when you have time (and /take/ the time) to think about it. So it's slower and doesn't sprig to mind as readily.
#+end_quote

You've got a point there. I think there's a Simpson's episode where Homer takes ages to realise he was being mugged or something, because of how stupid he is? Hopefully feeling danger in non-traumatic situations would help the hypothetical person. Or not, and they'll end up constantly going into white vans with badness resulting.
