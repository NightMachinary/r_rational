  The "bad guy" aliens in Stargate: SG-1 were known for being theatrical rather than practical.
#+end_quote

Ah, I see. They weren't trying to stop an enemy, they were trying to create an engaging and challenging war game in which only unimportant servant races were at risk of death or injury.

Fair enough. That does rather change the design specifications necessary.

  I'm still terrified it will figure something out though it seems to cover anything that we know about in our current science knowledge. That said, they're much smarter than we are, and maybe it would be conceivable to disable the faraday cage in some way? Maybe communciate in infrared by heating itself up?
#+end_quote

It probably /could/ communicate in infrared like that - but who's going to be watching?

Communicating does nothing if no-one's listening.

  Brainfreeze!

I hope that by now she's figured out the optimum amount of ice to have sleepy snakes without brainfreeze.

  Not big because it happened long ago because of that nifty constitution, or not big because of the bigger fish to fry you were talking about?
#+end_quote

Not big because of bigger fish to fry.

At the time that the Constitution was written, the big fish was that everyone (above a certain age) was suddenly getting to vote. (This was a /very/ big fish, because something like 60% of adults had previously been barred from voting, split along racial lines). Racism has never really gone away, and remains an issue... though things are /significantly/ better than they used to be, there are still problems.

And then, of course, the idea of the President getting rather involved on the wrong end of a number of corruption scandals is another big issue.

So... kind of overshadowed.

  Makes sense; you'd imagine there would be competition over resources. Almost a pity that they weren't more war-like. It's probably one of the reasons the Maori are ultimately more "successful" today.
#+end_quote

Yeah... probably.

  I'm imagining the post in [[/r/unresolvedmysteries]] now: "Over the course of two years, everyone who posted on a paranormal forum and their families has been killed. Coincidence or conspiracy?"
#+end_quote

If it gets that far, then (due to a little something called the Streisand Effect) the contents of said forum will probably spread faster than the jannissary can keep up with...

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. There are so many offshoots. I'm now reading about orthodox christianity and trying to work out what "changed the least", though of course every single branch basically claims they're the "best". I'm now reading about the East--West Schism and wondering exactly what would align with William's values, though not his /current/ values but the vague values I assume he would have had in 1054. This.... is maybe not the best use of my time?
#+end_quote

[[/derpyhuh][]] /Gasp!/ Creating the perfect history for your novel is /not/ the best use of your time? How can this /be?!/

#+begin_quote
  ... I think William would most closely identify with Eastern Orthodox, because he /probably/ wouldn't like the modification to the source of the holy spirit or the elevation of the roman patriarch over the others (then again, he's never really one for equality, and the roman guy is closest to france and all... but it looks like the roman see wasn't meant to have that power originally, and, well, usurpers are bad).
#+end_quote

[[/twibeam][]] Right now, you probably know more about the subject than I do, and it sounds good, so feel free to go with that!
