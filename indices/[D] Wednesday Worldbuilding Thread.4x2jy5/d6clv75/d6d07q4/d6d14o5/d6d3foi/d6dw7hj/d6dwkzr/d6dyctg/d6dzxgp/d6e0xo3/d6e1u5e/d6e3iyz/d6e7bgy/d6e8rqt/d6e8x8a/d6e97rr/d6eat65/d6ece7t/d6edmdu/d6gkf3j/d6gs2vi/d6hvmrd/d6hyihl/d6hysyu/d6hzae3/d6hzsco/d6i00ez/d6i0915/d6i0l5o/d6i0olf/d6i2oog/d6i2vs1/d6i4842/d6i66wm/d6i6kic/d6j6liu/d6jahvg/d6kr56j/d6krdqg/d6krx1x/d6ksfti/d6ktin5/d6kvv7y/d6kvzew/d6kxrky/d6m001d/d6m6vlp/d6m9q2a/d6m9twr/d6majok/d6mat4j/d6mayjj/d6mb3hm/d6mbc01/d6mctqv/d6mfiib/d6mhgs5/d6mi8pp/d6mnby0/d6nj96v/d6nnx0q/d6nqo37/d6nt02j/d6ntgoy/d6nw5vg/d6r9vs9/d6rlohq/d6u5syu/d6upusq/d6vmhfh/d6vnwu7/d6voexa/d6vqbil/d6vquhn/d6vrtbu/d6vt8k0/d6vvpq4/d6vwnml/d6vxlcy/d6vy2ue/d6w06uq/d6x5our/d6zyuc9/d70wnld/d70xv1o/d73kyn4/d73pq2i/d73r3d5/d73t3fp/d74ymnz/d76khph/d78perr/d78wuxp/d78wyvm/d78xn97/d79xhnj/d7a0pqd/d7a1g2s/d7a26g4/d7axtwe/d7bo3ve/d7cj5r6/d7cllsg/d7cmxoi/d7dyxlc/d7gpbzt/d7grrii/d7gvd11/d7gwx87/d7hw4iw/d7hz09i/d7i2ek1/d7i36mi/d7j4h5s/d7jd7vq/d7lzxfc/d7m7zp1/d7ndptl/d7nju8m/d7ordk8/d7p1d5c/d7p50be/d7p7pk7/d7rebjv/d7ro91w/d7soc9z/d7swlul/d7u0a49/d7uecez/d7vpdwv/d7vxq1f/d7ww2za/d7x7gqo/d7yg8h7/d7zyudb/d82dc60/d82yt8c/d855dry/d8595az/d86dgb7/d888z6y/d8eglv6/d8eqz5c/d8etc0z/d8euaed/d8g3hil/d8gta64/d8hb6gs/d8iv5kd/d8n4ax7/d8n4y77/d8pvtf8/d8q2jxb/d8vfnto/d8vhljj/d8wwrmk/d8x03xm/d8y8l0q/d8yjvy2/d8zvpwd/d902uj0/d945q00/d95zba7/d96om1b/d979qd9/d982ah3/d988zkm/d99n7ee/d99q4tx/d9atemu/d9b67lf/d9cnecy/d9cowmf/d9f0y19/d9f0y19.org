  Next question. When controlling someone, does a vampire need to actually give a verbal command?
#+end_quote

Good one. I'm two minds about this: it makes sense conceptually that, for example, giving a command in sign language (whether like ASL or that military gesturing thing you see on TV), putting your fingers to your lips to indicate be quiet, etc would all be sensible ways this power could work.

However, also conceptually, you'd imagine the power would work from the vampire's gaze having a power over you. So if you stopped looking into her eyes to see what she was signing you to do, the spell would be broken.

I'd say that it can be a non-verbal command, however it has to be easily "read" by someone staring into your eyes. So you couldn't hold up a piece of paper with instructions on it, and you might not be able to sign (I'm not sure if you can understand sign language whilst staring into the speaker's eyes?), but you'd definitely be able to put your finger to your lips to indicate "quiet" for example.

  Does he actually have to say something like "Drop it!" (And if he does, is the signer able to misunderstand him and drop something else instead? ...let's just say he's holding something in his other hand as well).
#+end_quote

Using the gun to your head analogy: it would be the thing you thought they most probably meant. So, for example, if you had a microphone in one hand and a sandwich in the other and you were signing, you'd probably drop the microphone unless you saw the vampire was the person you stole the sandwich from.

You might be able to deliberately disobey (e.g. dropping your handbag rather than the gun you're pointing at the vampire's ally), but it would take a lot of guts, and the willpower to do so would be just below what it would take to just ignore the order in the first place.

  ...not quite sure how that hurts Perseus, but okay, that makes sense.
#+end_quote

In the myth, he kills Medusa by using her reflection in his shield to guide his blade. If you look at Medusa, you turn to stone, but the reflection doesn't have the same property. So, using the mirror physics just proposed, Perseus would not be able to kill Medusa like that.

#+begin_quote
  can a vampire, with the aid of a mirror, mind-control himself?

  (I'm imagining this could potentially be very embarrassing, with the vampire frozen in front of the mirror, starring at his own eyes, until someone else comes and takes the mirror away)
#+end_quote

Vampires are immune to mind control, so no. It also takes effort to do, so it'd be hard to come up with a situation where a vampire might try and control her reflection (though you could always throw a mirror in the way before they try and control you. But as I said, it's moot, as vampires are immune).

  I've been looking into this a bit more, and apparently there's some types of brass that look /really/ golden.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah. Might work well instead of aluminium. I was proud of the aluminium fakeout though, because aluminium used to be /so/ valuable so it would make sense as a gift given by a long-lived being, and now would be seen as a unbelievably cheap fake silver.

    shenanigans result, probably including a vombie which they won't understand and will just give them the impression that vampires are crazed beasts, so the discovery that William is a thinking, feeling being will be a nice twist.
  #+end_quote

  Ooooh, nice.
#+end_quote

Yeah. I'm tossing up all my ideas for JaNoWriMo now I've decided that I'll do it. I can see a kind of rational prologue, with the hunters trying all sorts of things (mirrors, etc) could be fun. But I've been watching /Jane the Virgin/ and it's made me feel a lot better about romance as a genre. We'll see what gets me excited when I come around to choosing between ideas.

    Like, I imagine if we discovered Australia today, we'd form a treaty with the aboriginals, maybe arrange some mining rights and whatnot, and settlement but "do everything right".
  #+end_quote

  I /hope/ you would, but I /doubt/ you would. It's hard to take people seriously when they can't send a negotiator who's got a university-level qualification, and it's easy to take advantage of people who don't know the value of what they're selling (especially if they're selling stuff they didn't even know /existed/ before they got to the negotiating table).

  I'm not saying that war is inevitable or that you wouldn't do better now, but I'm sure there would still be problems and people taking advantage where they shouldn't.
#+end_quote

Maybe. But we have the Sentinelese people and those uncontacted tribes out in the middle of Brazil, and they're left mostly alone. (Well, the Sentinelese people don't give us much say in the matter what with all the arrows). Then again, they also live in areas that are pretty undesireable, whereas Australia, the Americas, Africa all have gold, diamonds, vast tracts of land, etc.

I like to have faith in people but you may be right.

  ...I have absolutely no idea how well New Zealand is doing. I do know that we're doing very well, considering; and if we can just deal with certain corrupt politicians, we'll be doing even better.
#+end_quote

The considering is the bad part though. I don't know what the situation is like in NZ or South Africa, but Australia has [[http://www.australianstogether.org.au/stories/detail/the-gap-indigenous-disadvantage-in-australia][a 10 year difference in life expectancy]] between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. Lower graduation rates, higher suicide rates, higher incarceration rates, higher rates of infant mortality, the list goes on. A lot of that is related to alcohol, smoking, and the fact that indigenous people tend to live in rural areas more often. A gap of 10 years is just appalling though.

New Zealand has put more recognition for Maori language programmes, has a lot of good social policies, etc.

  Hmmmm... that's true. And then the father pushing the son to find a girl, get married, and then create and train the next generation. And the son, who knows /very well/ how to manipulate a girl's emotions in a variety of undetectable ways, has to /not do that/ and try to find a girlfriend the old-fashioned way... in the rare time between his lessons in mental manipulation.
#+end_quote

Oh god.... can you imagine what that relationship would look like? A relationship between equals after someone had gone through life being told nobody was? It would take some intense parental meddling.

#+begin_quote
  And, at least in some generations in the past, the mind-mage isn't all that concerned about the girl's emotional independence, and he just finds one who looks good and makes her develop an attraction to him...

  It's possible that that stopped when one of the wives found out and asserted her independence with a sword.
#+end_quote

Yeah, assuming mages wouldn't bother training their powerful daughters. I suppose if they had a suitable son why waste the effort. You might end up with some very post-apocalyptic type scenarios if you were able to subjugate the erstwhile mothers easily enough. :(

  In the old testament, the Israelite kings were specifically and deliberately /chosen/ by God. If William has an ego (it sounds like he does), he can easily infer from that that he was a divinely-chosen monarch even if he didn't realise it at the time.
#+end_quote

"It all makes sense! The reason I'm so awesome and was able to get eternal meat-suit life is because God chose me for it. I'm going to go around collecting junk, watching plays, and maccing on dudes now. That is the life God would want for me"

Yeah.... I actually really can see it. He's just waiting for the veil of ignorance to lift and for France to recognise him as their rightful king so he can go back to ruling, only instead of basically being a war-chief he goes to a lot of meetings about agriculture and immigration and wonders where all the swordfights are.

    That sounds like exactly the sort of self-serving, egomanical type of thing the man would do. He's probably feeling pretty secure about that immortal soul of his.
  #+end_quote

  But he may be a bit more worried about the immortal soul of his American soldier. /Red/ didn't buy the indulgences, after all.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but, I gotta level with you - he loves Red and all, but his wife-whilst-human is waiting for him (or already with him? who knows!) up in heaven (surely! He bought her tons of posthumous indulgences!). Red can do what he likes, William's got a backup plan.

... maybe that's not the most romantic thing to have. But I think that's how his mind is gonna work.

Of course, it would be /great/ if Red could get his immortal soul saved and all that - he asked him a few times whilst he was alive, and it seemed he was on some variation of what Saint Paul started only a few hundred years before William was born. No chance of him getting an authentic 5th century catholic priest to bless him and make sure it's all legit, unless - oh god, William is going to turn the world upside down to try and find an authentic 5th (or really, 6th or 7th will do) century vampire priest to get all this down.

... Maybe the Vatican has one?
