Yeah, you're right. Thanks again for your input.

I did a little bit of research into the specifics of addiction and 'highly addictive' tends to gloss well with the established canon of jannisaries (instant gratification, especially).

The big problem is I want to have them be content waiting at least several weeks between feedings, but be desperate for them in short order after that, so it'll probably consist of huge initial high during the feeding itself, which is replaced by a more mild pleasant sensation for two to three weeks, perhaps including the sort of benefits that things like ritalin and modafinil provide to provide incentive for 'the rich and powerful' to take it, gradually fading into withdrawals that put you back below your baseline and then as time goes on get worse and worse and worse. So, say, six weeks after a feeding you'll be a little beneath your best, the headaches start after two months, and then three months in you've got basically the worst flu you've ever had and you just KNOW that the only thing that will fix it is that beautiful toothy beast.

Note to self: research drug addiction and withdrawal further
