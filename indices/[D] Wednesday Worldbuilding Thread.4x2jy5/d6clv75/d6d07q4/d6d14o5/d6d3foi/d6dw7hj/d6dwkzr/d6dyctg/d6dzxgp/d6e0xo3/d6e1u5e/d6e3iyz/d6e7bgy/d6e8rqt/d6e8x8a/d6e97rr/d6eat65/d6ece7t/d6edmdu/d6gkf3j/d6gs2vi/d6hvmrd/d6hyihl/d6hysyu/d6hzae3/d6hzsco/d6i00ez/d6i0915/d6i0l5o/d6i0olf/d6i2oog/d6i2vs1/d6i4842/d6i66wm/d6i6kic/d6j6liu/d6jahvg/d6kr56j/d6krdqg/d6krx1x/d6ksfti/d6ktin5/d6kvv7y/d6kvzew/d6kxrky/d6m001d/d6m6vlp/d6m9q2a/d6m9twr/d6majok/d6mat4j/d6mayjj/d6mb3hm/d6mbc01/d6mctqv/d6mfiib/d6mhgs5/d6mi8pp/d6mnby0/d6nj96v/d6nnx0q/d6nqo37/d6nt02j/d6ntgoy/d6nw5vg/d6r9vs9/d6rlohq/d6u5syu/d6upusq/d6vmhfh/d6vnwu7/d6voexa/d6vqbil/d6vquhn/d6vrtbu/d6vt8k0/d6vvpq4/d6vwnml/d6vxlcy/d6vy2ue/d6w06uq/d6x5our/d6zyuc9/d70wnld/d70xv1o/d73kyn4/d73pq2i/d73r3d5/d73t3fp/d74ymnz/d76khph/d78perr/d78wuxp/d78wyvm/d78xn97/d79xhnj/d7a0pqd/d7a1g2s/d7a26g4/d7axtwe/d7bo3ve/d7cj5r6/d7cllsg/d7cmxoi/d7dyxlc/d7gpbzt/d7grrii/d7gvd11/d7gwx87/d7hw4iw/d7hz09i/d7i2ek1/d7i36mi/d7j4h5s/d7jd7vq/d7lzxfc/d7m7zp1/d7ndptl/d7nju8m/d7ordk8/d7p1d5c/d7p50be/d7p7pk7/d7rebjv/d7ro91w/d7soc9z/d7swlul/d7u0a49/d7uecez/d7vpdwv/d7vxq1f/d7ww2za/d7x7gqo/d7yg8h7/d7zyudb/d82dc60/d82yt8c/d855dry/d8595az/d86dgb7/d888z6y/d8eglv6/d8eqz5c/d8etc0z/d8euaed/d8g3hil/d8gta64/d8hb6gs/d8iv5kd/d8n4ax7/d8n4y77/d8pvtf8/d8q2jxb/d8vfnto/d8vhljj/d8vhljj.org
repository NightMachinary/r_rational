  But then what do we cast the stake under? Hmmm

Also wood! It works because it's magically similar enough to vampire flesh - it's like ramming a bit of copper through an electric circuit, it makes thing stop working because it conducts the 'electricity' in all the wrong places. (Electric circuits don't self-repair when you take the copper out, so the analogy's a bit weak).

  Yeah, but (one of the) literal translations of the character that means "metal" - é‡‘ - is gold, which I thought was /very very/ cool, from a worldbuilding perspective;
#+end_quote

I see. And, better yet, gold doesn't chop wood but it /does/ chop vampires like anything, so originally calling it gold might have been a deliberate instruction for future vampire hunters.

  I like all the above, it's a pretty neat system. I'll have to work out which I prefer.
#+end_quote

Great!

  I worry all the powers and counter-powers is going to get confusing, but at the same time, it's a pretty rich sort of tapestry and doesn't require much investment as it only happens at times when vampires are being torched and stuff by hunters anyway.

Yeah, a lot of this is background detail that might crop up once or twice in a story but hints at a coherent system behind everything.

  Wu Xing is pretty cool isn't it? At least conceptually, it's got a lot of little things to hang hooks off of.
#+end_quote

And, as we've conclusively proven, it's wide open enough for two people to apply it to the same fictional situation and come up with two wildly different ways to make it fit said situation. So it can probably be used to explain /everything/.

Which is bad science, but great for fictional worldbuilding...
