  When a vampire turns into a bat - or bat-like mammal - where does the extra mass go?
#+end_quote

I was thinking that when I was talking about it and I don't have a satisfactory answer. The obvious thing is for the "gravity has less effect on them" explanation, but I'm not sure I like that as there's more transformation in the canon that isn't so easily explained and in fact canonically has additional weight or disappearing weight.

For example, there's a gargoyle. In his natural form, he's fifteen feet tall, with an additional fifteen feet of tail, and weighs about 3 tons (he's made of sandstone after all). However, he can change into a human form, where he looks like a standard 7 foot tall human but is really a 7 foot tall sandstone golem with a thin veneer of human skin on the outside, weighing about 260kg. This naturally causes issues if he transforms in places that can't handle the weight of a giraffe.

Also, he doesn't need to eat, but can choose to, and he regenerates, too, but far, far slower than a vampire. Presumably he can get the extra mass from the air, too, but he's made of rarer minerals (potassium, sodium, aluminium and so on), so he's probably getting them from a combination of the air and, like, doing stuff like making voids in his body. He eats rocks quite a lot, so after losing a limb or something he probably will just eat even more rocks to regain the mass.

Oh, and some more fun facts in case you want a thread to pick on - he's magically bound to protect a certain vampire, through a spell that has to be refreshed every ten years or so. He's pretty chill about this, as he was basically created to protect whoever owns him at the time. Finally, a few hundred years ago, a vandal carved his name ("Julias"[sic]) into the pedestal that the gargoyle sits on, and ever since the gargoyle and everyone known to the gargoyle - including his wife - has only been able to refer to him by that name, and have forgotten what, if anything, he used to be called.

So yes, to go back to the original point - transformation and additional mass is a glaring problem in this universe as it stands. Instant transformation can't be explained away as easily as regeneration. I think I might ask that at the upcoming world-building thread, if you don't have any ideas?

  [vampire spit being waste] ties in nicely with the whole jannissary idea - the waste products themselves are addictive
#+end_quote

Yeah, it explains how the effect lasts, because there's no reason they can't persist in the blood. Adding this to canon.

  Actually, that raises a point - if a vampire bites an athlete before a major race, and that athlete is then selected for a random drug screening, does the athlete get disqualified?
#+end_quote

Not unless the vampire spit has been identified as a PED, which, hey, maybe it has and we don't know it.

#+begin_quote
  And is there a drug lord somewhere dealing in a highly addictive narcotic only known as "vampire spit"?
#+end_quote

No doubt, and the DEA probably thinks it's the worst street name since bath salts. If only they knew...

#+begin_quote
  Does this mean that if you have a vampire, and continually cut off his arm, you can start converting the atmosphere of (say) a sealed room into vampire arms?
#+end_quote

Why the heck not?

#+begin_quote
  How soon would this start causing a problem if you did it on the International Space Station?
#+end_quote

Hell yes!

#+begin_quote
  Actually, could a vampire on the Space Station deliberately use this in order to asphyxiate the entire human crew?
#+end_quote

Yep, but I think once a vampire gets onto the ISS, waiting weeks for arms to grow back without being detected is probably a bit of a hassle - better off just killing them the old fashioned way.

That said, if you really want to assassinate the astronauts and making Challenger/Columbia happen a third time isn't doing it for you, sneak a little sliver of vampire heart into a tool box somewhere.

Then again - oxygen isn't a very abundant in the body - oh wait no, I was wrong, it is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body][most abundant element in the body by mass]] and the second most by atomic percent. Ohh, because the body's mostly water. Silly me!

Damnit, I was about to say that because of the high amount of hydrogen, the ISS would do well to have a tiny piece of vampire heart in a tiny vacuum chamber for "in case of hydrogen gas leak break glass". I was also going to propose it as an alternative CO2 scrubber, but it would just remove CO2 from the air and the oxygen would be lost because the ratio of C to O in the body is 1:2. How annoying, but still, it remains potentially useful.
