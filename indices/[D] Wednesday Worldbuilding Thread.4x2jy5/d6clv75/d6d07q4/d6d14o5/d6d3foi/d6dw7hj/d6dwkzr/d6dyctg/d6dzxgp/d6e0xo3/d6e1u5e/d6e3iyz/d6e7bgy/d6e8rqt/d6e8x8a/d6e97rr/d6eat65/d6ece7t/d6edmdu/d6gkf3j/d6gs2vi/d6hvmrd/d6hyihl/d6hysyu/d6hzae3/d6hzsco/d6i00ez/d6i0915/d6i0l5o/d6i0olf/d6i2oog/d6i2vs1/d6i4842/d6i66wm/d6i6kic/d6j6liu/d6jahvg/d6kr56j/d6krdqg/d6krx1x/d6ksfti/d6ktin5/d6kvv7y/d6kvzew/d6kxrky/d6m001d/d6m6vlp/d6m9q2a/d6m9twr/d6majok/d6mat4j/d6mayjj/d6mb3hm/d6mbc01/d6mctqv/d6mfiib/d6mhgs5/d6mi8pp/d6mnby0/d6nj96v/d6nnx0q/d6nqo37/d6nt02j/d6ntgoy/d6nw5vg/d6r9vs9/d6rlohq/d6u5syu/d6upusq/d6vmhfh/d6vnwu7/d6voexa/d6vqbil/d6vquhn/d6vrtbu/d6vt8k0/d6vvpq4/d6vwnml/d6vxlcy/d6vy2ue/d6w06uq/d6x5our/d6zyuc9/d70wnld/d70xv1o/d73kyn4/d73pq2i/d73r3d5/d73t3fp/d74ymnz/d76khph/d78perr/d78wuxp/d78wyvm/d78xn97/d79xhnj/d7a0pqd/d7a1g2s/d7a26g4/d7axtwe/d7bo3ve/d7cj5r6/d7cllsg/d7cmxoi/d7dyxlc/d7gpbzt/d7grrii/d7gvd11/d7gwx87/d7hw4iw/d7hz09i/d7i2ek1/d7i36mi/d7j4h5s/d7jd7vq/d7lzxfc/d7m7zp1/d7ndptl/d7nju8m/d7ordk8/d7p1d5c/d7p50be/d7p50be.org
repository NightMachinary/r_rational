  Or maybe he does know what's up. And it's clear, it's obvious.
#+end_quote

After all, what self-respecting old vampire /doesn't/ have a vombie in reserve? Surely William told Red (his baby vampire protege) about this?

#+begin_quote
  And while he's busy trying to put a pile of stuff back /into/ a completely different closet on the far end of the room, Red opens the Vombie coffin, and a hungry Vombie instantly bursts out...
#+end_quote

We're in [[/r/rational]] so I'm a bit loath to suggest a vampire would have put a vombie in a coffin without a stake through the heart to immobilise it - it seems to be prudent and with no downside, though I guess wanting to have a fascimile of yourself at short notice means that de-staking might be too time consuming in an emergency??

#+begin_quote
  I'd suggest making it some kind of active radar instead of passive vision.
#+end_quote

Yes. Fits as well thematically: a gargoyle looks like a bat, after all.

  - Things inside normal 3D space just look like part of the same infinite flat sheet to his 4D sight. So he can't tell you what's inside the next room without opening the door, unless something in there is 4D.
#+end_quote

I don't understand what you mean like this. Are you saying he can't see through walls?

    And, how does a creature the weight of a giraffe fly
  #+end_quote

  I'd rather go with sufficiently advanced Atlantean technology
#+end_quote

Yep, because I'm sure there's all manner of other creatures in mythology that fly, many of which that probably don't have wings at all. Better not to limit oneself when it comes to ordinary fantasy abilities.

#+begin_quote
  It's important to be sure which is which - if it's just polite, then he can drop it in an emergency (which is probably when you most want to show the reader what he is actually doing). So I'd probably go with geometric requirement, myself. But either could work.
#+end_quote

We'll see if it ever comes up. I'm beginning to get quite enthusiastic about trying to write this up for amazon self publishing, but in reality it'd probably be a slightly better Twilight; occult romance. However it's all GLBT/feminist as far as themes go, so maybe it's not so derivative...

I can see it now; three guys dressed as clowns, with a huge bunch of balloons. Maybe not as stealthy as they'd have hoped though...

    [excerpt]
  #+end_quote

  I am definitely seeing the possibility of Red opening the vombie coffin while the gargoyle is busy trying to repack something on the other side of the room.

  And then getting a lecture (once the dust has settled) about Not Opening Vombie Coffins.
#+end_quote

Yep. Containing the Vombie would be /so annoying/ for William, who had to stop writing one of his pages, and he has to start it all over again because the person he offended would be able to tell he didn't do the whole page in a single masterful stroke, and now, that won't do, will it?
