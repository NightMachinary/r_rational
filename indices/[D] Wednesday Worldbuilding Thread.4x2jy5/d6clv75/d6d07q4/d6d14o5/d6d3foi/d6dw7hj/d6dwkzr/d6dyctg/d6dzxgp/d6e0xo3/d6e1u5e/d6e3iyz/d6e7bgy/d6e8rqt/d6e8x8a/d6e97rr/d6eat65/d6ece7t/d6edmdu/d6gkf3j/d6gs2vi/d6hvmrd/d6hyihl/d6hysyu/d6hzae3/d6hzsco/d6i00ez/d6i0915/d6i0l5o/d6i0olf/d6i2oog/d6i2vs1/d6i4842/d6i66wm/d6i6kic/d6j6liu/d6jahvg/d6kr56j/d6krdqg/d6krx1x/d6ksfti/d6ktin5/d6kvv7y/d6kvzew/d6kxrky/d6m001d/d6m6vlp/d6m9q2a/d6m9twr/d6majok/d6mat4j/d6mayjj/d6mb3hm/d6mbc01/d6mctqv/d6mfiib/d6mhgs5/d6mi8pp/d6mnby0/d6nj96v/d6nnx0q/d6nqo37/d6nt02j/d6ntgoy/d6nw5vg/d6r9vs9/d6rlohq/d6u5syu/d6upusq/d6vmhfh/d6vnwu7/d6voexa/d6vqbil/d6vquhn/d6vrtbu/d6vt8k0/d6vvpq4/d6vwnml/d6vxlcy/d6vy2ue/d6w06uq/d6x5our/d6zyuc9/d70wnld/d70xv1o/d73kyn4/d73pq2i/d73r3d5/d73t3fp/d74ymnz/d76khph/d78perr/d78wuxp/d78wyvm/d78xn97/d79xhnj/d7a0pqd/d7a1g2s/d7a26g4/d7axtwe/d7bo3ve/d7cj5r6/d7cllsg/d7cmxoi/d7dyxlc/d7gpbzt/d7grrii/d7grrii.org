Wow. This is the first time anyone's ever bought malaria nets on my behalf.

I think it's a great idea!

I've also read Flatterland. It's a great book. (I particularly liked the negatively-curved 'Platterland' section).

So. On to the 4D vampires. Most of your bullet points are either perfectly logical extensions of the idea, or straightforward simplifications that make it easier to deal with. On a couple, though, I have a few further comments:

  However, things like wings and tails can suddenly appear as free-floating spheres and then slowly become thicker and thicker until they "join" to the main body, which is just freaky cool: [[http://imgur.com/a/cxCD9]]
#+end_quote

It is!

But now imagine your gargoyle, in human form, is trapped in - say, a broom closet. A room just big enough to hold his human form and not big enough for the full thing. He starts to shift, and his tail appears as an apparently disconnected sphere /outside/ the room. It extends towards the door, and... what happens when it hits?

The actual force does not come from the part of the tail in out 3D universe. It comes from the part of the tail trying to push /into/ our universe, trying to displace the door. So the direction of the force is from somewhere outside the normal three dimensions - it's trying to push the door in the opposite direction, i.e. to shove it outside the universe, in a way that the door, being a non-magical substance, cannot move.

(Of course, there's a whole range of possible doors to consider here - from flimsy wooden ones to thick steel safe doors...)

  vampires and werewolves, being human-based, lack intuition for the 4-dimensional world. Their bat, wolf and human eyes just do not see through the 4th dimension; after all, there are no photons there.
#+end_quote

Sensible. But just because they can's /see/ doesn't mean they can't /act/. A vampire (bat form) could still try to use his human form to punch the human form of another vampire (bat form), even if he has to guess exactly where to aim his punches. (This /does/ mean that he could get confused by a genuine bat that just looks like a bat-form vampire for some reason).

  The gargoyle has three forms: stone gargoyle at one end, gargoyle in the center, and human at the other end. /During the day, because of plot at the moment, but probably for a legitimate reason when I think of one/, the stone form is in our world with the other two forms "up" in the fourth dimension. Possibly it's where he goes to take a break, possibly it's how he actually 'eats', possibly his stone form has the most heightened senses for his guard duties, who knows???
#+end_quote

Hmmmmm. He's sounding a lot like some form of artificial life to me. A robot made by hyper-advanced technology. Which means that the same hyper-advanced technology might have inserted any number of forced behavioural routines (think Asimov's three laws of robotics - not the /same/ laws, of course, but something along those lines).

This leads to a few options:

- Perhaps he was intended specifically as a vampire killer. Since vampires are killed by sunlight and active at night, he only needs to be active at night.

- Perhaps he is (partially) solar powered, and his stone form is covered in hyper-advanced solar cells; he's programmed to return to it every day in order to remain powered up.

Even in stone form, he can still seriously inconvenience passing vampires - if his (human, currently extra-dimensional) form grabs the bat form of a passing human-form vampire, then what can the vampire do? He can't see what's got him, he can't walk away, he can't change shape, and ooooh, how long until the sunlight coming in through that window gets here...

  "Yes, our saliva contains something very valuable to humans. It's called albuterol."

  "Albuterol... isn't that the asthma drug that can be used as a steroid when it's injected?"

  "How do you think you humans discovered it?"
#+end_quote

Ha! And it makes sense for vampire spit to include some sort of stimulant, to hide the fact that the subject has been weakened by loss of blood...

#+begin_quote
  I don't see why not. Seems like a pretty safe source.
#+end_quote

Right up until some idiot DEA cop breaks into the basement, thinks they're humans, and starts cutting them loose...

  Oh no, you have just a tiny sliver of heart. It'll slowly regenerate, but once it's about the size of an orange you take another sliver, put it in a vacuum box, and throw the rest out of the airlock. Of course, a few hundred years from now, that 'space junk' might find its way in the aerated cargo hold of a space-ship, and, well, that would be quite the horror movie plot once it comes of age, isn't it?
#+end_quote

Nah, that "space junk" will get a full dose of sunlight in a couple of hours. (Actually, instead of throwing it out the airlock, you can save a lot of energy by just holding the bit you want to get rid of up in front of a sun-facing window...)

Also, I must admit, I was thinking faster regeneration.
