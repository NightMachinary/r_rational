I thought there were already enough reasons to make jannisaries over thralls, the latter are more reliable but require more personal attention. Jannisaries are better contacts, while thralls make a great entourage. You'll probably have to play with the specifics of the addiction until you get something that will hook the kind of people that you want vampires to have. That will definitely effect what kind of story you're telling.

Currently, the only way I can think of to reach powerful people would be to have vampire prostitutes get to them and the addiction would just be strong enough to entrap most people, but that may not make for the kind of story you want. If jannisaries are influential, then vamps would also be protective of them to prevent their loyalties from switching. I've come to the realization that controlling people through a drug addiction is rather counterintuitive.
