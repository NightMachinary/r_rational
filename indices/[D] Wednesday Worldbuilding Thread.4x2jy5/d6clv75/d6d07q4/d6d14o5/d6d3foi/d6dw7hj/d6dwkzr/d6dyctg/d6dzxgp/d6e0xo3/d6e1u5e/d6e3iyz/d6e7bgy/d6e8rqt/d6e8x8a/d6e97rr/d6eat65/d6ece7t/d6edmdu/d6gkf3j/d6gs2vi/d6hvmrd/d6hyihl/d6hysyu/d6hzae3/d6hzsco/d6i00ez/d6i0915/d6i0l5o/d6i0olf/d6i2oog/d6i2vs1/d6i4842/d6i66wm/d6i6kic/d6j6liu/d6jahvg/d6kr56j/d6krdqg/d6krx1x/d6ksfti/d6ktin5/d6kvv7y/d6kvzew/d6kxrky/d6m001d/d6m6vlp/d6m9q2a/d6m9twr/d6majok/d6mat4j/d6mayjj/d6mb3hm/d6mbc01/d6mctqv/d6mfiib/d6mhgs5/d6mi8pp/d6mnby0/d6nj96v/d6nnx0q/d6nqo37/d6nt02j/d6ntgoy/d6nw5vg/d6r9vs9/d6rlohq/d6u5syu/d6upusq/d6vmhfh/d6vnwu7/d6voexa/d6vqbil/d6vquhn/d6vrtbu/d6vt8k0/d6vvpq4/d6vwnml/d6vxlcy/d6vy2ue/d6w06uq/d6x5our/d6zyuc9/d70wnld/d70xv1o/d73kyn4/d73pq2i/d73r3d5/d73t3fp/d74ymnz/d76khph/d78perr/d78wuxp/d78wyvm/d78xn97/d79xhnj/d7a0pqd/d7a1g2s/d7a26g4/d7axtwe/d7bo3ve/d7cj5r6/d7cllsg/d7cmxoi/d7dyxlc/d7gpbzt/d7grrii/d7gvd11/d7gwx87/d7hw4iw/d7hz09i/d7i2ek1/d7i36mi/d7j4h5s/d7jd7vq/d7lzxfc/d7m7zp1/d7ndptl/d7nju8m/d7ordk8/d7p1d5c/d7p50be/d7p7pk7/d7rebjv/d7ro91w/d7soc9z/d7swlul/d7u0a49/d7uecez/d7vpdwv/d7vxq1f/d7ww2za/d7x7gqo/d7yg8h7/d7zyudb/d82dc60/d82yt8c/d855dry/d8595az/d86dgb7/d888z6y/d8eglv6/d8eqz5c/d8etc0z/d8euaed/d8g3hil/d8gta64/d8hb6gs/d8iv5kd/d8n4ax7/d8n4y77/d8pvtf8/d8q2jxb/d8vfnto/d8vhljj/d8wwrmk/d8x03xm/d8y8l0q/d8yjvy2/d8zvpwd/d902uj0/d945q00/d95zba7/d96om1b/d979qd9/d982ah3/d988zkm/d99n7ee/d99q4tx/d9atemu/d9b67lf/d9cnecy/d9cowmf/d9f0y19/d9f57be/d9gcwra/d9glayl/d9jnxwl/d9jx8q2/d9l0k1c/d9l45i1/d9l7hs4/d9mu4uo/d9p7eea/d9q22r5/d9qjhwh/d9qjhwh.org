    The "bad guy" aliens in Stargate: SG-1 were known for being theatrical rather than practical.

  Ah, I see. They weren't trying to stop an enemy, they were trying to create an engaging and challenging war game in which only unimportant servant races were at risk of death or injury.

  Fair enough. That does rather change the design specifications necessary.
#+end_quote

Yeah, though they did use the same sorts of weapons against, well, Earth, and the other Even More Powerful Races they warred with. Then again, they didn't invent any of the stuff they used, so they were probably limited in what they could scavenge.

  It probably /could/ communicate in infrared like that - but who's going to be watching?

  Communicating does nothing if no-one's listening.
#+end_quote

Who knows. Use SETI? Could it make its infrared signal look like it's coming from a star and get them to download a virus? All speculative. But probably best not to underestimate unfriendly AI. Friendship is Optimal and all that.

  At the time that the Constitution was written, the big fish was that everyone (above a certain age) was suddenly getting to vote. (This was a /very/ big fish, because something like 60% of adults had previously been barred from voting, split along racial lines). Racism has never really gone away, and remains an issue... though things are /significantly/ better than they used to be, there are still problems.
#+end_quote

It's really amazing that racism can be so systemic in a place where the minorities are not actually in the minority... Though I guess it's not like that 60% was entirely one ethnic group, and it seems like all the groups probably were not big fans each other, so it's not a unified 60%.

Australia's indigenous population is a 3% demographic, so it "makes sense" that they've "got no chance". 4% Chinese, 2% Indian, 1% Fillipino, 1% Vietnamese - you basically end up with about 90% white.

  And then, of course, the idea of the President getting rather involved on the wrong end of a number of corruption scandals is another big issue.

Hey, our former Prime Minister [[http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-shocks-as-he-eats-a-raw-onion-whole-20150313-143syz.html][was involved in a scandal]] during his time in office too??

    I'm imagining the post in [[/r/unresolvedmysteries]] now: "Over the course of two years, everyone who posted on a paranormal forum and their families has been killed. Coincidence or conspiracy?"
  #+end_quote

  If it gets that far, then (due to a little something called the Streisand Effect) the contents of said forum will probably spread faster than the jannissary can keep up with...

What a great way for vampires to come out of the coffin.

"Yeah, so, a rogue vampire was acting alone - well, with his slaves - and has killed people who were looking into our weaknesses. As a show of good faith here is a publication of all our weaknesses. Please note that our political system works differently to yours, and fights to the death are not uncommon. Moreso, they're already dead so killing us isn't a crime. Anyway, the guy who ordered all that cold-blooded murder, this is where he's holed up, how about some people take care of that for us. I've got lots of allies all throughout the world who are thrilled that we finally have an opportunity to step out of the shadows and live in harmony with humanity."

... that's not going to end well.
