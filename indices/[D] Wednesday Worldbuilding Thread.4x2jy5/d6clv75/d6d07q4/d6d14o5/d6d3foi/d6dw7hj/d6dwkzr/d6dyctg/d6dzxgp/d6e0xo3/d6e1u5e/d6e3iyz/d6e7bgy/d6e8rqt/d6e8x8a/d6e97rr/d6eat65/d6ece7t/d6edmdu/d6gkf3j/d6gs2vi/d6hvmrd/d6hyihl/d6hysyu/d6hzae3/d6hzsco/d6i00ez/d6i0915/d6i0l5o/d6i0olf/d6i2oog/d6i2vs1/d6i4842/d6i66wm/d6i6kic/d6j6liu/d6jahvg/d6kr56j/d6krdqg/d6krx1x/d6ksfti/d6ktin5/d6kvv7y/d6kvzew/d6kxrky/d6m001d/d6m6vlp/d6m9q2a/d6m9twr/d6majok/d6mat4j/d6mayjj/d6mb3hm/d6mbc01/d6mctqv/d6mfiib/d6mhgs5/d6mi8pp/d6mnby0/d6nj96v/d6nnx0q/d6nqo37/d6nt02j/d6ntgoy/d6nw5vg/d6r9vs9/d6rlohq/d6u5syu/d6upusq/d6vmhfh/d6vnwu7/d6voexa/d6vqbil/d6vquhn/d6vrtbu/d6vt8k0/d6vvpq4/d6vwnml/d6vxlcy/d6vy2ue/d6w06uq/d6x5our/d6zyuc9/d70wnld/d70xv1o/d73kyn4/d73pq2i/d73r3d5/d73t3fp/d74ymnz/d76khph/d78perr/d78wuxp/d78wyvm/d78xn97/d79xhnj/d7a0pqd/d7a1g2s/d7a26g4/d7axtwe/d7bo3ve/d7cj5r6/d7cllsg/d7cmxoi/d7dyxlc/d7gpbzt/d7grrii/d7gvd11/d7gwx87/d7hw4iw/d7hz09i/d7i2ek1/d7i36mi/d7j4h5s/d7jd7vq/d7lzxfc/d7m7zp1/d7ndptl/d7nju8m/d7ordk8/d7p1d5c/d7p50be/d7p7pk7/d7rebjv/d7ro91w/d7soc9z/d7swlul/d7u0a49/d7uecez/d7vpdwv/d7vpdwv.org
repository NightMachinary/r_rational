  Eh, you can wring quite a lot of plot out of that, if he has main-character focus. For example, consider; he has to prevent harm to William. Does this include emotional harm? If so, is he required to extend a (lesser) degree of protection to William's friends, allies, and protege? And how do his internal subroutines identify William - is he constrained to prevent all harm that would be done to William's vombie?
#+end_quote

Those are all interesting questions to toy with! Emotional harm: probably, but only extreme emotional harm, so he wouldn't be full of white lies (probably total unyielding honesty would be one of his requirements, anyway), so yes, he would have to protect William's allies if reasonable. He wouldn't be required to prevent harm to the vombie; or maybe he is by default, but he would have been given specific instructions to keep the vombie alive but not allow it to harm anyone William wouldn't want to harm.

He's also compelled to obey William's orders. Presumably some sort of Asimovian three laws type scenario is happening in the background, only he's sentient so has the ability to choose to prioritise the third law over a weak second law command, just like in /Runaround/. Of course, no explicit three laws type doctrine is actually there, just it's a good way of thinking about this.

(Sorry I forgot to reply to this section before btw!)

  Ignore narrative structure, tell your story.
#+end_quote

I worry about that. I don't enjoy reading our logs if we gloss over things that I consider would be necessary to include to establish later scenes - then again, I suppose that would come under "tell your story", since "ignore narrative structure" does not mean "throw everything to the wind and just do a highlight reel".

Added to that there's no "one story", things start and stop and run parallel to each other and it ends up looking kind of like /Sense8/ in that you have multiple narratives happening independently of each other but also sometimes dependently. Characters who are protaganists in some plots are antagonists in others (which is great for having a well-developed, rational antagonist). I suppose part of the process is to select a narrative to choose, stick to it, and then write subsequent narratives as new "books" rather than try to make /The Lord of The Rings/ on the first try.

#+begin_quote
  Make sure to follow the rule of "show, don't tell" as much as is reasonable. /Never/ outright describe how the magic works - rather have a behind-the-scenes set of rules and just apply them as necessary.
#+end_quote

This is something we're pretty bad at (why last night we did a whole, very explicit explanation of vombies - but the proteg√© asked and William was not going to lie about it - though this stuff can always happen off-screen if it doesn't directly help the narrative).

#+begin_quote
  Always remember that what's dead obvious to you is not dead obvious to the reader. Unless you mention something /explicitly/, you don't need to go to much effort to hide it.
#+end_quote

I have GMed enough RPGs that my advice to new GMs who are like "how do I put hints in my game" are "make it so obvious that you think you are treating them like children, and then make it still more obvious again. They'll still not get it". I will make sure to apply that logic to exposition, because I do enjoy the idea of having a complex, self-consistent, seemingly random system of transformation and magic that can in princple be "figured out".

    in a "real" novel you can't really just say "THREE MONTHS LATER" and skip to the action.
  #+end_quote

  Yes you can. I've seen novels that say "SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS LATER". (Isaac Asimov's "The Last Question", is a perfect, albeit extreme, example).
#+end_quote

Point taken. I wonder how many time skips you can get away with? I suppose we'll see.

#+begin_quote
  And yeah, hiring an editor is probably worth the trouble.
#+end_quote

Or, the poor man's version: finding a community willing to help out. If only the story would be appropriate for [[/r/rational]]. Unfortunately the rational elements would be minor, so I'd probably be better off posting in another subreddit if I wanted feedback.

#+begin_quote
  Have you considered writing this as a Nanowrimo novel?
#+end_quote

Pretty much every year. Unfortunately November is a bad month for me, if Nanowrimo were January or February it might have already happened.

#+begin_quote
  Which means that is the wizard fires off 200 force bolts, he falls over dead.
#+end_quote

I don't think so, I think the body would start catabolising fat and muscle to create more glucose; then again, the glycogen in your heart or diaphragm muscles gets used up by the force bolts? Very bad. A talented magician would probably not allow it to get to this point.

Then again, the character with premonitions who sometimes gets nosebleeds that are related to them? Probably related to his complete lack of control over his magic.

    (Of course it depends how 'easy' it is for magic to 'uncurl' the Calabi-Yau manifold stuff...)
  #+end_quote

  Yeeeeeeah.... that's going to be tricky. I have absolutely no idea how much energy that would even theoretically take.
#+end_quote

The husband's been using his physics knowledge more than his extradimensional mathematics for this stuff, I'll try and have a proper talk with him about it when I get a chance. I'm sure he'll have some idea.

#+begin_quote
  a more skilled mage will get the same effect with less effort
#+end_quote

Yep, exactly!

#+begin_quote
  [using his radar only intermittently makes sense], but he /does/ need to be able to sense unexpected nearby vampires, so some sort of untwist-detecting sense will be extremely useful.
#+end_quote

Yeah, we can probably handwave that in; no reason that can't be a passive sense of his

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    I pouted and asked why we couldn't just have ether that the 4D-photons travel through, but apparently that's anathema to the whole thing, so.....
  #+end_quote

  Ah. I'm guessing that's because the ether doesn't exist before the dimensions unwind, and actually creating enough matter to fill up that 4D space will take significantly more energy than even the gargoyle's 4D body can store. (The radar sense needs to be able to 'see' using some means that doesn't require matter - much like light doesn't require matter, so some sort of 4D light analogue).
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's pretty much it.

Though I'm wondering if we go down the Calabi-Yau manifolds if it's not going to look very, very silly in 50 years when we discover SuperPhysics: Physics 3.0 - but vintage sci-fi is always like that, so whatever.
