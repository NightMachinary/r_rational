  Yeah, though they did use the same sorts of weapons against, well, Earth, and the other Even More Powerful Races they warred with. Then again, they didn't invent any of the stuff they used, so they were probably limited in what they could scavenge.

...did these other Even More Powerful Races invent their own weapons?

  Who knows. Use SETI? Could it make its infrared signal look like it's coming from a star and get them to download a virus? All speculative. But probably best not to underestimate unfriendly AI. Friendship is Optimal and all that.
#+end_quote

Huh. That's... huh.

It seems implausible, but I can see the risk - it could send out itself as data, and just hope that someone, /anyone/ picks it up and runs it to see what it is. Straight out of the box, no intermediate virus stage necessary...

  It's really amazing that racism can be so systemic in a place where the minorities are not actually in the minority... Though I guess it's not like that 60% was entirely one ethnic group, and it seems like all the groups probably were not big fans each other, so it's not a unified 60%.
#+end_quote

Any disunity in that 60% was more than capable of realising that their own differences were minor in comparison.

Yeah, there was definitely an imbalance there. The underclass had numbers on their side; but the overclass had resources and the ability to do quite a lot of bullying within the law (largely because they /made/ the laws).

And, on top of all this, the entire country was under international sanctions over several years because of said policies (not that that did all that much to stop us, we had - and still have - a /lot/ of natural resources. One of the few things we don't have is oil, which is what led to Sasol developing a way to make oil out of coal (we /do/ have coal)...

  Australia's indigenous population is a 3% demographic, so it "makes sense" that they've "got no chance". 4% Chinese, 2% Indian, 1% Fillipino, 1% Vietnamese - you basically end up with about 90% white.

...I see what you mean, yes.

  Hey, our former Prime Minister was involved in a scandal during his time in office too??

Your politicians have tame scandals.

...want to swap?

  What a great way for vampires to come out of the coffin.

  "Yeah, so, a rogue vampire was acting alone - well, with his slaves - and has killed people who were looking into our weaknesses. As a show of good faith here is a publication of all our weaknesses. Please note that our political system works differently to yours, and fights to the death are not uncommon. Moreso, they're already dead so killing us isn't a crime. Anyway, the guy who ordered all that cold-blooded murder, this is where he's holed up, how about some people take care of that for us. I've got lots of allies all throughout the world who are thrilled that we finally have an opportunity to step out of the shadows and live in harmony with humanity."

  ... that's not going to end well.

...vampire war with Humanity taking sides?

"they're"? "us"? ...looks like he's not sure whether or not he's a vampire.

[[/twipoker][]] Ohhhhhhhhhh. So, it's not so much a matter of whether or not you should be looking up ancient Catholicism, it's a matter of whether or not you should be waiting until the evening before looking up ancient Catholicism.
