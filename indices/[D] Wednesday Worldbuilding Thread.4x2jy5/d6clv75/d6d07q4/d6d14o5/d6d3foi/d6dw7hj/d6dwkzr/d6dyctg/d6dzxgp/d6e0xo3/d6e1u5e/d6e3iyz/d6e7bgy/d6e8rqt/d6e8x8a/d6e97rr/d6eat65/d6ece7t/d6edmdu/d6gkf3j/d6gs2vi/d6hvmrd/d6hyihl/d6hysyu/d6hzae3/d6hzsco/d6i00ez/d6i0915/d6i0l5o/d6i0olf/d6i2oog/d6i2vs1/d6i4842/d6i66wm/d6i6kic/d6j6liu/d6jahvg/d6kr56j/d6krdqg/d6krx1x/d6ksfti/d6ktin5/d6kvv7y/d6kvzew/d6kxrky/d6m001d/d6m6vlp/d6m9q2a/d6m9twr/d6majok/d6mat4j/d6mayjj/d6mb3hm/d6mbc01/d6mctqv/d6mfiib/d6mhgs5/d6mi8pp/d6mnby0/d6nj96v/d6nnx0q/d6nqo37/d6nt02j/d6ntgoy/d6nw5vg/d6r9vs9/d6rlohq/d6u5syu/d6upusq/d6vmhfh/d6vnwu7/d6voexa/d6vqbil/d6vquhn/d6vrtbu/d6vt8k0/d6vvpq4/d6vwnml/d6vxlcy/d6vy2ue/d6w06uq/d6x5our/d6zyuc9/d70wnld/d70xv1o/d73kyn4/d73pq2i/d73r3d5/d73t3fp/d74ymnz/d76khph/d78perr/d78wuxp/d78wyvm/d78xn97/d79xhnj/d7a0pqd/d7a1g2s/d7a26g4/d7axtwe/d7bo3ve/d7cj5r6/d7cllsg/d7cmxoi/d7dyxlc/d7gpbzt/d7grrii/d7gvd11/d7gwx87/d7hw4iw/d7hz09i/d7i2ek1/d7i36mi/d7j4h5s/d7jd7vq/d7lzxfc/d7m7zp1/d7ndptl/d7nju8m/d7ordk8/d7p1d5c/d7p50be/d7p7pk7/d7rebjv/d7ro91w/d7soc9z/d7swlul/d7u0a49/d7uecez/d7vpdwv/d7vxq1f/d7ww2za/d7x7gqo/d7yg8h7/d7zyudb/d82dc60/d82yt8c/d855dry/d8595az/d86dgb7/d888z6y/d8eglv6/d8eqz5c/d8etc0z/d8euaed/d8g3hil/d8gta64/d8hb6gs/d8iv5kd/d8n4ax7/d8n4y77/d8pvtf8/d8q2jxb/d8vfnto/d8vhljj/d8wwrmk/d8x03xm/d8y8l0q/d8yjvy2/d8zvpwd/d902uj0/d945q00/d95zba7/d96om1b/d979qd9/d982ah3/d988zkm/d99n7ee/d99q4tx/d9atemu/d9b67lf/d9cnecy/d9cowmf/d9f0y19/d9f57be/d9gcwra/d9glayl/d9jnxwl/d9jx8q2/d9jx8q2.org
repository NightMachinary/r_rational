  Yeah, Tim would not shoot himself in those situations. You basically can't Control someone to do something that would kill them.
#+end_quote

/Knowingly/. Vern the Vampire can presumably Control Tim to drink the liquid in this glass, which is totally not a super-acidic poison, honest.

#+begin_quote
  I had a thought though - I said Control doesn't work unless you've got eye contact. I can see that the Vampire would need to look into the victim's eyes (to.... aim the Control beam?), but they can still see the eyes regardless.

  It looks like the pupil is literally a hole through to the retina, so I /guess/ you could say that Control works through pupil-to-pupil line of sight, and it would make sense that way. But the cornea sits in front of the pupil so it's not like an /actual/ hole.
#+end_quote

And even then, it's only a hole to the retina. The retina doesn't (usually) control the brain.

  Medusa's /hair/ is made of snakes. Snakes have eyes. Maybe Medusa can see via the snakes? Or if they have no neural connection and are just like symbionts, the snakes could probably bite Perseus - at least if Medusa maneuvered to allow this. Might be interesting.
#+end_quote

Perseus could have worn thick, perhaps armoured gloves. Could the snakes look at Medusa's reflection without turning to stone?

...either way, their hissing would kind of clue Perseus in as to the location of the head to which they were attached. (Snakes don't always hiss, but they certainly do when they're agitated, and I imagine that a guy wandering around with a sword trying to cut Medusa's head off would be rather agitating).

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. I found out that apparently "aboriginals live longer and have better child mortality than they would 'in the wild'" is actually a way terrible people try and justify colonialism, so, that's kind of horrific on another level.
#+end_quote

"Hey, look, this course of action led to this /one good thing!/ Let's ignore all the bad things that came with it!"

#+begin_quote
  Australia has some goals for indigenous welfare, but they're not being met (and some things have even got worse since they were set as goals!). It's kind of infuriating.
#+end_quote

Have you tried electing a representative of the indigenous people as President? (It looks good on paper, but make very sure you choose the /right/ one).

#+begin_quote
  And then you meet people who are actually, legitimately, full-on racist and /aren't shy about admitting it to you when you are talking about how terrible racists are/. It's like... how???
#+end_quote

You get some people here who try to claim with a straight face that only white people can be racists.

This gives me the same sort of reaction.

#+begin_quote
  I think "done properly" you can have a first generation of lots of good and no bad. You know, fairytale version: we land in Botany Bay, we share our food with the aboriginies, show them how to use guns to hunt kangaroo, give them medicine for TB, and so on, society comes together from a meeting of equals and both cultures are maintained.
#+end_quote

That's the ideal. I'm not sure how it'll work in reality.

I don't know how Australia worked, but I do know that when the colonists first landed in South Africa, they weren't exactly landing in a peaceful, enlightened civilisation where no-one is at war. Had they decided to simply give the Zulus guns, then the Zulus would almost certainly have turned them on the Xhosas - and vice versa, of course. (Oh, sure, they'd be used for hunting a bit as well, but what better time to kill those guys over there and take their cattle?)

So... still loads of Bad, just different Bad.

#+begin_quote
  So jealous. I've heard TV shows have characters breaking in between 4 languages in the same conversation.
#+end_quote

They put subtitles on those. (Also, try to watch District Nine).

#+begin_quote
  It's on the CEFR, which is probably the "best" way to describe "how well you speak" language X that I've seen (though I haven't looked especially hard).
#+end_quote

...then I think I can put my Afrikaans at about B2 level.

#+begin_quote
  What elections? He's the /rightful king/.
#+end_quote

...you said he'd never lose another election...

#+begin_quote
  Once vampires reveal themselves, vampire hunters are going to become ubiquitous anyway since it's a cultural touchstone.
#+end_quote

Maybe they just want to first kill off the guys who actually know what they are doing, and make sure that that knowledge is very properly and extremely thoroughly lost?

...they (think that they) can easily handle a bunch of wannabes with no idea what they're getting themselves into.

#+begin_quote
  Pope Benedict XVI would like a word with you, and there's a long and colourful history of papal resignations.
#+end_quote

Oh. Ooooops.

#+begin_quote
  A cardinal does sound a lot more exciting, though, and you could see someone from circa 600 getting more and more annoyed as the church moves away from whatever it was meant to be. Soon they might stop teaching transubstantiation and then where would Catholicism be??
#+end_quote

...he would /not/ have liked the Second Vatican Council.
