  Probably... I assume he'd pick clothing that doesn't stay 'stuck' on his gargoyle form in the way described above, because e.g. the rim of his pant leg could catch on something when he's flying.
#+end_quote

So things that would be tight on gargoyle form. (That's probably most clothing).

  These would be rare and expensive and only for formal occaisions because can you imagine the dry cleaning bills, especially when you're around blood????
#+end_quote

Not only that, your dry cleaner needs to be able to handle four dimensions as well (so that they can handle that stain sitting just outside the 3D universe). Which implies that either he does his own dry-cleaning, or (more likely) there is exactly /one/ native 4D drycleaner in the Demon World, who charges whatever he wants because he has /absolutely/ no competition.

    It's the same hand, it's just a lot more complex in shape than a human hand.
  #+end_quote

  Is it really?
#+end_quote

...is this really anything more than semantics?

When I poke my finger into Flatland, the Flatland natives see only a slice of it. They call that slice my finger, but it is not - it is a /slice/ of my finger.

When we see the gargoyle's hand, we're only seeing a /slice/ of the real thing, which we call his hand. Whether he calls the whole 4D organ a 'hand' or a - I don't know - 'meta-hand' or something else, it's still the same thing.

  I even like the idea of letting her be at oblique angles. Can you imagine a human, but at a slight 4D angle, so the proportions seem off somehow, but you can't quite put your finger on it?
#+end_quote

...yes, I can. You can check up on the math with your resident expert; but the result should be (assuming she remains "flat", just at a constant angle) a human shape which is stretched out in some arbitrary direction.

Let's say, for sake of example, that she's stretched out vertically. You can find her new height with the good old Pythagorean theorem; her untilted height (let's say two metres) is one of the legs of the triangle, the distance that the head that should correspond with {the feet that are in the 3D universe} is from the 3D universe is the other leg of the triangle (um... a few nanometres). Take the squares of both of these, add them together, and take the square root to find her stretched height...

I am seeing a distinct disadvantage here to having the shifters all only a few nanometres thick. The height distortion caused be her not being flat on the 3D universe seems to be limited to "too small to see".

(The /shape/ distortion, on the other hand - if her feet are "black female" and her head is "white male", then the body between will presumably gradually fade from the one to the other, getting slowly paler with height. With a very little amount of effort, she can presumably use this to mix-and-match parts from various shapes, so you could get a human with half a phoenix wing (disconnected, several centimetres from her back) and three-quarters of a lion's leg or something like that quite easily)

I thought up a (brief) scene while thinking about this character...

"How small can you get?"

"Um, give me a moment..." /shrinks down to a single eyeball, which drops to the ground/ "How's that?"

"Great! Now -"

"Just a moment, I can't keep my balance like this. Here -" /three more disconnected eyeballs appear, the four forming the points of a tetrahedron a metre on each side/ "- much better."

"Um. I was going to try to hide you in my pocket, but I don't have pockets that far apart..."
