Ok, reading more!

Discord: Misspelled je ne sais quoi, but it doesn't mean anything in French. Typo or clue?? The flower means she's almost ready to meet Pinkie

Weird prediction: turns out twilight is paradox. I have no just for it, but I am anticipating a twist, so....

dIsCoRd: Couldn't see anything hinty here.

The Cutie Mark Crusaders: Evidence paradox could be twilight emerges. Closed the loop with Pinkie.

The Nightmare Confrontation: Something is about to go down but I'm not sure what exactly.

The Celestia Confrontation: This chapter seems superfluous so I'm sure I missed something important in it.

Pre Paradox Explained: Well, I haven't read the chapter yet and as you can see I've got no clue about the twist. I know that the doctor isn't paradox. I suspect it will be one of the three princesses, but only because it has to be someone featured in the story. I am not sure who would have the ostensible goal of killing twilight. The doctor may have been wrong or lying about the hoof polish being poison?

Paradox Explained: Huh, so he's a time loop creature. Cool!

Side Effects: Nice to have some closure. Discord is a cool character.
