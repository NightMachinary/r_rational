Hmmmm. Alright, let's briefly consider magic. Using it offers considerable advantages to the user; we can therefore expect that those with better access to magic will, on average, have more descendants than those that do not. Even at the "small quirk" or "above average" level, that's enough to produce a slight evolutionary pressure in the direction of being more magical.

This would imply that a number of animals would evolve magical abilities (mostly at the "small quirk" or "above average" level). We're not talking dragons here; more along the lines of supernaturally fast [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackalope][jackalopes]] or a large Himalayan ape with the ability to turn invisible.

Now, the "ancient war" idea relies on Atlantis having had some serious magic. Up to the point where comparing an Atlantean mage to a modern mage is like comparing Richard Feynman to Plato; they definitely fit in the same category, but one is an accomplished professional with a thorough education while the other is making a few steps in the direction of developing the beginnings of that education. I'm thinking Atlantis was probably ruled by a few families of magic users (or possibly even one family that had an internal feud at the end) - they somehow made magic their /exclusive/ property, tied to their family bloodline and not available to those not related to them. (This means that the "magic genes", so to speak, imply that one is descended from one of these Atlantean mage-kings). This leaves open the possibility of finding the occasional, very very rare, exceedingly powerful Atlantean magical artifact, which cannot be replicated without a thorough understanding of the magic that went into the artifact's creation... which doesn't come with instructions and may or may not have limited charges...
