  Can't help here, really sorry. That was my partner's addition and I have no head-canon for it. I'll ask her.

Hmmmm. Given that your demons are already covering all the cryptid niches, I'm going to guess "not too common". And what that means is that the Atlanteans didn't just /tame/ magic; they pretty much /created/ it from whole cloth. (If it had been around all along, a lot of animals would use it)

#+begin_quote
  Again, not really sure; I'd imagine the magic skillz are specific to the spirit doing the posession, the human body is just a vessel
#+end_quote

If the posessing spirit can access and delete its host's memories, then it can /definitely/ go unnoticed.

Now I'm thinking of a cult in tentative control of a spirit. New initiates are possessed by the spirit at a certain point, giving them access to a small set of magical abilities, which are left behind when the spirit leaves; perhaps to do with direct mental manipulation, mind control, memory alteration, that sort of thing. (If you're wondering how they maintain control of the spirit, note that this is a spirit that specialises in /mind control/ - they /think/ they have it imprisoned, but it thinks it is slowly building up an army of slaves for its own use...)

  Basically, a Somebody Else's Problem Field? Love it!

Basically, yes. And who says mind control is only for villain use?

#+begin_quote
  I don't think so; we have werewolves so that niche is filled.

Okie dokie lokie.

Fascinating. So there's an entire alternate world out there.

Right. Let's first consider these teleportation booths. Assume I step in a booth in the Shadow World, and step out of a booth here. Now I move this booth one kilometre to the north, and go back to the Shadow World. Do I go back to the same place, or do I turn up north of where I last was in the Shadow World?

The fact that the demons have easy access to magic has a /lot/ of implications for Atlantean society; first of all, it implies massive self-modification among the Atlantean ruling class.

Could the Shadow World be the far future (or past) of this world?
