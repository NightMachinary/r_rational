  New question. Vern the Vampire hands Tim a gun, tries to Control him to shoot himself. Does Tim do so?

  Using the gun-to-the-head analogy, I'd think he wouldn't, regardless of his willpower - he comes off no worse for refusing that command than for following it.
#+end_quote

Yeah, Tim would not shoot himself in those situations. You basically can't Control someone to do something that would kill them.

I had a thought though - I said Control doesn't work unless you've got eye contact. I can see that the Vampire would need to look into the victim's eyes (to.... aim the Control beam?), but they can still see the eyes regardless.

It looks like the pupil is literally a hole through to the retina, so I /guess/ you could say that Control works through pupil-to-pupil line of sight, and it would make sense that way. But the cornea sits in front of the pupil so it's not like an /actual/ hole.

  And Perseus, of course, shut his eyes too... which put them on an equal footing. Only Perseus was armed and knew how to use a sword, so Medusa had no chance...
#+end_quote

Medusa's /hair/ is made of snakes. Snakes have eyes. Maybe Medusa can see via the snakes? Or if they have no neural connection and are just like symbionts, the snakes could probably bite Perseus - at least if Medusa maneuvered to allow this. Might be interesting.

    Could.... could colonialism actually have improved the lives of the subjugated?
  #+end_quote

  [[/twiponder][]] It may well be that they're a good deal happier having full control over their lands than they would be living in a slum, I can believe that... but there must be some way of getting them the medical care (and electricity and stuff) without putting them in a slum.
#+end_quote

Yeah. I found out that apparently "aboriginals live longer and have better child mortality than they would 'in the wild'" is actually a way terrible people try and justify colonialism, so, that's kind of horrific on another level.

Australia has some goals for indigenous welfare, but they're not being met (and some things have even got worse since they were set as goals!). It's kind of infuriating. And then you meet people who are actually, legitimately, full-on racist and /aren't shy about admitting it to you when you are talking about how terrible racists are/. It's like... how???

  So.... it's iffy. There's good and bad, and for the first generation there's a /lot/ of bad and not all that much good... but several generations down the line, done properly, there could be a lot of good.
#+end_quote

I think "done properly" you can have a first generation of lots of good and no bad. You know, fairytale version: we land in Botany Bay, we share our food with the aboriginies, show them how to use guns to hunt kangaroo, give them medicine for TB, and so on, society comes together from a meeting of equals and both cultures are maintained.

  Most people here are bilingual (not always the same two languages). My Afrikaans isn't all that great, but I can speak it.
#+end_quote

So jealous. I've heard TV shows have characters breaking in between 4 languages in the same conversation.

  I'm not quite sure what you mean by B1/B2 level...
#+end_quote

It's on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages][CEFR]], which is probably the "best" way to describe "how well you speak" language X that I've seen (though I haven't looked especially hard).

  How would sword-fighting win him elections?
#+end_quote

What elections? He's the /rightful king/.

#+begin_quote
  ...this might actually be the explicit aim of some vampire politicians. Reveal themselves to the public eye, then rule the world. Of course, before they reveal themselves, they've just got to kill off this irritatingly persistent sect of vampire hunters...
#+end_quote

Once vampires reveal themselves, vampire hunters are going to become ubiquitous anyway since it's a cultural touchstone. I don't know if it was ever covered in /True Blood/, though they definitely covered sects forming to eliminate the vampires, so... probably?

  I'm pretty sure that a Pope remains a Pope as long as he's still alive.
#+end_quote

Pope Benedict XVI would like a word with you, and there's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_resignation#List_of_papal_resignations][long and colourful history]] of papal resignations.

  A vampire /cardinal/, on the other hand, is a lot more possible. But I don't see what he really changes insofar as the Vatican is concerned. All it means is that when all the cardinals meet, there's this one guy who'd been at every meeting for the last thousand years.
#+end_quote

A cardinal does sound a lot more exciting, though, and you could see someone from circa 600 getting more and more annoyed as the church moves away from whatever it was meant to be. Soon they might stop teaching /transubstantiation/ and then where would Catholicism be??
