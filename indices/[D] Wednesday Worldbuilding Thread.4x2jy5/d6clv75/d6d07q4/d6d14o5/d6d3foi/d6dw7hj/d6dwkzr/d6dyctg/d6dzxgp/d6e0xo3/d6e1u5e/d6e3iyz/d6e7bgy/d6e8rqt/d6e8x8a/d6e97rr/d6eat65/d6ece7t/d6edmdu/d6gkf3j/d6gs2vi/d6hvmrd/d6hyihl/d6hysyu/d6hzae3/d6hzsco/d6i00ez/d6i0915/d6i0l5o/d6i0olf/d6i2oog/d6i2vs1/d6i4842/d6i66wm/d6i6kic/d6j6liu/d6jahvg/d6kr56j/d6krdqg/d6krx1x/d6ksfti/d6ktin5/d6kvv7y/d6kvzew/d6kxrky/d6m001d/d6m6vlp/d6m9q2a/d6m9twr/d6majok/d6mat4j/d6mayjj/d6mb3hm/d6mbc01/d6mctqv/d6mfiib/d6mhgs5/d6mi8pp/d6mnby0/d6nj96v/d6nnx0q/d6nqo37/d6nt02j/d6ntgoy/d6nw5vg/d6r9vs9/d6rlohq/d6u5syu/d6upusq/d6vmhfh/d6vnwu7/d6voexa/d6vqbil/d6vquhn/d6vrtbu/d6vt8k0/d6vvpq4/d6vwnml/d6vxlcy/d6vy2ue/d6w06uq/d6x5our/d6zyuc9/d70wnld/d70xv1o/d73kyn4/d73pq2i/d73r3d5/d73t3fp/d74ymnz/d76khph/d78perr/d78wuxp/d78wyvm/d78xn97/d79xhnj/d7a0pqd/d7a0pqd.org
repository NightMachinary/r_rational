  Or bankers, or actors, or, well, anyone succesful really.

Cities, then.

  I wonder if any vampires are conducting human breeding projects?

You mean outside of the Underground? Quite possibly, I imagine.

  But can you ghoul an ex-ghoul of someone else, or must the ghouls you ghoul be previously your ghouls or never ghouled?
#+end_quote

This has some other interesting side-effects, as well. Imagine a minor vampire ghouling (say) J.K. Rowling. Now, all the major vampires who want to /can't/, not even if they kill the minor vampire. The only way to control her is to keep the minor vampire alive, and control /him/ (probably through threats and/or intimidation). (I'm imagining a minor vampire sitting very still with an extremely nervous grin while two or three major vampires all glare at each other...)

Also, it means that you can send even high-value ghoul into another vampire's territory (say, carrying a valuable gift) without any risk of the ghoul being stolen. Freed, maybe, but not stolen.

  Thought: bitcoin makes getting untraceable money much easier. Satoshi is probably a vampire, or at the very least a ghoul. After all, for all the privacy advantages bitcoin as for us humans, it is FAR more useful for a vampire.

...huh. That's reasonable.

I'm not sure a vampire needs untraceable money, though. He can just use his ghoul's credit card - perfectly traceable, it just doesn't trace back to /him/.
