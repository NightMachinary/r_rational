  Emotional harm: probably, but only extreme emotional harm, so he wouldn't be full of white lies (probably total unyielding honesty would be one of his requirements, anyway)
#+end_quote

That sounds sensible. (Also, it's worth considering that the emotional harm from finding out about the lies would almost always exceed the emotional harm prevented by the lies in the first place).

#+begin_quote
  yes, he would have to protect William's allies if reasonable. He wouldn't be required to prevent harm to the vombie; or maybe he is by default, but he would have been given specific instructions to keep the vombie alive but not allow it to harm anyone William wouldn't want to harm.
#+end_quote

We've already previously established that he is permitted to restrain William (without harming him). So the same would go for the vombie - even if he is required to protect the vombie, he is permitted to restrain it (and if the vombie would harm William's protege, I'd argue that the gargoyle would be /compelled/ to restrain the vombie).

The interesting question here is whether or not the gargoyle would be able to allow the vombie to be re-staked.

#+begin_quote
  He's also compelled to obey William's orders.
#+end_quote

Can William order him to harm William?

Consider what happens if William gets his foot caught in a bear trap shortly before dawn. If the gargoyle cuts off the foot, then William can get to safety before sunrise; if not, the rising sun will kill him.

Is the gargoyle:

1. Unable to harm William by cutting off his foot? (Or, worse, constrained to prevent anyone else from doing so as well?)
2. Able to cause temporary harm now in order to prevent greater harm?
3. Forced to take a third option of some sort (e.g. wrapping his wings around William to block out all light before turning to stone for the day)?

And can orders from William change which of these options the gargoyle can take?

#+begin_quote
  (Sorry I forgot to reply to this section before btw!)
#+end_quote

No worries.

#+begin_quote
  I worry about that. I don't enjoy reading our logs if we gloss over things that I consider would be necessary to include to establish later scenes - then again, I suppose that would come under "tell your story", since "ignore narrative structure" does not mean "throw everything to the wind and just do a highlight reel".
#+end_quote

Yeah, you can always go back and edit those scenes in later, but it's probably best to include them from the start. But you shouldn't let some arbitrary rules get in the way of your story.

#+begin_quote
  Added to that there's no "one story", things start and stop and run parallel to each other
#+end_quote

Yes, there are /lots/ of stories like that. Some of them unify the disparate scenes by having some sort of overarching theme running through the whole thing, others have the separate plot threads all weave into a single story (or at least all crash into each other in one big climactic scene), while others just have them weave through each other. There's lots of ways to do it.

#+begin_quote
  I suppose part of the process is to select a narrative to choose, stick to it, and then write subsequent narratives as new "books"
#+end_quote

That could also work very well.

(/Lord of the Rings/ is a very hard goal to reach. Are you paying attention to the phase of the moon throughout your story? Tolkien did...)

#+begin_quote
  This is something we're pretty bad at (why last night we did a whole, very explicit explanation of vombies - but the proteg√© asked and William was not going to lie about it - though this stuff can always happen off-screen if it doesn't directly help the narrative).
#+end_quote

Having characters describe stuff is fine. They're limited by their knowledge of the subject (though I expect William is very knowledgeable on this matter) and are allowed to get it wrong on occasion, of course.

It just shouldn't be over-done, but it's fine used sparingly.

#+begin_quote
  I have GMed enough RPGs that my advice to new GMs who are like "how do I put hints in my game" are "make it so obvious that you think you are treating them like children, and then make it still more obvious again. They'll still not get it"
#+end_quote

Yeah, I wrote a fanfiction once with a twist and I thought I was broadcasting the twist like anything, and I asked before I explicitly revealed it, and... no-one had got it.

#+begin_quote
  Point taken. I wonder how many time skips you can get away with? I suppose we'll see.
#+end_quote

"The Last Question" had about half a dozen, I think, and that was a short story. So there's really no hard limit.

#+begin_quote
  Pretty much every year. Unfortunately November is a bad month for me, if Nanowrimo were January or February it might have already happened.
#+end_quote

Fine, then. Specify a month. In that month, you write fifty thousand words. Doesn't have to be November.

Voila.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think so, I think the body would start catabolising fat and muscle to create more glucose;
#+end_quote

...I admit I'm no doctor, and I have very little idea about hoow the human body stores energy. But I don't think you want to run entirely /out/ like that, even if you can survive it.

#+begin_quote
  Then again, the character with premonitions who sometimes gets nosebleeds that are related to them? Probably related to his complete lack of control over his magic.
#+end_quote

Definitely.

#+begin_quote
  Though I'm wondering if we go down the Calabi-Yau manifolds if it's not going to look very, very silly in 50 years when we discover SuperPhysics: Physics 3.0 - but vintage sci-fi is always like that, so whatever.
#+end_quote

I remember one short story - Jules Verne, I think, or one of his contemporaries - wherein the protagonist (in America) calls his wife in Europe on the telephone - and, thanks to what is described only as an "ingenious arrangement of mirrors", is able to see her while he talks.

/Functionally/, it's a videophone...

(The same story had a newspaper office which had revolutionised the industry by having an office full of interns whose job it was, every morning, to phone their subscribers and read them the newspaper over the phone. It looks ridiculous at first, but it carries within it the kernel of the news website...)
