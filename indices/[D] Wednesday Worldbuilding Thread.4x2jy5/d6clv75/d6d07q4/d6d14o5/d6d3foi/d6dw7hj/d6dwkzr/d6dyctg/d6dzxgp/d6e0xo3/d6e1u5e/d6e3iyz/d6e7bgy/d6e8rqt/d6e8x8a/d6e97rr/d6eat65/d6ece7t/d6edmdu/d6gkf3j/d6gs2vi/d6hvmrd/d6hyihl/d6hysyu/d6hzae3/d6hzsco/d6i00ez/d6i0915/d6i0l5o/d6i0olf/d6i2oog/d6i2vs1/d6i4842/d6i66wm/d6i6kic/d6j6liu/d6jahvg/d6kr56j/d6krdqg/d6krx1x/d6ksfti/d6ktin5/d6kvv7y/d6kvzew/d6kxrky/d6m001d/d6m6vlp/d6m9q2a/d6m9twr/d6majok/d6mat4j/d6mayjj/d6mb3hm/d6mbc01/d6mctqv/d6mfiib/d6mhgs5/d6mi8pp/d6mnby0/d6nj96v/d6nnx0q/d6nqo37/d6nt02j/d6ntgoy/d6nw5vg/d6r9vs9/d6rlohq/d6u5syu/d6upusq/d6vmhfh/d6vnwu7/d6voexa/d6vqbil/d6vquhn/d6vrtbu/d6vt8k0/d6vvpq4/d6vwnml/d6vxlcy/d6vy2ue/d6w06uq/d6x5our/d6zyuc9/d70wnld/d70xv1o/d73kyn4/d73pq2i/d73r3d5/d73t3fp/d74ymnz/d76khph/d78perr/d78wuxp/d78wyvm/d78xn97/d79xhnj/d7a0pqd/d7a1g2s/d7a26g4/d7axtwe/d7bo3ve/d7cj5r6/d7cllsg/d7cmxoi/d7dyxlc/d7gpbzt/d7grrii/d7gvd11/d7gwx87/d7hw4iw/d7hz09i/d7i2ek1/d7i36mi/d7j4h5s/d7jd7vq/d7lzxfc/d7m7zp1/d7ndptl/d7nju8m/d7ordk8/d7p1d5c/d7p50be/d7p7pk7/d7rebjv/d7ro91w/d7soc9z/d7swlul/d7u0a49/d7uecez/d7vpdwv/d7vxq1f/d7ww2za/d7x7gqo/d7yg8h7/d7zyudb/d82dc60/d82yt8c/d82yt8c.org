  Also, I forgot: vampires are vulnerable to silver as well as fire. A deliberate Achilles heel by the atlanteans, or did the early settlers of Earth merely enchant all the silver on the planet? Perhaps they cursed a few vampires to be vulnerable to silver, and they are all the common ancestor of the ones that sill live?

Hmmmm. Looking into alchemical history, I see that silver was associated with the moon, while gold was associated with the sun. Hmmmmmm. Would have worked out better the other way round.

It could always turn our that silver is a sort of magical conductor (you'd have particularly ancient or powerful runes being made of silver) so that stabbing a vampire with a silver dagger is a bit like dropping a computer in water - it conducts all the energy to the wrong places and makes it stop working properly.

Or the old alchemists got it backwards, and silver is harmful due to having a sympathetic link to the Sun.

  Not very, but how important is anything for the reader?
#+end_quote

I meant in terms of how necessary it is to understand the rest of the story. If you need to know all about William's history to understand why he does what he does in chapter seven, then (those parts of) his history deserve greater narrative prominence. If it has really no effect on the story one way or another, then it can be relegated to an appendix or a prequel.

  Would vampire society be more socially progressive?
#+end_quote

No, it would almost certainly be more conservative in just about every way, I think. All the vampires were blending in fine three to five hundred years ago, and they get a bit set in their ways as they get older, and don't like to change... some vampires might /start out/ progressive, but give them a couple of centuries and society will progress faster than they do...

Of course, they also don't really answer to human social pressure, so there will be a strong strain of independence running through them.

  Yeah I probably built it up to be more than it was. But at least you know it was mildly disappointing rather than having to wait to find out, so that's something, yeah?
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's something.

  Looks interesting, though the old timey style is very... thick.
#+end_quote

Well, it was actually /written/ in the old-timey, so it has a very good excuse.
