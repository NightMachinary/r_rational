  Yeah, sorry; I just connected them thematically even though the analogy isn't quite right. I tend to do that, get very excited about a link and then mis-state it to make it sound better than it is.

Okie dokie lokie.

  Here I was thinking "well if the sun rules the spleen I guess we can re-work it so you stake the spleen not the heart" but no the sun rules the heart and the spine in western astrology. Almost too convenient, hey?

Don't complain too much when the world unexpectedly lines up with your worldbuilding...

  Can you kill a campire with chamomile tea? All signs point to maybe. Having sunflowers be deadly seems a bit on the nose, but they are probably e.g. reagents for a sunlight spell (which definitely exists canonically)
#+end_quote

Depending on the strength of the link, you may need to include several of those plants in the tea (and perhaps in carefully regulated ratios, too, for maximum effect).

But yeah, using sunflower seeds to power a sunlight spell seems thematically appropriate.

  Here's a question: if we're going for the image of the sun, would touching a full page illustration with the tip of your finger burn you? Or would you have to stick your palm on a smaller-sized image?
#+end_quote

Hmmmmmm. I'd say that yes, it would burn a vampire - but the image has to be complete. Ripping the page in half and then touching the same part of the image will have no effect.

(This is bad news for a vampire who does put his palm on a smaller image; because he then has a burn on his hand which is, itself, a complete image of the Sun...)

  I'm imagining a young woman being turned by, say, her father or husband-to-be. She wanted nothing more in life than to bear a child, and it kind of ends up with her going a bit bonkers, trying to make it happen, and after three long centuries, conducting her own research into IVF, she has finally gotten somewhere... Damnit, I have a pregnant NPC in the nWoD RPG I'm running, still need to shoehorn something "interesting" about the pregnancy in, I'll keep that in reserve.

Have fun!

  I think this is the most likely way to do it. Little fuss, little mess, almost no risk of being caught. Especially if you have a woman from say, Nepal and her family flown into Standard Western Country - a lot more monetary leverage and maybe you'll illegally get them citizenship. Win-win-win.
#+end_quote

Yeah, there are quite a lot of problems that can be solved by application of sufficient money.

#+begin_quote
  This is horrific I love it.
#+end_quote

For the vampire without an expense account.

  Did your ghoul's wife see something she shouldn't have? May as well get some use out of her before you kill her.
#+end_quote

...ooooh, I hadn't thought of that idea.

#+begin_quote
  Probably the most convenient way to do it would be just to get a ghoul/jannisary in an IVF clinic, give a couple that looks roughly like you and the father the wrong egg, have them raise it to the appropriate age, and then swoop in and pick up your kid when they're old enough to be /useful/. After all, anyone who can afford IVF is probably wealthy and stable enough to provide your perfect little baby the environment they need. Bonus, do it to 10-20 families and choose the kid that you like the look of best.
#+end_quote

You don't need a wealthy family. Just pick out whichever family you want and, three months later, have them discover a "distant uncle" in Brazil who recently died and left a fortune to his closest living relatives who, due to an epidemic of something-or-other in Brazil, turns out to be the new family...

Doesn't matter that they've never heard of the uncle, all his paperwork is perfectly in order (watch it, that ink's still a bit wet).
