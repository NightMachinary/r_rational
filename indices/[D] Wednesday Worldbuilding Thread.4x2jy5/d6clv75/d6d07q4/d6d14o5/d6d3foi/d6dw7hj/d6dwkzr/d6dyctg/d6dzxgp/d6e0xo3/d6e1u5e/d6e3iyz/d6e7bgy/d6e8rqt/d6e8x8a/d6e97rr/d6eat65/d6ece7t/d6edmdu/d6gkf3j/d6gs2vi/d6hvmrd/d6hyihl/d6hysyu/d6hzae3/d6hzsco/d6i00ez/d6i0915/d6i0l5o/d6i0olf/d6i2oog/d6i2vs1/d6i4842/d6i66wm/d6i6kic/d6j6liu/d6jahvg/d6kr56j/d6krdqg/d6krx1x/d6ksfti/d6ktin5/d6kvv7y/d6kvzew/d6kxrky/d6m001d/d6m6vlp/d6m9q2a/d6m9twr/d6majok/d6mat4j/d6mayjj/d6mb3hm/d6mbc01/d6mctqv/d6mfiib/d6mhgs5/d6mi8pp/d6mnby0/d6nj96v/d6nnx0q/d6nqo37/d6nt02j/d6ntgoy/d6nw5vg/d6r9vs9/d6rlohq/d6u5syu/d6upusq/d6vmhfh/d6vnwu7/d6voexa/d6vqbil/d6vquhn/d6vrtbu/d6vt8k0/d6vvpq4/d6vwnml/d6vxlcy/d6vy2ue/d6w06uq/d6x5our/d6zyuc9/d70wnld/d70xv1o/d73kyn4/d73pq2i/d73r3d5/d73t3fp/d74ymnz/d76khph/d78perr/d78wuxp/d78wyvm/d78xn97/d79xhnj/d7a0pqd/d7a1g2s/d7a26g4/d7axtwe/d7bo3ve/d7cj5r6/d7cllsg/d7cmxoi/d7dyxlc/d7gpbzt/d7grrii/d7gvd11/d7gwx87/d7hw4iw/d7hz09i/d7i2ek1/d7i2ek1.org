  Considering these two analogies, it would seem to me that /tight/ clothing moves with the shape as you described, while /loose/ clothing is left in the normal 3D world. This has a few consequences:
#+end_quote

I'll provisionally accept this, though I think tight encompasses anything that is securely fastened to the body. For example, a pair of pants with the belt tightly cinched around the waist. In Flatland, imagine them 'nailing' a loose-fitting coat to one side of your finger - it would stay, though it might flop around weirdly as you describe with bats.

I imagine matter as preferring to "stay" in the 3D world, but being pushed into the 4th dimension as necessary.

  (This would presumably mean that different articles of clothing disappear at different times).
#+end_quote

BRB going to rewrite transformation scene to have his clothing disappear in order of tightness. He's probably going to be stuck in his underwear and sneakers.

#+begin_quote
  (He can, with care, take them off and them put them on again in his human form)
#+end_quote

Yes, just like you'd slide a rubber band down your finger to the appropriate 'segment' if you were visiting Flatland.

  When a vampire turns into a bat, the swimming costume will stay on his human form; while the robe will collapse theatrically around him. He can then crawl out of the robe and fly away; when he turns back, he'll still be wearing the swimming costume.
#+end_quote

Combines theatrical with practical, perfect for vampires (and now I have another transformation scene to retouch, probably). I agree that something like a robe that is 'draped' on the body rather than 'fastened' to it would be a concern. For vampires, who transform to bats rarely, they probably don't base their clothing choices around it. A gargoyle might though, preferring clothing that is tight and stretchy; kind of like the Hulk's magic pants.

Also, my husband raised the possibility that rather than being a 'line', beings with transformations exist in a 'torus', so someone with 3 forms can go between any of them at will. I'm quite fond of this, and it means that e.g. you could keep a cop's outfit 1nm "up" and a business suit 1nm "down" and have access to lots of quick disguises.

  If the vampire turns into a bat, then crawls up the sleeve of the robe, then turns back, then at some point during his transformation the sleeve will count as "tight" and he'll pull the robe out of normal 3D space. Unlike the gargoyle, he's going to have a lot of trouble getting the robe back, because he's /not/ a native 4D creature... (Actually, come to think of it, he'll pull the /sleeve/ out, but if he's only pulling it a few nanometres out of the universe, then he'll only drag a little of the robe out of the universe with him; he's going to have half a robe following him everywhere...)
#+end_quote

OMG. What a disaster! On a practical point of view though, the vampire stuck in his robe sleeve will transform back into human form and then cut the robe off his body, and then whatever bit he doesn't want to cut to (and hey, he could just cut a 1cm slice of his, say, butt off to make sure he's done with it). Sure, he'll have a robe surrounding him when he's next feeling batty, but it's not going to make him look ridiculous for the rest of his life.

#+begin_quote
  Important safety tip, then. Never hug a vampire.
#+end_quote

Unless you trust them not to destroy you... MUA HA HA HA HA

  Though if they're taking noticeable delay to move a few nanometers in the fourth dimension, they're going to have very low velocity; that'll reduce their momentum somewhat.
#+end_quote

Somewhat, but 10^{13} is huge. I should ask my 4D expert for whether the momentum would be "huge" or "negligable" which I'm sure it's going to wind up being one or the other.

    And most werewolves aren't aware they're werewolves, so there are "humans" with these "silent" 4D protrusions who won't be able to enter secret anti-vampire vaults. It also is a good way for "Our Heroes" to be able to protect themselves from vampires among other things.
  #+end_quote

  Huh. Now you have a potential werewolf detector. (Paint a few fancy runes around the entrance and see how many people think it's the runes somehow keeping shape shifters out)
#+end_quote

Also going to have big problems with reality looking weird to normies, though werewolves are rare enough (shit, let's think. The incidence is something like 0.005% of the general population, but only ~25% of those are going to know that they're werewolves).

  If he has to protect them both, by his rules, then he /can/ attack the Master at any stage - free will or no - as long as he uses minimum necessary force to prevent the Master from damaging something he has to protect.
#+end_quote

He doesn't have to protect his girlfriend - he just /wants/ to. That said, he didn't harm his master in any way in so doing, and could potentially have justified it by saying "people might have come looking for her and then found him and then burned his haven to the ground!!!!" to use it on his protection circuits. With between 5,000 and 70,000 years of apologetics in his brain, he's probably quite accomplished at doing what he /really/ wants to do, though that always includes protecting his master too.
