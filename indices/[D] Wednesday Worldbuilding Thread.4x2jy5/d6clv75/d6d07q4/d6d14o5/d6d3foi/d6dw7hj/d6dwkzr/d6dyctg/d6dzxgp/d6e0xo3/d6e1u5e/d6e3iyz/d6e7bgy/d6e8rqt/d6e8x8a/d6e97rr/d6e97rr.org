Indeed... if you want a ghoul with connections, you have to babysit them like nobody's business. Better to just have a ghoul butler who is cut off from their family and goes everywhere with you. Easy enough to kill if you get sick of them, some muscle when you need it, and someone to watch over you when you sleep during the day.
