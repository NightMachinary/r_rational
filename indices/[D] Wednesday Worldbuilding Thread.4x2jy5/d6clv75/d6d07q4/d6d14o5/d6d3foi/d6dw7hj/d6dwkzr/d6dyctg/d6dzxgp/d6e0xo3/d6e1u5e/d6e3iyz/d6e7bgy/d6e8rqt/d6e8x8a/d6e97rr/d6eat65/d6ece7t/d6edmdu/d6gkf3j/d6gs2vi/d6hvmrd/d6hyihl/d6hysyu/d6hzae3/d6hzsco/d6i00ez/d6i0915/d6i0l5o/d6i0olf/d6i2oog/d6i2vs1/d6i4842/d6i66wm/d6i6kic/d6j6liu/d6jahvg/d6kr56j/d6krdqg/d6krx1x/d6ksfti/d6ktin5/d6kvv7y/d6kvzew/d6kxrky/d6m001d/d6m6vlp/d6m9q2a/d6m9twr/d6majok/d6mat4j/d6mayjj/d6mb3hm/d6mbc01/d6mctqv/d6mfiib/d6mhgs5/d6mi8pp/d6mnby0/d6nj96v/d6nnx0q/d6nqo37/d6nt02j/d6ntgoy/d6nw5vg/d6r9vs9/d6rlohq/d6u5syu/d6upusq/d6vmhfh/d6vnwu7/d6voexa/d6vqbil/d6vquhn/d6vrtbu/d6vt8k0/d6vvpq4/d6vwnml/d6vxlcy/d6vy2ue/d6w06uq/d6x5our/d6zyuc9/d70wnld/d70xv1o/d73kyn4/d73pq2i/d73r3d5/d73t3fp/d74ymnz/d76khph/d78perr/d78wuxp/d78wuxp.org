  Better to make this generation's JK Rowling or Walt Disney your ghoul, then there's no need to worry about actually writing for /humans/.

Oh, I didn't mean story /writing/. I meant story /telling/. Standing up in front of an audience, reading their reactions, tailoring the story towards what keeps their attention... and by setting it in a time the vampire is more familiar with, he can avoid a lot or cultural problems...

You're right about story /writing/. There are universal aspects to it, but a vampire would be tripped up by the more modern stylistic elements; elements that are much harder to notice in a spoken performance, especially when the vampire is able to read the audience and tailor the tale to match their expectations and reactions.

(Even in a written work, a good editor will be able to deal with most of the problems - if a vampire could swallow his pride enough to listen to one).

Also, I've just realised - there's only one J.K. Rowling. How many vampires would want to collect her as a ghoul?

How would they decide who gets her?

  Yeah, I'm wondering what the Underground bloodline of humans would be like.

I'm thinking they'd be bred for quantity of blood, flavour, obedience and loyalty. So they'd probably be of ruddy complexion, perhaps tending towards slightly plump, and act slightly like well-fed cattle.

  I can see it now: he did something to offend one of the more major vampires in his region, and it was a really serious gaffe...

Heh, yes, I can certainly imagine that. Maybe he ghouled the wrong best-selling novelist?
