  Hmmmmmm. Not really. I can see that he wouldn't see colours, so he could see a book, but he can't see the title unless it's raised/embossed.

This is pretty much what I'm getting at, with the added conditional that it would need to be raised/embossed in the fourth dimension, which by definition a 3D object isn't.

I'm not saying his 4D radar /has/ to work this way. It /can/ work in ways that allow him to pick up the shape of 3D objects. I'm saying that it /can/ work this way, and this neutralises a lot of the advantages. In short, I'm trying to suggest a way in which it can work, without giving free X-ray vision as a consequence.

(Photons have nothing to do with it. His 4D radar works entirely without photons; this it pretty much has to do).

I don't know much about Calabi-Yau manifolds either. But one potential niggle strikes at me - if a 4D creature is locally untwisting one of these extra dimensions, then surely the following consequences follow:

- Any magic dependant on this is limited in range to the area of the untwisted space
- The gargoyle's 4D radar will not be able to see through an area that's not untwisted
- As a consequence of the above, the 4D radar can only see another 4D being if they're close enough that their untwisted region overlaps the gargoyle's untwisted region, at which point they're both in range to throw untwist-dependant magic at each other.

  I /think/ what my husband was saying is these Calabi-Yau manifolds mean you can have photons stick around to hit the 4D eyes, with some very localised physics breaking (which can also be used to cast spells), and you get the x-ray vision.

That looks reasonable, if the 4D radar does end up using photons after all.

  Yes, but the image of clowns is just +gold+ horrifying.
