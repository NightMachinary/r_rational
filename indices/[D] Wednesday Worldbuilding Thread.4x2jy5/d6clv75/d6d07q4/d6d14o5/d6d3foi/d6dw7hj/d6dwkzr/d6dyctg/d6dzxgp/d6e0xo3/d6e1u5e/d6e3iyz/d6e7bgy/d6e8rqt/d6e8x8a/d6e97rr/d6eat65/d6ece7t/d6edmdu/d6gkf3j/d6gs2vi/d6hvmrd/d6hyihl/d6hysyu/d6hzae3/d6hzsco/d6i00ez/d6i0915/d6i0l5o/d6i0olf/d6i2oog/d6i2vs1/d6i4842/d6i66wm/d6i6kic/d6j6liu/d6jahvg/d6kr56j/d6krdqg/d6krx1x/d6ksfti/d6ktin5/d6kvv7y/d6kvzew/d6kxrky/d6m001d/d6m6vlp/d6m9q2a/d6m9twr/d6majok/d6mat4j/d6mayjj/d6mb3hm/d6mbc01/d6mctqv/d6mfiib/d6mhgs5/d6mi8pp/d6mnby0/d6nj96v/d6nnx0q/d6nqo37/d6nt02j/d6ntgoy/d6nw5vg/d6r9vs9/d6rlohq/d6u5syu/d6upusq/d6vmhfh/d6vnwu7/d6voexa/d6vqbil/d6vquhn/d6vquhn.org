  What happens if the vampire, with the aid of explosives or a bulldozer, demolishes the house to the point at which it is no longer a house?

Shit, that's a good thought. Really gets down into 'what is a house, anyway' territory. If you have people sleeping in a cave, is that a house for purposes of the invitation? If so, at which point is the 'threshold' past which the vampire needs an invitation.

I suppose 'house' in the context of this would be a structure /created by humans/ that is currently used for sleeping.

On one hand I don't want vampires to be bulldozing houses to get to the creamy human inside; on the other hand, if a vampire is willing to bulldoze a house that he can't get an invitation into, that's already taking a huge, probably out-of-proportion risk so they are unlikely to be doing it routinely. So, yeah, a vampire could bulldoze a house to get past the invitation if necessary.

  leaving civilians out of any actual war is a pretty recent innovation

You're right. Only need to think back to the old testament to realise how silly it is. So, why did the atlanteans add the 'invitation' quirk? It seems rather bizarre on the face of it. Was it something someone was developing for themselves that was quickly rejigged to be a more general war weapon, and they didn't have time to write out the invitation code anyway?
