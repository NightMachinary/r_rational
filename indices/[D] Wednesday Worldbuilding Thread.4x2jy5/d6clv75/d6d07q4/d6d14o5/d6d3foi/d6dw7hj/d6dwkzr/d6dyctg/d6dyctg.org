[[/itsnotmyblood][]] Fortunately, My Vampires Are Different - turning someone into a vampire can't happen by accident. You have to basically open their chest, vomit a weird blood-like paste into their heart, and leave them out of the sun for a day or two in order for it to work. So very few new ones get made, thankfully. It's mostly young ones wanting to create peers so they can hunt in packs for protection from their elders, or vampires who want to keep a friend or lover with them.

The other big problem I'm having with my vampires is they have three distinct food sources:

1) People they hunt and kill in the traditional vampirey way

2) What we've named jannisaries, who are addicted to the experience of being fed on, since it releases endorphins, adreneline, etc in humans. Typical sort of addict personality. They usually continue to live their own lives and just seek the vampire out for scheduled feedings. Some vampires will eat from them unsustainably, but the wisest ones know roughly how much they can get away with taking, though this still shortens the jannisaries life span.

3) Ghouls, humans who have been fed vampire blood and gain up to a max of, say, 10% of the vampire's strength/healing ability over the course of several months before reaching a plateau. The vampire blood makes them completely subservient to the vampire. Vampires can feed from ghouls, and though they require a few drops of blood every day or so, canonically, at least, in my mind, a vampire can feed from a ghoul more than often enough to counteract this modest loss.

What I'm trying to figure out is - why would a vampire not just make a herd of ghouls, keep them in a basement somewhere, and feed from them? Why have jannisaries at all? Jannisarries are uncontrolled, often unpredictable, and have been known to attack vampires to force them to feed. They are a security breach. And yet, vampires for some reason seem to have a lot of them. Ghouls are better in every way.

Should I just retcon it and say having a ghoul is a net loss of blood, because the amount they must drink to sustain themselves? Or is the logistics of keeping ghouls prohibitive, since you have to bring them human food, dispose of their bodily waste, etc (except, being slaves, you can just order them to do that for themselves)? Does keeping ghouls under control require the use of mental focus that means keeping more than 1 for every 500 years of age you have just takes too much of your brain so you wouldn't be able to control them effectively?

I tend to lean towards the 'ghouls use psychic energy' school of thought, but it still bugs me.
