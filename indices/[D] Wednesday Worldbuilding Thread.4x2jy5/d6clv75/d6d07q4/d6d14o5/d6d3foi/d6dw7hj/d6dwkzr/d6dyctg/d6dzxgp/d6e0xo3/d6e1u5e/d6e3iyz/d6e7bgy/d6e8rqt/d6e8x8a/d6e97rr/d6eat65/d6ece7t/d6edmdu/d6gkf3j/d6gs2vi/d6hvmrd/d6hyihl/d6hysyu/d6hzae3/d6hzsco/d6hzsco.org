[[/chrysaliswarfare][]] You gotta be careful when moving, though. If you're not well-known as a powerful creature, you wind up having to insert yourself into the local community, often by force. Etiquette requires, after all, that you send appropriate flocks of birds in advance of your arrival, or you may be seen as doing something... uncouth.

Then again, if you see a city controlled by a young, weak vampire, you can always go in and make it your own. That can get messy, so dress appropriately.
