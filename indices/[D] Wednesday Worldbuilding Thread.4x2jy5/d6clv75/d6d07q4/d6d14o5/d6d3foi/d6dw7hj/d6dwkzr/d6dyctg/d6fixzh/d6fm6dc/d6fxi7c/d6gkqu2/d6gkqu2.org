Yeah, the second I realised I imagined it as being like 'graduating up the drug scale' I was like... I am totally talking bullshit, aren't I? I actually know a guy who used to be a drug and alcohol abuse councillor at a prison, so I might ask him for his perspective on this sort of stuff.

  Additionally, the kind of people who actively seek out drugs to get high probably aren't the kind of people vampires would want to work with.

Agreed. I always imagined jannisaries as specifically a reliable food source, and if you wanted influence, you'd make a ghoul instead as they're more... controllable.

Problem is, with all this in mind, you end up back at my problem of why have jannisaries over ghouls/thralls. I suppose the psychic energy being a limited resource makes the most sense.

I also imagined vampires as being /very/ protective of their jannisaries. They're an excellent resource in that they're a meal whenever you want it, but if you have to share them, they become infinitely less useful, especially because in order to get their high the jannisaries are likely to lie about being fed on in the past. In most cities this would take the form of vampires having 'territories', and you can only take jannisaries who live in your territory. It would have the counter-intuitive consequence of vampires tending to prefer the 'bad' parts of town. Individual jannisaries, though, would be out for themselves a lot of the time. And I do like the idea of truck stops literally having rooms of jannisaries in them, so vampires who are just passing through have an easy food source.
