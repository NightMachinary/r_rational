  I am so happy to read you type those words.

[[/twiwink][]] I felt it was expected of me.

  I would have conceptualised it more as, he would still think imagining killing his daughter would be just as bad as he did before he did the imagining. Like, the fact he did the action has no bearing whatsoever on how he feels about it.
#+end_quote

...ah. I thought that not being horrified about having done it would generalise into a sort of gradual desensitisation.

But fair enough, I take your point regarding the drunk father.

#+begin_quote
  I definitely concede that you can have a loving father kill his daughter through mind control, even if it requires waiting a few weeks/months to get the gap wide enough. I don't think there's a huge issue with this exploit because e.g. a semi-loving father could be controlled into killing his daughter with no problem.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but it can be generalised further. Anything that someone would never do, even under Control, then becomes a matter of the vampire just setting up the right scenes for a while beforehand - it weakens from "he'd never do that" to "you have to plan ahead to make him do that".

Or, of course, just buy a hooded cloak and make the daughter wear that.

#+begin_quote
  Sounds like a perfect option. You'd probably need to control the boss semi-regularly
#+end_quote

That's reasonable, yes.

  Hmm. I had William wrap Red in cloth; being wrapped tightly in flammable cloth which is then set alight could be part of the ritual (and make it pretty risky and impossible to do covertly), though not really sure of an in-universe explanation for that.
#+end_quote

...yeah, given how lethal fire is for vampires, I'm not seeing an in-universe explanation for this one, either. Especially as I'm pretty sure that if you get all the cloth on fire, you'll end up with a lot more ash than corpse out of it.

#+begin_quote
  Oh goodie. I wonder what another major (or minor) magical / superstitious belief system is, that could get me thinking about that. I do like the idea of a smell interfering somehow. Indian is another big one, but I'm sure there's plenty of places in Africa and the Americas and Oceania too.
#+end_quote

...I think Africa is more likely to give you other creatures to live in the alternate universe than vampire lore. Hmmm. Though the Sun will naturally take a major part in any mythological tradition, won't it?

#+begin_quote
  No, you can remove the negative emotions entirely and the person can rationally understand that strangers in white vans are very bad, assuming they're old enough. Sure, some people have to touch "wet paint" when they see a wet paint sign, but if you go to a mage to have a traumatic memory removed, the mage might say "ok, I am removing the emotion of you not liking what happened in the white van. Just remember that white vans are bad places to be, the things that happened were bad, and you should not let them happen again".
#+end_quote

Okay, fair enough, but the rational and emotional work on different levels. The emotional revulsion pulls you out immediately, before you even realise what's going on - the rational level only works when you have time (and /take/ the time) to think about it. So it's slower and doesn't sprig to mind as readily.
