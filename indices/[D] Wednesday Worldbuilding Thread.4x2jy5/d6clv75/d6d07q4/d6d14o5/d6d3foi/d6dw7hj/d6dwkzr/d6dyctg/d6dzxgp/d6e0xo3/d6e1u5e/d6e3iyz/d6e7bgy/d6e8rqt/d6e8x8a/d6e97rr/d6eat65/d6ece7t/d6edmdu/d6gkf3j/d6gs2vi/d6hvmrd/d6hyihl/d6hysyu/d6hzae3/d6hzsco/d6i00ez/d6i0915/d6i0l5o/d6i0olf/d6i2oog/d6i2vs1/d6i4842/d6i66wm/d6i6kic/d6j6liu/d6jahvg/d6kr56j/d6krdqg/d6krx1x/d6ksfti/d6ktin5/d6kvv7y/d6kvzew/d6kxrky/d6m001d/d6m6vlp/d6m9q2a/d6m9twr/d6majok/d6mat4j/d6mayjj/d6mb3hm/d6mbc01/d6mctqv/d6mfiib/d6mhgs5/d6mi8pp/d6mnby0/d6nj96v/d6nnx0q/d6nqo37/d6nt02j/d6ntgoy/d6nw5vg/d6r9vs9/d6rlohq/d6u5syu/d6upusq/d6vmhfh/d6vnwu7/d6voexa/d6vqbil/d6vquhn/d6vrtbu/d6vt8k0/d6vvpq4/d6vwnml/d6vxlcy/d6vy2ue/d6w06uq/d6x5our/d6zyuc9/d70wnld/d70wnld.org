Your description of Atlantis is so beautiful I want to start writing about it! I also like how Atlantis is no longer canonically in our timeline.

I assume they're also self-propagating, with the demons themselves having no knowledge of their own origins?

There are also gods who exist and are worshiped by demons, but they are more in the vein of pantheon gods - different demons worship different gods, some of the gods are race exclusive, and they don't have anything like omniscience or omnipotence, so they can quite easily slot in as the 'upper middle class' to the demons' middle-class - just much more powerful spell-casters, maybe even remnants of the original atlantis.

Yes, and the malevolent-seeming manifestations are just a side-effect of not knowing how to properly interface with them. I can also see exorcism as the magical equivilent of presssing ctrl+alt+del and ending the processes.

  so, by correctly arranging the journey, you can get from North America to New Zealand by foot in an hour or so if you're willing to pay the necessary tolls?
#+end_quote

Absolutely. This has a problem though, you could break the light speed limit, and thus time travel, couldn't you? But light travels so fast maybe it doesn't matter. Let's work it out:

#+begin_example
  circumference of the earth = 40,000km 
  => about 20,000 km between places at worst
  Time light takes to travel 20,000km is 67 milliseconds
#+end_example

So giving each portal an almost-imperceptible half-second delay means that we don't have time travel. Not sure whether the demon world is literally a parallel universe or if it's underground, but if it's a parallel universe physics can just kind of shrug at that and if it's underground then the laws of physics are still not getting broken.

  and I can imagine your character wth the shop to point out this advantage to people

This would require giving knowledge of the underground world to normies, which must be taboo or it would have happened long ago; but I assume that demon folk use them routinely for international or even interstate travel. (Actually, given humans have no rights in the underground world, enterprising drug kingpins might find themselves on a centaur's dinner table if they don't have a backstory, or if they encounter an unsavory type).

  Besides, you get some really big cryptids (the Kraken comes to mind) and the Shadow World needs space for them.
#+end_quote

I'm just imagining a big, misunderstood Kraken squeezing into a river in the Shadow World to give everyone hugs with its tentacles, and everyone is happy to let it, because they know that a Kraken is all about hugs.
