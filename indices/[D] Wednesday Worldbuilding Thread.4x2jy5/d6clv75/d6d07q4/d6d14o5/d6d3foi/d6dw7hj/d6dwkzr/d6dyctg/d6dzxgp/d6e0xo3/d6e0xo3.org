[[/twidrugs][]] I love the spirit of your suggestions! However, I probably misrepresented ghouls - they still retain their original personalities and ability to think creatively / etc, and are able to maintain their human lives if the vampire wishes them to. They just become very suggestible, think of a stage hypnotist, and fiercely loyal. It's more like someone who is unconditionally in love with a vampire, than a zombie that has lost its entire personality.

I love the idea of the vampire blood altering the taste of the ghoul's blood to make it less palatable, but it's still likely going to be better to have a journalist as a ghoul than as a jannisary.

Then again..... a ghoul can be un-ghouled by keeping them away from the vampire for about a week, and they might be disgusted by what they did and turn on the vampire. A jannisary will still be looking for that next high, and while they might sell a vampire out for another vampire's services, there's very little else that would make them want to do so. So, while a jannisary can't be ordered to keep you secret, it's in their interest. On the other hand, a ghoul is bound to you at her very core - until they aren't, and then they are likely to be your biggest enemy. So you would only want to create ghouls you will have complete control over....
