    Then again, there's folklore about them not being able to stand the sight of a cross, and how is the sight of the sun any different?
  #+end_quote

  It's not the sight; it's having the image somehow come into contact with the vampire.
#+end_quote

Yeah, sorry; I just connected them thematically even though the analogy isn't quite right. I tend to do that, get very excited about a link and then mis-state it to make it sound better than it is.

#+begin_quote
  In this case, the Sun is cursed - and very strongly cursed - where vampires are concerned; so things that share a sympathetic or magical link with the Sun are all harmful to vampires.
#+end_quote

So, what else is harmful? Let's start looking at some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_astrology][medical astrology]]!

#+begin_quote
  Sun -- heart, spine, and general vitality
#+end_quote

Here I was thinking "well if the sun rules the spleen I guess we can re-work it so you stake the spleen not the heart" but no the sun rules the heart and the spine in western astrology. Almost too convenient, hey?

From some other pages:

#+begin_quote
  In Ayurveda, it rules over life-force (praan-shakti), governs bile temperament (pitta), stomach, bones and eyes.
#+end_quote

So.... I guess we're being western-centric if we don't have the sun be associated with the stomach, bones and eyes - or just the westerners happened to get it "right".

#+begin_quote
  When it comes to plant magic, the sun is associated with a number of flowers and herbs, including sunflowers, daisies, dandelions, chamomile and rosemary. Use these in your workings for a bit of extra solar mojo.
#+end_quote

Can you kill a campire with chamomile tea? All signs point to maybe. Having sunflowers be deadly seems a bit on the nose, but they are probably e.g. reagents for a sunlight spell (which definitely exists canonically)

#+begin_quote
  Honestly, the fact that it's gold is probably enough already... but even the wrong page from a modern astronomy textbook could have a nasty surprise if touched.
#+end_quote

Here's a question: if we're going for the image of the sun, would touching a full page illustration with the tip of your finger burn you? Or would you have to stick your palm on a smaller-sized image?

#+begin_quote
  Okay, so negative effect, yes, but minor. Still, a vampire who goes to /that/ amount of effort just to get a child is going to want /everything/ to be just /pErFeCt!!!!/
#+end_quote

I'm imagining a young woman being turned by, say, her father or husband-to-be. She wanted nothing more in life than to bear a child, and it kind of ends up with her going a bit bonkers, trying to make it happen, and after three long centuries, conducting her own research into IVF, she has finally gotten somewhere... Damnit, I have a pregnant NPC in the nWoD RPG I'm running, still need to shoehorn something "interesting" about the pregnancy in, I'll keep that in reserve.

#+begin_quote
  ...which means tht the surrogate can be neither jannissary or ghoul.

  - Kidnap someone. Jannissaries in local law enforcement will keep the investigation(s) away.

  - The surrogate does not know that the backer is a vampire, she just knows he's really rich and willing to pay off all her debts in exchange for nine months of discomfort and having to follow the provided diet.
#+end_quote

I think this is the most likely way to do it. Little fuss, little mess, almost no risk of being caught. Especially if you have a woman from say, Nepal and her family flown into Standard Western Country - a lot more monetary leverage and maybe you'll illegally get them citizenship. Win-win-win.

#+begin_quote

  - The surrogate was briefly in a hospital where some of the doctors are jannissaries. She does not know the child is not hers (and may or may not be expending significant effort trying to figure out how there could possibly have been a father)
#+end_quote

This is horrific I love it. Could totally go down the /Jane the Virgin/ path and end very, very messy.

#+begin_quote

  - The surrogate is aware of vampires (and that the parent is one) and has a very good idea of what will happen to her if she objects to anything. Fear keeps her obedient.
#+end_quote

Did your ghoul's wife see something she shouldn't have? May as well get some use out of her before you kill her.

#+begin_quote
  After the baby is born, I guess the surrogate might or might not be permitted to leave alive... in some circumstances, the surrogate might end up being a kind of foster parent as well (what vampire really wants to deal with dirty nappies?)
#+end_quote

Probably the most convenient way to do it would be just to get a ghoul/jannisary in an IVF clinic, give a couple that looks roughly like you and the father the wrong egg, have them raise it to the appropriate age, and then swoop in and pick up your kid when they're old enough to be /useful/. After all, anyone who can afford IVF is probably wealthy and stable enough to provide your perfect little baby the environment they need. Bonus, do it to 10-20 families and choose the kid that you like the look of best.
