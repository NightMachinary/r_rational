  Umm. They must have, surely? But I don't recall any.

Well, the Aztecs didn't have wheels. It's quite possible that some alien race may have managed to miss some fairly obvious application of technology.

(Similarly, it's quite possible that /we/ have missed some fairly obvious application of technology).

If the aliens /had/ throwable explosives, though, then their failure to design some sort of defence against them sounds like incompetence on the part of whoever designed those shield generators.

  Until someone figures out how to use a computer to transmit vibrations in the ground that can be picked up.... I just imagine AGI as being able to do literally anything because I'm probably not far off.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Good point. The drives have motors, imbalances in said motors might be able to transmit some vibrations.

...simple solution - put the faraday cage on a space station. Have no other computer systems on board the station, apart from one very simple one that just maintains the orbit. Then there's nothing for it to vibrate /to/.

  If that's the case, then we're back to eye contact not actually being necessary - which could be fine, but maybe not.
#+end_quote

We don't actually /need/ an explanation. We've got the rules for how it works - eye contact, separated by no solid objects and not more than twenty metres of air, and for five minutes the guy does what the vampire says.

The underlying mechanism is all done by magic.

  I'm now wondering if she just had a "haircut" and had some seriously dead snakes, or if the snakes are just.... friendly and chill with the arrangement? Actually, if they were kept cold, they might just sleep most of the time anyway. Assuming snake hair has any actual biological similarity to actual snakes.
#+end_quote

...now I'm imagining that she wears a very elaborate headdress - under the burka - containing (among other things) a small amount of ice and a battery-powered cooling fan.

And wherever she goes, people wonder what on earth that continual /humming/ noise is...

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. That's really depressing but all too true. We still don't have /gay marriage/ here so we're surprisingly backwards. That said we've effectively had compulsory gay (and poly) common law marriage since 1999 so.... we're not all bad?
#+end_quote

Our constitution has - since 1994 - had an important line about not discriminating against anyone based on race, creed, gender physical disability, sexual orientation (and I think there's some other things in there as well) except where there is seriously good reason (the example given being that one is allowed to refuse to give a blind man a job as a bus driver without running afoul of anti-discrimination laws).

The whole gay marriage debate isn't really that big a thing here, though. (Racism and corruption are much bigger - or at least /louder/ - issues. At the moment, /especially/ corruption.)

#+begin_quote
  We can only hope.
#+end_quote

There's also the question of why aliens haven't turned up here /yet/. I've seen all sorts of proposed answers to this question...

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, apart from dingos (which are not actually native to Australia, they came with the aboriginies), the Australian aboriginies didn't domesticate anything. I'd be curious about inter-tribal warfare and that sort of thing. You'd imagine there'd be competition for resources if nothing else.
#+end_quote

Google says there was [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-history-of-inter-tribal-warfare-in-pre-1788-Australia][a certain amount of inter-tribal warfare]] - most of which is not recorded because (a) the aboriginals had no writing to record it with, and (b) since they were hunter-gatherers, not farmers, they didn't have a firm enough base to stand firm against the British invaders and lost that war pretty thoroughly.

...I don't know if Google is telling me the truth here (sometimes it doesn't) but it looks pretty trustworthy this time.

  "What? There's a forum where people are sharing their experiences? Someone has run a /controlled experiment/ on vombies and worked out that 24 carat gold produces the best results and silver does nothing? They've worked out that cammomile prevents restoration? How???"

"As per our usual method, let's kill everyone who's been exposed to this information, burn all the paper, and wait a generation or two to see if it comes back. Jannissary, get us a list of everyone who might have seen this information."

"Everyone, sir."

"...everyone in the city?"

"No, sir. Everyone."

"...in the country?"

"In the world, sir."

"...no. No, that can't be right. Narrow it down a bit further for me, will you?"

  Oh god, you're right. "I have been damned and my soul has been destroyed. All I can do is make sure everyone follows the True Path". Maybe he ended up in one of the many christian offshoots from catholicism.
#+end_quote

If he ended up in one of the offshoots - which is not unreasonable - then presumably he would have left the Vatican at some point and set himself up somewhere else...
