  That said, the 'just so' story doesn't explain why it's /running/ water - you'd imagine still water would be worse, because it can be perfectly reflective.
#+end_quote

Perfectly flat water is only dangerous from one direction - if the vampire and the sun are both to the east of the lake, then there are no dangerous reflections to worry about. (Well, not until some idiot throws a stone into the lake and causes ripples, anyway).

But that doesn't really matter - a superstition will often have a lot of unnecessary details attached. Consider the matter of vampire stakes, for example; a lot of traditions say that it matters what /type/ of wood you use.

To quote from the Wikipedia article:

#+begin_quote
  Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with staking the most commonly cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures.[46] Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states,[47] or hawthorn in Serbia,[48] with a record of oak in Silesia.[49] Aspen was also the wood of choice for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night).[50] Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany[51][52] and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.[53]

So, yeah, superstitions acquire unnecessary details all the time. (Why a /black/ cat?)

  Not sure about how to incorporate fire into the vampire creation ritual. All your ideas are great, though I don't want to get too complicated by having a vampire die or become an automaton if she ever gets wet.
#+end_quote

Eh, the security program could be non-self-repairing if properly destroyed while creating the new vampire.

...maybe the ritual, done properly, makes the vampire's system think that the burn wounds are "supposed" to be there, and so the body regenerates with the burns if injured. (I just like the idea of every vampire having a very visible scar if you know where to look - somewhere that's easily hidden by clothing, so it doesn't stop them pretending to be human, but it kind of feeds into the idea of vampires being a twisted unnatural mockery of life, which is always going to be part of the undercurrent of a vampire story)

  Not sure if this will help any, but here's the description of the ritual (it's a bit incomplete).
#+end_quote

Hmmm. So, basically, sludge and readings in Latin. And it's known to not always work... interesting. I wonder why not? Perhaps there are some requirements to the vampire ritual that the vampires themselves have forgotten (something not hard to get right accidentally, but also not 100% certain - perhaps it requires a very specific range of air temperatures, or doesn't work if the humidity is too high, or something). Or perhaps there's something about certain people - it may be that the magic genes prevent vampirasation, or are required for it.

  Completely changing the subject, I was having a discussion with my rolepalying partner last night about whether it was appropriate to have mages in fiction be able to, for example, remove traumatic memories so that way kids can grow up without the baggage from those.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Well, I see no reason not to have it, if it's handled properly. I mean, some mental disorders can be handled by means of chemistry, so why not by means of magic? Magic should be a tool - it has uses, it makes some things easier, but above all it needs to be used by someone who knows exactly what they're doing.

Having said that, I don't think it should just be a matter of waving a magic wand and all is well. There should be drawbacks and tradeoffs. Some examples might include:

- Memories are intertwined; they connect, and you may remember thinking about a memory, or remember a time when a memory helped you make a decision. Either the memory erasure spell wipes all associated memories as well (and thus using it on a sixty-year-old to erase a childhood trauma that's continually affected him may leave him a drooling idiot). This type of amnesia spell can still be safely used /immediately/ on a person to deal with a traumatic memory that happened ten minutes ago - or three days ago, at the cost of wiping all memories of the last three days.

- The spell removes the memory, but does nothing for the brain chemistry. The patient remains fearful and traumatised, but can no longer remember why. Some patients recover naturally at this point; others descend into paranoia and, in extreme cases, insanity; this is more likely if the patient finds something that proves him memories have been erased (e.g. he looks over his diary, or, worse, he realises that his diary has been deliberately removed) and less likely if the original trauma was less severe.

- The memories are removed - and so are any lessons that may have been learned from them. The patient them happily goes off and gets himself straight into the same situation all over again - or at least a similar situation. The trauma hits harder with each successive event, because every time there's a little bit of trauma that the spell doesn't /quite/ remove, and it builds up with repeated exposures.

- The spell doesn't remove the memories, merely hiding them from the conscious mind. Over time, the memories slowly seep back - mainly in dreams - and eventually (slowly) return completely. This type of memory spell would be best used in combination with conventional therapy, to ease the impact of the trauma - it's still there, it just doesn't hit as hard as it otherwise would.

A common thread in all of the above is that, if you just throw it about at random, you can do more harm than good. But, at the same time, if you are, or work with a competent psychologist, the magic can be used to complement a more traditional means of dealing with trauma... it's not going to solve everything with the wave of a wand, but it can make everything a lot easier (or, in some cases, possible at all) to solve /if used correctly/.

  Like it's just a hair below "and then the super mage cast a spell that removed racism, sexism and homophobia from the world forever"
#+end_quote

...that one's straight up mind control. The super mage may have had good intentions, but he's sitting right on top of a giant heap of "absolute power corrupts absolutely".

He'll probably still have good intentions when he casts a spell to make people obey the laws.

And he'll probably /still/ have good intentions when he casts a spell to make people say "please" and "thank you" when appropriate. Or donate one-tenth of their income to various charities.

Will he notice the point at which the planet Earth is no longer populated by anyone with the ability to make their own decisions?
