Before anything else I just want to say the extra dimension idea was AMAZING, it was in fact RIDICULOUSLY GOOD, it was in fact SO RIDICULOUSLY GOOD I wanted to express my appreciation. I considered reddit gold and then thought the more rational thing to do would be to buy some malaria bed nets, so I bought 5 malaria nets in your honour by way of thanks:

(If you're not actually /at all/ interested in effective altruism, then I'd be happy to buy you gold by way of apology, but a month of reddit gold is approximately the same price as a malaria bed net, so...)

But, yes, not only have I read Flatterland (highly recommend it, btw), but my husband is a mathematician who participates in something he calls "recreational mathematics" of higher dimensional spheres, so he was all too happy for me to pick his brain about vampires, transformation, and conservation of mass. I guess that is why I was so very, extremely, inexorably impressed by the idea.

So, this is what he helped me work out. I use Flatland metaphors a lot, because it's the only way I can get my head around 4 dimensional geometry.

- the 4th dimension is not really a part of our universe except when it is used by magical beings in some way or another. In other words, if the universe is flatland, there is void "above" and "below" flatland except where vampires, gargoyles, werewolves etc "stick out" - no physics/etc to speak of

- things can only stick into the 4th dimension as a result of magic; possibly, magic was invented in a 4 dimensional universe

- things are only able to be "at right angles" to our universe. This prevents creatures from looking "distorted" by being askew

- transformations look pretty much how we'd expect them to look, with slowly changing from one to the other. However, things like wings and tails can suddenly appear as free-floating spheres and then slowly become thicker and thicker until they "join" to the main body, which is just freaky cool: [[http://imgur.com/a/cxCD9]]

- transformations happen the same way every single time.

- this whole thing has some interesting connotations for how werewolves might work, since I have a whole werewolf concept based on menstruation but I'm very protective of it and I don't want to share it in a public forum, even buried deep in a month-old worldbuilding wednesday thread

- vampires and werewolves, being human-based, lack intuition for the 4-dimensional world. Their bat, wolf and human eyes just do not see through the 4th dimension; after all, there are no photons there.

- a "native" of the 4 dimensions, such as a gargoyle, has eyes that are capable of seeing other "projections" into the 4th dimension. This makes such creatures great guards, as they can see the projections of vampires and werewolves and many other transforming creatures in the 4th dimension at all times.

- The gargoyle has three forms: stone gargoyle at one end, gargoyle in the center, and human at the other end. During the day, /because of plot at the moment, but probably for a legitimate reason when I think of one/, the stone form is in our world with the other two forms "up" in the fourth dimension. Possibly it's where he goes to take a break, possibly it's how he actually 'eats', possibly his stone form has the most heightened senses for his guard duties, who knows???

OK, that's probably enough higher dimensional stuff. Thanks again for the idea. It's excellent.

    Not unless the vampire spit has been identified as a PED, which, hey, maybe it has and we don't know it.

  Vampire spit might not just be one compound. It might be half-a-dozen or more. Any one of which might be a performance enhancing drug.
#+end_quote

Yep, I meant like, maybe one of the PEDs that has been identified is actually one of the components of vampire spit.

Sample dialog:

"Yes, our saliva contains something very valuable to humans. It's called albuterol."

"Albuterol... isn't that the asthma drug that can be used as a steroid when it's injected?"

"How do you think you humans discovered it?"

    No doubt, and the DEA probably thinks it's the worst street name since bath salts. If only they knew... How does the drug lord get the stuff, that's the question... does he have a bunch of vampire-zombies tied up in his basement that he milks every now and then?

I don't see why not. Seems like a pretty safe source.

    I was also going to propose it as an alternative CO2 scrubber, but it would just remove CO2 from the air and the oxygen would be lost because the ratio of C to O in the body is 1:2. How annoying, but still, it remains potentially useful. I fail to see what sort of emergency could be so terrible that it can be made in any way better by introducing an immortal, feral, near-unkillable human-eating monster in an enclosed space with the crew.

Oh no, you have just a tiny sliver of heart. It'll slowly regenerate, but once it's about the size of an orange you take another sliver, put it in a vacuum box, and throw the rest out of the airlock. Of course, a few hundred years from now, that 'space junk' might find its way in the aerated cargo hold of a space-ship, and, well, that would be /quite/ the horror movie plot once it comes of age, isn't it?
