  Your description of Atlantis is so beautiful I want to start writing about it!
#+end_quote

Thanks!

#+begin_quote
  I also like how Atlantis is no longer canonically in our timeline.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that avoids all /sorts/ of tricky questions about historical records and stuff.

#+begin_quote
  I assume they're also self-propagating, with the demons themselves having no knowledge of their own origins?
#+end_quote

Definitely. No Atlantean merchant would ever fit something as stupid as planned obsolescence into something they sell to one of the /powerful/ Atlantean families. (The ability to wipe people from time if they are rude to you encourages an amazing amount of politeness.)

#+begin_quote
  There are also gods who exist and are worshiped by demons ... they can quite easily slot in as the 'upper middle class' to the demons' middle-class - just much more powerful spell-casters, maybe even remnants of the original atlantis.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that works. Some of the demons may have been servants as well - I can see dryads as gardeners, naiads as water-based landscapers, and so on.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, and the malevolent-seeming manifestations are just a side-effect of not knowing how to properly interface with them. I can also see exorcism as the magical equivilent of presssing ctrl+alt+del and ending the processes.

"Fits? No, no, no, that one's supposed to make you dance in perfect choreography. You did spend ten minutes meditating over your desired dance routine before letting it possess you, right? What, you didn't? Well, then, what did you /expect/ it to do?"

#+begin_quote
  So giving each portal an almost-imperceptible half-second delay means that we don't have time travel.
#+end_quote

As long as you're only exiting them on Planet Earth, yes. (I can easily see one guy with a portal that comes out somewhere in the Andromeda Galaxy - if there's a half-second delay on /that/, then yes, in theory you can use it to mess about with time travel; but it would be virtually impossible for you to actually do anything with it and still end up within a dozen years of your starting point (so kind of a one-way trip).

#+begin_quote
  This would require giving knowledge of the underground world to normies
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. He could just point it out to people who already know about the portal. ("Hey, I'm told there are people in New Zealand who will pay quite a bit for cigarettes that haven't paid import taxes. Incidentally, I sell cigarettes over there as well. Would you like to buy - no? Your loss.")

  I'm just imagining a big, misunderstood Kraken squeezing into a river in the Shadow World to give everyone hugs with its tentacles, and everyone is happy to let it, because they know that a Kraken is all about hugs.
#+end_quote

[[/pinkieflutterhug][]] Everyone loves hugs, right?
