  That's really cool, I'm trying to picture it - the monster is undulating, changing around, parts appearing and disappearing and his pants are amongst them.
#+end_quote

Thinking about it, if he's only pulling the belted part of his pants a few nanometres away from our normal 3D universe, then most of the legs are going to stay there anywhere, surely?

#+begin_quote
  Ah, my headcanon is that vampires can't turn into bats until they're more than 1000 years old,
#+end_quote

Oh. Yeah, that /does/ reduce the odds of going joyflying. Not necessarily because they're too dignified (you get some /very/ undignified eighty-year-olds), but because they're far more set in their ways and trying to be careful not to be caught out by a surprise dawn.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. Hmmm. I wonder what you'd need to fabricate in order to have pants that keep you modest. I doubt a 5,000 year old gargoyle cares much who sees his dingus though, so he's unlikely to go to trouble.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. The first thought I have is a "bedsheet ghost" type costume.

Refining that slightly, I thought of a poncho - too big on his human form, barely modest on his gargoyle form.

Then I thought some kind of robe, with straps and belts, which takes several minutes to put on in his human form - but pull the right cord, and it unfolds almost instantly into a gargoyle-sized poncho.

[[/notfabulous][]] Certainly a challenge for any clothing designer, but perhaps not /entirely/ insurmountable.

Fair enough. (Or perhaps it's just for formal occasions).

#+begin_quote
  So the gargoyle could use one of his other projections (e.g. the 'cross-section' that's 'parallel' to the sleeved-bat) to grab the sleeve, and pass it 'down' the conga line of his projections into the 3D universe, which would result in the vampire feeling the odd tug, and a piece of torn fabric appearing out of thin air bit by bit.
#+end_quote

It's not a conga line. It's the same hand, it's just a lot more complex in shape than a human hand. But you're right, he doesn't need to take the visible part of his hand out of the universe to reach the fabric. (He might need to in order to move it 'around' the vampire's human shape to get at the fabric... or he might not).

#+begin_quote
  That sounds really cool - I should check it out. It's been a long time since I've read a new webcomic.
#+end_quote

Starts [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff100/fv00001.htm][here]]. The scene with the rubber knife comes in about 1500 strips later, [[http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff1600/fc01582.htm][and really needs a bit of context]].

#+begin_quote
  Also, we have a new character concept now
#+end_quote

Hmmm. A simple 4D multishifter would be a string - would need to always take the shapes in the same order (geraniums come /between/ whale and giant eagle with glowing eyes).

So I think she'd work better as a /complex/ multishifter. Something with a lot of moving parts that shift and adjust - and because they do so in four dimensions, she can change her mass as well. Perhaps even a cloud of near-molecular nanomachines that hold firmly to each other but can flow like a liquid - including in the 4D directions - and change colour. (She might even be the /origin/ of a lot of mythology). Designed to be able to look like anything - perhaps originally intended as a perfect spy or something...
