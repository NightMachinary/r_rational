  RE Gold/metal, originally /originally/ it apparently met copper, so let's not look too closely at it.

Okie dokie.

  I'm wondering if there's some way we can make vampires unable to cross running water, but I think that's probably getting a bit too far out there.
#+end_quote

Easy.

A vampire can go out in the day, as long as he doesn't allow any sunlight to fall on him. So, one an imagine a rich but eccentric vampire, in very thick clothing, with an umbrella to keep the sun off his face, strolling through the countryside in the middle of the day.

He approaches a river, running water. The water gives off /reflections/. Sunlight - a full, undistorted image of the sun - strikes his face from a direction that the umbrella does /not/ cover. Instant sun-injury - instant death if he's too old.

Two or three incidents like that, and a rumour goes around that vampires cannot cross running water... though in reality, running water poses no obstacle to them as long as the sun is down.

  I think I'll keep the "fire needs to be used to create a vampire", because it makes it difficult to make new vampires, though I'm not sure how that would happen mechanically. If you threw a match at a recently dead corpse, they wouldn't catch alight, would they?

Hmmm. A funeral pyre needs to be a pretty big thing; so a corpse /can/ be burned, but you need to take some effort to do it.

Maybe you need to take a torch (the flame-on-the-end-of-a-stick type, not the battery-operated type) and use it to seal the wound after the slurry is inserted into the heart. Possibly create a few ritual burns at specific locations. Hmmmm... fire is opposed to vampires, so one would expect it to hurt them... but perhaps the practical reason is that it burns away parts of the animating spell? Perhaps the original vampire enchantment was supposed to have them take no action unless explicitly ordered by a member of the right family, and these burns are basically ripping apart the parts of the enchantment that keep the new vampire's old mind sealed away?

Hmmm... and if that's the case, does the security programming revert if the wound ever heals? Do all vampires carry a burn scar on their chests that they have to take care to keep away from water? Or does the flesh heal back but leave the security programming broken?

  Blood nourishes wood -> stakes soak up the blood and get all magically charged and can be used for ????.

Magic wands. In these modern days when magic is all but forgotten, a blood-soaked stake is one of the few things that can act as a magic battery, quite beneficial to a mage who has some idea of how to use it (or even just one who has used too much magic and wants to use more)
