Or bankers, or actors, or, well, anyone succesful really. I wonder if any vampires are conducting human breeding projects? Are the Rothschilds just a family of vampire ghouls?

  So it's possible to usurp a ghoul, then? One vampire ghouling someone doesn't immunise him against everyone else?

I've actually never thought about it too closely. Even if you can't ghoul a ghoul, you can wait a week for the ghoul to become unghouled and then ghoul the ghoul. But can you ghoul an ex-ghoul of someone else, or must the ghouls you ghoul be previously your ghouls or never ghouled?

I kind of like the idea of a ghoul not being able to be ghouled by another vampire, even after the ghouling wears off; it keeps vampires from making moves on one another's ghouls, and as the connection is almost vaguely romantic it makes sense as something that would include some "loyalty". I do know that trying to take someone else's jannisary is considered VERY rude.

Indeed. That's probably the way of these things; a vampire gets money, gold bullion, etc and when they run low they just ghoul one of the local humans and get a source.

Thought: bitcoin makes getting untraceable money much easier. Satoshi is probably a vampire, or at the very least a ghoul. After all, for all the privacy advantages bitcoin as for us humans, it is FAR more useful for a vampire.
