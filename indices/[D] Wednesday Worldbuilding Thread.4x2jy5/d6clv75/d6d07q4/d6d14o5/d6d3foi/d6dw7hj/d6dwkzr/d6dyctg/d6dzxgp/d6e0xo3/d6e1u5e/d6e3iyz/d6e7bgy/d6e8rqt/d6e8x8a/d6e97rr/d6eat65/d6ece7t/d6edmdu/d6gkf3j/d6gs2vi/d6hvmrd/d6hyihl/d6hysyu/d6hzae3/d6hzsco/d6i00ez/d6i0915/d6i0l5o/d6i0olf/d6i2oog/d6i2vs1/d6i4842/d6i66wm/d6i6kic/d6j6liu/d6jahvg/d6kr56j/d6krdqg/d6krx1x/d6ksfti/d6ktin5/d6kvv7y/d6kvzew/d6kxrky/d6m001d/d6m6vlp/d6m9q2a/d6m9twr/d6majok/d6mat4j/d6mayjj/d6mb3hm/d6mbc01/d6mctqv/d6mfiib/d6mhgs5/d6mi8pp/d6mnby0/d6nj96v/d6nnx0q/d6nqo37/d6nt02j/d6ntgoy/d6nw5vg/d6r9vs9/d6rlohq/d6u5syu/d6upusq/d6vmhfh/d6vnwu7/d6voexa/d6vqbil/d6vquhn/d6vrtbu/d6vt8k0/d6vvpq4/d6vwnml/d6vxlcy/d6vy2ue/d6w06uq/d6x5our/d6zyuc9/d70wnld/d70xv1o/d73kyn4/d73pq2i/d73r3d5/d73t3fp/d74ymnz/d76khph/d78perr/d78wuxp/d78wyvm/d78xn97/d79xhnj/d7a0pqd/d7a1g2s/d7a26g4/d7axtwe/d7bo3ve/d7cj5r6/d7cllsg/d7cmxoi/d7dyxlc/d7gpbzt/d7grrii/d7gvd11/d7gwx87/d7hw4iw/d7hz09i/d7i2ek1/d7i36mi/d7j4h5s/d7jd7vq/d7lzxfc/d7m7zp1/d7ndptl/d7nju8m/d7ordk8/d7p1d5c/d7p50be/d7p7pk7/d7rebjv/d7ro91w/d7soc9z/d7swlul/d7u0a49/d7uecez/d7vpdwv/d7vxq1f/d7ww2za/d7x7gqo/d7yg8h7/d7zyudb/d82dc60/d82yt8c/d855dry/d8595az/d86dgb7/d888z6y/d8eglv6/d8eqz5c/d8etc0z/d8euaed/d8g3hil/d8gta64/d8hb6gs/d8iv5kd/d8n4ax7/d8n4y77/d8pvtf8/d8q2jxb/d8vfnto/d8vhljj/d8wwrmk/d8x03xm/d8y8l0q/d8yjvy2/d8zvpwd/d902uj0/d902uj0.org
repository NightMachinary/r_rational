  Had a discussion with my boyfriend about how the vampire "mind control" power worked, trying to make sure it wasn't too exploitable.
#+end_quote

Great!

Now let me see how I can exploit it.

#+begin_quote
  The person remembers what they did, but aren't horrified by it.
#+end_quote

Ooooooooh, now this /is/ exploitable.

Let's consider Sam. Sam has a daughter, Sally, who he loves with all his heart.

Let's consider a vampire, Vlad. For complex reasons outside of the scope of this example, Vlad wants Sam to kill Sally. The simple way to do this would be to put a hood on Sally... but no, Vlad wants Sam to knowingly kill Sally.

So. First thing Vlad does, he controls Sam, and asks him to spend five minutes imagining why it would be a good thing to kill Sally. Sam does so (since it doesn't involve actual harm to anyone), and, this is important, he /is not horrified/ by the idea that he just spent five minutes thinking about why it was a good idea to kill his daughter.

In fact, he'll make excuses to himself why it's acceptable to do so. "I didn't actually do anything," he'll tell himself. "I just thought about it. As a hypothetical situation."

Next day, Vlad controls Sam again, and asks him to describe circumstances that would lead to him killing his daughter. Sam suggests the possibility that he might shoot someone he thought was a stranger breaking into his house, only to find afterwards that it was his daughter - Vlad shakes his head, and asks Sam under what circumstances he would /knowingly/ kill Sally. Sam's at a loss, but he tries to come up with something - anything - that might satisfy Vlad's question. Maybe - maybe if it was necessary to save an entire city of people?

Next day, Vlad goes to Sally. He gives Sally some item of value (e.g. her mother's wedding ring) and Controls her. He tells her to sell the ring to his jannissary standing right over there in exchange for drugs, which she will hide in her room. Because of the Control, she thinks this is a great idea and does so. (She doesn't /take/ the drugs because (a) she is not stupid and (b) Vlad didn't tell her to do so).

It doesn't take Sam long to find out (Vlad will point him in the right direction if necessary) that his daughter sold her mother's wedding ring for drugs. (Doesn't matter that the bag of white powder is really cake flour). Now there's a definite rift between Sam and Sally. And, every day, Sam is being Controlled and asked to spend five minutes imagining the benefits of killing Sally.

In fact, just to desensitise Sam further, he might Control Sam and get Sam to kill a few total strangers - starting with borderline suicidal people who have been Controlled into begging to be killed and working up from there - just so that Sam is less horrified at the idea of murder at all.

...he still wouldn't do it on his own, but how long will it be until the rift between Sam and Sally is wide enough that Sam can be Controlled into killing Sally?

--------------

Okay, that's one way to get around the "he would never do that" problem. Now, second exploit - how to make someone do something both complex and long-term?

Easy solution. Control their boss. When Mr. Smith tells Tom from accounting to prepare an extremely complicated fifty-page spreadsheet and /not ask questions/, then Tom does it because he doesn't want to be fired - and Vlad only needed to Control Mr. Smith for one to five minutes.

  Yeah. I'm not sure what sort of themes I'm looking to explore with vampires. It's probably more in line with the standard Supernatural Romance tropes; they're sexy and other and dangerous and wise, rather than being tortured creatures, though they kind of are.
#+end_quote

Eh, fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  The readings in Latin are entirely the christian burial service that William is putting in because he's a religious guy. (Also because when he had it done to him thousands of years ago, he insisted on all that sort of stuff because he was worried about his immortal soul.) The only important part is really the sludge and closing the body up afterwards, so it can heal back together in one piece. That's why I'm thinking incorporating the fire would make things more interesting, as at the moment it's not clear exactly what's required.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Even if there's no scar left afterwards, the only place I can see fire fitting into that ritual is to cauterise the wound when it's done.

Wait... that, or the sludge has to be vomited into a bowl and then boiled before being added.

#+begin_quote
  Of course there's no doubt magic spells that prevent the magic reanimating a vampire from taking root in the area of effect.
#+end_quote

Of course. It might not even be the original purpose of the spell - a spell that causes (say) the smell of chamomile might just interfere with the nascent vampire's energies in just the wrong way.

#+begin_quote
  I think the drawbacks and tradeoffs were the things that were actually bothering me, since that's the way of, well, life.
#+end_quote

Makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  I'd also imagine you'd need a mage who was not only a one in a billion level mage, but a neurologist, to be able to do the sorts of things we're talking about
#+end_quote

Definitely a neurologist, but he might not need to be a one-in-a-billion level mage. I mean, how much magic force does it really take to nudge a neuron? (It takes a ton of /precision/, of course, so he'd need to be a seriously well-practiced mage, if if he doesn't have much magical muscle).

#+begin_quote
  we have no idea how memories are stored so how would a mage be able to begin to take effect iwth it?
#+end_quote

Magic has to follow rules, but it doesn't have to follow the same rules as everything else. And magic often works with high-level concepts.

Consider Sleeping Beauty. Magic puts her to sleep until such time as "true love's kiss" wakes her up. But how do we define "true love's kiss"? This is a high-level concept, which we can't translate in terms of neurons.

Or the idea that an inhabited structure prevents an uninvited vampire's entry. The idea of a structure makes sense, and so does the idea of an inhabited structure - but not so much on the atomic level. It's a high-level concept, but it /works/ with magic.

So, I see no reason why magic /wouldn't/ work with the high-level concept of memories. It just has to do so in a consistent, rule-based way.

#+begin_quote
  My boyfriend proposed a spell that removes the emotional component of the memory. So you still remember the bad stranger in the white van, but the memory doesn't cause you negative emotions.
#+end_quote

Yeah. That could also work.

...you don't want to remove /all/ negative emotions, though, because that leads to the horror story where the victim sees noting wrong in repeating the nightmare. Maybe just remove 90% of the negative emotions, to make it easier to deal with but still leave it as something to avoid.

#+begin_quote
  That's nasty. Eeep!
#+end_quote

It is, rather. I was thinking it would be a bit like the difference between dropping an anvil on someone versus dropping books one by on until he's carrying an anvil worth of weight - the eventual impact is equally large, but in the second case you've got a bit of time to adjust to the weight and not get crushed instantly.
