[[/twiponder][]] Hmmmm. Paralysis but not death. That fits with vampire myth, yes.

So the brain regenerates from damage, but regenerates in a blank state, leaving the vampire with permanent /mental/ damage. That's fair.

  I never thought about that before, but that sounds AWESOME. The canon does have 'vampires are comatose when the sun is up, but can resist it for several minutes with effort' going for it, though, which might make things tricky. Maybe it would be better if the brain-heart connection is the magic itself, it's a ying-yang sort of thing, once they are separated the magic is lost - makes things a lot.... cleaner.

Do you /want/ "clean"? This brainless vampire becomes a mindless but still dangerous beast, moving only at night (and perhaps even instinctively hiding from bright lights) but can still be destroyed by even reflected sunlight. It adds a whole new dimension of terror to vampire hunting; beheading the vampire interrupts all its plans and makes it stupid and animalistic, but /it can still kill the hunter/. Far better to set up a collection of mirrors and use sunlight to deliver the death blow...

  I feel like lava should be a problem but I can't think how it would be a problem but none of the above would be, so, I guess vampires can chill around lava. That actually sounds kind of neat. I'm imagining a pompeii vampire getting encased in hard lava like the folklore tales of frogs emerging, alive and somewhat pissed off, from inside rocks that are split in mines.

I'd imagine that even if it doesn't kill them, lava still /really really hurts/. Which just makes the trapped vampire even angrier. (Though that might be mitigated by the centuries he spent in complete sensory deprivation driving him insane...)

  The magic, 'spirit', whatever you want to call it of the sun. In my head it's Sol in particular; a vampire can watch the sunrise on Alpha Centauri with no ill effects, though a particularly ancient vampire would have to consult her star charts to ensure that Sol is not visible that night.
#+end_quote

Huh, now this is interesting. Okay, backstory time; why Sol in particular? What's so special about /this/ sun? What are the odds that vampires would live on a world whose sun is one of the very few things that can utterly, entirely, absolutely and /easily/ destroy them?

(I have some ideas about the answers to those questions...)

  It's quite concerning that they break the laws of thermodynamics.
#+end_quote

It is indeed, but there's a way around that as well. A starved vampire simply needs to continually take in energy from its surroundings. (This can be accomplished by simply reducing the temperature of said surroundings - never state /why/, just that everyone too close to the starved vampire feels a chill - which prevents anyone from using vampires to break conservation of energy)
