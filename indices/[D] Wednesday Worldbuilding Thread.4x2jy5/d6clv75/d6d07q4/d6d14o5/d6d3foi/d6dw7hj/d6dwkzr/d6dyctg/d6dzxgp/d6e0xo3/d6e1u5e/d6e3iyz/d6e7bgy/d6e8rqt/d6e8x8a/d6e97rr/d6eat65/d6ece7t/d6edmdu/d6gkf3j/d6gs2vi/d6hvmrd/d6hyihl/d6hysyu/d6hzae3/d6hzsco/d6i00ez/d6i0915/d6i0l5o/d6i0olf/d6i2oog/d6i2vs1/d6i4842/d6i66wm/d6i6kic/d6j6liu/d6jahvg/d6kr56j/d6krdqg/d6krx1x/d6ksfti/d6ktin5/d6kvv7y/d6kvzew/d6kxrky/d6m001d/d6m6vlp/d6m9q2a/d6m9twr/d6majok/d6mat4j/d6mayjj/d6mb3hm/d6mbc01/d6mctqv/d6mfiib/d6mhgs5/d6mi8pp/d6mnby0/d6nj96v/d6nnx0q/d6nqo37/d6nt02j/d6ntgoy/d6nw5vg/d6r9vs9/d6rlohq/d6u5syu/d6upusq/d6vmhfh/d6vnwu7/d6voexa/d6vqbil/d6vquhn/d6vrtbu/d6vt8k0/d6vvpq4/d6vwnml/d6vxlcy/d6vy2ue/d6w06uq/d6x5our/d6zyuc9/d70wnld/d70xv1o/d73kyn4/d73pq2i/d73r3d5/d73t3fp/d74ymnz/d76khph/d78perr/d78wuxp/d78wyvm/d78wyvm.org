  there's only one J.K. Rowling. How would they decide who gets her?

HAHAHA. I love this. Vampires care a lot about physical territory, so the vampire who owns the territory her mansion is in would have the obvious claim; however, if she does a speaking tour in your city, you'd do well to grab her, ghoul her to yourself, and then have her announce she's fallen in love with your quaint town and move there permanently. Rinse and repeat.

Are there any celebrities, past or present, who were known for being nomads?

More realistically I'd imagine usurping someone else's ghoul would result in retribution unless you were much stronger than them yourself. So the strongest vampires would have Bill Gates as a ghoul (hey, maybe all his charity work is just a smokescreen to hide the comparatively modest millions being siphoned into a vampire's shell corporation?), and your average well-to-do vampire would just have a local millionaire or two. After all, no need to get greedy, stick your neck out, and risk people coming after you, hey?

  they'd be bred for quantity of blood, flavour, obedience and loyalty. So they'd probably be of ruddy complexion, perhaps tending towards slightly plump, and act slightly like well-fed cattle.

Yes. With very high blood pressure and lots of cholesterol no doubt. They'd probably keep them well hydrated too, to keep that pressure up.
