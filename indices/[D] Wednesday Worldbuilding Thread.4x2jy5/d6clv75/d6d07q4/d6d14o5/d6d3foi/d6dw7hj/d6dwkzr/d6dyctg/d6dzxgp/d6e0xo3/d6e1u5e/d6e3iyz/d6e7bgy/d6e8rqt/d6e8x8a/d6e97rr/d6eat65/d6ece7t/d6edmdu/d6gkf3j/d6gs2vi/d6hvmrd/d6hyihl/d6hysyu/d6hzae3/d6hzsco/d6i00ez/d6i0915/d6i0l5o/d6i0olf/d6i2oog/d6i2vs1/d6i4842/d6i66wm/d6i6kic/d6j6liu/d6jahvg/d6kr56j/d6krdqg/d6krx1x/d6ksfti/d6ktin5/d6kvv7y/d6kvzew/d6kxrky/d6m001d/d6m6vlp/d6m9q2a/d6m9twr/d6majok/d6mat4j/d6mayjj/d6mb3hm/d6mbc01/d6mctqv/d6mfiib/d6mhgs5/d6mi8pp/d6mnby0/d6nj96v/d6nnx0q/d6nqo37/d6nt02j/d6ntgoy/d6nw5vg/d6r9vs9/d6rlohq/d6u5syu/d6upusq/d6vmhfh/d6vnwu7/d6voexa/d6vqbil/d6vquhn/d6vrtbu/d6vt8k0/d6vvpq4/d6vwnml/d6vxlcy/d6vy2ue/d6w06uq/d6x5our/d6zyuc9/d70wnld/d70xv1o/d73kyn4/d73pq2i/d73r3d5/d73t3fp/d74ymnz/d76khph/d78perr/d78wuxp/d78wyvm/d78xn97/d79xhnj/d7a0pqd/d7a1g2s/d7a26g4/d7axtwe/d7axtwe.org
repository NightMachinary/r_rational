  Useful - that means you can train up a butler and keep him pretty much indefinitely.

Exactly - a good ghoul is an /investment/ that will continue delivering returns almost indefinitely.

  It also means that vampires might be able to advertise and find volunteers for immortality.

Immortality with the catch of being a vampire's thrall with your will forever subservient to hers is not ideal.

  Start dying your hair a colour just a touch different to its natural colour and everyone will think you're going grey and hiding it.

Haha, yes.

  So, minor vampires are usually under the protection of major ones [in exchange for taking care of the chores].
#+end_quote

Yes, though the definition of "protection" and "chores" will vary from place to place.

  and a major thrust in modern biological research might come from a vampire who has collected a few of these eunuchs and wants to breed from them because he likes the taste

The first human clone was done 50 years ago, simply because an Eritrean vampire lord had been given a specimen from an extremely rare line, and said specimen was beginning to get a bit old. And, well, the lord didn't want to be without his fantastically rare treat.

Now, all that stuff people are saying about monsanto - terminator genes, infertile offspring, all the rest of it? That was started by a vampire trying to protect her bloodline. It works, too. You clone them or breed them with IVF and the children have the most noxious blood. Ugh.

More stuff to ponder: can vampires gain and lose weight? Can they train to have buff muscles? Does their hair continue to grow? On the face of it you'd think not, because they're magically animated corpses, but if the magic is strong enough to grow a new arm and brand new muscles that go with it, then surely it'd be strong enough to make an existing muscle more buff.

I can see a vampire having control over whether e.g. their hair grows or they gain weight, since they don't have to breathe but can pretend to. But if a vampire gluts on blood, where does that extra mass go?

Actually, canonically I believe vampires don't poop. Does that mean that vampires are just choc full of haemoglobin that they've accumulated over decades of blood meals? I suppose the cleanest way is for it to come out in their breath, but they don't need to breathe. Do they sweat it out? Or does their blood just become more and more treacle-like over time? That's kind of a cool thought.

When a vampirezombie (vombie? zompire?) grows from a piece of vampire heart, where does the extra mass come from? After all, you're talking at least 60kg of /stuff/, you can't get that just from dust.
