  Oh, on the subject of ghouls - did I mention that ghouls stop ageing until they stop drinking blood? I probably, did, right?

Huh. No, you /didn't/. Useful - that means you can train up a butler and keep him pretty much indefinitely.

It also means that vampires might be able to [[http://www.sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/980927][advertise and find volunteers]] for immortality.

  it can mean your ghoul might need to be... weaned, lest it stops aging and loses its cover.

Nah, the solution to that is make-up. Start dying your hair a colour just a /touch/ different to its natural colour and everyone will think you're going grey and hiding it.

  I do imagine vampires, though, as having huge swathes of territories, but major vampires have bigger territories that tend to completely encompass the territories of minor vampires. I guess kind of like predators in the wild; a lion pride will have a huge territory, and say two cheetahs might hunt in that same area, as well as 3 packs of hyenas, a dozen jackels, etc.

Hmmmm. So, minor vampires are usually under the protection of major ones. And then the minor vampires are expected to deal with minor threats so that the major vampire doesn't have to bother about them (and a minor vampire who fails to deal with, say, a reporter nosing about in the wrong place will anger the local major vampire and then will probably not want to hang around after that).

  Yeah, but ghouls need to be replaced every 20 or 30 years for best results and who has time for that? If humans get onto this whole bitcoin thing, then, well, they'll be set forever.
#+end_quote

...I see the point.

On the subject of human-breeding, it's easy to imagine different vampires producing different lines of humans - different flavours, as it were.

[[/e36][]]

These flavour lines might be jealously guarded (look at some of the things that humans breeding flowers have got up to for inspiration) - a traditional (perhaps somewhat extravagant) gift in certain circumstances might be a eunuch (so you can't breed from him) of their own private flavour line (and a major thrust in modern biological research might come from a vampire who has collected a few of these eunuchs and wants to breed from them because he likes the taste)
