I'm writing a jumpchain fanfic, in major part to try and get used to writing a lot quickly. Would enjoy being used to writing loads, getting into a routine.

In the story you are taken to a fictional universes, use point buy to buy various abilities, and live out your life in said universe for several years. I'm trying to work out how they would play out the fairly standard eating pokemon issues- pokemon are clearly smart enough to understand language, handle complex issues, use tools to say, build a playground, and people on occasion consume them. I'm trying to work out how a person would justify that if questioned.
