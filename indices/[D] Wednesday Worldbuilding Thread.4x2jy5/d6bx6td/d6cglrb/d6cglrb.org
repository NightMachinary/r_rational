Ask someone. I'm not a nuclear engineer, but I'm hoping to start doing research on solar physics in the next few months. I know a little bit more about stellar cores than nuclear bombs, but I may be able to help, or point you in the right direction for what to google.

The more niche and specific your questions are, the better.
