From the conversation on the discord server, I can answer some of these.

There was discussion about the possible non-development of audible language. There wasn't a conclusion, that I saw anyway. Personally, I think the development of audible language is still probable, but I may be misjudging it.

While the reason why humans develop radio-hearing is magical (Or at least, we haven't figured out how or why humans would evolve it. There was some mention of this being on another planet with more metal-rich surface soil, but it was still supposed to be about humans? So I don't know.), exactly how we radio-hear is not. I believe the general consensus was that humans have four antennae embed in their humeri and radii bones, with a couple bundles of electroceptive neurons in the elbow, and stacks of current-generating muscles in the upper torso.

I don't know the science behind how much energy it would take, being filtered through the human metabolic process, to generate a particular amplitude or frequency of radio waves. Abstractly, I assume the maximum amplitudes and frequency would be subject to improvement through training, under the model of the it being powered by muscular action.

The ability to disrupt other people's communication (and in particular, only /other/ people's) is probably fantastical, yes. But does mean that, in the future when radio technology external to the human body arises, it becomes another thing that could be disrupted, along with audio-hearing and sight.
