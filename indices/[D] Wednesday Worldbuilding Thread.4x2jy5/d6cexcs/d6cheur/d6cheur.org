Ouch. Some first impressions:

- Human bodies are equipped with some magical HAM radios? You have to pick the scope of the power before doing anything else.

  - Do you basically just want to write a story where all humans are telepathic without saying telepathy?
  - Radio technology is mostly used to transmit sound. If we had the ability to communicate on the radio since birth (or before), would our languages even use sound? Seems unlikely, depending on how the magic works.
  - If humans have this ability, did we evolve it? Were we granted it through divine intervention (or aliens)? If we evolved it, to what extent can other animals use this? How does that affect animal-human relations?
  - Even though we knew about radios and how they work, it took us a lot of time and theoretical plasma physics research to even attempt to use the ionosphere as a reflector for sending messages across the horizon. Even if we discovered it through trial and error, what makes you think any human body could produce the kind of transmitting/receiving power necessary to make this work?
  - Lastly, even though humans can currently hear more than one conversation at a time, we have a very hard time actually interpreting them and carrying out two conversations simultaneously. The sort of mass communication/coordination in battle that you're thinking of would be very hard to achieve through magic telepathy. In the middle of a pitched battle between two armies, the only difference between the light and sound is how easily light can propagate through it. Even then, if you put a bunch of radio transceivers in one place and have them all try to communicate with each other at the same time, you get the same problems than if you have a bunch of people in a room (or a battlefield) together and have them yell at the same time.

In conclusion: how would you make this different than having super-hearing, and how would you get around human processing power limitations?
