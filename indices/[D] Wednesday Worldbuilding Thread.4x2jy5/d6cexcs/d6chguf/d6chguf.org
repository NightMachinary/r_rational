I think the effect might not be as profound as you think. It's just ordinary talking, except "louder" - you can be radio-heard at longer ranges.

Radio waves are not unlike sound waves. They decay following the inverse-square law, and are also naturally deflected or absorbed by certain materials. Waves pass through one another, interfering but not interacting. Probably the biggest difference is that radio is effectively instantaneous while sound is limited to ~300m/s.

I said radio was longer-range than sound, but that really depends on how "loud" it is and how sensitive your "hearing" is. Depending on exactly how it works, the effective range could be, well, anything. For all I know it could be shorter-range than talking. Longer-range isn't necessarily better, either - as you know, if a large crowd all tries to talk at once then you'll be drowned out at more than a few centimetres. That effect would be much worse if your hearing was good enough to pick up noise from an entire city.

Another question is how wide the bandwidth that people can perceive, and how well they can distinguish between similar frequencies. The more sounds you can distinguish, the better you can pick out one person's voice from a crowd.

I don't think we'd see electronic warfare or battlefield-wide coordination, at least no more or less than we do in reality. Screaming at the enemy is not known to disrupt their conversation.

At least there aren't many natural sources of radio waves. I think it's just lightning bolts. No need for "ear protection" when doing, say, construction work.
