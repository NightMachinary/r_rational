Radiohumans. Humanity evolved with the ability to communicate radio signals with each other, generating radio traffic and such.

I don't have even rudimentary knowledge of radio physics, but I imagined that it will have profound effect on civilization.

Human beings will have to organize and solve problem regarding radio interference in a town, for example.

Ancient warfare also involved electronic warfare, with radio screamers disrupting communication on the other side. Combat is much more fluid with real-time coordination being done by radio.

Technology will advance faster simply due to more communication.

Some humans will figure out how to communicate using the ionosphere, creating a global communication network even before the age of sail.
