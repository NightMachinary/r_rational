I must have not made it clear enough, but I had in mind It being a posthuman with all of the physical abilities that it implies. Extreme durability, healing, and enhanced abilities. But all of that requires a lot of energy which is one of the reasons It wanted access to uranium. Therefore It must have used up most of it's energy reserves surviving the crash by focusing completely on protecting it's brain-equivalent and then spending three days afterwards regenerating a weaker, less energy-costly body.

This story is definitely poorly done, but it's the first time I actually manage to write something worthwhile (more than snippets and doesn't involve worldbuilding) in a few years. So for getting back in the hang of writing I feel that this is a decent start.
