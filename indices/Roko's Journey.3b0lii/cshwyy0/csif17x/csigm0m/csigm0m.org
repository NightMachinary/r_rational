  A slightly less specific comment about how far away the sun is, because it never seems closer no matter how far one walks, and then a comparative narration where these other suns must be even farther away would be fully within the capabilities of a rational paleolithic mind.
#+end_quote

That first requires one to conceptualize the sun as an object in Euclidean space, with an actual distance. That is not something you can take for granted in a paleolithic environment. Before you can say the stars are like the sun, you first have to say that the sun is like any other object. You can see that this was not at all the case in even historical times, as they were deified in myth and viewed as objects of an entirely separate class. The sky itself was not seen as an expanse of unending space, but a curtain or a bowl that the tribe lived underneath. Appealing to the nature of predation doesn't work either, because we /still/ have a hard time intuitively understanding the vast distances and scales in astronomy, or even /geography./ The scales a predatory mind can think of are on the order of hundreds of miles.

  Spoken like a rational person. Not a robot.

I think I realized my actual objection. The first sentence is completely unrelated to the following train of thought, and should have been placed after it. More description and deliberation would have been nice.

  In this world, where thinking carnivores eat thinking herbivores, and they can talk to one another, there's going to be a LOT of conversations about death and existence.
#+end_quote

Why would there be? Thinking humans killed thinking humans all the time, and actual ideas of a theory of mind came from institutionalized philosophy and science. Cannibalism was and still is a thing, and there isn't any special difference between human tribes and this circumstance that would imply that there would be /any/ cerebral thinking about that arrangement, especially without the benefit of writing to build up ideas that were already thought of. Cannibalism in tribes is religiously/spiritually rationalized, if I'm not mistaken, and given the clear sense of religion Roko's clan is shown to have, it would be a rationalization waiting to happen if it hadn't already.

In paleolithic times, all anyone would be doing is duplicating information, not moving beyond the same ideas anyone else has had. Insular, tribal cultures preying on one another, focused on survival as they are, would only serve to develop religion and the idea of an afterlife, with an instinctual sense of spirituality. The sense of perspective Roko has in the story is frankly bizarre, given that he was raised in this culture and /does not have the benefit/ of past thinkers to jump off of. You say that we didn't even try, but I say we weren't able to in the first place. Everything technological, economical, and cultural plays into this. Agriculture for supporting a population larger than farmers, writing for providing past work, and a tradition of philosophical thinking, which, like it or not, developed from the status and resources bestowed upon a developing religious caste, and eventually science itself. All of these things were necessary to build the ideas we take for granted today, and as a final blow, should I mention that Roko's iconoclasm is itself the rebuttal to the scenario you have hypothesized? If they developed a theory of mind, then it would not be a departure from the traditional beliefs that were depicted in the story.

  I agree that the idea of immortality is odd. I would think Roko would eat him because he was hungry, and the being might be shocked and reply something along the lines of "You would eat someone who speaks to you?" And then "If I did not, I would starve."

I do not find the idea of immortality odd in this setting, as it was conceptualized in myth and it comes naturally out of a fear of death. I was objecting to the idea that Roko's first thought would be making everyone immortal. The idea of eating him to obtain his power is entirely natural. Bull testicles give you strength.
