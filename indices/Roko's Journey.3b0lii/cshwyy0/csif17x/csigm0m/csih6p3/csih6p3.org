There is one other thing to consider. A lot of your arguments are based on human interactivity with myths. What if these beings were rational, and simply rejected unprovable theories. No gods. No myths. No superstition. Plenty of mistakes and mis-attributions, certainly, but if a reason for it isn't known, they don't just make things up randomly. They assign it as unknown.

You seem to be basing a lot on an assumption that irrationality is unavoidable in a primitive society.

EDIT. Hrm, there is a mention of a circle of life. They are clearly not fully empirical. Perhaps simply more so than humans were before technology.
