  “I tricked you into rushing the eaters to all attack at once when you saw some of us moving towards the dam, but I already convinced the swimmers to break the dams themselves beforehand and drowned all of your forces. I was trying to kill you outright, but you managed to survive hitting the rocks even though most of the other eaters died.”

Yes, allow me to monologue my plan at you while I assume you are unable to escape, to the benefit of neither of us.

  If the tiny stars are truly same as the Sun, then that could mean they are specks of the same things which make up the Sun...No, it implied that they all are the same, which means the stars have to be very far away, so far that I would never reach them.

This would require a concept of distance and scaling not particularly available to paleolithic-level tribes.

  “If you are immortal or very long-lived, then that means there is something unusual about your body which has a possible chance of being passed on to others. You also have shown an utter disregard for the lives of others. You will only use others for your goal of departure. You are too dangerous to be allowed to live.”

  If it was possible for one being to become immortal, then it could be possible for everyone to become immortal.

This would require a sense of altruism that would simply not come from a tribal hunter who eats sapient beings. He sustains himself by eating others, and would not be particularly disposed to bestowing immortality upon a pleasurable form of sustenance.

  Without any memories, you weren't the same being from life to life.

This would require a proper theory of mind on a level that took us hundreds of millennia to reason out. At this point you're simply dressing up rationalist tropes and dropping them into your character's mind without regard for your setting.

Short answer, no, I didn't like this.
