Normally I don't like criticism because they usually boil down to only saying "I don't like this", but unlike most other criticism you actually provided very good and clear reasons why. Awesome.

I freely admit being rushed with this story and just shoehorned in the monologue to hint to the reader what the trap was like instead just skipping over without any mention. I'll have to put in the work to actually add in the scene without being lazy about it tomorrow.

I had taken for granted how seemingly self-evident how the size of an object shrinks with increasing distance and am really surprised by this. Do you know why it's not an obvious thing?

The memory one was definitely poorly done but I didn't even realize it since it's a concept I have known for the majority of my life.

Thanks for being a helpful Wise Reader!
