"Roko's Basilisk" was a thought experiment brought up by Roko (a once-poster on LessWrong) with potentially cognitively damaging implications. To avoid distress, Eliezer deleted the comment, with predictable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect][Streisandian]] consequences. It's a topic of some infamy around these parts.

The term "Basilisk" or "Langford Basilisk" for cognitive hazards comes from the short story [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLIT_%28short_story%29][B.L.I.T.]] by David Langford, which proposed the idea of visual patterns that could damage the brain by subverting the visual cortex.
