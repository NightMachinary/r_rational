/Jaw drops/

I was only using the name 'Roko' due to a preference for four-letters and two-syllabic sounds as the common shared patterns used by the animals.

I had completely forgotten about 'Roko's basilisk'!

Argh! /Now/ I have an awesome ending to write and I can't do any writing until tomorrow!

Thanks for the explanation.
