Monologue is done very often in prisoner interrogations, explaining how law enforcement broke down the behavior of criminals, hoping for reactions or clues. Roko wants information. He's got a broken enemy in front of him. Perfect opportunity to get answers, interrogation style.

The comment about "so far away that I would never reach them" I agree with. A slightly less specific comment about how far away the sun is, because it never seems closer no matter how far one walks, and then a comparative narration where these other suns must be even farther away would be fully within the capabilities of a rational paleolithic mind. Also remember, this is a predator. Visual-based predators have extremely good concepts of distance and position. If they didn't, they wouldn't eat.

Spoken like a rational person. Not a robot. Though I would have interspersed it with thought-related activities, like pacing back and forth. Gnashing of teeth. Perhaps some inner dialog.

I agree that the idea of immortality is odd. I would think Roko would eat him because he was hungry, and the being might be shocked and reply something along the lines of "You would eat someone who speaks to you?" And then "If I did not, I would starve."

It did not take us hundreds of millennia to reason out a proper theory of mind. We didn't even try until recently. In this world, where thinking carnivores eat thinking herbivores, and they can talk to one another, there's going to be a LOT of conversations about death and existence. I could see them developing a theory of mind before they have complex tools, with that sort of prompting occurring so regularly.

I like this. It has weaknesses, but I believe them to be addressable, provided that the reader is nudged and prompted into recognizing that Roko's world is different.
