  What if these beings were rational, and simply rejected unprovable theories.
#+end_quote

Except they aren't.

  should I mention that Roko's iconoclasm is itself the rebuttal to the scenario you have hypothesized? If they developed a theory of mind, then it would not be a departure from the traditional beliefs that were depicted in the story.
#+end_quote

They are clearly depicted as having irrational beliefs, with Roko being the rational iconoclast to contrast their beliefs with.

#+begin_quote
  You seem to be basing a lot on an assumption that irrationality is unavoidable in a primitive society.
#+end_quote

I am not. I simply claim that rationality in a primitive society would not manifest in the ways you are claiming, and that inferential distance precludes many of the logical leaps that Roko makes in this story. Inferential distance is actually a rational thing when you don't have a community of experts to defer to.
