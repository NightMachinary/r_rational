  I had taken for granted how seemingly self-evident how the size of an object shrinks with increasing distance and am really surprised by this. Do you know why it's not an obvious thing?

It is not that foreshortening isn't obvious (it is, to the point that it's engrained in our visual cortex), but rather that the Sun simply doesn't behave like any other objects. It belongs to a separate class of object, with the moon and the stars, which don't change in (apparent) visual angle no matter how far you walk towards them (The whole round-planet thing doesn't help either, not that we could walk a recognizable distance towards the sun if it weren't). The reconciliation of this would require a more sophisticated observation, that objects farther away vary in visual angle less with the same distance traveled, and that the sun's invariance to approach (besides the fact that you're walking on a rotating ball) despite its visual angle is due to its massive size and distance.
