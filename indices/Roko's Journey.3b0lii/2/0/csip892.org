Huh? Why would a basilisk be an 'it' in any way? Aren't they creatures with the ability to petrify others with their gaze? That wouldn't mean they couldn't have a gender.

The 'it' phrasing was meant to only show how alien the posthuman is to the uplifted animals without spending time on any descriptive details....as well as it's lack of an observable gender.
