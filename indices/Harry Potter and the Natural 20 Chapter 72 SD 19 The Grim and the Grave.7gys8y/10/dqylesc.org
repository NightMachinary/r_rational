Reread the whole thing to get caught back up; it had been a while since I did so! I'm finding the third book to be pretty good, but it has a much different feel than the first two. It felt much more... serious, I suppose? There were still jokes and comedy, but overall it felt more like the author wanted to get on with the story rather than actually just let it continue paralleling the books. The Fiona chapters in particular were just super stressful. I wonder if he just lost the enjoyment of the writing and quit for a few years because of that?

Anyway, the new chapter was a welcome return, and while Sir Poley's tumblr said he doesn't have a set schedule for updates, hopefully we'll see more coming before too long. He has some clean-up to do to dust off the cobwebs; his intro on fanfiction.net is out of date (references having an updated character sheet on his Author page, but none exists), his forum page is full of advertising spam, and his tumblr updates infrequently. Hope this becomes a central project for him again soon!
