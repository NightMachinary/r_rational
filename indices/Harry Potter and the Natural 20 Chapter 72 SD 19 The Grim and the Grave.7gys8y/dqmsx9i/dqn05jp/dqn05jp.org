I'd also be really keen for a synopsis!

(incidentally, does anyone know if modern automatic summarization algorithms can understand narrative structure yet? I tried running the first chapter of HPN20 through smmry.com, which is what autotldrbot uses, but the output wasn't very good. Then I tried genericSummary() in the {LSAfun} R package and it was a bit better but still rather lacking. It looks like TensorFlow has some applications that allow fancier text summarization (i.e. not just important sentence selection) so I might try firing that up later tonight to see what it gets me. Not really my field though so I was wondering what the current state of the art is -- I've seen some articles on using RNNs to write /new/ stories but googling around can't seem to find any devoted purely to summarizing existing ones; edit: it looks like [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02268][this]] and [[http://thescipub.com/PDF/jcssp.2016.178.190.pdf][this]] might be worth adding to my to-read pile, and [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf][this]] looks pretty recent so I might try playing around with their TensorFlow/Python [[https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator][code]])
