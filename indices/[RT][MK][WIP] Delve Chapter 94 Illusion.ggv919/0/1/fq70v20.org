I don't think the DKE was naive. Remember that this was a sneak attack army sent to capture Fel Sedanis before it was under the control of the DKE, so it was not unreasonable for the DKE to assume the army would have been scaled to be able to take the city, no more. I believe the narration mentions the Lightbreaker is the Empire's most powerful individual tool. Without him this strike force would have trounced the army. There is a whole war going on, the DKE had no way of knowing he was allocated here. And they need to be careful about allocating their own resources.

Besides, as long as the barrier stands, DKE has no immediate need to relieve Fel Sedanis. I believe this was more of a "that army was unprepared for a siege, we can probably destroy it cheaply"-attack, than a "we really want to relieve Fel Sedanis, let's send as many people as it takes to break the siege" one.
