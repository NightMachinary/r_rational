I'd honestly like to see that rather than the 1000th "secret special power no one knew about" completely pulled out of the author's ass that we usually see in other web novels.

EDIT: a story doesn't need secret powers to be interesting. The unexpected and interesting parts can be the events, the interaction between characters, the setting as a whole.
