One strength I feel has been sorely lacking: Novelty.

The fantasy that LitRPG sells might be about increasing power levels, but if there were one stat, Might, and it increased in one way, lifting-heavy-things, it would be boring no matter how much more powerful the protagonist got each chapter and it would be awkwardly burdened by that even if its plot made it otherwise the next Great American Novel.

By being a litRPG rather than a standard fantasy novel or Wuxia, the author can introduce scores of classes, builds, skills, synergies, alternative paths and power sources, etc. that could never be implemented in full in a tabletop or computer RPG, and these are exciting - even when they're mechanically shallow dressing, good dressing and competent writing lets the reader enjoy the fantasy that there's more beyond what is canonically exposed and fixate on how "cool" it all is. Brandon Sanderson does this some with the different magic systems in his Cosmere (well, except that it isn't shallow at all in this way), and this inspires a ton of theorycrafting and fantasizing over on its fan platforms. LitRPG lets you tap into the same thing as in the Cosmere, add tons more of it in every chapter, and not have to write a separate novel for each new magic system to flesh it all out.

The downside is that positing a "real world" RPG System/HUD is clunky, awkward, heavy-handed, and difficult not to make be a lazy solution to achieving the story you want. If it is going to be included it needs to earn its keep, not be something you could do as well without and still tell the same story.
