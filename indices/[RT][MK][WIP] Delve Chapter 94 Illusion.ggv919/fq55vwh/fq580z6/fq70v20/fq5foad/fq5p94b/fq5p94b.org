  I hope that one of the accolades can give him a temporary skill point, as that would give him access to (almost) the same tricks as Ameliah for unlocking prerequisites and getting synergies.

Which is probably why it won't work like that. Ameliah has a legendary class; it's unlikely for a single accolade to measure up to what her class provides. If anything, I imagine a skillpoint accolade acts like a consumable; gives you an extra skillpoint, but is destroyed in the process.
