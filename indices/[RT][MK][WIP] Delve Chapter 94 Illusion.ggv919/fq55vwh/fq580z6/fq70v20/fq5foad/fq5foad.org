  Also I'm getting more and more curious what OP build Rain is going to discover.

I hope that one of the accolades can give him a temporary skill point, as that would give him access to (almost) the same tricks as Ameliah for unlocking prerequisites and getting synergies.

He has seven more Wards visible and fifteen other auras (including Suppression and Fall). Leveling all 15 non-Wards to lvl 10 should be relatively easy for him, and would give him an Aura Synergy multiplier of 3.3x (instead of his current 1.8x). Somehow leveling the Wards as well would boost it to 4.0x. This would result in a 240m range at 24x power with extend/amplify/focus (or 190m @ 48x, or a 0m @ 139.2x, depending on Aura Compression.) It could still be doubled by Channel Mastery.

That would also unlock Prismatic Intent, which is a huge power boost on its own.

--------------

Has anything been said about T4 skills? I assume that it would take 100k XP to unlock a tree, but I don't think that it's been completely ruled out yet. Specifically, if he tried it and de-leveled to 13 from the XP loss, then he could (mostly, kind of, probably) pull off the tricks I outlined above.

My main concern with this idea (other than whether it's possible at all) is if it's too much soulstrain for him to ever handle. He only has ~130 T3 skill trees left to unlock, and I'm not sure if that's enough to train his soul to lose that much XP at once, especially since he's just barely over having problems with spending 22000 XP spread throughout the day.

--------------

I wonder how quickly he could build his Focus/Clarity tolerance if he just alternated between Winter and Velocity singularities, and whether that would boost his general stat tolerance in the same way. He has quite a bit of room to grow before he maxes out the ring. If equipment limits are based on total XP instead of actual level, then he could get quite a bit more powerful without any more changes.
