Honestly seems a little naive by the DKE. The empire attacks one of their cities, surely the army would be ready to deal with a counter attack. Now they're down another two high level citizens.

Also I'm getting more and more curious what OP build Rain is going to discover. The last couple chapters have been filled with super high level potential opponents he's obviously going to have to deal with eventually. Even if he just needs to get to the "don't get squished like a bug" level, he's got a ways to go.
