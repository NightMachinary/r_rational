Hypothesis: The leveling system in Delve is a safety mechanism to prevent players from accidentally killing themselves via soul strain.

So, we know from Jamus (and Incarns) that boosting someone's stats high enough can cause severe damage and eventually death. We also know that some forms of soul strain are directly tied to player level (Equipment). What if the leveling system was put in place by the System's designer to prevent people from leveling up until their soul can handle it? It would explain why some abilities (the Watch's truth sense) seem to read Rain as a higher level than he is, because without this safety mechanism, his soul would be over level 25 in most aspects anyway. Narratively, it explains why so much emphasis has been given to soul strain and the gold ring, and why this pushup sequence in the cave is so important. Rain is not going to make his own essence monster out of a Crystal Slime, he's going to strengthen each aspect of his soul to the point that the System recognizes that he can safely level up to 19. This hypothesis explains why all of the Monolithic classes can come so close to accidentally killing themselves, but none of them do. They are the "edge cases", with the System designed such that they just barely cannot commit suicide without the use of equipment or another player's abilities.

I wonder if Essence Monsters give you some sort of temporary soul strain resistance, allowing you to level up without dying. This would explain why it is transferable within a certain period of time, because it is temporary anyway. You've got a week to naturally build up some soul strain resistance to a level where the stats you've gained won't kill you.
