Well this chapter shows us that if you are powerful and thus rich enough, there is no such thing as old enough to start killing blues if there are items that no-sell that much damage for a while. Just make sure the first one is known not to have any surprises.

Edit: no, wait, he didn't even have to solo his first one, just the one that took him above 5? Just go together and kill any small blue.
