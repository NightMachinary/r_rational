Did we hear about that lightdude before? I can't remember...

Can't Rain pretty easily test if an item is magical? They tend to be more durable than nonmagicals. Especially weapons and armor. So try to damage them a bit?

What was Val's stated reason of wandering around? Why didn't this lightdude just help him find some blue he could kill, instead of him having to wander around.
