The pacing issues of the last few chapters are ridiculous. The watch is ambushing Velika! Lavarro is attacking Westbridge! The empire is attacking Fel Sadanis! Oh man, finally all this build up is going to be rewarded! Nah, we spend a bunch of chapters of rain doing math in a dark cave. Oh and he gets a pet slime. It's cute.

Lightbreaker is too dumb to be sympathetic -- he knows Fecht is powerful, but there are at least two others of similar power. Oh, I can't take the empire killing so many people, best help them kill a bunch of people. Also you'd really think the DK citizens would be smarter -- apparently Lightbreaker is a well known enemy and they still get tricked everytime. Obviously the empire thinks they can kill a few citizens, or they wouldn't be there.
