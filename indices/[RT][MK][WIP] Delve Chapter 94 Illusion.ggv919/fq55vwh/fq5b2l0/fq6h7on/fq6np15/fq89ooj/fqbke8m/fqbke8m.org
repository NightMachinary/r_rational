The Citizens seem universally overconfident. Possibly because the only way to become a Citizen is to aggrandize yourself so hard that they take notice. They also seem to think that whatever the glass-sphere artifact is, it makes them more powerful than any other group, when really it just elevates relatively-strong people to very-stronghood in a world where the upper tiers of power are unknown. Their whole setup is overconfidence incarnate.
