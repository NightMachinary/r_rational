I guess you meant the difference between 41 and 50.

But a better way of thinking about it is that when something is exponential, the power ratios are the same for equivalent level differences. If someone at level 10 is twice as powerful as someone at level 1, then if it is exponential we can conclude that someone at level 50 is twice as powerful as someone at level 41.
