  it's unlikely for a single accolade to measure up to what her class provides.

It really doesn't measure up, and Rain's build can take advantage of the (hypothetical) skillpoint accolade better than anyone else.

Ameliah's class lets her basically respec into anything she wants, with fewer limits than people who choose that build from the start. The accolade lets people use one chosen skill and put ranks into others.

If Rain got a full-respec at-will ability, he would be much more powerful. He could still get full ranks in everything, but he could also:

- Use Prismatic Intent, Immolate, and Heat Ward at the same time to level Heat Ward, and the same for other elements.
- Drop Immolate and Refrigerate, and replace them with the vastly-superior Shear, freeing up a skill point.
- Probably see a couple hidden skills that he would meet the loosened restrictions for.

Furthermore, /most/ people can't get a skill to level 10 in a day, which makes the accolade a specialized advantage for Rain instead of a general one. How many people would lose access to a lvl 10 skill in exchange for a bit of synergy?
