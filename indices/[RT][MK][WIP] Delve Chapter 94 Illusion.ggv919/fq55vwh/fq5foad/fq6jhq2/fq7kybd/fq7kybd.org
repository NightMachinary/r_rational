His /build/ is focused on auras, but his /class/ is just "bet it all on mana regen"

It wouldn't make sense for the mana regen class to upgrade into a "center your auras around other objects" class, considering there's no inherent link between auras and mana regen. Maybe his focus on auras will give him the ability to switch to an aura-focused class, but that would almost certainly remove the huge boost to mana regen from Dynamo, so it would have to be incredibly powerful to be worth taking.
