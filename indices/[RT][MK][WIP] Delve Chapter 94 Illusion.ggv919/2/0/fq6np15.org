Given what Val implied about his dad (that he's dead, not that he's captured, at least IIRC) I think the inference to draw wrt Lightbreaker being too dumb is that he's been magically brainwashed. He's always described as the man in chains too, even though I don't think he's literally chained up.

I've got no excuses for the DKE Citizens though.
