So I recently realized that I'm very drawn to stories that play with being very meta-aware. It's hard to define, but it basically boils down to characters who are aware that their lives have tendency to follow literary/narrative rules over normal/every-day reality. But it's not being [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][Genre Savvy]], rather it's a step beyond it. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness][Medium Savvy]] is close, but it goes too far since I don't want stories where the characters are literally aware of being in a book.

It's hard to clearly explain what stories have to do to have this quality, but I have list of recommendations that I hope help fill in the inference gap.

[[https://korridor.rip/][Game By God: Sludge Reformation]] - a murder mystery game show with 16 contestants who are well aware of the tropes of their genre.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] - where heroic fantasy tropes are actual laws of the world instead of mundane physics and a young girl seeks out to be on top in an evil empire which is crumbling due to Good and Evil being out of balance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] - a guy gets thrown into a world of fantasy that was recreated from his DnD sessions. Really plays with the idea of being a character in your own story.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]] - a girl wakes up with Gamer powers with the classic abilities to level up and increase stats. It has the twist that she's an eroge gamer rather than the classic RPG gamer and she actually takes the time to question and investigate why she has these powers instead of taking them for granted unlike the protagonists of other gamer stories.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Thursday-Next-Novel-Book/dp/B00WKNLISI][A Thursday Next Novel]] - a seven book series where people know they are characters in a story and act as if they are living real lives with the ability to move from story to story. Thursday Next is a Special Operative in literary detection who needs to rescue kidnapped literary characters.

The following three are all kinda of similar where they are Korean-translated stories where the protagonist are reading a story and then became a character in the story, but they don't do enough with the concept (except Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint). I'm still including the other two since they at least flirt a little with what I'm trying to convey.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-novels-extra][The Novel's Extra]] - Author is sucked into his own unfinished story of a modern heroic fantasy world to fight monsters and humans.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/trash-of-the-counts-family][Trash of the Count's Family]] - Reader is sucked into the story of a medieval Asian high fantasy world to survive a coming war and he only read the first five volumes.

[[https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/][Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]] - Reader is living through a game-like apocalypse where he read the entire series, but there were numerous unanswered questions about the original story. It's the only one out of the three that has the main character actually take the time to question and wonder about why he is in a story.

Can anyone recommend similar works with themes of meta-awareness?
