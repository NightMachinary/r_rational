"Kaguya wants to be confessed to" is one of the best romcom I've read in years.

I wouldn't consider it particularly rational, but it has some of the best plot consistencies I've seen and better lore than some sci-fi/fantasy works. You can go much deeper than you would expect for a romcom.

The manga is at chapter 135, and the post for it is the highest rated chapter discussion on [[/r/manga][r/manga]], while the anime is one of the most popular airing anime of the season (on reddit at least).

Give it a try. Many people (including myself) say that the first 10/15 chapters or the first 2 episodes are rougher than the rest. I myself didn't start falling in love with the work until chapter 20, after which it slowly became the highlight of my week.
