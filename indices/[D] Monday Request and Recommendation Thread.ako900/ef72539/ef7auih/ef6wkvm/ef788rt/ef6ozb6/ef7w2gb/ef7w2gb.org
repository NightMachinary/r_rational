Has anybody here found any rational or rational-adjacent cosmic horror? I recently finished some bloodborne fanfiction and they are really fun, but their cosmic horror aspects are often pretty lacking. A lot of them don't include horror elements and the ones that do merely borrow the aesthetic. Sigh.

An important part of cosmic horror in my opinion is cultivating a sense of mystery. You can't just say “ohh look at these tentacles, mankind wasn't supposed to know about these tentacles, they'll make you go maaaaaaad!” You're just borrowing the aesthetic. You have show the reader that these things are mysterious and horrific rather than just saying so or using standard ‘eldritch horror' signals.

Lovecraft did a decent job of this in some of his stories and, surprisingly, HPMOR did as well, although it was not the focus of the story and barely received any screentime as result.

EDIT: I think a rational approach to cosmic horror would work well because you couldn't just blithely accept that the horror elements are inherently mysterious, and as a result you have to do the legwork that lazy attempts at cosmic horror avoid. ie the quintessential rational protagonist when approaching some "eldritch god" might investigate it, with various hypotheses that explain it along the way. Each of these are disproven which helps convince the reader that this might be inherently mysterious after all.
