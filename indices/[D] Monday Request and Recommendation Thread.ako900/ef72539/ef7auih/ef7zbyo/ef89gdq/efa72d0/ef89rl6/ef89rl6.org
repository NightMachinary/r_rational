Reminded of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]], which I've been rereading; you're already aware of it but for the sake of those who may not be. A D&D character is translated into the HP universe, and operates using his knowledge of narrative logic as well as D&D rules. There are two complete "books" and one in progress (but the updates are no longer regular).
