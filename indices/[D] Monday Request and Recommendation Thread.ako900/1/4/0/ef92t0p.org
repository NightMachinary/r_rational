The Novel's Extra and Count's Family are both hosted on [[https://wuxiaworld.com][wuxiaworld.com]] which is a site that prides itself on having professional level translation so these two are at least well-written if you like the plots. I usually only read translated books from wuxiaworld because of this.

Omniscient Reader doesn't have as good of a translator, but the plot and setting is really /novel/ in a lot of ways and I found it made up for the not as good translation.

Depends on which is more important to you: plot or translation quality.
