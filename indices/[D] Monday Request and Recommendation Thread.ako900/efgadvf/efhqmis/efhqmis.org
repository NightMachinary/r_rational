These are the three main web serials i read too, having slowly dropped over time all the other serials recommended in this sub. The two best pieces of online fiction that i've read recently that are comparable in quality were actually Harry Potter fanfic:

Hermoine Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation

Applied Cultural Anthropology, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus

The former is rational/ist and the latter is at at the least rational adjacent. Both are currently incomplete and may remain that way for some time though. Also, if you haven't read through the backlog of Alexander Wales, the author of Worth The Candle, you should. Metropolitan Man and The Dark Wizard of Donkerk are especially great.
