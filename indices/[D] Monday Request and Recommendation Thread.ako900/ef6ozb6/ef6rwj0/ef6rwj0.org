If you want a fun sword and sorcery romp, try [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron][Cold Iron]]. A poor young man studying magic and sword fighting at /the/ University in an alternate Byzantium gets caught up in a conspiracy. Very well written book, especially the beginning (you don't see that a lot).
