The creator of /CORDYCEPS/ recently released a new Nanowrimo story by the name of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw][Dave Scum]]. He's [[https://itsbenedict.tumblr.com/post/182357227759/man-i-feel-kind-of-bad-about-how-nanowrimo-went][expressed disappointment]] over how it turned out, but personally I thought it was excellent barring the ending.

Highly recommended to those interested in reading about a funny man exploiting time travel mechanics in increasingly clever ways in order to save the world.
