Is it necessary to have read the Harry Potter books to fully appreciate Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation? I mean, I watched all the movies, but I know that the books normally have much bigger deal of details.\\
Also, I will surely take a look at the other works of the author of Worth the Candle, I never knew he had written something else, thank you for the recommendations.
