Have you tried the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] or the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/215776-destiny-s-crucible][Destiny's Crucible]] series? Both are portal fantasy 'uplift' stories, where the MC tries to introduce modern tech to a backwards people. World of Prime is pretty good, but has a rough 1/3 or so of the first book.

Destiny's Crucible drags on a bit too long, and I found the ending a bit unsatisfying, but it's decent enough.
