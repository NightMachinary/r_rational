Read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53546.The_Reluctant_Swordsman][The Reluctant Swordman]] based on last week's rec thread mention. It was an OK read, but not particularly great; while the adventures are engaging, only one or two characters are interesting at all, and it's hard to cheer for MC who wins mostly by deus ex fiat. Read it if you're looking for an easy action flick and have nothing better to do :P
