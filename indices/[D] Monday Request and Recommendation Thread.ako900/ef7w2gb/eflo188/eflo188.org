The perfect example of what you want is actually the SCP series "There is no Antimemetic Division", and all the subsequent mini-series that followed after it. (Quality dips for spin-offs written by other members of the forum.)

Anti-memes are anomalies that erase information/memeories about themselves. An amazing premise that the original author realizes to an incredible extent. The best I've ever seen comic horror done.
