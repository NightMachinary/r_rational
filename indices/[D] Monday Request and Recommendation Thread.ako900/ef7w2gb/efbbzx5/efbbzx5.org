Try [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14][14]] and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23164927-the-fold][The Fold]] by Peter Clines. Both are set in the same metaverse, with different stories and characters. 14 is my favorite, a horror mystery with an apartment that is just a tiny bit off, and every new detail only makes it weirder. The Fold is also very good, but I found the big reveal a bit more predictable.
