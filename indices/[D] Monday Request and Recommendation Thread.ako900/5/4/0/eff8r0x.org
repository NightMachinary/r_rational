There's a blood procurement chapter in /The Rhesus Chart/ that's just about the epitome of what I think of when I think of this subreddit. Impeccably researched, reveling in what things look like in the real world, and just about everything that I could ask for in a combination of infodump and investigation.

I would agree more rational adjacent than rational, though it depends on which book in the series you're talking about.
