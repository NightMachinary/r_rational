What would you recommend that updates very regularly (e.g. weekly or more often)?

The only things I have this category are webcomics - I was reading With this Ring and found the daily update schedule added quite a nice element to my day, but I was getting a bit tired of it and decided the recent forum move (and to a lesser extent the events leading to it) was a good prompt to stop. I'm wondering if there's anything good to replace it with.
