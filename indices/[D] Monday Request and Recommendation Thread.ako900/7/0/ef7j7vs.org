Can you be clear on what you want? Just asking for something that updates frequently is too vague, because there's a lot out there that updates regularly.

Web serials like [[https://www.parahumans.net/][Ward]] are updating with multiple chapters per week.

There's fanfiction authors who update their stories on a weekly basis like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran][Coeur Al'Aran]] who writes amazing RWBY stories.

There's wuxia stories on [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/][wuxiaworld.com]] and [[https://webnovel.com][webnovel.com]] (although this site charges for the latest chapters, be warned) that update on a daily basis.

Your request is too broad. Can you specify what you are interested in that I can recommend something that is updating frequently?
