If you've got a VR headset, I highly recommend [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/889480/Virtual_Virtual_Reality/][Virtual Virtual Reality]]. My only gripe with it is after the ending, where you ursurp administrator priviledges and acquire the ability ascend the stack of heretofore inaccessible realities above the ones you start out in. The topmost one is some lame tumbleweed minigame. Where I find that thematically it would've been perfect to shut down your actual RL VR headset when you attempt to ascend past the one below it.
