That's not the definition of homophobia, esp. not once you attach the word "raging" to it; it's disingenuous to pretend that /all you meant/ was "is opposed to gay marriage and gay sex."

As to your second comment, I see you're an expert with personal experience, so I'll defer to your authority under the rules of "it takes one to know one." Interesting that you think an appropriate strategy for combating hatred involves the use of misogynistic slurs.

Also, thanks for providing a ready example of the type of person I was referencing. Saves me from having to go find a source to cite.
