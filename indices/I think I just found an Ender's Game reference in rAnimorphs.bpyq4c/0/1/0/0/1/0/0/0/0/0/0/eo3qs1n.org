I ... sort of? ... disagree with b)

I think he's passionate, but I think the /root/ of the passion is something like /desire for humans not to suffer in hell./ Like, I really genuinely believe that the root of his passion is /compassion,/ and thus "raging" is inexcusably misleading (like those posts that insist on humanizing Hitler, because /if we forget Hitler was human, and think of him only as a cackling caricatured monster, we'll fail to recognize the next Hitler)/.

Which makes this all the more tragic. I think OSC is looking at humans like a doctor, and being like, "what could possibly cause us to be this way, to each other and to ourselves?" and he's decided to blame it all on biology and man's fundamentally flawed nature (because that's what he was told, over and over again his whole life).

And so you have someone who a) wants the world to be good, b) thinks he knows what's bad, c) thinks he knows /why/ what he thinks is bad, is bad, and d) is trying to get that message across with the absolute minimum of trespass, but /thinks the minimum trespass still requires telling people that their sexual behavior is wrong./

That's ... tragic. Imagine living that life. Oof.

I don't think his passion comes from innate revulsion. I think it comes from ... well, /because he was never taught better or raised correctly,/ ironically enough.

The reason I keep drawing this line is because of something like, I find myself imagining that I'm back in the classroom, teaching again, and I've got two eleven-year-old boys in front of me who are fighting, and like, sure, on the object, policy level I'm on the side of the kid with two dads, I'm /glad/ that OSC and the Mormons are losing the culture wars, but I /also/ care about and want the best for the kid who was raised by fundamentalists, and ... idk.

If it were /just/ the kid with two dads in the room, I'd have no problem saying words like "everything he told you is wrong, I'm sorry you had to hear that, I'm definitely going to make him sit out at recess for saying it, that kind of talk isn't tolerated in this classroom, period."

But it feels (in my head) like both kids are in the room at the same time, and so I'm trying to pull /both/ of them onto the middle ground, and honestly right now "the gay agenda" is winning in polite Western society, and that's great, and so where in 1990 I would've been faster to step to the defense of the kid with two dads, now in 2019 I feel like I'm constantly running around saying "do you see how what you said isn't actually fair, though?"

(Less to you and more to the first guy.)

If I can't treat the fundamentalist kid with true compassion, if I can't pass his ideological Turing test, if I can't speak to the /true roots/ of his belief, then I can't save him, too. And I want to save him just as much as I want to save the kid with two dads, just as much as I want to save /everybody./ To the kid that's like, "why's he such an /asshole,/ though?" I feel like I want to have a truer answer than "i kno, rite??"

"i kno, rite" is easy, but it's ultimately no less destructive. It's just writing off a different set of people.
