It sounds like you're interpreting people calling him homophobic to mean he is afraid and/or angry towards gays. Colloquially, homophobia or calling someone homophobic means that they are against same sex relationships. The cause of that aversion actually usually based in disgust, in my experience.

Personally speaking, I find the arguments that he's using particularly hurtful - for the reasons mentioned above. (On the 15yo comment, I'm taking it in the context he puts it, that homosexuality is some kind of derelicton in restraining ones hormone-laden impulses.)
