I didn't mean to imply that you all hate him. I just meant to say that I don't hate him. (I don't particularly like him, either, and I agree that his views are harmful).

Being friends with that person is a bit strange, to be honest, but the gay thing almost never comes up. And I imagine it feels like weird compartmentalization for him, too, being friends with someone who his religion says is an unrepentant sinner. But we like each other in every other way. I enjoy his company enough that I don't want to push him away just for that. I think I may have softened his views over time as well.
