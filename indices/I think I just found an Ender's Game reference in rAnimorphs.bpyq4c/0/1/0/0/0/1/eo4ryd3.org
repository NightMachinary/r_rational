As a gay guy who was raised in a christian conservative setting, and as fan of both Ender's Game and r!Animorphs, I feel like I should say something...

​

I /mostly/ endorse [[/u/TK17Studios]]'s previous comments here. Too few people are trying to genuinely pass the ideological turing test for the religious perspective. I've had enough experience with religion that I can put myself in OSC's shoes and see how his perspective follows reasonably from his worldview, and is not based in his own personal hate or disgust. I can't hate OSC, or anyone, for trying in good faith to discern what is right to the best of this abilities. I even have a friend who is a devout christian and is opposed to gay relationships because of his religion. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met; he has no problems hanging out with me, and I've talked to him directly about LGBT issues on several occasions (he is personally opposed, but never judges me and doesn't think the government should have any say in it). As a general rule, if so-called "homophobes" are willing to be friends with me, then I'm willing to be friends with them. Personal kindness is a very effective means of changing minds.

​

But about that word, "homophobia." Although it contains the suffix "phobia," as far as I can tell everyone now understands it to generally mean "opposed to same-sex relationships." Yes, it has an extra derogatory connotation, something like "oh, so you think gay people should be beaten to death, huh?" But I think it's /supposed/ to have that connotation. In some sense, the overt motte-and-bailey is entirely the point of the word. OSC may not support violence, but his views are only one or two steps away from policies that do enact violence, such as gay conversion therapy. So is OSC "homophobic?" I still hesitate to use that word against individual people, for exactly the reasons TK17 said above; I think it's better to say that the /religion itself/ is homophobic. But sometimes words are strategic rather than truthful - if no one had ever accused OSC of being homophobic, would he have bothered to make such a strong attempt to clarify his position? Sometimes the best way to coax out the truth is to first say something wrong. (I have no thesis that I'm building towards here - I'm just thinking out loud).

​

And about that essay linked above - it is indeed hurtful, not only for what it says, but how it is said. The language is distancing, clinical, diagnostic - being "homosexual" (a cold, detached, academic word that I have always hated) is a defect, a sin, a "lifestyle," and if you follow it you'll never be happy, et cetera. I grew up surrounded by this rhetoric, and my resulting mental health was... not good. Do you know what the worst part about these arguments is, to someone growing up with them? It's not that they are mean, or that they inspire violence and oppression. Personally, I can deal with meanness and violence, if I am whole inside. No, worst part is that they sound so reasonable. They set your mind at war with itself. If you don't yet have the intellectual skills to combat them, then you start to think they are true. Those are the worst insults, the ones you fear to be true.

​

(So I guess there I'm agreeing with TK17, because attacking strawmen doesn't do anyone a favor, especially those, who, like me, were desperate to find genuinely good counterarguments to anti-gay rhetoric instead of hollow virtue-signalling... but honestly I /did/ also appreciate the virtue-signalling, because it was nice to know that some people would support me unconditionally... again, I have no thesis and I'm just thinking out loud).
