Ok. I get where you're coming from. I too look at alternative viewpoints when I hear an argument or a statement (much to the detriment of my relationships, as it usually comes across as arguing when they just want support or validation).

But the takeaway in this case, for me, is that words and actions have consequences. Just because I understand /why/ someone might say something hurtful doesn't make it any less so.

I'm not going to go into a huge tangent, but my beef with religions is that they usually crush critical thinking (or perhaps it might be more fair to say that they take advantage of people's intellectual laziness). This seems like another case of that - his religious leaders say being gay is bad, therefore it is. And all of his arguments must necessarily circle back around to that.

Now that I think about it some more and as I'm internalizing some of what you're saying, I think that beacuse this piece is meant for his brethren, because he is arguing for leniency, it's exposing the things we don't usually hear (the rationalizations for being gay). What I'm getting at is that maybe because he's an otherwise rational thinker who is forced by his religion to have a certain viewpoint, he can't just say "gay is bad, don't do it" but must come up with reasons. As someone who disagrees, it's much harder to shrug off rationalizations and arguments apathetically than it is to just disagree.
