I'm not excusing them, per se. I reiterate (since I did already say it, above, explicitly) that I think his viewpoints are wrongheaded and uncompassionate and unjustified.

What I'm doing is saying /they're not based in hatred or fear,/ or at least not in him personally (obvs their /origin/ is from xenophobic frightened desert nomads trying to acquire some modicum of control in a world full of things that are trying to kill them). And that---while you might argue that /any/ arguments against homosexuality end up emboldening and supporting hatred and fear, since there IS a lot of hatred and fear in that crowd---OSC's arguments in particular *explicitly* delegitimize hate, violence, rejection, etc. The worst he says is "if you do this and keep doing it, *you shouldn't consider yourself a member of this church, which has rules against exactly that, anymore.*"

I think that's fair play. I think his church is welcome to dry up and die for lack of membership as the rest of the world moves past it. I think it's /also/ nice for people who grew up Mormon to try to get the Mormon church to change from the inside.

But /as the rules of Mormonism stand right now,/ it's silly to pretend that his position is hateful and fearful when it's clearly just /a logical extrapolation of his religious beliefs./

Again, I'm not excusing those. I'm /diagnosing/ them. I'm saying that if you come at him with attacks designed to combat hatred and fear, you're going to miss the target and be ineffective (and make yourself look silly, to boot). Attack the real root of the real problem, don't round your enemies off to the most convenient strawman.

(And what I mean by "rounding off" is stuff like "he has no flexibility in his viewpoints" when the sentence he wrote was a /true sentence/ about the /average/ fifteen-year-old. Have you worked extensively with fifteen-year-olds? I have. The /average/ fifteen-year-old boy is well-described by that sentence, in my experience, for all that I've known literally dozens of boys who were better than that. C'mon, this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]], specific words should matter here.)
