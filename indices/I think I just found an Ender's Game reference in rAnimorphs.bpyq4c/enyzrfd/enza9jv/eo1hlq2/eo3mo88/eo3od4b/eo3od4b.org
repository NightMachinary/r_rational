The problem at the root of all this (I hypothesize wildly) is that most of the people hearing his words "from the outside" (e.g. most agnostic liberals, most LGBTQ people, etc.) don't actually have, or aren't booting up and actively using, their "genuinely faithful human" module.

They're looking at his words, and then squinting at /themselves/ and thinking, "what kinds of things would /I/ have to be feeling, right this second, to produce sentences like this?"

And then they're concluding "oh, like---barely disguised hate or disgust, or something. Like, if I was feeling a whole bunch of really strong revulsion or bigotry, but knew I'd be attacked for expressing it, I might try dressing it up real nice, like this, to make it defensible and get away with it."

And yep, that's true---that's a thing humans do.

But if you look at /all of OSC's other behavior,/ including all of his writing (both fiction and political), it's /much more consistent/ and /much simpler/ to posit:

"Oh! He's just got ... a lot more faith than I've ever had. Like, he's taking his religion unusually seriously, and unusually logically, and so even though he's naturally an empathetic and understanding person (as you can see in all of his fiction) he's sort of forced himself to draw a line in the sand here, and is holding that line sincerely and in good faith, despite the fact that it's causing him to /keep company with assholes./"

The people who want to tear him down /don't want to admit that he might just be sincere about his religion./ Which makes it much harder to /actually fix him,/ since he's already got to have shields up and knives out against attacks that really are unjustified and unfair and based on wildly wrong assumptions. It would be much easier to engage with and convince people like him if the most zealous of his opponents fought /what's actually there/ instead of fighting the strawman they've invented.
