Hey, thanks for the additional input. I honestly can't decide if I'm for or against the kind of mental compartmentalization you're talking about -- it's a little weird to me that a) someone would be able to genuinely believe that gays are bad for society but still want to be friends with you (and /not/ try to proselytize) and b) that you would want to be friends with someone who thinks you and others like you are delusional, ripping apart the fabric of good family values, etc. But. If you're fine with it, I guess I can't really say anything? That's your choice.

I do just want to say, though, that you need to be reeallly careful about not falling into the same trap you're accusing others of:

  I can't hate OSC, or anyone, for trying in good faith[...]

  attacking strawmen doesn't do anyone a favor[...]

Nobody in this thread said they hated OSC. They called him a raging homophobe and a cunt, further down the thread. Now maybe I'm getting real close to playing semantics, here, but you're putting words in other people's mouths (this motte-bailey thing) when you're saying we /hate him/. (Maybe others do, but personally I just feel disappointed and sad. I think his views are hurtful and disgusting, but I don't hate the guy.)
