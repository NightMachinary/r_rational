Yes, his religion is homophobic and since he follows it's tenets so is he. I'm not sure why you're excusing his beliefs just because they're sourced from religion.

But beyond that, what I found egregious were his rationalizations and... infantilising of those who engage, unrepentantly, in gay sex. He has no flexibility in his viewpoints.

  The average fifteen-year-old teenage boy is genetically predisposed to copulate with anything that moves. We are compassionate and forgiving of those who cannot resist this temptation, but we do not regard as adult anyone who has not overcome it;

  the Church has no room for those who, instead of repenting of homosexuality, wish it to become an acceptable behavior in the society of the Saints. They are wolves in sheep's clothing, preaching meekness while attempting to devour the flock.

  What we do with small children is to establish clear boundaries and offer swift but mild punishment for crossing them.
