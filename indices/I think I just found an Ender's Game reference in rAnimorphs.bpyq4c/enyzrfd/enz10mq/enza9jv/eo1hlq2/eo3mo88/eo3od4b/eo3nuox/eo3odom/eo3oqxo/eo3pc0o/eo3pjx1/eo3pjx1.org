The problem is, "homophobia" is a *textbook* example of a motte-and-bailey argument.

Like, sure, you're +now falling back to say+ saying "but all I mean is that he's opposed to same-sex relationships." But if I hadn't stepped in to object to the guy above, the /implication/ and /connotation/ and /takeaway impression/ of the label "homophobe" (especially with the word "raging" attached) would have been something /much/ more sinister.

If all you meant to say is "OSC is clearly opposed to same sex relationships," then I am 100% in agreement with you; that's a demonstrable fact, and not really open to opinion.

If you further wanted to add "... and I think that's dumb/wrong/bad," I'm at least /mostly/ with you, and maybe completely, depending on the details.

What I'm objecting to is the bailey-use of the term, where we all agree "okay, he's a homophobe" using the definition "against same-sex relationships," but then later on people go and socially beat him up for being full of hatred or fear or for being personally and fundamentally bigoted and motivated by disgust and being the same sort of person who beats gay men to death in back alleys with socks full of gravel, because /they/ include /that/ in the definition, and we've given them license to put OSC in that same bucket.
