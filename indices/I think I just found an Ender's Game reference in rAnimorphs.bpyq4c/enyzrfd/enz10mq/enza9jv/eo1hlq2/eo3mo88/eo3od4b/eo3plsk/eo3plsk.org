I can't speak for anyone else but I remember reading and enjoying his works back in the day and going on his website to search for more and to learn about this author that I admired. I think the most disappointing part of finding his musings on religion and the like was how well he writes mostly-rational characters. How can there be such a disconnect in his own personal life?

It's interesting that there's a few Mormon authors and artists that produce works untinged by the religious perspective I see from other authors.
