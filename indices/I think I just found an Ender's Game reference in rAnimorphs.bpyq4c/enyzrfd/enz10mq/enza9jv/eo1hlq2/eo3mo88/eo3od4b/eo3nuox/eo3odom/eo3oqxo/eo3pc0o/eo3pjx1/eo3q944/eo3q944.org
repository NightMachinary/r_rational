I'm not familiar with that argument, I'll have to look it up.

I am not walking back my stance at all, I think we're just clarifying what we meant. The original statement was that Card is a raging homophobe. I agree with that because I took that to mean he's a) against gay relationships and b) passionately so.

I further went on to say that his arguments are repugnant because you seemed to disagree with the b) part of that statement.

I'm honestly don't understand how you can read that article and not be disgusted with the way he's marginalizing the feelings of those who believe differently from him. It's very different to say, "I don't agree with your actions and hope you change your ways‚Äù vs "you're only acting this way because you were never taught better or raised correctly. Because you're acting on your base instincts. Because /my view is more correct than yours/"
