I've read it before, and just reread it. It's not repugnant in the least.

  I predicted toward the beginning of the preceding essay that those who have already accepted the dogmas of the homosexual community as a source of truth superior to the words of the prophets would be incapable of reading what I had actually written here and would instead interpret my words as intolerance, oppression, gay-bashing, or, an epithet used now without a shred of its original meaning, "homophobia." My prediction was exactly fulfilled, and I have had ample opportunity to observe that some supposed proponents of liberty for homosexuals do not believe in freedom of speech for anyone who disagrees with them.

That comes /after/ 1800 words in which his message, repeated and clarified in detail, is this:

- Everybody sins; we all need rules and communities to help us grow to do better
- According to the LDS, homosexual behavior is a sin
- If you do it a little, as a Mormon, you should be met with compassionate but firm correction and support
- If you do it a lot, endorsedly, you're not really a Mormon anymore

... that's straightforwardly logical, and sensible, and contains no fear or hatred except for the fundamental disapproval of /all sexual misconduct, homosexuality no more or less than adultery./

For the record: I'm a cis male atheist who has had sex with eight men in his life so far, counting back to the year 2003 (one of those is an ongoing, decade-plus-long relationship).

What you're taking offense at is his /declaration that homosexual behavior is itself sinful./ That's fine---I also think that's a backwards, misguided, uncompassionate, and unjustified position!

But /if you take his religious professions seriously,/ then you will see that he's doing the bare minimum required to be /actually consistent./ He's not advocating for anything other than what /you yourself/ *ought* /to advocate, if you believe that homosexual activity will damn someone's soul to eternal torment./

He's /absolutely correct/ that if you advocate for the acceptance of homosexual behavior, you're not really a Mormon anymore, but some kind of diluted Mormon-prime. He's no less correct than someone who points out that advocates for birth control aren't really Catholic anymore, but some kind of diluted Catholic-prime.

I think the correct attack here is "Mormonism is inherently vile," not "Orson Scott Card is a raging homophobe." Orson Scott Card has a wrong belief down at the root of his behavior, but it's not hatred of gay people. It's faith in the Mormon interpretation of the Judeo-Christian tradition.
