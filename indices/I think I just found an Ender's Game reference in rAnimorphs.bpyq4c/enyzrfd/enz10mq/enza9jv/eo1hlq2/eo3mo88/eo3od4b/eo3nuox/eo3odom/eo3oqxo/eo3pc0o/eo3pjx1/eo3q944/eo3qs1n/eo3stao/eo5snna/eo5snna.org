I feel like I have to object to this metaphor, because there's a huge difference between a child who has fundamentalist parents and a grown man who has known many gay people and still holds these beliefs. There's some hope that you can convince such a child that there's more to the issue than what they've been told, but after decades of holding such a position the idea that by being nice to OSC you'll convince him otherwise seems laughable.

At the root of this problem is that no matter how polite he may be, he's still a voting adult; he and people like him will vote for politicians who want to stop gay relationships, extramarital sex of all kinds, divorces, etc...

This means that no matter how polite he may be when saying these things, he's still in some sense an enemy, because politicians with similar leanings will try to make laws preventing these things in other people for what they think is their own good. It's too much to hope that OSC can be convinced at this point, so the difference between him and someone who hates gay people on an emotional level is pretty much academic except for the possibility of actually going out and beating someone up. Sure, it might be better if such people were more like OSC, but even if they were all magically changed overnight, the result would still be widespread support for anti-gay laws and government policies.

(And no, despite his claims, not thinking gay marriage should be recognized is still anti-gay.)
