A close friend has jokingly referred to me as a "a spider hovering over a p-zombie".

Do you have an internal monologue, when you're not specifically trying to format your thoughts for communication? Or I suppose when you're not reading. Can you visualize things?

I suspect, in my case at least, that lack of disassociation is partly due to me not really making use of those internal feedback mechanisms. Serializing thought to text/speech is /slow/, and annoying, and I mostly don't do it except when I'm communicating with people.

Reading through your links after posting this, and yeah, that.
