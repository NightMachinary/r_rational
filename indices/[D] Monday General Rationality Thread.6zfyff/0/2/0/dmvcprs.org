  Do you have an internal monologue, when you're not specifically trying to format your thoughts for communication?

  Can you visualize things?

Usually I can visualize things in glimpses, or I can recall specific visual memories. I can't make a continuous movie in my head the way I can recall sound continuously.

EDIT: Actually, seems I can, it just takes more effort.
