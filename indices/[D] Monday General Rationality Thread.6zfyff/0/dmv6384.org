  I don't have a voice in my head, I have /four/, each of which speaks for a different part of me and who regularly talk to each-other socially.

Now, that's a symptom of reading too much, and I know it. I'm fairly sure I saw the study saying that people who read or write too much develop this and only this dissociative symptom.

The universal human experience I think I'm missing though, is precisely dissociation. I've never really stood back from my actions, even when they've been deeply irrational or under the influence of drugs or mental illness, and said, "That wasn't me." I've never looked in the mirror and asked, "Is this really who I am?". Drunk-me tries to help out sober-me because I'm the same person drunk as sober.

This is more like my experience of the world, which is apparently so different from most people that it's worth noting as a character trait of /Granny Weatherwax/:

  Most people, on waking up, accelerate through a quick panicky pre-consciousness check-up: who am I, where am I, who is he/she, good god, why am I cuddling a policeman's helmet, what happened last night?

  And this is because people are riddled by Doubt. It is the engine that drives them through their lives. It is the elastic band in the little model aeroplane of their soul, and they spend their time winding it up until it knots. Early morning is the worst time -there's that little moment of panic in case You have drifted away in the night and something else has moved in. This never happened to Granny Weatherwax. She went straight from asleep to instant operation on all six cylinders. /She never needed to find herself because she always knew who was doing the looking./

Emphasis mine. I often wonder that I sort of fail to communicate what's going on in my life with others because I can't put my psychologically abnormal experiences into their frame of reference.

So, uh, how /does/ that work, to step back from your experiences and have some gap between them and "you"?
