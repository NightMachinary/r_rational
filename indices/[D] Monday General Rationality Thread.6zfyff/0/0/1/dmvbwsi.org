  How much reading is too much?
#+end_quote

Probably somewhere around the point where you've tried to step into the heads of people who do have mental conversations. Nita Callahan and God-Emperor Shinji Ikari are probably the ones that made me start doing that.

  I assume simulating fictional characters from behind the fourth wall doesn't count.

Well my whole thing was that this seems to be a symptom of imagining other people a little too much, rather than an /actual/ dissociative symptom.

  Is this really how it is for most people? Sounds mildly terrifying.
#+end_quote

I know, right? But on the other hand, I find most people's discourse about personal identity completely, utterly baffling. Like, they /have a self-concept/ apart from whatever they happen to be at the time. I rarely develop one, and when I do, it's wildly divergent from reality, so it dissolves.

Maybe if you had one of those, you'd have to ask yourself where it is when you wake up, like remembering anything else you know?
