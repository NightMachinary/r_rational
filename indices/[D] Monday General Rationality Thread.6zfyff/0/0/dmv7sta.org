  Now, that's a symptom of reading too much, and I know it. I'm fairly sure I saw the study saying that people who read or write too much develop this and only this dissociative symptom.

How much reading is too much? Though I've hardly ever written anything, I estimate I read about 100k words of fiction a week on average, (ballpark, never actually cared to measure), but sometimes when I have nothing better to do I can read more in a single day. Yet I can't say I've ever experienced anything of the sort, let alone disassociation from it. I assume simulating fictional characters from behind the fourth wall doesn't count.

  Early morning is the worst time -there's that little moment of panic in case You have drifted away in the night and something else has moved in.

Is this /really/ how it is for most people? Sounds mildly terrifying.
