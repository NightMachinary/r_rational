I sometimes have a form of dissociation where I'm looking at the actions I'm doing like if the person performing them were someone else, a stranger that I find baffling and that I'm disappointed with. I'm an outside observer who tries vainly to influence my own actions. This usually correlates with periods of intense depression where I have to use a lot of will power to force that stranger to do anything.

The feeling is a bit similar to Camus l'Ã©tranger or at least what I remember of it (I read it 20 years ago) and that feeling is relatively recent (probably triggered by my divorce), it also rarely last for more than 4-5 days at a time.

When those period happen, I usually end up drowning myself in fiction, as a way to escape from reality and from this feeling, waiting for it to pass. But, yes, I wouldn't qualify this as being normal, nor would I wish it on anyone.
