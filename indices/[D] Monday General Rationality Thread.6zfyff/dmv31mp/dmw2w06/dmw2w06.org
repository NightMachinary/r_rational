Also, the more I read about Taleb's views, the more worried I become. His views are not irrational. They are quite logical, and the actions he advocate truly are the best ways to achieve his goals.

The problem is his goals seem extremely susceptible to evil.

In "How to be Rational About Rationality", he states that his goals are about survival. Survival of the individual or the collective. And that any action taken that goes against survival is irrational.

Does he not see the potential for evil here? There are plenty of ways to improve your own odds of survival by hurting others. Stealing their stuff, murdering the competition, turning people into slaves, etc. Similarly, there are plenty of ways to improve the odds of survival for the collective by hurting individuals: rapes to increase birth rates, dictatorships and blind obedience so decisions can be made quickly, culling the old and weak so they don't drag down the species, etc. etc.

Now, last time, I was told that Taleb's philosophy has an exception: Follow the philosophy unless what it tells you to do infringes on ethics.

But this doesn't even work because Taleb's philosophy promotes willful ignorance. It tells you to perform actions even if you don't know the reasoning behind them, so long as other people are also doing said actions. For all you know, these actions could be committing major ethics violations without your knowledge. Yet you aren't allowed to wait and investigate whether your traditions are evil before obeying. You have to obey them *now*, because to do otherwise is to risk the survival of the collective.

It's really terrifying.
