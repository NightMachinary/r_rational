I think you're just misunderstanding Taleb. Which is understandable, since he makes interpreting himself difficult. A lot of what you are saying is cleared up in his books, which I maintain are worth reading if only for some interesting methods of analysis to add to your mental toolbox.

He's not against reason and analysis; he just spends most of his time discussing how these are misused. He is very much in favor of mathematical analysis. But where you say "Investigate, Analyze," or "Don't just blindly copy, THINK," his point is that in /some/ cases, you /can't./ Like, literally, physically can't, unless you are actually a superintelligence. You can't get enough information about a complex dynamical system to make meaningful predictions (with important exceptions embedded in the mathematics). Like, can /you/ predict what the stock market will be in five years? But you still have to make a decision, and certain decision heuristics are better than others.

  Going against the status quo is a short-term risk that he says you shouldn't take, even though keeping the status quo in the long term may be devastating.

Again, misunderstanding Taleb. If you can see devastation in the future of the status quo, then change, definitely change. It's just that for a certain class of old practices, /if/ the status quo were devastating, /then/ we would have already observed this devastation in the past and changed the status quo. Of course, this is not an automatic conclusion: we need /reasons/ to believe that this is the case, reasons based on the structure of the problem, the time horizon, the degree of devastation, etc. This maps directly into a set of factual questions: for particular issue X, according to our best statistical analysis, /should/ we have a bias towards the status quo for X? Taleb argues yes /for a certain set of issues./ The issue of fossil fuels you bring up requires reasoning about scale, for example. Burning campfires when the population of the planet was in the millions is not at all comparable to industrial pollution in a world with a population of billions. It's an order of magnitude difference that occurred in the last hundred years or so. Differences of that scale are things you actually /can/ reason about effectively. So the debate hinges on factual questions that differ depending on the issue, and as long as these factual questions are unspecified I will not debate this further.
