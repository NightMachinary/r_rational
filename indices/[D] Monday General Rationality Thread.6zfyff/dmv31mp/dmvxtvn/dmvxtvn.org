  How to be Rational About Rationality
#+end_quote

This was pretty helpful, I now understand his views better than the last time we discussed this subject.

Quote from that article: The only definition of rationality that I found that is practically, empirically, and mathematically rigorous is that of survival --and indeed, unlike the modern theories by psychosophasters, it maps to the classics. Anything that hinders one's survival at an individual, collective, tribal, or general level is deemed irrational.

I assume that, since you brought up Eliezer Yudkowsky specifically, you consider the views of the rationalist community to reflect Eliezer Yudkowsky's views. If I'm not mistaken, Eliezer Yudkowsky has roughly utilitarian goals. With that in mind, it's obvious why their views are so different: *they are trying to optimize different goals.*

Let me give a bit of an exaggerated example. Consider a town that practices slavery. A small part of the population are owners that live in luxury, while the remaining are slaves that lead unhappy lives serving the powerful owners. Depending on the goal, the rational choice of action to take is drastically different.

If your goal is utilitarian, that is, to maximize happiness, the rational choice should be to revolt. Free the slaves, even if at cost to the owners. The needs of the many (slaves) outweigh the needs of the few (owners). The expected utility of a revolt is far far higher than the expected utility of keeping the status quo.

If your goal is survival of the individual like Taleb advocates, your action would be to keep the status quo. If you are an owner, your individual survival odds are improved by having slaves, so why free them? If you are a slave, your survival odds are lower if you revolt, since the violence may result in your death. Your expected survival odds are much better if you just shut up and obey. You will live an unhappy life, but you will live.

Taleb also advocates survival of the collective. In this case, the rational choice is to again keep the status quo. A revolt has a small chance of resulting in everyone dead. Keeping the status quo has much better survival odds for the collective.

So you see, there's nothing particularly strange happening here. Eliezer and Taleb may choose opposing actions, but neither are being stupid. Their chosen actions truly are the rational ones for maximizing their own goals. They are opposing simply because their goals are different.
