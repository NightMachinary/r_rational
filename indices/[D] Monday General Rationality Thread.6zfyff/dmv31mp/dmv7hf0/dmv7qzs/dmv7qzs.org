The antithetical part is that "beliefs" have nothing to do with rationality, for Taleb. There is no such thing as epistemic rationality, only rationality of decisions. So Taleb finds religion perfectly agreeable if it causes people to not die. Most "rationalists" despise religion, in my experience.
