As far as GMOs go, I recall that the rationality community is somewhat split for a number of reasons. I have heard the argument against GMOs that (you say) Taleb puts forth and the counter argument that I've heard in the past is that the risk from GMOs is likely low compared to the benefit. It's an equation that has lives on either side, so it just depends on what the risk and benefits actually are. If (cost from GMOs going bad) * (change of GMOs going bad) > (benefit from GMOs), then I think very few people would disagree with him. So this basically is a disagreement over the numbers.

In regards to Trump, I think that Trump's policies are likely good for people like Taleb (eg. rich, not female, not an illegal immigrant, etc.). His view about "most news stories as noise with no signal" seems like what Scott Alexander argues in [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/07/tuesday-shouldnt-change-the-narrative/]].

Some other points of his:

"talking like we're high-and-mighty empiricists while being too lazy to carry out actual experiments"

- [[https://www.gwern.net/][Gwern]] has done a number of actual experiments,
- there have been a number of surveys across LessWrong and SlateStarCodex collecting data,
- [[http://metaculus.com/][Metaculus]] is a startup that is part of the rationalist community that is collecting data to see if a prediction market works out
- Givewell and other Effective Altruism type groups are all about collecting data on what works and what does not
- many people in the rationalist community are professional scientists who work in labs where they collect real data

I would agree that the rationalist community needs to do more data collection though.

"learn the ultra-advanced theoretical statistics necessary to properly understand the data we have received"

- [[http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html#recent][Bryan Caplan]] is an economics professor who is part of the community
- [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/author/robin-hanson][Robin Hanson]] is another economics professor who is part of the community
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Galef][Julia Galef]], co-founder of the Center for Applied Rationality, has a degree in Statistics
- Gwern (again) appears to me to be very well educated in statistics
- The people at MIRI appear to know what they're doing with math
- The people at GiveWell definitely seem to know what they're doing with statistics

I can't evaluate this claim well because I definitely do not have the statistics knowledge.

Overall, I would guess that you're mainly mistaken about the degree of discrepancy.
