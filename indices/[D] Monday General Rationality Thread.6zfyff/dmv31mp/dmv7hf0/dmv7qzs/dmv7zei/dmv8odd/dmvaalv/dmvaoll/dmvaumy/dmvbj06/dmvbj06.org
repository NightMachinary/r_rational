I'd be surprised if he has /never/ encountered CFAR or modern rationalists, but he might have dismissed them purely by the name and not investigated further. I have in mind a specific Facebook post where someone who was clearly from the LessWrong-type rationalist community asks him what he thinks of "rationalists," at which point Taleb gets angry and goes on a tirade against rationalists, and I'm 50-50 on which type of rationalist he was talking about. There is a whole tradition of rationalism in philosophy which is [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/][contrasted with empiricism]], whereas LessWrong-type rationalists are all about empiricism. "Rationalist" is an unfortunate choice of label, in that sense.
