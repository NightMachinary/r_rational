There is nothing particularly strange happening here once you look at their goals.

Taleb's goal is the survival of the individual, and the collective. If that is your goal, the rational choice is to accept religion. To keep the status quo. Going against religion paints a target on your back for religious fanatics to go inquisition on you, lowering your survival odds. Abandoning a religion means adopting a different philosophy, which has higher chance of destroying society compared to just keeping the status quo. So again, keeping the status quo is the rational choice, if your goal is survival of the collective.

Most "rationalists" tend to not have survival as their goal. They tend to have utilitarian goals, i.e., they want to maximize happiness, even if it has a tiny chance of killing everyone in the process. In which case, religions are a hindrance, mainly because most religions are not utilitarian. Just about every major religion tells its followers to waste time praying and performing strange rituals when they could instead be out there saving lives or making the world a better place. They promote goals like "worshipping god", or "filial piety", or "honor and glory", instead of the utilitarian goal of maximizing happiness. Which means all the religious followers would frequently take actions which do not maximize happiness, simply because those actions maximize some other goal. So from a utilitarian perspective, religions should really be abolished to maximize happiness.

So even though their views on religion are opposing, neither is irrational. They just have different end goals.
