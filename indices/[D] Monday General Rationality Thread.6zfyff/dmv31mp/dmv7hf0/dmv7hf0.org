Having read the two articles, I do not see anything that is antithetical to the rationalist community. I'd guess that you're thinking of claims like how Taleb does not think that science is useful for a lot of real-world problems. By his definition of science, I think Yudkowsky would agree. From what I can tell, Taleb's science is a specific subset of activities - academic science. Yudkowsky's science is "the ... kind of thought that lets us survive in everyday life." [1] Science to Yudkowsky is figuring out that the red berries are dangerous and that if you put a dead fish by your corn seeds, the corn will grow better. Taleb's science, however, is only the search for absolute truth.

This sentence [2] by Taleb sounds like something Yudkowsky could have said in fact. Taleb speaks about how you need to focus on the instrumental value of activity, Yudkowsky's rationalism is about doing whatever achieves your goal ("winning")

Their job description is not to produce the most accurate scientific representation of reality; rather the most useful one for survival."
