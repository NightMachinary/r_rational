It seems to me that Taleb applies the same methods of reasoning used by rationalists, but he starts from a different set of assumptions. This doesn't seem particularly confusing to me, unless your confusion lies in why he chooses those assumptions as opposed to others (in which case he would probably reply "empirical evidence").
