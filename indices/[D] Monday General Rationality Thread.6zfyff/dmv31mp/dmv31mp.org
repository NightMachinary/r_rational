Edit: See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6zfyff/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dmwfq4w/?st=j7hnugxd&sh=e01db591][my reply to ShiranaiWakaranai below]] for an overview of my endgame here...

--------------

A couple of weeks ago, I made a post here about Nassim Taleb, which did not accomplish what I had hoped it would. I still want to have that discussion with members of the rationalist community, but I'm not sure of the best place to go for that (this is the only rationalist forum that I am active on, at the moment, though it may not be the best place to get a full technical discussion going).

Anyway, Taleb has an interesting perspective on rationality that I would like people's thoughts about. I won't try to put words in his mouth like last time. Instead, the following two articles are good summaries of his position:

[[https://medium.com/incerto/how-to-be-rational-about-rationality-432e96dd4d1a][How to be Rational About Rationality]]

[[https://medium.com/incerto/the-logic-of-risk-taking-107bf41029d3][The Logic of Risk-Taking]]

I'll just add that when it comes to Taleb, /I notice that I am confused./ Some of his views seem antithetical to everything the rationalist community stands for, and yet I see lots of indicators that Taleb is an extremely strong rationalist himself (though he would never call himself that), strong enough that it is reasonable to trust most of his conclusions. He is like the Eliezer Yudkowsky of quantitative finance - hated or ignored by academia, yet someone who has built up an entire philosophical worldview based on probability theory.
