  How much reading is too much?
#+end_quote

More than three or four /Culture/ novels in one day is probably too much, but the /Young Wizards/ series isn't... that I've noticed.

The closest I get to the descriptions above is something like (someone mentioned Discworld) Tiffany's First Thoughts, where I notice a thought that's more like me-as-I-want-to-be than I am. It's still me thinking it, though.
