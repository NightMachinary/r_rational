Hm. For me dreams are like, well, really getting into a book or a movie. While I am engrossed in reading (dreaming) my internal narrative is kind of suspended and replaced by the narrative of the book (dream), but if I am interrupted by somebody (woken up) my narrative immediately resumes, with no disorientation or any need to remember who or where I am.

(I call my stream of consciousness 'narrative', but it is not really linguistic in the same way the book one is. I don't constantly describe what is happening, I just am.)
