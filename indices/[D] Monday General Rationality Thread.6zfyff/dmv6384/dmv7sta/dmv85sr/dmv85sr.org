I read similar amounts, perhaps even twice or thrice that. I have also never had that kind of symptom.

I occasionally will have moments where I look in the mirror and question myself being myself - whether the person I perceive myself as being is different from the person that others perceive me as being - but aside from that I have had none of the symptoms of dissociation that [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is talking about.
