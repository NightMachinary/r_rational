Sometimes I can run myself on automatic.

It's only possible when doing something that I've done often enough that it becomes habit, and it's only possible /because/ it has become habit. Basically, I just... let the habit run on its own, more or less. I think about whatever catches my fancy while letting the body do as habit dictates.

I do not know if this counts as disassociation or not. I'm still doing stuff, I'm just not paying that much attention to what I am doing. Even then, I'm still technically in control - I was the one who set up the habits, and I am the one who can take back control at any point (such as if something unexpected happens).

As to what happens when I wake up - I'm most certainly not instantly firing on all cylinders. But it's not because I need to find myself. I'm just not very energetic in the mornings.

Sometimes, I'm aware enough to start moving before I'm awake enough to have kicked off sleep paralysis. That's weird, because I'm awake enough to know to move, and sometimes asleep enough to start dreaming about getting up for a short while before drifting to awake enough to realise that I have not in fact, actually moved at all... I've been known, on rare occasion, to go through a few cycles of this. And, sometimes, I'm just awake enough to realise that I'm /not/ moving... I have found that if I can find any part of me that can move, even a little, I can shake off sleep paralysis on that area of my body by literally shaking it. (Usually this is a hand, at first; once I can move my hand, it's not long before I can move my arm, and if I can manage to shake my head, that tends to wake the rest of me up really quickly...).

The other alternative to wake up quickly is to find something to panic over. "I'll be late!" is useful in this regard (because if it's necessary, it's generally true).
