When I wake up, I'm completely aware of who I am and (unless I wandered off somewhere last night and forget) where I am. I have one voice in my head, and it is mine, though I can use it to "read aloud" other voices and so on. I can narrate other voices as well. I read a very large amount of fiction and a good amount of nonfiction as well and do not have multiple internal voices. It's possible I'm just less imaginative or something though.
