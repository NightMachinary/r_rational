Just went hunting with family in northern Canada, right in the Yukon for 2 weeks.

We left tuesday 2 weeks ago, made it to canada, got off at whitehorse, then drove for 6 hours to watson lake, then took a bush plane into the middle of no where. The fourth day of the trip we hiked for 9 hours one way and posted camp. That night, i was walking like an old man. The next day, we hiked for six hours up a mountain. On the mountain was our quarry. Two mountain goats.

Typing on a phone is obnoxious, more on Friday. I'm at Vancouver airpt right now, waiting for my plane to seattle.
