  If your goal is utilitarian, that is, to maximize happiness, the rational choice should be to revolt. Free the slaves, even if at cost to the owners. The needs of the many (slaves) outweigh the needs of the few (owners). The expected utility of a revolt is far far higher than the expected utility of keeping the status quo.

Except that the utility-function formalism doesn't render utilities commensurable, and even if you go measure "hedons" in the slaves' and slaveowners' brains, either can just go ahead and reconfigure their brains to respond to the same events with more hedons, thus forcing a utilitarian to tip their balance.

Utilitarianism doesn't work without first establishing not only a common currency, but one that maps commensurably onto distal (not /just/ in-the-brain) world states.
