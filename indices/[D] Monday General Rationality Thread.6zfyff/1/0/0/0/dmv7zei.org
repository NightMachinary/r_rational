I'd guess that this stems for Yudkowsky and most rationalists valuing truth for the sake of truth while Taleb does not. That's entirely a statement about personal preference, they just have different personal preferences.

I doubt that Taleb would claim that epistemic rationality does not help with finding the truth, instead he would claim that it is useless because finding the truth is useless unless it has some other benefit to him, in which case it is part of his rationality of decisions.
