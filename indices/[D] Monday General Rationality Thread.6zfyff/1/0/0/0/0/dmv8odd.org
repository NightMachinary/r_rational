I agree, although it's more than just religion. There are a whole set of issues where he would disagree with what I think that most rationalists think should be done in practice. (GMOs and Donald Trump, for example - see my post from a while back). Even though Taleb does not care about beliefs, he cares about decisions, and the things he considers optimal decisions do not seem like what rationalists would consider optimal decisions in certain settings. I could be mistaken about the degree of discrepancy though.
