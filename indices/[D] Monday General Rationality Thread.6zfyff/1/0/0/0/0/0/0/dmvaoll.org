Good post, and thanks for adding the links (I was going to edit them in later when not on mobile). I could indeed be mistaken about the discrepancy. Part of the problem is that Taleb's community and Yudkowsky's community use different terminology and motivating examples. For example, when Taleb decries "rationalists," it is unclear if he is referring to the modern movement a la CFAR, or to the old-school philosophical rationalists, which have nothing to do with each other.
