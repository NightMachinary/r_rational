It seems unlikely that Taleb even knows about rationality in regards to our group of rationalism a la CFAR - or if he does know about it, knows or cares enough to decry us. We're still a small community. Our biggest influence on the world could plausibly be HPMoR.

I do not know anything about the old-school philosophical rationalists though, so I'm not sure if he could plausibly be referring to them.
