  I'm confused because two smart groups of people should not diverge so much in their views.

There's a strange tendency to believe that all smart people should agree on things, by virtue of their smartness leading them to eliminate the less intelligent choices. For example, if tasked to solve a difficult math problem, a bunch of average joes may give wildly different answers, while all the mathematically-smart people would give the one correct answer.

For better or worse, this is not how it works in reality. This is because intelligence only tells you: given a goal X and a set of assumptions S, how to achieve X. It doesn't tell you which goal X you should achieve, or which set S of assumptions reflects reality. (Well, technically, it can rule out some sets of assumptions, but a countless number of distinct sets are still possible.) In math, everyone agrees on S and X, so all smart people agree. In reality? Finding two people with the *exact* same S and X is nigh impossible.

And just like a computer program, all it takes is one bit of difference in the right place, to get drastically different behavior.
