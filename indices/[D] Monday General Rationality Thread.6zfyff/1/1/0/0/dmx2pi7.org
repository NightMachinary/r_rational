  More generally, Taleb argues: many people make the mistake of trading short-term bounded risks for long-term existential risks. Quite often, preventing short-term disasters just sweeps problems under the rug until they all collapse at once. For example, bailing out big banks instead of letting them fail just maintains the status quo and ensures that there will be another market crash from corrupt practices. Polluting the atmosphere to generate electricity in the short-term has long-term environmental consequences. Using plasmid insertion to create super-crops that solve hunger in the short term could lead to an ecological disaster in the long term (hence the GMO issue from last time).

But this mistake is what his philosophy also does. A lot of what he advocates is about keeping the status quo even if you don't know why. Going against the status quo is a short-term risk that he says you shouldn't take, even though keeping the status quo in the long term may be devastating.

The only way to prevent things from being worse in the long term is to actually think. Investigate. Analyze.

Willful ignorance and blind obedience like Taleb advocates are recipes for long term disasters with short term gains.

  just listen to the wisdom of the ancients; practices that have survived since ancient times probably don't have existential risk.

I have discussed the perils of natural selection last time. Just because something is done a lot, doesn't mean it's safer. There are plenty of historical examples of natural selection leading to everyone dying. The very principles of natural selection advocate trading long-term advantages for short-term gains: half your lifespan in exchange for ten times the offspring now, create poison in your bodies which will eventually kill you in exchange for not being eaten by predators now, poison the environment in exchange for some boost to yourself now, etc. etc.

I also find it very inconsistent that Taleb is anti-pollution, anti-fossil fuels. Burning coal and gas is just burning stuff on a larger scale, and burning stuff is literally one of the most ancient human traditions. People have been burning stuff since they were cavemen, despite all the environmental risks, because fire = energy. Whoever burns stuff gains a short-term advantage of light and heat. Even though plenty of towns and nomadic groups have probably burned themselves to death in accidental fires, and groups of cavemen have probably suffocated themselves to death in caves from all their fires sucking all the oxygen, the practice of burning continues because natural selection only cares about the short-term gains. This ancient tradition of burning stuff for short-term gains is exactly why we are paying the price today with global warming, and precisely why I keep advocating against "monkey see monkey do".

Don't just blindly copy, THINK.

  Regarding survivability: it's not that surviving is Taleb's terminal goal so much as it's a prerequisite for all goals. If you don't survive, you can't do the utilitarian goal-maximization that you want to do. Therefore, maximizing your long-term survival chances should always be your first worry.

This sounds dangerously like Knight Templar logic: *I AM THE FORCE OF GOOD. ALL WHO OPPOSE ME ARE THUS EVIL. ONLY I CAN SAVE THE WORLD, SO ONLY I MATTER!*

Only making me more worried here (x.x)...
