Gotcha :) The analogy of taking the lens off made it seem like there was a different lens to put on instead, which may well be true, but I've started to think of rationality as less of a lens and more of a lens crafting tool. You imply something similar with this:

#+begin_quote
  When you do take off those Rationality Glasses, it turns out that you can see even more clearly without them.
#+end_quote

Assuming you mean something like "because of them" rather than literally "without them."
