  Haha, gotta love the subtle reveal that the whole setting is in some sort of post-apocalyptic world.

It's really the only explanation that makes sense once I rule out genies being able to see the future. See also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8886151][Under a broken sky]]

  Now I'm guessing the whole genies and over-genies thing is just Sufficiently Advanced Technology.

My official stance on this is that if it's not in the text then any opinion I have on the matter is just another headcanon. I didn't write this with any sort of Sufficiently Advanced Technology in mind, but there's no reason it couldn't be.
