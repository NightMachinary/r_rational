Actually I'm bored of the story and was thinking of waiting another two or three years before continuing.

Err. Wait. No. The other thing. [[http://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/programmer-at-large-how-did-people/][New chapter out today]] but I forgot about the new "Only post your stuff once a week" rule, so somebody else will have to post it for me (hint hint).

(The schedule is every other Friday. I found doing weekly a bit too much, and intended to use biweekly to build up a buffer, but I must admit so far that hasn't happened).
