Since you could do blatantly supernatural things with this power like tell apart 2 identical looking objects (one is hollow) you could use this to become very famous as with any power.\\
Something you could do that might actually be somewhat useful is measure the chemical composition of artifacts that might otherwise need to be damaged to be examined, but again your measurements are pretty bad so this is only useful in narrow scenarios where people can't use better measures.
