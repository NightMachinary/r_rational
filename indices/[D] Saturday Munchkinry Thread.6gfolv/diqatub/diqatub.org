You now have the ability to accurately measure anything in your direct perception. For example, you can look at something and immediately know how tall it is, or hold something and tell how heavy it is, and so forth. These measurements are guaranteed to a high degree of accuracy, but the precision is limited to the granularity of your natural perception; you can't measure something down to the microgram if you couldn't tell a 1 kg rock from a 1.000000001 kg rock by holding both of them.

*EDIT:* On a second reading, I don't think I explained the power well enough. The object to be measured and the property to be measured /both/ have to be in your direct perception. So to weigh something you'd have to hold it, and to tell what chemicals are in something, you'd need to taste or smell it. The power just puts numbers to what you can already perceive.
