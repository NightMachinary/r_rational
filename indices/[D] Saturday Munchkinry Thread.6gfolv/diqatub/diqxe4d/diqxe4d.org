This seems almost like normal perception. What you're getting from this power is guaranteed accuracy, known precision, immunity to confounding factors (e.g. conductive objects feel colder), and the ability to express yourself in common units.

As for the limits to granularity, I can easily detect a 1' step up or down. Does that mean that I can tell whether I'm at 5000' or 5001' of elevation? If so, I may have more ideas...
