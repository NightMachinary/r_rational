The power doesn't provide you with extra information; it just allows you to more numerically process the information that you have. So you could tell, for instance, that there's a roughly 70% chance that proposition P is true based on your current knowledge, but you couldn't predict the future through wild guessing any more than you could measure an object through a photograph with no reference points.
