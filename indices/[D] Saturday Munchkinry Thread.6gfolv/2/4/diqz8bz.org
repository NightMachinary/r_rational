This might be one of the most useless superpowers since you can get it just by practicing. Practice weighing lots of stuff and you'll be able to tell how heavy something is to a "high degree of accuracy" that is "limited to the granularity of your natural perception".

So the only thing this superpower does is save you the effort of practicing measuring stuff.
