Does this power only extend to specific types of measurements? Your examples seem to all be physical, but what about less physical measurements?

For instance, right now if someone tells me a lie, I can sometimes perceive whether or not they're lying to me (depending on a number of factors). With this power you're suggesting, if anyone lied to me, would I be able to 'accurately measure' the boolean value of whether or not they're telling a lie?

Taking that even further, statements people make can have a measure of objective accuracy. For instance, if I'm staring at a blue phone and say "The phone is blue", that statement is objectively more accurate than me saying "The phone is red", /regardless of whether I personally believe that the phone is red/ (for now, let's ignore the arguments regarding the world/perception/etc as all an illusion or theater of the mind, and assume things can objectively have specific color attributes).

So with this power, could I judge the % accuracy of a person's statement, regardless of what they personally know? If so, you could use methods of increasingly educational guessing to accurately predict the future, just by having someone tell you that something happens in the future, and judging how accurate the statement is.
