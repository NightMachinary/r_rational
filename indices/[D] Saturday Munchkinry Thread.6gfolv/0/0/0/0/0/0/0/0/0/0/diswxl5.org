  Good idea! The rules imply that it's strictly precognitive, not postcognitive, so viewing the past might not be possible. If it is, though, that would definitely be worth looking into.

This is an issue of phrasing. Start the prediction along the lines of "if I go to the library, and look up Historical Event A, then I will open up the reliable reference book and I will (ten minutes from now, in the future) see that the book says..."

It's near-future and specific, but it's not something that his actions can change - the book will say what it says no matter whether he goes to the library or not.
