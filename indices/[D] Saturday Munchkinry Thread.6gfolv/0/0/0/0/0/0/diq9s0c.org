In fact (your thread is brilliant!) the powers of Intelligence and suspicion that the world is fake should combine exactly to break the fourth wall by in-character entertaining the hypothesis that I'm playing a PnP. A way to test this, after the tests from the edit in my previous answer pointed in the direction, would be to flip an object into one of two containers without looking, ask whether the first container I (or my acquaintances) check will contain the object, and see whether the answer was unambiguous and correct. For a GM can fudge the object to be in a superposition of the two positions and entangle it with my future actions, so long as I only observe its position after my player reveals the entangled action to the GM.
