Tricky, because the answer might come back "yes" even for a theoretical non-halting program - and then, fifteen days after the prediction, some idiot lets off a bomb at the local power station and the program halts because the computer on which it was running wasn't plugged into the UPS. Or something along those lines; some event which causes a program to halt because a computer is not a /perfect/ Turing machine.
