I'd expect that to fail for the same reason specific or short-range queries do - it begets paradox, for you might be interrupted iff you hack, which you do iff you are told you shan't be interrupted.

So one hypothesis would be that it gives you the least cryptic answer that avoids paradox. One way to test that would be to ask for whether you are going to press this button right after the ritual, press the button if it said I would, and see how cryptic the message was.

Another hypothesis would be that it gives you the least cryptic answer that it is sure, based on its fallible heuristics, will not turn out to be wrong. [This one would be the most lenient possible hypothesis if a pen-and-paper GM is supplying the answers.] In this case you might be able to figure out stuff about its heuristics with particular questions - a possibility that presents itself to me /for some reason/ is that it is good at predicting anything that doesn't depend on the future actions of you and a select number of your acquaintances.

...huh, Scion and Eidolon are the PCs of Worm. Who woulda thought?
