I'm surprised no-one has given the obvious answer of creating a fictional text taking place inside an eternal hypercomputer which is running a FAI that is aware that it exists in a fictional universe. Then most of the story would consist of the FAI monologuing about how you would instantiate it in the actual world or otherwise doing things to pass information to you.\\
Hell while you're at it you could write in that the FAI has knowledge of every single quantum event that happened in your universe's past and gains knowledge of any new quantum events in real time (obviously you can't give it perfect future knowledge because that would require making the real world's quantum events non-random). So the directions would go from general directions on making a FAI to effectively a fairly accurate path to victory.

Given the stuff about how the story progresses naturally you said to Noumero I can't see any way of realistically getting rid of this exploit, without making it so fictional characters are incapable of knowing that, and without also not allowing the power to generate any new information.
