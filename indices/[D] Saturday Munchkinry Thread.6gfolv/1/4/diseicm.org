In case B, I can use it to pass information instantly to anyone holding a piece of paper on which I have pre-written a single copy of a short story with a fourth-wall-breaking character. Though this is normally about as useful as a (one-way) cellphone, it also can't be intercepted (short of the paper being stolen).

I can't use it to create any AI; because even if I were to create a story that includes an AI, all I'd get is a single author's description of an AI, and not an actual AI itself. I can't get any information out of it that is not either already known to me, or known to the original author at the time of writing - so no information-from-the-future.

I /could/ mess around with a lot of crossovers, though. (Even in case B, if I did this to the Thursday Next novels, I'm not sure anyone would notice...)
