I would tend to figure that, regardless of the truth of the various theological claims they make, some fraction of religious texts would be considered fiction and others wouldn't based on whether the authors believed they were creating an allegory or recording history; this would be an invaluable historical resource.

Hmm... what if the authors believed they were creating an allegory /for/ history? Like, if a Biblical account is a fictionalized version of something that actually happened, like if the parting of the Red Sea story was meant to be a more exciting version of the actual event where they sailed across the Red Sea or something. (Purely an example.) Is it considered a fictional text, because the author deliberately added in details they knew weren't true, or a historical text, because the author was generally trying to record events they believe happened? I'm inclined to believe that it wouldn't count as fiction, just like you can't edit all accounts of American history just because George Washington was lying about his age and no one ever found out about it.
