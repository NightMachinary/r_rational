Hmm, in that case it could potentially be used to enforce truth-telling and read minds in e.g. contract negotiation, or hostage/ransom notes. If contracts can qualify as works for the purposes of this power, you can have all parties write them out and add "The sky is blue and I fully intend to abide by all the terms in this contract" at the end, and then check to see whether you can alter the contracts afterwards.

Also, changing religious texts might not work in a lot of cases like in my first suggestion, since presumably the authors writing them believed them to be true.
