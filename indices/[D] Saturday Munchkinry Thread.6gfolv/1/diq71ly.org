You've discovered a genie and wished for reality-warping powers. Unfortunately, in typical genie fashion, it has twisted your wish, and your powers are now limited to fictional realities. You now have complete control over the canon of every fictional universe.

This control is not retroactive, so you can't significantly change real-world history through changes to influential books, but the physical books, and any other record of the stories involved, will be altered to match. How do you best take advantage of this power under the following two scenarios?

*A:* The "any other record" stipulation includes everyone's memories. No one notices the change, but if a historically significant work is changed, this does cause some confusion when people notice that the rest of history doesn't seem to line up.

*B:* The aforementioned stipulation does /not/ include anyone's memories. People /do/ notice the changes, but most chalk them up to faulty memories, because all records point to the new canon, including hard-copy ones. A few people count the changes as more proof of the "Mandela effect", but generally aren't taken seriously.
