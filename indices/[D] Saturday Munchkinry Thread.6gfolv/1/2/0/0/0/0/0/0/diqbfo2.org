From my perspective, sure.

From the perspective of the writer of the new version, though, it /would/ be information from the future (or from nowhere, as it happens) that this person would be basing future actions on, then writing about the results.

Which would be read by the actual me.

It would be hijacking the mechanism by which this power generates stories to run extensive simulations of the real world between points A (when the first page was written) and B (when the book was finished) with insertion of outside knowledge into the mind of simulated!me, not actual time travel.
