If I introduce a change at one point in a story, does its future follow from my premise or do only my manual changes take effect? If the former, I can conjure an AGI to break into reality. (Conjuring genies wouldn't work, but one needs no magic to influence our world through what's written in a record of their world.)

What happens if I alter a book to become longer? Do the copies gain mass?

What counts as fictional universes? Can I edit all copies of an image, video, computer program or even change every 10011011 byte in the world's digital memories to a 11011011?
