[Shadowrun 5e, notable setting divergences. Tl;dr: You have intelligence beyond the limit of normal humanity, and limited precognition. How do you break out of your illusory world or stop the spread of the Necronomicon in the cyberpunk future?]

Your alias is Redline, and you are thirty years old. Long ago, you were seized by the unshakeable sense that your three-layered world - Matrix, Meatspace, and the Astral Plane - was entirely fake. Drawing on the teachings of Gnosticism, your terminal value is to discover the true nature of reality, and break out of the illusory imitation you find yourself surrounded by. For the past 8 years, you have been running the shadows, performing deniable criminal activities for the megacorporations and other powers that be, ever since the fateful car crash that took your left arm and promising career as a concert pianist. Until recently, this was in order to pursue illegal cognitive augmentations, hone your skills, and to seek the one secret that could finally allow you to make sense of everything.

Two years ago, London fell to madness, and the rest of the UK shortly followed. The entire island was cut off from the outside world, all access prohibited by order of the Corporate Court. Two of your occasional colleagues, a rigger and a pixie, made it out before the interdiction was fully enforced, and they claim to have previously worked with the person responsible, an anarchist elf adept that the rigger speculated was not entirely of this world.

Supposedly, a Deep Run into the foundations of the Matrix went horribly wrong. Everyone survived, but in the process the elf made a bargain with a simulated elder god. They woke up with a physical copy of Al Azif beside them, an apparently impossible occurrence. By all accounts, this tome insidiously corrupts all of its readers. For a short period, this was limited to the elf, the pixie, and a dragon the elf offered the tome to on a whim. Then the elf died, revealing they had set up a dead man's switch to send a digital copy of the book to everyone in range.

By now, it has become clear that the containment has failed. The Black Lodge, the most powerful secret society in Europe, has already been completely compromised. On your previous mission, you discovered the tome had spread to the Seelie Court, a metaplane subject to accelerated time and with hidden portals across the globe.

Your team is split between going down fighting, or fleeing somewhere the corruption will be unable to follow. You are currently gazing out onto the Berlin sprawl from the cramped confines of the coffin motel room, pondering your next move.

You have a newly installed, custom-designed cybernetic left arm, illegally overclocked for precision and power. Hidden behind its armour is a prototype cyberdeck, a reward for hacking the e-ghost of the dragon ex-president of the UCAS. These alone make you a formidable opponent in the Meat and the Matrix, even without all the other gear and gadgets waiting in the smuggling compartments of your tankcycle, thirty stories below.

In addition, you are a mystic adept, capable of channeling mana into spells and into your body. You have focused on enhancement and are currently affected by almost a dozen permanent spells. Through a combination of this magic, nanotechnology, genetic optimisation, and tailored nootropics, your logical abilities are at the limit of what is possible for anything but an AI or a dragon. You can even outsmart most of those.

Lastly, you have discovered that, by performing an hour-long ritual and crushing 8 magic 8-balls in your metal fist, you can achieve limited glimpses of the future. It seems to be affected by what resembles the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics: vague questions covering a month into the future receive mostly helpful, unambiguous responses, while very specific queries or those relating to the immediate future are cryptic and barely better than chance at the best of times.

What do you do?
