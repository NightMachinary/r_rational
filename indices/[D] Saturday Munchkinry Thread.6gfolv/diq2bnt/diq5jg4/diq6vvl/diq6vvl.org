Unfortunately it seems to be the latter. Even if it wasn't, you're not comfortable with putting all your confidence in this technique just yet, as you don't exactly know what's answering the questions.

For example, one idea you've had is to go to an isolated location prior to starting a hack and ask whether you will interact with anyone in meatspace or the astral in the next week. If this is the case, you can immediately return to civilisation, in order to effectively defuse the prediction. If not, however, you can camp out and be confident that the hack will go undetected as otherwise you would expect a High Threat Response team to come hunt you down.
