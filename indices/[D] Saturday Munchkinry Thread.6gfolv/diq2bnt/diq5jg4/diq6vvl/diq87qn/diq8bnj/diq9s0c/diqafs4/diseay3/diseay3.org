...how possible would it be for Redline's prophetic spell to be able to predict the /past/? That is, can Redline make a prediction about something that happened seventy years ago which Redline does not know, then go to the library and check up on the prediction?

And then, next question - are there any hints that suggest that the /past/ might be in some sort of superpositioned state that is collapsing with every prediction?

And... can Redline influence the way that the Past's superpositioned state collapses by correctly phrasing the questions?

(I know that predictions work in the FATE system by making actions that support the prediction more likely to succeed and actions that prevent it less likely to succeed, that's another option Redline might like to investigate).
