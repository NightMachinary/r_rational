Thanks! The character started as an exercise in optimisation, but once I got the idea to go meta with Gnosticism and made her a massive conspiracy theorist, she seemed like too much fun not to play!

Your point about the answers being the minimum level of vagueness necessary to ensure they're never wrong, for the sake of the GM, is an excellent one. That's probably the best way to consider the divination powers. It definitely would be fun for me (if not for the GM :P ) to come up with a series of tests in order to deduce exactly how the divination works. Sadly, the rules themselves are rather vague and lacking in detail, so that line of investigation probably wouldn't be practical out of game. However, I do really like the idea of using different queries to eliminate various hypotheses of how the mechanism of the divination works, as that's exactly the kind of process that would be in character for Redline.
