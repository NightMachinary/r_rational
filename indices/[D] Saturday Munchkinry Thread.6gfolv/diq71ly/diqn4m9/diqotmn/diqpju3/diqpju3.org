I wouldn't just tell it to make a "friendly AI" since I already know it's effectively hostile. My actual detailed wish would be long and contain many conditional statements.\\
However generally it might resemble something like "friendliness as defined by how a superintelligent version of myself working on this problem for a century of subjective time would define it", or I might just create a superintelligent version of myself and use that. Though I'm lazy, so that superintelligent version of me would probably just create another AI to actually run things, so either way things work out the same.
