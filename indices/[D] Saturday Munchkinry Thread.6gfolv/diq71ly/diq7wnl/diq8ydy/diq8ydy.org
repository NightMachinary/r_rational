Good questions. If you make a change early in a story, the rest of the plot will play out based on those changes.

A "fictional universe" is the abstract context in which the narratives take place. In this respect, you don't have complete granular control over the works themselves. Think of the power as replacing the works with works from a parallel universe in which the author had had different intentions. So if the change you make is minor enough, or not related to the main story, the book might not change at all.

So you could, say, alter DC canon so that Bruce Wayne puts all of his money into AI development, but that doesn't mean that the full code of the resulting AGI would now be included in every Batman video game. Likewise, you can't directly make a book longer; you could add diversions to the main quest to delay the heroes, but the author may decide to gloss over the details to keep it to a readable length. There may be minor fluctuations in mass, compensated for by taking matter from elsewhere, but you couldn't make a book unreasonably massive.
