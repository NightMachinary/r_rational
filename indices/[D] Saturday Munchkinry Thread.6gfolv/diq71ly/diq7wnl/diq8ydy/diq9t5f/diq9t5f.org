  Good questions. If you make a change early in a story, the rest of the plot will play out based on those changes.

And you could manipulate history books? That's /so/ broken. You could analyze the behaviour of humanity based on arbitrary premises, initiating wars or conflicts then seeing how simulated people reacted.

Better yet. Take an empty piece of paper, then decide to write an autobiography/a diary. Diligently fill it with information a few days/weeks/months/years. Then use your power on the result, changing the empty piece of paper fictional!you held at the beginning to contain some kind of message, such as “go break into NSA” --- obviously precommit to follow all messages displayed before initiating this plan first. Voilà, now you have a postcog that you could feed data from the future. You could use it to gather information, investigate, develop something; you could do so /iteratively/, by feeding the fictional you information previous instances have found, etc.

Depending on how fast the power works, you could compress decades of research into a few hours.
