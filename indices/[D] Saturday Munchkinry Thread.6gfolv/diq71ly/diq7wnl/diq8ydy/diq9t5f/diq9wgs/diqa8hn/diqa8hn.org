Hm, that's trickier. Then, sit before an empty piece of paper. If no inspiration strikes, write a story about, um, a Boltzmann Brain being angsty about sensory deprivation. Then rewrite that story completely, starting from the main premise --- now it includes some cryptic message, such as “intelligent agents dislike invading nations”, that you could be sure past!you would get --- and the plot is some kind of barely-fictional Urban Fantasy littered with important messages about the fictional real world.

You start with a fictional book, then exploit the part about “the author having different intentions”, still creating a technically fictional story. Wouldn't that work?
