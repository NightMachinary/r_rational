The fiction/nonfiction dichotomy is based on the intentions of the author, not a direct comparison to the real world. If a speculative science fiction story happens to get the future right, it doesn't become nonfiction. So both of your examples would end up classified as "fiction", since both "P = NP" and "P â‰  NP" came from your imagination, not your knowledge.
