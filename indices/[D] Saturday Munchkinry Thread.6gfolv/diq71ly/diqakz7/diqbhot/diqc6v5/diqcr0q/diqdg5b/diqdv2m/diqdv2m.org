Something like that might work, though it might require tweaking how contracts are done somewhat to include more of a narrative structure. It could definitely be used as a lie detector; falsified testimony would certainly count as a fictional narrative. It could presumably also be used to probe the minds of long-dead authors.

I'm not sure whether religious texts could be changed, because a lot of the myths were arguably allegorical and not intended as literal historical truths.
