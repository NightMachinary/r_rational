I think maybe if you were subtle about it and didn't change anything too strongly at once in the first case, people would write off historical inconsistencies as motivated thinking/hypocrisy, and the semi-universal nature of the changes would potentially help there (if all these great figures agree on some important truth, then surely it must hold some merit!)

In the second case, "inorganic" advertising/product placement might be tricky/suspicious, but I think if it's sufficiently un-commercial I could still make a killing -- e.g. buy up the art of some old, dead, obscure painter, and change fictional works to extol their immense skill and revolutionary ability. Then, after revealing that I've miraculously found a hidden collection of their paintings I can sell them off for some obscene amount of money. If art is more about signaling than "objective" quality it shouldn't be too suspicious, compared to Jesus loving the refreshing taste of Pepsi or whatever.

Since the power is limited to fictional realities, it must have some way to distinguish fiction from non-fiction, right? If I write a non-fiction book, and then introduce a detail about some unknown event or principle, does the book become classified (according to the power) as fiction if that detail does not correspond to (nonfictional) reality? If so, I feel I could use this as a way to divine hidden truths, e.g. by writing two books consisting of:

"The sky is blue. P = NP. My hair is brown."

and

"The sky is blue. P =/= NP. My hair is brown."

Since my hair really is brown and the sky really is blue, I can try to alter the propositions relating to color in each book, and thereby see whether P=NP by virtue of which book's canon I can manipulate.
