Jesus, Mohammed, various Jewish Prophets, Zoroaster, Confucius, Laozi, Buddha, the Saptarishi, etc. now advocate a system of values much more closely aligned with my own.

More aggressively, since real-world history is not altered, I can use this to trivially modify consumer demand for certain products, and, by seizing control of supply before exercising my ability, become fabulously wealthy. Suddenly, all the aforementioned figures, along with Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, Batman, etc. yearn for the possession of, IDK, rocks from a very particular quarry that happens to be in my possession. Hell, make it a holy site, and me its rightful heir, and also there's a very strong taboo against counterfeiting these rocks or taking any actions to harm those who own the land.

Then I can sell/donate the rocks for immense profit (rinse and repeat for any similar good).
