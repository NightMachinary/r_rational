Hmm...I have wondered about promoting participation. I think writing to a prompt can be tricky, and perhaps less fun than simply trying out a new genre. Many writers can get stuck in a rut of writing the same old thing, and might like a chance to stretch their creative muscles. Alternatively, some people enjoy writing in one or two genres, but would love an opportunity to show off their work. :)

I also think bi-weekly could be stretched out to once a month/two months. That gives people time to think up and write a story they feel comfortable sharing. Also, giving out a calendar for the year might help. Example: January: Sci-fi, February: Romance, March: Humor, etc. Authors have more time to plan and it gives them something to look forward to.
