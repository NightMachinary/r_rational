Good ideas! My thoughts:

1. Agreed
2. I'd prefer a longer event, but I also take longer to write things. Flash fiction is fun but doesn't seem much different from the biweekly writing prompt.
3. What about optional prompts? I agree that constraints can bring out creativity, but poor prompts can be restrictive. It also puts more pressure on the person planning the monthly events, whoever that might be.
