I think this could work better under some conditions:

1. it has to be more of an "event". A biweekly continuously running contest becomes simply background noise, you keep telling yourself that maybe you'll take part in the next one and then never do;\\
2. it has to be properly short, so that people see it as a lot of fun with relatively small time investment. Like, do-it-in-some-free-time-over-the-weekend short;\\
3. it has to have interesting and stimulating enough templates. Restrictions often aid creativity, don't impede it, as they allow you to focus your attention on a smaller section of the space of possibilities. Just a single word is often very little, for that purpose.

Under these conditions I think a small event of this sort could be feasible. I'm down for stuff like 500-word stories or even shorter, in particular. They can be really fun to write as you try to work your ideas into the word count limit.
