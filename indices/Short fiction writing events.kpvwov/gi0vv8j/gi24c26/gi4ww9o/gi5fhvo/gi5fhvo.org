Based on the response to your post, it seems like there's interest. The question then, as you said, is how to actually make it happen.

My experience: When I ran this year's Secret Krampus contest, I just messaged the mods first for permission, and they were cool with it. They even stickied the contest threads and put them in contest mode for me. So you could probably run a genre-themed event yourself, just by following the same process. This would be less work for you than a prompt exchange contest like Krampus, since you wouldn't need to distribute prompts. You could further reduce your workload by having people post their stories in the thread themselves, like in the old biweekly contests, instead of DMing them to you to post. So the workload for you would be writing the event post, requesting permission/sticky/contest mode from the mods, and potentially announcing the winner if you want to run it like a contest. If you don't want it to be a long-term commitment, maybe you could accompany the event with a request for a volunteer to run the next one, and they could do the same when it's their turn, and so on.

What do you think? Would you be interested in running an event?
