One point where I think the comic is wrong:

The universes can interact through the chip, so this means the universes are entangled with each other. This should mean that a split by /any/ Ulf should split the entire 'multiverse', so it would double /all/ the Ulfs. So the rate of growth is not just 2^{# of splits}, instead each Ulf only committing 2 splits (from their perspective) is enough to diverge to infinity instantly. A single Ulf deciding not to split a second time will cancel the infinite doubling though.
