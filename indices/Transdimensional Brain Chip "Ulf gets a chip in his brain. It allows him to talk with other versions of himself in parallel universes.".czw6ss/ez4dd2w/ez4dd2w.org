If you get the power to split into four time lines or split once and then split again at a separate time what would you do?

Power works like this does, you can fade in and out, you can communicate by thought, to pay attention you can't be distracted.

Isn't it best to split into four immediately? But then the time lines will drift apart.

Perhaps you wait until before a big decision?

One use is during exams you can assign each of you to a specific topic then copy each other during the exam. Of course then you won't learn everything which could be an issue.
