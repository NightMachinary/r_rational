[[http://lies.thecomicseries.com/][/Lies, Sisters and Wives/]] is crap; just one long comedy of errors with no rational themes. Skip it.

[[http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/][/The Accidental Space Spy/]] is not as good as /Transdimensional Brain Chip/, but it's still worth reading. It's about this guy who gets mistaken for a space spy and is forced to travel to many different alien worlds while trying to solve a mystery. Each planet has a different species of alien, each with their own unique evolutionary psychology and physiology. Think [[http://web.archive.org/web/20090704030515/http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/][/Three Worlds Collide/]] minus the game theory.

I haven't read [[http://hitmen.thecomicseries.com/][/Hitmen For Destiny/]] or [[http://trixie.webcomic.ws/comics/first/][/Trixie Slaughteraxe for President/]].
