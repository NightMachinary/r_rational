Plot hole: The button is too powerful. As soon as Aisha had figured out how to make it safe to expand, she could have simply precommitted to pressing the button a bunch of times, so that all her split-offs would press it too, yielding exponential growth. She must have done something like this to get a network of 10 million within 3 days. But the story vastly underestimates that kind of growth. She could have easily gotten a network bigger than the square of Ulf's within /one minute/, as soon as it was possible to spread with impunity. Then she could have easily outclassed Ulf's network in any world with better antivirus technology, and once she had done it once she could have done the same in every world in her network.

The biggest plothole isn't really that Aisha didn't do that, however. It's that /Ulf/ somehow didn't manage to figure out how to speed up the splitting process in his chip, especially since it was apparently an arbitrary limitation. He specifically shows that he has access to brain-computer interface technology, and yet not one of his millions of copies figured that it should work on improving his chip, or even just removing the timer, given that it too is brain-computer interface technology, and it's the most useful piece of technology he has! It doesn't make sense to argue that he was distracted by his world manipulation or his religious wars either: world manipulation becomes much easier the more computing power you have, and the first religious faction to successfully remove the timer from the chip would instantly and totally dominate the network.
