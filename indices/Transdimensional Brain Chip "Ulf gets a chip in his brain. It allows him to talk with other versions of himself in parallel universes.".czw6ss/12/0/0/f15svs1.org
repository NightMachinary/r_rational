Bit of a necro, but I still think it's a bit of a horrifying world. She's letting countless people die that she could save because she somehow thinks that's less evil than just using her nanotech to regulate reproduction, and her brain-hack motivates sole focus on average happiness, which might be OK if you're the sort of utilitarian that really thinks that should be the sole factor, but I value things like freedom even in the absence of an associated increase in happiness.
