I'm about halfway through. This is fucking hilarious. Making the protagonist an idiot was definitely the right move.

Edit: Wow, that really escalated! It was a lot of fun. One thing I'm confused about: How did Aisha manage to outnumber Ulf? Every time one of herselves split, shouldn't that have created a new universe with a new brain-virused, chip-connected Ulf? Or maybe it wasn't literally creating new universes, just connecting her with similar ones, but it still shouldn't have been possible for her to outnumber him because there'd still be a chip-connected Ulf in every universe she connected to by pressing the button in a universe where she hadn't defeated him yet. Maybe there were multiple, isolated Ulf networks, each of which originated with a different universe's Original Ulf getting the surgery, and Aisha was able to access universes across more than one Ulf network while each Ulf could only access within his own network? I guess that last idea works, although there might be a simpler solution I haven't thought of.
