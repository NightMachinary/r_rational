  Every time someone "splits" (bearing in mind that the chip didn't actually split anything, but connected to a universe that diverged at the same moment), all other networks in that universe (still 1 per chipped person though) are split wholesale, but while the splitter's chip connects the two resultant versions, no such process happens for the other networks. So while in a sense there may be more individual Ulfs, each Aisha split does not increase anyone's network size but her own.
