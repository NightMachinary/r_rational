This comic hasn't been reposted in four years ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ouxcm/xrisktransdimensional_brain_chip/][link 1]], [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/35ayz7/transdimensional_brain_chip_now_finished/][link 2]]), so I think it's time. The art is godawful and the beginning is very slow (A/B testing is the first thing any moron would do with this power, which makes sense since Ulf starts out the story as a random moron but is boring to get through) but once it gets going it gets /really/ good. Existential risk, the anthropic principle, weaponized memetics, applied utilitarianism... truly a must-read for any rationalist.
