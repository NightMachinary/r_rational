Right, but see my edits. Every time an Aisha presses the button while her Ulf is active and has a working chip, the "new" universe she connects to must also have an active Ulf with a working chip, so there should always be a connected Ulf for every newly connected Aisha, excepting any Aishas split off from universes without a connected Ulf. Which would make it difficult if not impossible for her to outnumber him. I think it works if there are multiple Ulf networks that are separate from each other, so each individual Aisha has access to a much larger network than the one she's competing against.
