Because our meat-brains don't have the capacity to conceptualize Infinity. It's right there in the first strip.

#+begin_quote
  Every moment, our universe splits into a gazillion other universes.

  [The] chip will let you communicate with [a] version of you... in [*/one/*] universe that just split off from ours.
#+end_quote

The second strip? The first split? That's playing out a gazillion times with a gazillion other Ulfs A and Ulfs B, who will have each split seven gazillion times by the time of the second split. Every time there's a number denoting total Ulfs? Multiply that number by infinity. There are infinite Aishas A and Aishas B. A human meat-brain just can't write that story.

EDIT: Rearranged the order of some sentences, nothing was added or removed.

EDIT: Replaced an [*/a/*] with a [*/one/*].
