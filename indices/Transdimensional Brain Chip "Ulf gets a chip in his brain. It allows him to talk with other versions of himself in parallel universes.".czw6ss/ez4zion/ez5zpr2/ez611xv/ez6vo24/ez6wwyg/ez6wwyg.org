It's confusing to think about because it seems to imply that when a non-Ulf splits a universe with an Ulf in it, it results in a duplication of the entire Ulf-network, with the "original" and newly-diverged Ulfs each only having access to one of the networks. So when Aisha splits...why doesn't that double her entire network instead of increasing it by one? Or does it? Early on she went from 2 connected selves to 3, which suggests a button press does only add one new Aisha.
