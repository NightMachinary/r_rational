You are thinking that every time Aisha clicked the remote a new universe was created, but if you reread the very first comic, you'll see that the universe is naturally splitting over and over every second. The remote is just connecting Aisha with another Aisha from an identical universe that split at the same time as the remote being pressed. So Ulf doesn't split when Aisha does.
