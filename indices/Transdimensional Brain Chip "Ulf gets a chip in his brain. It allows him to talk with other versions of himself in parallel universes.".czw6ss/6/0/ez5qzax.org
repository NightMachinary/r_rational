I think we're meant to infer that once Aisha defeated Ulf, she set about implementing her own vision of utopia, which is what we see in the epilogue. We don't really need to know exactly how she did that; we saw how easily Ulf took over Earth once his own smarts and resources had snowballed enough, so we can assume that Aisha similarly took over Earth with ease as soon as her competition was out of the way.
