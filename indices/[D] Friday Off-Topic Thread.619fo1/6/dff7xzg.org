So I've been looking through this Jumpchain thing that people use to make stories, and is it just me or is it really badly designed from the perspective of wiritng interesting stories? 10 years in-story is way more time than most people have in them to write. So a lot of it just ends up being phoned in because the writer feels like they need to get through multiple ten years slogs before they're done. They're mostly SI so the person choosing the perks avoids the difficult (read interesting) perks and difficulties in favour of choosing an optimal build that makes everything easy. This and other things means that not only is it a low pressure stomp train even at its hardest, more often than not you end up reading a summary of events rather than an actual story. Ya'know, a story with a plot, and intruige, and suspense, and characters with meaningful goals that aren't quasi-brainwashed into always following the main character regardless.

It's like taking a standard SI and then pumping them full of steroids, removing all of the actual challenge and difficulty, then skimping out on proper character interactions because really what's the point if they're not going to be there next jump.

What a waste of beginner writers.
