I've put out the second chapter of my fanfiction The Greatest Weasley, bringing it to just under 4,000 words. I've found this one fairly easy to write, and hopefully I'll be able to add more to it as time passes. I like the premise and hadn't seen it executed well, so I thought, why not do it myself?

Not a rational fic, but let me know what you think!
