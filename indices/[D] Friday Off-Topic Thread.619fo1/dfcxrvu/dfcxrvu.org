Ok, so I've been thinking about Death Note recently. Not really sure why. And I had a question I've been meaning to ask some of the fine minds here at the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] sub, specifically those that have seen the manga/anime already (if you haven't, I highly recommend it, it's a very intelligent series and very well done, if a little contrived at times. I'd probably call it one of the more rational works out there).

As anyone who's seen or even heard about it knows, DN is basically about this guy that find a death magic notebook that lets him kill anyone who's name and face he's seen. He proceeds to use this to kill criminals (a fairly inefficient method, for a number of reasons) to help create a "new world" because he finds the current one is rotten and unjust.

Now, my first question. What are some gaping holes/issues in the series that you noticed and that bothered you? One for me is how the deductive reasoning skills of L and Light, while being somewhat believable, still seemed almost magical at times. Oftentimes, a plan would be enacted and I'd find myself thinking "There's no way, no matter how smart you are, you would've foreseen X and so done Y like that!". I get that we're supposed to buy it because these guys are legendary geniuses but I felt like this was used cheaply to move the plot along. I still enjoyed the ride, there's no question, but I found these instances fairly annoying from a rationalist standpoint, as the real reason was sometimes very obviously "The writer made it this way" as opposed to "Someone really intelligent figured it out".

Now, for my second question (and even non DN watchers can answer this): Do you think the main character has an effective, moral goal? He has a death notebook and is using it to kill criminals (murderers, serial rapists, etc.) to act as both the ultimate deterrent and to remove those who've committed heinous acts from this world entirely. Is this the best way for the MC to use such a thing if he really wanted to make a better world? And, even if it is effective, is it morally right?
