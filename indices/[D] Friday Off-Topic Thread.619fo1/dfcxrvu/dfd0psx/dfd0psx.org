  He has a death notebook and is using it to kill criminals (murderers, serial rapists, etc.) to act as both the ultimate deterrent and to remove those who've committed heinous acts from this world entirely. Is this the best way for the MC to use such a thing if he really wanted to make a better world?

No, I don't think so.

The Death Note manipulates the future, correct?^{1} The people whose names written in it will die either in forty second of heart attack, or at the time of your choosing in the situation of your choosing?

If so, it's so gameable it's not even funny. /'[Murderer #443] died during March 31, year 2020, after serving as my devoted slave for three years,'/ is there a reason it won't work? If it needs to be a /cause/ of death, simply write 'died of overworking'.

But that's small fish. Can't you simply write /worldstates/ in there? /'[Bystander #4] died of heart attack in year 2304, in the most advanced hospital of the perfect human solar_system-spanning eudaemonic utopia peacefully established by humanity in preceding centuries, right next to the equipment necessary to ressurect him in the next five minutes'/?

/'[Bystander #5] had his neck broken by a solid-state drive containing the ready-to-execute code of a truly Friendly seed AGI that appeared above his head'/?

It seems people focus too much on the 'death' part of the 'death control', and not enough on the 'control'.

^{1. I'm actually asking. I admit, I did not watch the anime neither read the manga, but I'm familiar with the power and just now skimmed} ^{[[http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note][this]]} ^{article to try and find the evidence that my understanding of the power was incorrect and so the above won't work. But I don't think anything there proves that? There are rules that 'the situation should be possible', but the above is certainly /possible/, merely /unlikely/.}
