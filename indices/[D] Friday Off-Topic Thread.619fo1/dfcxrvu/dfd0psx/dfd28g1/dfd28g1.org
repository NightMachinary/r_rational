The Death Note has several limitations that make any game breaking a huge challenge, if not downright impossible. The main relevant limitations are you only have control of someone up to 23 days after putting their name down. Now, the upside is that you have pretty much full control over them during that time. You could easily write:

/Bob Jones, heart attack, April 16 2017, does whatever I, MC, commands until then without question or hesitation./

And it seems the Death Note favors the writer, as opposed to the victim, where there's ambiguity. So, in the above example, Bob wouldn't be able to find some loophole in my orders as they're implemented magically based on how I feel they should be done (no djinn tricks here!)

As far as your other questions, the Death Note has no effect on anything besides people. It can't make things spawn out of thin air or anything in that realm. All you can do is kill people and control how they die. But their death needs to be reasonably able to be accomplished. if "fate" or whoever determines their death is too difficult, then the person just dies of a heart attack. This also occurs if, by causing their own death, said person kills other people (unless those conditions were laid out specifically in the conditions you wrote, such as /Bob kills himself by hijacking a bus and driving it into a river in an attempt to take as many people with him as he could/. If you left out the last section, events would happen such that Bob hijacks a bus and drives it into a river solo)

You're also limited in that you only have six minutes and forty seconds to write in conditions. After that, it will run with what you have written down or, if it's not possible because your conditions need the other stuff you wrote down to happen, the victim dies of a heart attack.
