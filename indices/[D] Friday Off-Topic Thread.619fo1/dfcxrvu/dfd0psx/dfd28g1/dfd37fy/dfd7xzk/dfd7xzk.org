  .... But that's the same article I linked in my initial comment!

Well. That'll teach me to skim XD

Also, in re-reading my comment, I realize I may have come off sassy. That wasn't my intent at all. I was honestly saying you could peruse them at your leisure. But your comment made it clear you already did that. So...yea...I shouldn't skim, lol.

  I see. But it assures that things will be where I write them to be, if they could plausibly end up there through human actions, correct? Why won't the ones in my comment up the tree work (the reply to [[/u/DRMacIver][u/DRMacIver]]), then?

Some of those sound viable. The rules state that 23 days is the max length of time you can set someone's death to be. If you write down a date beyond that, the person will either day immediately or after 23 days have passed. 23 days is like the hard limit put in place. The manipulation and stuff is possible; it's just that the person in question will die in three weeks. Once you can work within that time frame, you can realistically make anyone do anything. And there definitely is lots of potential there.
