  Bob Jones, heart attack, April 16 2017, does whatever I, MC, commands until then without question or hesitation

Just want to state that if you were to write that death, assuming MC is a replacement for your "real name", it would kill you by heart attack in 40 seconds. Having your name written in the note results in your death, even if you're writing it in a description.
