  The Note manipulates the future, correct? The people whose names written in it will die either in forty second of heart attack, or at the time of your choosing in the situation of your choosing?

This is correct but experimenting with its capabilities is one of the first thing Light does. If you try anything too implausible then what happens is they just die of a heart attack.

I'm not sure if it's specifically tested whether someone can die prematurely if you've set them to die at a future date.
