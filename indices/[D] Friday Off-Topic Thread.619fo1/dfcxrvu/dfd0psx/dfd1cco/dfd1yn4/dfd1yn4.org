  If you try anything too implausible then what happens is they just die of a heart attack.

Hmm. Fair enough. I still think that manipulating worldstates through causes of death is a better way of fixing the world.

Finding patients that are expected to die in a few years if no cure is found, placing their deaths a few decades later due to accidents. Writing people dying of heart attacks after reading valid articles telling about worldwide decrease in death rates or poverty. Manipulating politicians into showing more concern for existential threats.

Even if these are still too 'implausible' and need to be toned-down, I'm positive that you could manipulate the future through one artificially-created cause of death better than with natural consequences of one's death.
