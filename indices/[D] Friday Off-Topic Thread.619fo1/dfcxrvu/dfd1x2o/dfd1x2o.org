Given that it's only effective on people who are publicly known to be terrible criminals but have evaded arrest, it's only going to eliminate a small percent of all criminals. Eventually, people will figure out that only people who end up on the news get killed, so the deterrence level of "I'm okay as long as I don't get arrested" only gets increased to "I'm okay as long as I don't get discovered and broadcast."

A much better method of improving the world would be to become an unstoppable assassin. Bin Laden? Dead. Kim Jong Un? Dead. He can take out any evil dictator and any of their officers as long as their name and face are public knowledge. He could probably anonymously contact the government, prove the legitimacy of his power, and coordinate with them to kill off a number of important people in an enemy nation or group simultaneously, and have the army go in there to handle the power vaccuum. Since he can control the death time down to the second, they would know exactly when to move. And given that he can basically mind control someone for 23 days before they ultimately die, he could probably force them to step down from dictatorship, and set up a new, more democratic government, before going off and dying in a ditch somewhere (or giving some speech about how terrible they feel for their actions and committing suicide).

You can argue about the morality of this, it's clearly abusable. But it would be far more effective than killing "criminals" who are responsible for at most dozens of deaths rather than thousands.

Even if he wanted to become a god, he should have just secretly threatened all of the politicians, of every nation, and made them into puppet governments. I don't know about Japan, but if he did that in America at least 80% of congress would cave. At any point in the story when he realized he was getting in over his head he could have just got up and went to America and become a shadow king. Yeah, it would have been totally obvious to the investigators after he left that he was actually guilty, but by that point he's in another country with a new name, a new life, probably in the witness protection program or something because he has congress by the balls and can make them do pretty much whatever he wants as long as he can make sure they don't kill him.
