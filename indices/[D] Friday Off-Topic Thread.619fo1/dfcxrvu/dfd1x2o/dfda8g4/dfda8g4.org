I think the first ten episodes of this show are basically perfect, but even I found it really odd that Light limited himself to people in Japan. I also found it really weird that an FBI agent showed up only for the US government to be uncharacteristically intimidated into submission by Kira's response. Even by the standards America has set for being the global center of attention, it these seem like an odd oversights.
