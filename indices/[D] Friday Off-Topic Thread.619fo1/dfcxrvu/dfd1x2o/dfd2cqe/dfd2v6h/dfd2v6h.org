I guess what he would need to do is set up his new identity in a way such that nobody knew he was there. So if he did witness protection he'd have to mind control some secretary or something to switch files around, rather than having the threatened people officially arrange for it. Or just kill someone with no family/friends and take their identity. If all of his contact with them was anonymous, he could still have them do things that benefit him (like creating and funding a new government branch CIA-like-thing that does things he tells them to and pays him a salary into a swiss bank account)
