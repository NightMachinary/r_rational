Replying to address my second question: I think it's a very inefficient way to go about things. I don't have hard numbers but I'm certain that at least a few thousand people worldwide are the perpetrators of crimes that the MC would consider heinous enough to die for. He simply doesn't have the time to kill all of them, especially when you consider that he needs both a name and a face. That's a lot of research to do and he can't afford to sit in his house at the computer all day.

Now, I'm sure it would act as a deterrent, in the same way that police forces and martial law does, but I don't think it will significantly improve the world in any way in and of itself. Certainly not enough for him to consider himself a "god of the new world".

As far as if it's morally right? I would say yes /If and Only If/ our MC had some way of confirming his victims were truly guilty and if he didn't kill the people that would invariably be trying to catch him (which, in the series, he does. Heavily.)
