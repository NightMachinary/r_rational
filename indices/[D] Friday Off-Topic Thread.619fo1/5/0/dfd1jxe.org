  Father had once taken him to see a play called The /Tragedy of Light/, about this /incredibly/ clever Slytherin named Light who'd set out to purify the world of evil using an ancient ring that could kill anyone whose name and face he knew, and who'd been opposed by another incredibly clever Slytherin, a villain named Lawliet, who'd worn a disguise to conceal his true face; and Draco had shouted and cheered at all the right parts, especially in the middle; and then the play had ended sadly and Draco had been hugely disappointed and Father had gently pointed out that the word 'Tragedy' was right there in the title.

  Afterward, Father had asked Draco if he understood why they had gone to see this play.

  Draco had said it was to teach him to be as cunning as Light and Lawliet when he grew up.

  Father had said that Draco couldn't possibly be more wrong, and pointed out that while Lawliet had cleverly concealed his face there had been no good reason for him to tell Light his /name/. Father had then gone on to demolish almost every part of the play, while Draco listened with his eyes growing wider and wider. And Father had finished by saying that plays like this were /always/ unrealistic, because if the playwright had known what someone /actually/ as smart as Light would /actually/ do, the playwright would have tried to take over the world himself instead of just writing plays about it.

  That was when Father had told Draco about the Rule of Three, which was that any plot which required more than three different things to happen would never work in real life.

  Father had /further/ explained that since only a fool would attempt a plot that was /as complicated as possible/, the real limit was two.

  And, even if it is effective, is it morally right?

This is a common rhetorical trap for utilitarianism: if you /knew/ this great evil would result in even greater good, should you do it? Yes - *but* in real life, /having that certainty/ is all but impossible. When you account for a probability of failure, the expected value can drop very quickly.
