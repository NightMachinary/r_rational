  I was honestly saying you could peruse them at your leisure
#+end_quote

That was my interpretation as well; no offence taken.

#+begin_quote
  The rules state that 23 days is the max length of time you can set someone's death to be
#+end_quote

Just the article I've skimmed:

#+begin_quote
  /If you write, die of disease for the cause of death, but only write a specific time of death without the actual name of disease, the human will die from an adequate disease. But the Death Note can only operate within 23 days (in the human calendar). This is called the 23 day rule./
#+end_quote

I suppose the lesson about not-skimming applies to me as well.

That said, the rule appeares to not be fundamental?

#+begin_quote
  /If you write die of disease like before with a specific disease's name, but without a specific time, if it takes more than 24 days for the human to die the 23 day rule will not take effect and the human will die at an adequate time depending on the disease./ --- [[http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note#How_to_Use:_XXVIII][How to Use: XXVIII]]
#+end_quote

This is confusing. So if you specify the way the victim dies, and your scenario takes longer than 23 days to unfold, but both inevitabily results in the victim's death and doesn't specify the time of the death, it will happen as you've written? Or is that somehow unique to diseases?
