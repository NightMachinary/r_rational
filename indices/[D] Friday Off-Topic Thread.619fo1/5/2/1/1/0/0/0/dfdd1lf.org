I think the idea is that the /cause/ of death must occur/manifest within 23 days, even if the death itself may occur beyond that timeframe. (E.g. if you write that someone will be shot 22 days, 23 hours, and 59 minutes from now, it's permissible, even though realistically speaking they won't bleed out until several hours later--since the /shooting itself/ occurs within the time limit, it doesn't fall afoul of the 23-day rule.)
