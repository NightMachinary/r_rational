Yes, the /Death Note/ controls the future. I vaguely recall there's a time limit, but I can't find it skimming through that link, maybe I'm mistaken.

But if the death is "too implausible" it will be replaced by an immediate heart attack, and there's no strict rule about what counts as implausible. (It's a convenient escape clause to prevent any trick unwanted for Doylist reasons.)

The protagonist, in good [[/r/rational]] fashion, [[https://youtu.be/vfMspmV9bsw?t=8m03s][experimented with a number of edge cases]] (though stupidly letting his enemies learn from them as well). As a lower bound, anything that can't be achieved by casting the Imperius curse on all of humanity will fail. Getting information out of the aether is right out.
