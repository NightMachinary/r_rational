Yeah, if anything I consider the sorts of glitches Super Mario 64 have in its favour, since they don't impact the casual player and allow for all sorts of cool and interesting things for the dedicated players to do. At the low low cost of just not going out of your way to fix the bugs, you add yet another level of depth for those willing to dive that deep.
