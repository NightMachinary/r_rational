  I'm curious if people here have looked into marginal improvements to the system?
#+end_quote

The easiest and most direct thing I can think of is throwing money at the problem, particularly in the form of teacher salaries across the board and in the form of classroom supplies (for poorer classrooms).

More teacher salary will attract more teachers, and possibly attract higher skill teachers who would otherwise pursue more profitable professions. This will allow for reduction in class size which would allow for more specialization in teachers (dividing up the students by giftednesd level or even by learning types or student needs). As it currently is, teachers are not paid in a way that matches their education level or the sheer number of extra hours their job requires (planning curriculum, grading homework, calling parents, and any extra clubs or programs they support).

Classroom supplies... right now schools are funded at a local county level, not at a state or federal level. Students from poorer areas can be screwed on basic supplies like textbooks or if the students are especially poor, stuff like folders/binders/notebook paper/etc.

So yeah. Kind of a simple solution, but surprisingly difficult to implement given the opposition to federal government intervention and how it would change how the money moved around.

To answer specific concerns:

  Critiques of the traditional classroom paradigm

More money for teacher salaries=more teachers=room to experiment with one or two teachers specializing with less traditional classrooms or alternative teaching/learning approaches.

#+begin_quote
  Lack of well-defined pathways for very smart students.
#+end_quote

More teachers=more room for specialization/smaller class sizes=classes specifically targeted for the handful of most gifted students in the school (and conversely the students most in need of additional help/guidance/one-on-one focus).

#+begin_quote
  Lack of widespread use of well-backed pedagogical techniques, like retrieval practice
#+end_quote

More teacher= each teacher can have more planning periods/time allocated, which may give them room to learn and prepare to use advanced pedagogical techniques.
