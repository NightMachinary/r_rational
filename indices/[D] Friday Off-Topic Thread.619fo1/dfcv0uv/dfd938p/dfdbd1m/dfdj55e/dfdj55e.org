Here in Canada, you don't really see anything like that for any schools below university / college, especially in the public school system. Here, for college and university, you get oral exam and thesis assessed by minimum of supervisor + internal (inside department) + external (outside your department) + person from outside your university... at the Masters and PhD level, programs. Some different programs mix it up a bit - having a thesis for the Bachelor level, or not require an external to the university for Master's degrees, or whatever. This sort of thing would probably be a really good idea but it would also be time-intensive. The closest thing we get to that here in Canada are that the final set of written exams for high-school level are set nationally and marked by contractors who are not the instructors.
