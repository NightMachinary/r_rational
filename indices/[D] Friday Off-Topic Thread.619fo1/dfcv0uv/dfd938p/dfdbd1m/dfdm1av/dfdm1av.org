So, there is standardized testing at the state level in the US, but many of the standardized tests are "Goodhart's Law-esque" traps in terms of education, teachers teach to the test and not to maximize learning.

The Florida FCAT, I remember was despised pretty thoroughly. I hated it as a student myself, although mostly because it was so mind numblingly easy, I didn't have much sympathy for the complaints of students not able to pass it. (Performing well on the FCAT literally required bare minimum reading/writing/Math skills, I have a hard time understanding how someone not developmentally disabled might fail). In High School there was also county level exams for each class, which were a littles less than 1/3 of the semester grade. I thought these were too easy as well, and they didn't capture everything that should be one the curriculum for a class sometimes.

Others have mentioned the SAT, which I think is okay as a test, but basing someones entire college admission on just the score or setting an absolute minimum threshold is stupid. If someone for example had several AP credit classes in high school, and had lots of community involvement and activities, a lower SAT score should be tolerable. As it is, I think it varies from college to college, with some colleges using it as an easy way to weed out applicants.

I think the AP exams were actually good tests. They were hard, but because they were hard, inclusive of a lot of material, and designed with multiple types of questions (short responses, long responses, multiple choice, even oral recordings for some classes like foreign languages), many colleges accept them as credits.

  Oral exams are held by your teacher + one outsider, as a sort of good cop / bad cop routine where your own teacher tries to nudge you in the right direction.

This sounds like a pretty good idea... I would imagine US schools would find someway of screwing it up though.
