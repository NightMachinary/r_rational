The thing about Goodhart's Law traps is spot-on! I'm working on an extended write-up for high school friends of mine, so my asking of the question here was to source some add'l viewpoints for solutions I'd yet to consider.

I think AP tests are fairly suboptimal in terms of their grading (very lenient curves that reduce the actual amount you need to know. Something like 50% of people get 5's on AP Calc BC, for example, and you can get that score if you skip some problems) and setup (studying an entire year for a three hour test seems fairly unbalanced), though.
