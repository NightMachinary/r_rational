There was a bit from Eliezer's April Fools day thing that touched on this as well:

#+begin_quote
  Tell a real educator about how Earth classes are taught in three-month-sized units, and they would've sputtered and asked how you can iterate fast enough to learn how to teach that. Tell them that the same universities that taught were also responsible for certifying that teaching had occurred successfully - that the performance of education, and the verification and certification of education, were carried out by the same financial entity - and they would have just turned and walked away. Tell them that students paid up front whether the university succeeded or failed at training them, and they'd turn around and start yelling about dishonorable fraud.
