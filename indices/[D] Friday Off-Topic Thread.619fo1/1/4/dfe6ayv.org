[[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148319/tragedy-looper][Tragedy Looper]] is my absolute favorite game, /possibly/ because it's a time travel mystery deduction game.\\
If you are psychic there is no luck in the game, but because you lack information you have to make informed /random/ choices that can be (un)lucky. As the game goes on and you get more info, your actions become more purposeful giving you a sense of progression and capability.
