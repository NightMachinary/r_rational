Not a boardgame, but Malifaux is a roleplaying game that uses a deck of cards rather than dice. When you would roll a d20 in D&D, in Malifaux you instead flip a card from the top of your deck (adding the result to the modifier to see if you hit the DC).

In my opinion there are two neat things that Malifaux does with this. The first is that there are positive flips and negative flips, which somewhat mimic advantage and disadvantage in D&D (though I think Malifaux the minis game had them first). If you have beneficial circumstances, you can flip two or more cards and take the better one. If you have negative circumstances, you flip two or more cards and take the worse of them.

The second neat thing is that players have a hand full of cards drawn from the deck, which they can use in order to replace any neutral (one card) flip or better. Cards in hand are a limited resource, so you don't want to use them too often, but they're basically luck mitigation so long as you aren't trying something ridiculous that you have bad circumstances (negative flip) on. Since you can only refill your hand at certain points, there's a good balance to it. And suits of the cards matter, so even low value cards in your hand are worth something depending on what you're trying to do.

(Malifaux the RPG is descended from Malifaux the minis game, so probably closer to a tabletop than most. It's got some other issues, but the core mechanics are pretty interesting, especially the tarot reading you do as part of character creation.)
