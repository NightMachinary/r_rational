So I recently bought a game called [[http://daystareld.com/review-cultists-of-cthulhu/][Cultists of Cthulhu]] from Thomas Eliot, a fellow rationalist who has designed and released multiple board games. You can read the review of it I put on my site there, and in it I discuss dice rolling mechanics in games, and how Cultists adds an extra level to it:

  Now, normally dice rolling is one of my least favorite parts of games due to the random element it puts in, but this one does something clever with it.

  After you roll your dice, you can choose any symbol you've rolled and reroll all dice of that kind. So let's say you roll your dice and get 2 Success, 1 Weird, and 2 Fail. The card requires you to get 3 Success to get the positive effect, 2 Weird for the Weird effect, and 2 Fail is enough to get the negative effect. So a smart choice might be to reroll the 2 Fail dice. Hopefully, you'd get the 1 extra success you need and avoid the 2 Fail effect... but if the Weird effect is actually something you really don't want to have happen right now, it might not be worth the risk, and you might choose to just reroll the Weird, accept the two Fail, and hope that one dice will get you the third Success.

  Mechanics like this help add a lot of nuance to otherwise rote gameplay, and is one of the strongest parts of the game. There are some genuinely hard choices it forces you to make, while also helping mitigate the downsides of a luck-based mechanic. I've had some great arguments erupt at the table as people try to decide which dice to reroll, and it's all made more tense by the knowledge that one of the players is actually a cultist in disguise!

It made me think about ways to introduce decisions to chance mechanics in other games too, but when I tried to think of other examples I came up a bit short. My favorite games tend to be those with a lot of social aspects and with few (if any) dice rolling (Avalon/The Resistence/Secret Hitler, or Dixit, or [[http://daystareld.com/game-of-thrones-game-review/][Game of Thrones]]) so I was wondering what some of [[/r/rational]]'s favorite board games are, and specifically whether any of them have dice or chance mechanics that are influenced by player choices?
