There's a class of eurogames that use dice as input rather than output. You'll roll a pool of dice and begin making decisions about what you can do with the results, often spending dice with specific faces as resources directly. Stefan Feld has made a lot of games in this space, often with forms of dice manipulation; I recommend checking out his body of work. We're also seeing a wave of dice games come out with some of these ideas, and dice spin-offs like Pandemic: The Cure and Roll for the Galaxy that explore implementing other ideas in fistfuls of dice. They generally use reroll mechanics because they're simple, fast, and fun, and you often see result conversion, too.
