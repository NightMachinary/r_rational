Some fics I've read that I enjoyed recently:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/glassmaker-worm-complete.433391/][Glassmaker]], a light hearted wormfic that almost makes you feel like you are on drugs when you read it. Complete.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-naruto-si.380860/][Shinobi: The RPG]], an SI gamerfic which uses Fallout mechanics and takes the idea of charisma as a dump stat seriously. First arc is complete, now starting the Shippuden arc.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/romantic-pursuits-worm.504298/][Romantic Pursuits]], Greg Veder as the MC in a gamerfic with dating sim mechanics, apparently. New.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]], where a hobo on the streets of Brockton Bay gets gamer powers and focuses on vitality. Fairly new, updates regularly.
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-greatest-weasley-harry-potter.36079/][The Greatest Weasley]], Ron the competitive younger child overshadowed by his many siblings wants to become the best and is sorted Slytherin. Two chapters in, looks very good so far.
