I think it's generally accepted that the education system in the United States is pretty suboptimal. (This may also be true of education in general/elsewhere, but I don't have experience with those).

I'm curious if people here have looked into marginal improvements to the system? I'd be really interested in hearing what other people have thought of.

(These are all directed at high schools mainly.)

Things I'd like to find ways to improve in particular:

- Molochean cycle in students->college->jobs that leads students to compete hard w/ one another, leaving actual learning behind.

- Goodhart's Law-esque problems with tests (as a subset of the above) where things like the SAT are essentially gameable.

- Lack of well-defined pathways for very smart students.

- Critiques of the traditional classroom paradigm

- Lack of widespread use of well-backed pedagogical techniques, like retrieval practice
