I've always felt that the most low-hanging fruit is separating the goals of education into different roles. Right now, everything is teacher and student. The teacher, in particular, is playing too many roles. They're the judge - they grade the student and determine whether they've passed or failed. They're the educator - they want the student to learn things and are working on their behalf. They're the law enforcement - they try to keep order in the classroom, assign detentions and such.

There's a reason we separate these roles out in a court room. We have judges, lawyers, and court security, respectively. The incentives for all acting parties are inevitably going to be in conflict if you fail to separate these concerns. At minimum, I propose creating two entirely distinct institutions for education and credentialization. The institute of education has no permanent record and they are only there to curate the best educational content and advise students regarding how best to make use of said content. They might give out assignments if they think it is helpful for learning, but students are under no real obligation to do them. In general, they are there to increase the knowledge, skills, and competency of their students. On the other hand, you have the institute of credentialization. Their job is to test students. It's to evaluate and assess. They give assignments and tests too, but there are actual consequences for students that fail to complete and pass them.

By separating out these roles, you've made the incentives clear - the educators will always be seen as advocates and allies of their students (where they are currently /not/ in most students' eyes) and the credentializers will always be seen as an obstacle that needs to be overcome. Currently, students have to look past the fact that the teacher they need help from is also the jerk that gave them a D on their midterm. That's a hard sell for a lot of people.
