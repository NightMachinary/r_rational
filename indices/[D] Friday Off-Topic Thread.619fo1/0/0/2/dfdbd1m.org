I don't know how it works in the US, but at the European School (and I believe in France), external examiners are brought in to write and grade baccalaureate (final) exams. Oral exams are held by your teacher + one outsider, as a sort of good cop / bad cop routine where your own teacher tries to nudge you in the right direction.
