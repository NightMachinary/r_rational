I'm saying both more money for more teachers, and more money to pay more teachers. At some level, you need one to achieve the other (just making more teaching jobs without increasing the pay would exhaust the supply of teachers eventually).

The level of increase of both I think is necessary to really improve the US education system would drastically increase how much taxpayers need to pay for schools, and thus is completely politically untenable, Republicans have an ideologically obsessive level with reducing government spending, and the belief that privatization can solve costs. Paying through the federal level would ensure the money was spent evenly (so that poorer areas don't get screwed in favor of richer ones), but would be hated by Republican "state-rights" types even more. Paying more on the local level would accelerate the rate at which poorer areas education system deteriorate, as they would suffer from a brain drain as their more skilled teachers are hired by richer districts for higher salaries.

For a case study... Florida passed a class size amendment, but then the legislature didn't back it up with sufficient funding. Many schools (at least the schools in Hillborough County) responded by juggling kids around in class to meet the caps, instead of hiring teachers (because their budgets didn't increase enough). So for an extreme and simplified example, instead of 24 students in one class and 20 students in another (if for example level or ability or scheduling made it convenient to do it that way), they would instead move 2 kids and have 22 kids in each class, regardless if that was right for the kids or teachers schedules/learning ability. Whereas if they had more money, they could hire an additional teacher, and then do maybe 18 kids in one class, 16 in another, and 10 in the third. That was a simple example... in some ways it is worse for that. For example, a rural area with a lot of immigrant children, the school might bank on the fact that many of them drop out throughout the year, so they'll arrange things to meet the class size check early in the year, and then rearrange things as kids drop out.
