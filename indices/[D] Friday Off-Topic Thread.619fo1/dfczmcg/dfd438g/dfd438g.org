Note that a lot of this is purely a matter of perception.

E.g. if you have to roll lots of dice, or do it often, the improbabilities will average out, but for many people it /feels/ more random.

E.g. card games (with decks of very different cards) are /super/ random, but perceived as much less so than dice games.

  whether any of them have dice or chance mechanics that are influenced by player choices?

"Deck-building" games, in which players start with a simple deck but can buy/earn extra cards in-game and thus slowly shape the probabilities of their draws. E.g. /Dominion/, /Arctic Scavengers/.

/Olympos/ and /Game of Thrones/ have a mechanic where the exact consequences of an action are random, but you're in control of whether it's a "good" vs "bad" outcome. (In GoT, the wildling attack. In Olympos, the god cards.) So if a certain bad outcome screws up your strategy you can blame luck to a certain extent, but it still feels like it's "your fault" for not paying for the good.
