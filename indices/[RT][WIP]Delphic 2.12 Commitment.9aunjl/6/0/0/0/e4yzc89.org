Wordpress hosts the site, yes, and delphicserial.wordpress.com also directs to the page. The ads are served through them as well, I'm pretty sure.

Like I said, if you are having problems with redirects, it's due to the particular advertisers that are serving you. Message me details and I'll see if my service settings includes blacklisting.
