That would be Wordpress not properly policing their ads.

Make sure to hit "report" under where the ad is. Also send me a screenshot and I'll see if there is a way to blacklist the problem.

If it keeps happening, I think there's a way to turn ads off entirely for X dollars a month. I will look into that next.
