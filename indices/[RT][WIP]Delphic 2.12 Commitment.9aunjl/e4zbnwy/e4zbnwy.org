I'm going to have to side with Delphic's parents here. This trio does seem fishy. I was already very put off by the roommates demands; in a world where superheroes exist, secret identities are probably serious business. Expecting Hector to be completely honest and upfront after spending literally one-night with Kimberly, strikes me as ridiculous. There seems to be no charitable reason for the roommates outrage, unless there's also an ulterior motive behind it, or some serious, serious backstory that hasn't been revealed yet.

I know the story isn't finished yet, and the world-building isn't complete, but getting mad at a guy for not telling a girl he's known for one night he's a super, seemed to me like someone getting mad at a fried they met yesterday for not telling them they're gay. Realistic? Yes. Believable? Yes. But it still makes me strongly dislike the roommate, and distrust Kimberly to some extent.

She appeared so suddenly, clicked with Hector so well, and has a strong interest in super. Hector already knows he's under suspicion for ties to Delphic. He should definitely check them out, make certain they're not government plants, because they definitely could be. They all seemed to be positioned in fields/clubs that would make it easy for them to get in touch with underground communities of supers; and one of them even has an 'ability' that lets them detect supers, making them perfect for finding undocumented ones.

Seems far to fishy to actually be benign.
