Yes, and real life ideological wars are about-

Race. If you hate their skin colour then issues are hard to resolve.

Land. If they live on land you want it's hard to resolve it.

Oppression. If they have a history of killing your dudes then that causes resentment.

People rarely have open war over pure ideas, and your people have no real incentive to have an actual war, and would have a massive advantage if they allied.

Also, most militaries are very keen to find any weapon that works, and would likely fund both magic and science.

As of now, they don't have a strong reason to fight.

How about you step it up a notch?

Scientists have active social issues with magic users, and actively work on ways to suppress them. There are a number of criminal elements they want to stop, and more powerful magic users are a dangerous threat. As such, they actively cause problems.

Magicians magic is actively threatened by machinery. A well made piece of machinery is invested in magic by the creator and is resistant to disruption. Weaker magic users and disabled people want the wider introduction of such machinery to supplement their powers but more powerful users are worried this will disrupt some of their abilities and empower the wrong groups.

So, science might be the equivalent of guns. An active threat to those in power which potentially gives them the ability to assassinate even highly powerful magic users with technological weapons. For the safety of mankind these dangerous terrorists have to be suppressed.

Then a locked room wouldn't solve it. They have diametrically opposed goals (Weaken magic, strengthen magic, make strong mages untouchable except by the army, make anyone subject to justice).
