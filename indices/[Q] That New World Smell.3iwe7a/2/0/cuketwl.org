  Why does this not apply for people who claim the planet is only 10,000?
#+end_quote

It does. There are legends and traditions that go back for centuries, and the mythos of those eras say that the world is unspeakably old. The aliens in question are happy to let them look at data from neighboring planets and let them come to their own conclusions. Plus there's a bit of a social pressure to not blasphemy when the gods are on your doorstep.

  What would such an event actually change?
#+end_quote

Everything and nothing. All of that Earth's History is called into question as shared memories that left behind nothing tangible, every relic could just as easily be undone. Such is the nature of magic and memory, but in addition to a robbed history, there is also there is a trust issue introduced when your alien buddies willing to let you learn from them the secrets of their magics are actually trying to control the big damn bomb and making it sustainable during a peacetime. Plus, if the world could be magically made, it could just as easily be magically unmade, and as magic makes things that people think into reality, well...

  What does studying anti-magic imply for magic that it is hated?
#+end_quote

It's kind of seen as a anti-intellectual pursuit and a practice of bullheadedness. Magic is the hard knowledge of the universe, constant and eternal. It may fluctuate and change with society, but Magic is what Magic does, and it is fundamentally tied to this humanity. If you know magic, you know yourself.

Anti-Magic is a rejection of that ideal, and a focus on what is here, now, and the study of the natural physical world without the veil of magic. It's kind of become a study in the esoteric, as magic can make the physical laws of the universe it's bitch. There is a fear that if too much is studied, magic will lose it's power, and because magic is what the people demand of it, it's entirely possible that magic will suffer with further studying, possibly to the point of being able to be gamed and not being able to be easily undone.

But really, it's because they are different ways of seeing the world that there is animosity between one or the other in the first place. Magic can't be placed easily in a Science Box, Science can't be easily placed in a Magic Box, and devotees pitted against one another have to pick each other's fights because the other side is wrong and they are right. The two exist in the world as quantifiable forces, but there are incongruities and rough places where they mesh, and that won't stand with either party. You are either Team Magic or Team Anti-Magic, and there is no inbetween on this one, except that there is, but that that makes you intolerant and a wuss to both sides.
