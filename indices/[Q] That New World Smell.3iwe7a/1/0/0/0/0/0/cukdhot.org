Magic is a discipline of many expressions, and most of the specifics consists of soft laws and limits that are only there because they are agreed upon that it is what magic can and cannot do. There's a thing called the Usagi theorem that states that as people are made of Magic, societal preconceptions state the rules of magic, and they are made so. Females are on average more conductive to magic, because a lot of the early movers and shakers in the Magical World were female. Shooting a fireball from your hand is easy, trying to convince someone that the fireball won't veer right and set them on fire before they intercept it and make it so is more difficult.
