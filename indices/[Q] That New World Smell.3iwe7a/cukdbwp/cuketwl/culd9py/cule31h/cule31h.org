I'm kind of basing the idea of scientists and magicians in this world as an analogy to ideological civil war, where both magicians and scientists want to explore and push limits in their fields, but both want to shout at each other until they are proven right, their opponents are wrong, and their demonizing of one another is proven just. Lot of that going on in my corner of the Internet, and figured I'd explore it as an allegory. People are too damn invested in tearing each other apart, they fail to see the bad agents coming in, and using that conflict to summon a great two headed worm-demon that consumes the people's minds and physical planet. There is a conflict there, but a locked room would or wouldn't solve it for some people. Is that level of bad blood and bad thought sustainable to keep a stories conflict going if someone is directly aggravating it in an attempt to power a world eating Lovecraftian Nightmare, or should it still be a more justified tension?
