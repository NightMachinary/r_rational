  Anti-Magic is a rejection of that ideal, and a focus on what is here, now, and the study of the natural physical world without the veil of magic. It's kind of become a study in the esoteric, as magic can make the physical laws of the universe it's bitch. There is a fear that if too much is studied, magic will lose it's power, and because magic is what the people demand of it, it's entirely possible that magic will suffer with further studying, possibly to the point of being able to be gamed and not being able to be easily undone.

People presumably know that gravity pulls you down, and that using magic you can overcome gravity. People already know that there's a physical world and you can overcome that with magic.

Here you are setting up a conflict where there should be none. Scientists explore the universe. They find new laws and affects that you can magic up, and find shortcuts to power like antimatter bombs. Magic alters things. It makes science easier and cheaper and can be studied directly to see what effects make magic stronger.

They shouldn't have a conflict just because of poor communication. People do talk. They should have a genuine reason for actual conflict that, even if you locked them together in a room, wouldn't result in them becoming best of buddies.
