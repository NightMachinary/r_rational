Me as the Author, or is the character at the center of it experiencing something unusual?

There would be a panic mostly because the epiphany that history, not just memories of events, but the things that happened before the war just didn't happen, and is all a collective delusion. That's a little concerning to say the least, but on top of that is the fact that the higher powers claimed to have come across that particular Earth and Prime Directived it until the war was too dire to not drag them in. To learn that your race and planet was a weapon to turn the tide of a war the gods brought you into, wouldn't that be at the very least controversial?
