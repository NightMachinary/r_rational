No, I'm feelin fine. Slightly anxious about a new job but that's not here or there. I wanted to come to the sub to bounce ideas and poke holes into the magical system for the story I am writing, and how a rationalist would interact with the word if magic was the constant, scientifically poking at it is the new medium, and the Earth literally falling apart is a metaphor for that anxiety some people get when something they know in there heart of hearts is true, but reality seems to think otherwise. If not the Earth itself, then that that person is made a little more fragile until they figure out their place in the world.
