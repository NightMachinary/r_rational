Other possible theories.

1. Some magical effect altered the isotope ratios.

2. The theory is wrong.

3. Some force other than the gods magic'd up the planet.

The gods could support various theories. They could say that, perhaps, people's expectations that rocks were constant made it so. They could say, yes, it appears you are fake, what a shock, who did this to us? They could say "We did this, you were violent psycopaths from another world, we did this to give you a fresh start." They could do all of those.

How do you break it? Seize on pre-existing pressures. Are people in loveless relationships that should be annulled as false? Are some people in unfair contracts that were signed before this? You hire celebrities to promote this message.

"You only live once, don't let it go to waste! You didn't exist ten years ago, anything that happened before that doesn't matter."

You sell it as personal freedom.
