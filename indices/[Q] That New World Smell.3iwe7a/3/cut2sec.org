The premise doesn't quite make sense. The researchers know that perception can overwrite reality, and they're studying this with expectations that presumably differ from the norm, and they find some evidence that differs from what the masses would expect, and they don't even consider the idea that maybe their perceptions overwrote a local chunk of reality?

When we have a world where belief can directly alter physical evidence, properly blinded experiments may become impossible. Even if only the experiment designer knows what's going on, and every participant is in the dark, the designer's expectations may be the only force left determining the outcome!

Even if everyone is totally uncertain about the outcome of a particular experiment, that implies an underlying belief that there is a world which produces phenomena outside the mind's purview, which may not even be true in this setting. And if enough people believe that it IS true, does it become so? Does belief in an orderly reality automatically remove magic?
