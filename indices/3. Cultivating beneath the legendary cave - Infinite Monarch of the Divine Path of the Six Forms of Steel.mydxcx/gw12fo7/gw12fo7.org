I hate to say it, but this doesn't read like a parody. This literally reads like a bog-standard xianxia novel, where everything is already described as being extreme, astounding, the most, the greatest, etc.

You can't parody something like that. To quote Seinfeld (I'm going by memory here), "It would be like making fun of a clown. What, are you gonna make fun of their big nose, their floppy shoes? It just doesn't work."
