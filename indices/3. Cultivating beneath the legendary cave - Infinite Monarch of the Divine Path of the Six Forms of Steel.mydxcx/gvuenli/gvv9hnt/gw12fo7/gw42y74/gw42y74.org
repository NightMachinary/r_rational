  Bao Chu Ching was shocked. He had never seen a woman without any clothes before. He was raised in a wolf pack.

I feel like what's twigging it as a parody for me is the sheer dryness of the prose. Things are described as the super awesome bestest, but like, in a flat way that emphasises how stupid the description is.

...I feel like it would be really funny to have a text to speech program read it in a flat monotone, actually.

(EDIT: Oh the other main thing is using very flat descriptions in most of the narration and the usual metaphors falling on their face next to that)
