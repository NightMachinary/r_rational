What would it take to make a biological axle work?

Living creatures can't have wheels, because as the wheel turns around its axis, the blood vessels and nerves and miscellaneous sinews will become twisted until they can't twist any further. This makes axles the simplest machine that can be made by tool-using creatures which doesn't exist in biology.

Is this a limit of life on Earth due to some evolutionary accident, or is it likely true everywhere?

Philip Pullman wrote a species that uses their long, sharp nails to grip two hard-shelled fruits and ride them like a bicycle. This is an interesting way around the problem - the "wheel" isn't actually part of the creature's body.
