Carts seemed to function ok on dirt roads, and on the American plains if memory serves. So that should allow at least a horse-and-cart creature, if not a full-blown car, probably a plains dweller of some kind. (Why develop the "cart" portion? They're more stable, but offer less control, so maybe if the creature needs to carry stuff a lot - give it arms or a trunk, the cart serves a camel-like adaptation for long desert journeys?)

Dirt bikes also do OK on some /very/ rough trails - I've seen people biking through the woods on trails I wouldn't trust myself to walk on. That wouldn't fly in an old-growth forest, but maybe somewhere rocky, hilly, bordering on mountainous?
