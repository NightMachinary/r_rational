I've been designing a world and a magic system for an original rational fantasy story I'm planning in which I need souls to be real, but I've been having a bit of trouble figuring out a mechanistic explanation for how they would interact with the physical body (the brain in particular). My main stumbling block has been things like telepathy, mind/memory magic, and even mental casting of magic.

Motivation: I've always found it annoying when supposedly-anatomically-normal humans can use telepathy or other kinds of "mind magic" with only meat brains as sources and targets. Even casting "normal" magic by using thought/will/imagination doesn't ever seem to get a satisfying mechanistic explanation. I doubt that the electrochemical activity that occurs in a brain from a certain thought is really isomorphic to that thought, or that the thought could be reconstructed from analyzing the brain activity, even in principle. And even if it could, the intricacy and processing power required to do so would be so huge that it sets a pretty high lower-bound on the potency of magic that makes it difficult to set reasonable limits and rules on magic without contradicting that.

So, I'm trying to work out a system that addresses this and am hoping to find a way to make it work through the use of "souls" (I have quite a bit of other interesting things planned involving souls too). I've explored a few possibilities, but haven't quite found one I'm satisfied with, since each has their own problems. I was hoping for some feedback, suggestions, and/or recommendations to other works that may be helpful as inspiration.

Some of the possibilities I've considered (and their problems) are:

1. The "mind" is (a part of) the soul and is /not/ the brain. The brain doesn't store memories nor does it produce consciousness on its own; it's only functions are controlling and regulating the body the same way it does IRL, and being the place where the incorporeal mind/soul "connects" to the body. So one's consciousness and memories exist only in the soul and it /somehow/ causes your brain to send signals to your muscles to move when you want to move (I can't think of a satisfying mechanistic explanation for how the soul could do this, but was considering just making it unknown in-universe, just like how even in real life, I can't explain how my will to move my arm, but not imagining doing so, gets converted into the electrical signals that end up actually moving it). I'm hesitant to go with this option though because having the mind not depend on the brain is just /really different/ from real life and it could make it awkward to ascribe real-life psychological features like imperfect memory, heuristics and biases, etc. to this completely non-physical mind. (It also necessitates that all living creatures have souls, which limits a few lore-related ideas I had, but that's not really a deal-breaker.)
2. The physical body (including the brain) works exactly the way it does in real life. The soul is a "projection" of the body (including the brain) in the "information dimension" / "spiritual plane" that contains all the information about the body, but encoded in such a way that the information can be accessed and read with magic. So while thoughts, consciousness, and memories exist as electrochemical signals, an emergent phenomenon from those signals, and neural connections (respectively) in the brain, one could broadcast a thought or memory using mind magic by using the encoded version of the thought or memory from the soul as the source. The biggest problem with this (that I haven't been able to solve) is how the physical brain (and therefore the actual mind/consciousness) could /receive/ telepathic information. Even if souls can be transmitters, receivers, and (mirrored) storage units for mental information, how can information received from the soul turn into actual thoughts, mental images, or anything that one could actually experience through their meat brain? That seems like it would require very complicated magical manipulation of the physical brain by the soul, the explanation of which would likely be very hand-wavy and unsatisfying and subject to some of the same issues I was originally trying to solve by using souls in the first place, especially considering that the body is supposed to be the "original" and the soul the "projection".
3. The soul is sort of like an individual's unique platonic form (encoded somehow as information), and the physical body is the (perhaps imperfect) "projection" of the soul in the material world. If the audience is willing to accept this one fact as a given, then I can have anatomically normal humans where consciousness happens in the physical brain, but when there are magically-induced changes to the "mind" portion of the soul, those are reflected in the physical brain (as electrochemical signals for thoughts and sense-data and as alterations to synaptic connections for memories) as well because the brain is a projection of the soul. The main problem with this is that it would probably have to be a bidirectional synchronization between the body and soul because otherwise, how would thoughts, memories, and sense-data that occur based on experience by the physical body end up being stored in the soul so that magic could do anything useful with them?

Note: If I could solve #2 in a satisfying way, it would be my preferred solution because in-universe humans would be anatomically identical to IRL humans, meaning that while souls are empirically verifiable, they wouldn't actually be /necessary/ (though they'll be the source of many in-universe advantages over IRL humans, including magic), which would allow for some interesting lore where maybe animals don't have souls and maybe some ancient/lost society (or gods) granted them to normal humans at some point in the distant past.

If anyone has any ideas, thoughts, or even notices any additional problems with any of my suggestions, I'd appreciate it! Thanks
