I didn't hate Empire, I just found it really forgettable. The politics were not realistic, but I give it some credit for showing conservatives accept a liberal-ish President for logical reasons. It's still weirdly skewed towards Card's beliefs, thankfully not bringing up same-sex marriage, but there's a lesson in there somewhere about people of different ideologies working together. It's weird, but occasionally insightful.

What ruined it for me was the characters, in that they were all written the same way as the kids in Ender's Game. It didn't make any sense for them to act the way they did if they were supposed to be normal people, which they kind of need to be for a modern military-political story. The book might be worse than I remember since I wasn't as good a judge of quality back then, and I remember nothing about the action scenes.
