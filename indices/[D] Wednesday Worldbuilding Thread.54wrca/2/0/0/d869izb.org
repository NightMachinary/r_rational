you'd need smooth flat surfaces with little friction but not too little. Too little friction and you're on icy ground and biological ice skates would work better. Too much friction and it would be better to just walk, like on grass or bumpy rocky ground. Maybe it could work on a plain if the grass there had evolved to survive and even benefit from being trampled on. Like say being squished underfoot releases their seeds, and so they would have evolved to make it easy for wheels to run over them.
