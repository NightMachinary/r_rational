it would probably have to be more like bone or fingernail to support a larger creature though right? Hair just wouldn't cut it. Also, there's still the issue of there needing to be a natural environment in which wheels would evolve in the first place. Like I said, wheels need smooth, flat surfaces with little friction but not too little friction. Like roads. It's probably no coincidence that people had to build roads in order for cars to move around on. The kind of surfaces that cars can travel on have not occurred naturally. Not saying they couldn't have, it's just that they didn't. or at least no evidence of naturally occurring road-like surfaces have been found on Earth yet as far as I know.
