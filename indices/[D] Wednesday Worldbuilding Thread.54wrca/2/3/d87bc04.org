Couldn't the axle and wheel combo simply have its own dedicated bloodcycle?

think of this similar to how corals have a symbiosis with seaweed, or how we have mitochondria in our cells. Only instead you would have the "main" animal, and the wheel/axel animal. each with its own heart, digestive system(the main animal would excrete some compound on the axle/wheels which they would further consume) .

I don't see a theoretical aspect preventing this.
