Empire was terrible. I felt actually cheated, after I read the synopsis. Almost returned it for false advertising.

Alvin Maker is definitely worth reading, with 2 caveats: First, it's incomplete. The last book was published in 2003, and while the conclusion is still reportedly forthcoming, that's a looooong gap to overcome, and like you say, Card has really kind of lost his touch. Second, the last couple books that are out show a slight degrade in quality, to the point that I barely remember them.

But the premise is really unique and interesting, and I enjoyed it a lot, personally. One of my favorite alternate-history-with-magic book series.
