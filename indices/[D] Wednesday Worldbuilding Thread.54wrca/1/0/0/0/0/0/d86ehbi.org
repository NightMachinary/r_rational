See, what ruined it for me was that it was still explicitly politically biased, even though it tried not to be. I was looking forward to a truly politically neutral conflict, with heroes and villains from both liberals and conservatives. That's what the blurb on the back implied.

So when the story starts, we get a conservative villain in the form of the xenophobic military general who tried to incite a coup, and a liberal villain who used supertech to try and take over the country in response. All so the real villain can become president, who's described as being "on nobody's side" but his own, and who was pulling the strings.

The problem is, the conservative villain was a fake. He literally was just acting that way to goad the liberals into trying to take over, and worked for the grey super-villain. But the liberal villain was apparently genuine.

Which wouldn't be so bad on its own if the main characters were mixed as well. But no, every single one of them is a conservative... except the main character's wife, who if memory serves does nothing, literally nothing, all book, except occasionally remind the main characters that she's liberal to point out that #NotAllDemocrats are evil.

It wasn't a badly written book other than that, it was pretty standard and entertaining political action thriller. But it was so politically biased, with its straw liberal protagonist and its straw conservative antagonist, it just offended me beyond what it normally would have if it hadn't made any pretense at neutrality, like most political action thrillers by conservative writers (/coughs/ Vince Flynn).
