I've been nervous about checking out more of Card's work. Ender's Game may be my favorite book and I really liked the rest of the series, but Pathfinder was boring as hell and Empire was just weird. I've started to think that the guy has lost his touch, I didn't even bother with Shadows in Flight. Is Alvin Maker worth reading?
