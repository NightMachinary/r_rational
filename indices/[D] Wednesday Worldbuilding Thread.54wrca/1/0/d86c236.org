I always like it when writers take the time to show how different cultures react to and grow around their magic systems. Makes them feel more thought out and immersive.

One of my favorite examples of this is the Alvin Maker series by Orson Scott Card, where Native Americans, European colonists and African slaves all had their own magic systems rooted in their cultures. They weren't tied to genetics, anyone could learn any of them, but they were so distinct it was easy to use it as another source of cultural conflict and insight into their differences.
