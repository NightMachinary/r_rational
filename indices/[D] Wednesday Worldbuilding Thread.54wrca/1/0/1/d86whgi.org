  I always like it when writers take the time to show how different cultures react to and grow around their magic systems. Makes them feel more thought out and immersive.

Have you read the Temeraire series? Its basically alternate history of the Napoleonic wars ... with dragons. Each book is basically an exploration of how different cultures and continents developed their relationships with an intelligent species.
