In the Night Angel Trilogy the magic system can do pretty much anything and has very few limitations. While this is almost exactly what you shouldn't do when writing a rational fantasy story, the author does manage to subtly pull off some really good worldbuilding by focusing on what magic is used for in different cultures.

Each country has its own taboos against magic and professions it encourages mages to enter, and that says a lot about them. Healers, battle mages, and enchanters all come from different schools across the continent. The few truly academic schools that will teach a student anything have treaties with neighboring countries meant to restrict their power.

You can even learn a lot about a character based on what magic they use. The majority of mages just find a niche for themselves and profit from the few spells they're good at, which is easy because so few mages receive training. It helps get across the disorganized nature of medieval society.

There are downsides to this, of course. Munchkin characters are extremely powerful in this setting since they'll use magic no one is expecting in ways no one would expect. This sort of worldbuilding isn't even a big part of the book, I just thought it was interesting way of going about it that was worth sharing.
