If each species had their own complement to the human magical system, that would make it feel more integrated. For example, you mention evolution, as in you're not basing your world on intervention of Gods, so it would stand to reason then, that if this magical power is inheritable (evolutionary) then some of the other species in your setting would be able to have their own systems of magic similar to other species'. By doing that, you make the creatures in the world not so tacked-on, since they are involved in (at least their own) magic systems similar to what normal humans would have.
