There are three distinct intelligent species, one of which are humans (though they're all primates). They can't interbreed with each other, and in fact have sufficiently different physiologies that they can't really share a society (spoken languages are mutually unintelligible), though they have some trade and contact. There are three distinct subspecies of human, and they can interbreed and coexist within a single society, though they've historically tended to form separate nations (although not just one nation per subspecies, of course). The other species don't really have nations as we recognize them; the small species is so numerous and short-lived that each of their "nations" is only aware of their current or recent neighbors, while the aquatic species is too placid and wary of conflict to form any sort of large faction.

They evolved naturally, though I have to admit that it's all sort of far-fetched. The need to go "don't think about it" about the implied prehistory of the world is one of the weaker points of the setting. It all sustains itself naturally once it's already going, but so much variety in a planet's intelligent life to start with is probably pretty unlikely.

They're all real people though, IMO, including the fully distinct species. I think the word "people" is most useful if synonymous with "intelligent beings" rather than "humans".
