Will there be religion in your universe?

If so, will species share belief systens, or will they all have their own?

Or perhaps, will it be a more "DND" style pantheon with representative gods for each species?

What level of political organization will your universe have? Will there be sophisticated Bureaucracies, whether under Kings, dictators, or republics? Or will it be a less organized feudal system or plain tribal warfare?

I hope it doesn't seem like I am bombarding you with questions, I just find your universe interesting!
