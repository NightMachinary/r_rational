There are several religions, though secularism is surging in popularity since this world's version of the enlightenment. Many religions exert more control over their members, so that even apostates are compelled to obey church authority, but the more proactive religions have an uneasy relationship with actual governments, except where the government is actually theocratic.

Among the humans, common humans are the most diverse, both religiously and nationally. The "feline humans" mostly belong to a single nation with a state religion, though in recent years the central leadership has taken an officially agnostic position on its actual supernatural claims. They also have several smaller countries and religious groups, though not many. The "armored humans" are all descended from a single (defunct) state that had a state religion, and though some of them have converted to common humans' religions, it is much more common for them to either remain in their ancestral religion or be secular. The small people have nearly as many religions as they have tribes (IE, a lot), and the aquatic people (who are culturally somewhat mysterious, being too solitary to have much contact with other beings) are mostly superstitious without any organized religion, merely sharing the belief that dreams are windows into other worlds.

Won't go into detail because it's intricately tied to the magic system, but bureaucracy is extremely important in this world; where kings or dictators do rule it's because they or their predecessors were very good rule lawyers. As in our world, globalization is huge and smaller governments are getting absorbed or outcompeted by larger ones as we approach the modern era, but with breakups of empires being much rarer than they are in our world.
