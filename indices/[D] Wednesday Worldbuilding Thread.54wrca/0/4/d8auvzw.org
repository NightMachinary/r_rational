Few questions about the pseudo-people:

Are your planned nations of beings human?

Can they still reproduce with each other?

How would they have diverged so far phenotypically while still remaining human, for all intents and purposes?

Will they all communicate through speech, or have mutually intelligible languages?

Did they evolve naturally or are they a product of willful modification?

I feel like the cat/wolf/bear/goat people trope is often really poorly justified and sorta lazy. If done properly, it can drive conflict and be a very interesting and important part of a story. Good luck!
