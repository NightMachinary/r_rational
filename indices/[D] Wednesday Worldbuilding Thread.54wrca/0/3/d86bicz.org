  My only fear is that being nonmagical, ie, already physically possible, won't stop the various creatures and races from feeling tacked on as a "second conceit" on top of the central magic system.

Think about how evolution might exploit your central magic system, then work out your various creatures and animals based on different concepts from this. For bonus points, don't explain this to the reader directly in the narration, but let them work it out from hints, and/or let a character figure it out and exploit a creature in a new way by realizing that the creature uses the same magic as everything else.
