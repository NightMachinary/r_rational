Fairly creepy answer incoming, but I'd be motivated to get as many people as possible to 'share' my abilities so I don't have to keep seeing loved ones dying on me. So, I would attempt to have a lot of kids in good homes/family situations spread out over a wide area of several continents. Then I would work on minimizing any potential racial issues preventing my kids from breeding and being a part of society. Within a few generations, there should be only Humanity 2.0 left due to natural selection.

Yes, I agree that this is a creepy answer due to how strongly it smacks of epigenetics, but I just felt like writing about something morally /off/ today.
