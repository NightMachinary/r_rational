I don't think wanting to have lots of kids is creepy, even if your goal is to spread your genes (which isn't that uncommon a motivation, although usually for legacy reasons rather than true altruism.) Assuming you're doing it ethically, of course.

Lots of people have large, complicated families. Nothing wrong with that.

I think it would take more than a few generations, though. Even if they're all immortal and dedicated to the cause, you're talking something like ninety children per person per generation if you want to succeed this century. Evolution isn't fast.
