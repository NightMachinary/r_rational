Premise: You are an incredibly healthy, genetically modified human. Your natural lifespan is now about 1000 years. You recover from injury and other problems much faster than other humans. You have better reflexes, a higher than average intelligence, and a bunch of other minor improvements over normal humans. One more thing: you are stuck in pre-modern times, and you basically grew up there, so you have none of your current knowledge.

What do you think you would do? Try and rule a country? Travel all over? Get involved in fighting for good causes? Be ultra careful and never get involved in something that might get you killed?
