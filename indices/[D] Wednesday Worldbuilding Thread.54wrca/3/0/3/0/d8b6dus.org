Sorry for not replying earlier, but I'm proposing to get a woman pregnant (with consent) with my child and then /leaving her/. This is why I consider my answer morally repugnant.

  Assuming you're doing it ethically, of course.

I basically don't consider it to be very ethical. A man's responsibility towards his children is to be a good father and to be around until the child is fully grown and self-sufficient. I'm proposing on ducking out of this and having someone else to do this for me.

Considering that my end goal is to have as many children to have more people similar to me, it's probably not the best idea to have all of my descents resent me. :P
