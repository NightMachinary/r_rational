So, I'm designing a setting for a potential future project, and I come up with a really elegant low-magic system that makes the world immediately completely different from the real one and opens up all kinds of interesting story possibilities. I'm completely satisfied with it, but - it only makes the world /socially/ different from ours, and not /visually/ different from ours. It changes the relationship people have with each other, the relationship people have with their government and religion and family and so on, but it doesn't change anything you could take a photograph of. No fireballs or antigravity, y'know?

And that's perfectly fine, but I kind of want some visual distinction from our world; I kind of want it to be specifically a fantasy setting and not just a general specfic setting. But I don't want a second tacked-on magic system, because it wouldn't be as good as the first one, and would only really distract from it. So instead, I'm adding fantastical but non-magical creatures and races to the setting, things that are physically possible and could exist in our world but simply don't. "Dragons" that are just slightly larger and venomous pterosaurs, predatory mountain goats the size of bears, nations of people with various animal features like horns and natural armor, and potentially intelligent species that evolved alongside humans but didn't have natural lifestyles conducive to forming civilizations of their own.

Is this a good approach? I think it's an ideal compromise between not distracting from the central magic system and giving the setting some visual flavor distinct from our world. My only fear is that being nonmagical, ie, already physically possible, won't stop the various creatures and races from feeling tacked on as a "second conceit" on top of the central magic system. Any good tips for avoiding this?
