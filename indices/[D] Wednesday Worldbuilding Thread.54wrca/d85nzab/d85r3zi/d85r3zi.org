Civilization could respond in an artistic or stylistic way. You could look around at different ancient building styles for inspiration, Eastern, Indian sub continent, Norse, greco-roman, Central American pre-columbus, etc.

Lets say you have a magic system that allows some low level mind reading. Maybe people tend to want their privacy back, and their architecture would be based around giving people their own space and sense of privacy. Or cultures just adapt to having no privacy, and its something they don't care about, so things we might consider private or intimate they consider public.

Basically anything that changes social dynamics could have an impact on artistic and architectural styles.
