the Neanderthals were more adapted to the cold than modern day humans. the Neanderthal were short and stout because that gave them a more favorable volume/surface ratio and made them more resistant to cold. they also had big noses to better heat the air they breathe. you could make your nordmen like that.

the old norse people were not all of them raiders most were simple traders, merchants, lumberjacks, farmers, and fisherman you could think of them as "Canadians that minored in murder"
