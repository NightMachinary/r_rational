I can't comment on biology, but I know actual Viking culture had several facets to it other than being a warrior or sailor. That was more of stereotype that the rest of Europe held because that was who they interacted with the most, but they were actually ahead of Europe in terms of a legal system and civil rights.

It's my limited understanding, though, that one of the core ideals of the Vikings that allowed them to thrive was determination. These were the people that kept a colony in Greenland going for generations out of a pure stubborn refusal to leave. I don't know if you could pull off something similar without keeping that.
