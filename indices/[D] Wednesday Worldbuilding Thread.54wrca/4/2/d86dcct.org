If you're not going for the Viking stubbornness, there needs to be a reason for your people to actually be living there. Are there mines? Is it in pockets of mountains with large numbers of warm springs? Lots of wildlife despite the weather?

Essentially, what makes the land itself livable? Once you figure that out, see how it's different from the Norse and go from there. [[/u/trekie140]] mentions their stubbornness, and if you make it a land without any pluses, you'll end up with a people in similar vein as the Norse or dwarves, especially if it's a kingdom of any significant size/power.
