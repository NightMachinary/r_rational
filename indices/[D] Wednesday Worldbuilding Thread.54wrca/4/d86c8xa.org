Its Thursday but maybe I have a chance.

So I have this whole northern kingdom. Its big, cold, forest, savage, yadayadayada.

I have different ethnico-cultural groups but the main group is around 80% of the population of said kingdom. My question is: Is there a way to avoid the typical barbarian Northman?

Is being tall a must in the North? Or can I make them smaller than average? (-->using less energy-->surviving?)

Is there a way that they won't be savage brutes? Or is that also a must?

The north has recently transitioned to feudalism. But they take knight-stuff super seriously. That makes them very honour-bound. Isn't that to game on thronesy?
