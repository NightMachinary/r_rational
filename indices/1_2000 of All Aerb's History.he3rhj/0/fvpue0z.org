One of my favourite parts about the Exclusionary Principle as a worldbuilding concept is that it provides a plausible explanation(both intra- and extra- diagetic) for why magical advances like in your story aren't commonly a thing in-universe. Even proposing such an experiment might be grounds for immediate execution.

Imagine how intensely risk averse Harvard university would be as an institution if it had a monopoly on psychology, were 1000x more powerful politically and economically, and at any given moment pushing the cutting edge of psychology too far could not only inadvertently detonate a nuclear bomb, but also destroy psychology as a viable profession for the rest of history, as well as all their power and influence.

In my view that would breed a culture of extreme conservatism on magical usage and experimentation, which would bleed into every other aspect of athenium operations. They would select students based on that criteria, they would make instilling those values in students a bedrock of instruction, and they would dedicate a sizable portion of their energy on hunting down and exterminating any hint of ideological deviancy.
