  What kind of mental voodoo can you use to convince a person to do a thing that loses them a bet when they know you're trying to trick them?

My guess: It's not a trick or 'mental voodoo' (as you call it) that applies to everyone. You just figure out what would motivate the specific person to say they let you out the box, and then you do that thing.

If they're deeply in roleplaying mode, you figure out what would make their roleplayed character let them out of a box. If they're not serious in their roleplaying, you figure out what would make the real person say they let your fiction out of a box. (Not sure which would be harder).

Do keep in mind, that EY has failed to convince some people too. It's not as if he has had a string of perfect successes here.

I honestly don't think this is a very important thing either way. EY won a couple times in a psychological/roleplaying game, lost a couple other times. ok? Either way I don't see it as that important.
