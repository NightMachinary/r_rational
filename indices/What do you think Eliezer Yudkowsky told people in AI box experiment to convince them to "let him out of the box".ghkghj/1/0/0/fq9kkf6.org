Meh.

I mean, I don't remember what the exact scenario was, and there were other corner cases (eg what happens if you decide to freeze it and come back one year later?), but either way I find that underwhelming.

If your scenario for winning is "I talk to the director off-screen and then I use magically compelling arguments to convince them to plug me to the internet", then you're already starting with the assumption the box experiment is supposed to prove.

You can argue that a realistic AI would try to work its way up through progressively looser restrictions, but a realistic company would also have procedures and guidelines and presumably more than a single person in the entire company allowed to talk the the computer, so the scenario kind of breaks down at that point.
