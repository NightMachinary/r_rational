I would think the game would be stacked in favor of the gatekeeper because they can (you would hope) just easily remind themself that it's a game and nothing the "AI" warns them about or promises or whatever is real.

Like, to pick a simple example, the AI claims it can cure aging for humans and tries to convince you it wants to do so. And maybe you are tempted to think about whether that's true or whether the AI is benevolent like it claims etc... and that if it is true there are risks of NOT releasing the AI.

But in this game you just go "oh wait, this isn't real, aging definitely won't be cured by me letting it out, and then I 'lose' the game."
