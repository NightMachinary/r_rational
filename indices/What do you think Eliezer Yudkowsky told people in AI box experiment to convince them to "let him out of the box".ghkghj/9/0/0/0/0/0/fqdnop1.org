No, I think more precisely the game is about illustrating human weakness, not AI dangerousness. Since it's not an actual AI, but a human opponent pretending to be such.

It's about illustrating humans wouldn't be good gatekeepers.

For the game to have any value, I'd think the gatekeeper needs make a proper attempt, to at least pretend to be in-character.

When you are accusing other people of dishonesty, I wish you expressed such accusations with less seeming certainty, and made it more clear you're just *guessing* and *theorizing* they're being dishonest, that you don't have any actual proof, or even significant evidence, of that.
