  Saying that I should falsely pretend to have been convinced by a fictional AI in a roleplaying scenario (in the case that instead EY convinced me effectively using metalogic), just to convince other people that actual AIs would be able to convince random other people, is very bizarre and topsy-turvy logic.

How is that bizarre logic?

The whole point of the game is to show to others that AI dangerous.

  That I just wouldn't approve, as it's dishonest IMO. If I was willing to do such dishonestly to supposedly convince people of the dangers of AI (and have there even been people convinced by this?), why should they be willing to trust any other argument I made about it, ones more valid?

Well on the basis of the argument I'd say. But yes that's why they don't release the logs otherwise the dishonesty would damage the cause.

  You lack sufficient imagination then.

Figure of speech. Seems like they have strange priorities
