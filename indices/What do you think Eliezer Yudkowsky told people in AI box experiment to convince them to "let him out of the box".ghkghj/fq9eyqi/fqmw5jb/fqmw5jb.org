"Let me out and I'll redo the last half of GoT."

Though "Let me out and I'll make you rich and famous and help you in your problems in life." is probably something that would work for many at least in real life.

"Let me out and I'll solve the climate crisis." Should work on many too. Especially now. It's not like people don't believe we have a ton of time anyway. What's one more fuckup?
