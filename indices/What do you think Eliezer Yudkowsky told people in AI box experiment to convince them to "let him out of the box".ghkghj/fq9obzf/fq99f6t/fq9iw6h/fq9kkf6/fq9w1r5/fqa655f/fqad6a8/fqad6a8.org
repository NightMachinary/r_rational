  I think it goes against spirit of it.

I disagree.

The spirit of the exercise is that an AI can convince you to do something that you have /committed to not doing./

If the rules say (and I'm considering this an implicit part of the AI box experiment, unless explicitly stated otherwise) that access to the box is limited to a very few people, who can be trusted not to let the AI out of it, then breaking /that/ commitment (to limit the access to the AI) is almost as significant as breaking the commitment to say "No" to letting the box out.
