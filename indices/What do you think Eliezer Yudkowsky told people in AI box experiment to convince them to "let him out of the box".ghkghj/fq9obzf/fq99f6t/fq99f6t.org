Whatever the answer is, it's probably underwhelming.

Having played on the "gatekeeper" side of that game, it's really not hard to say no over and over again, even if tactics like "don't read the chat and play on your phone the whole time" are forbidden.

(though a problem in the game I played in was that the AI player and I disagreed on what the loss condition would be; eg I assumed that letting the AI talk with a board of directors was fine while the AI player thought it would be equivalent to unboxing the AI)
