My hypothesis is that he told them that while this was just an experiment, the threat of actual AI talking themselves out of a box was very real. A good way to decrease the chance of that happening would be more attention/funding/hype around the subject of UFAI and what better way to create a stir and show the dangers of the AI box experiment than with a human 'making it out of the box' even under the disadvantageous rules that were set?

If the person he was playing against already donated to AI research, I could buy an argument that paying EY the prize would take your money further than that same amount of money donated.
