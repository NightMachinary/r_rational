I remember, at some point, EY mentioning that his argument would only work against someone who was already adamant that nothing would convince them to let the AI out of the box. Your theory doesn't seem to fit that description, in my opinion: it seems to me that someone who is already convinced that they might let the AI out of the box would be /more/ responsive to it, not less.
