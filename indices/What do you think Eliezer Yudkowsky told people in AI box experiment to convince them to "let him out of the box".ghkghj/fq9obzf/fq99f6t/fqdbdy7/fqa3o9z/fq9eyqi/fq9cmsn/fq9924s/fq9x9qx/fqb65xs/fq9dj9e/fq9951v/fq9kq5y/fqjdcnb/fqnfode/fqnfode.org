As I understand it, the essence of this challenge was that one person I don't know IRL ostensibly convinced two other people I don't know IRL to do something they said they wouldn't. But he never released the transcripts, which would be easy enough to fudge in any case, and /nullius in verba/ is as fine a rule today as it was for the Royal Society hundreds of years ago. Pics or it didn't happen.

Also, the challenge was not and could not be an accurate simulation of the thing it represented, as the players knew full well that EY wasn't an AI, they had cause to respect him and no cause to fear him, stood to lose only a little money ... etc. It doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things.
