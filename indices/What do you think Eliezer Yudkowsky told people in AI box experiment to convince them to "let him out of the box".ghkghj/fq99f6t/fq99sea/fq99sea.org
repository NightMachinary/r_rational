Wow, this is really interesting. Could share more about the experiments you've been playing?

Did you ever lose as a gatekeeper? (aside from the board of directors argument, which I don't think counts) Did someone make some really cool/convincing arguments that made an impact? Did you learn something interesting/unexpected from trying this stuff?
