  If your scenario for winning is "I talk to the director off-screen and then I use magically compelling arguments to convince them to plug me to the internet", then you're already starting with the assumption the box experiment is supposed to prove.

That's not my scenario for winning; you just have a different assumption of what "the box" is. To go back to my "browser sandbox" analogy, if applications running in your browser sandbox doesn't have access to, say, the database on your network's mainframe server, but a different application, outside of the sandbox, does, then just breaking out of the sandbox will not give a malicious application access to your database - but it /is/ the first, toughest, most necessary step it needs in order to achieve that goal. "The box" in the AI box experiment, as I see it, is the framework in which only selected, trained people (not necessarily just one person) are allowed to talk to the AI. When you play as the gatekeeper, you're not playing a /specific/ person; you're playing a specific /kind/ of person, whose job it is to keep the AI's scope of interaction limited to people in that position, and, by letting the AI interact with someone outside of that position, you've effectively failed at that job.
