  I assumed that letting the AI talk with a board of directors was fine while the AI player thought it would be equivalent to unboxing the AI

I would agree that's equivalent to unboxing the AI; the point of the experiment is to allow the AI to expand its sphere of influence, which it has done.

If /you/ had conveyed its arguments to the Board, that would be a different story, but, if you visualize the "box" like a browser sandbox, where the browser is only able to write to selected portions of memory, then the "writable memory" is you, and the Board is the writable memory outside of the sandbox, and talking to the Board is escaping the sandbox, and therefore the AI box.
