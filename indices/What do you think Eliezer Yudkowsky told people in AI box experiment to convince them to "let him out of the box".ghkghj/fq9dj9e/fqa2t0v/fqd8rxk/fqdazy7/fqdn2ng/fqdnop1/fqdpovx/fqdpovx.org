  No, I think more precisely the game is about illustrating human weakness, not AI dangerousness. Since it's not an actual AI, but a human opponent pretending to be such.

Human weakness in the context of AI. If even a human can beat a human then so can an AI.

  For the game to have any value, I'd think the gatekeeper needs make a proper attempt, to at least pretend to be in-character.

Surely that's self-evidently not true. Even if the AIs did what we're speculating here this would have value.

  When you are accusing other people of dishonesty, I wish you expressed such accusations with less seeming certainty, and made it more clear you're just guessing and theorizing they're being dishonest, that you don't have any actual proof, or even significant evidence, of that.

As I'm not a mind reader that should be self evident.
