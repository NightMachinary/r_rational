  If it doesn't work on you then you probably would let the AI out of the box anyway because you're not worried about an AI threat.

Saying that I should falsely pretend to have been convinced by a *fictional* AI in a roleplaying scenario (in the case that instead EY convinced me effectively using metalogic), just to convince other people that *actual* AIs would be able to convince random other people, is very bizarre and topsy-turvy logic.

That I just wouldn't approve, as it's dishonest IMO. If I was willing to do such dishonestly to supposedly convince people of the dangers of AI (and have there even been people convinced by this?), why should they be willing to trust any other argument I made about it, ones more valid?

Now you may hypothesize that in two hours of argumentation, EY would be able to change my mind about the moral value of such pretense weighed against my ethical rules and principles. Well, obviously I have no way of disproving it, but currently the line of arguments you suggest I find to be extremely unappealing, it's a line of argument that I strongly think would move me AGAINST "letting the AI go".

  Can't imagine someone caring about AI's being let out of the box enough to play this game wouldn't go for that argument

You lack sufficient imagination then.
