I am sadly not fast enough to /ever/ catch up to Wandering Inn. My current average word count is ~2600 words per day, while Wandering Inn seems to be ~3700 words per day.

I do like money, because it can be exchanged for goods and services, but I don't plan on ever monetizing this story, short of some publisher or agent coming up to me and offering me a reasonable deal (which almost certainly will not happen).

If you want to support this story, my preferences are:

- write some fanfic
- draw some fanart
- post about it somewhere
- recommend it to friends

But those are really just "things that would bring me personal happiness".
