Good to get more discussion on how/why the different artifacts are bound to Amaryllis.

Curious why the skin tattoo failed. Wondering what the high-level results of a skill as broad as "Engineering" will look like.

Gotta say, I also think the author does a good job in both the emotionally resonant scenes and the nitty-gritty worldbuilding which often appear as if they're mutually exclusive skills.
