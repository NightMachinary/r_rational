I highly recommend /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382450.Fevre_Dream][Fevre Dream]]/, George R.R. Martin's only vampire novel. It's unlike any other vampire story I've read, and it touches on some philosophical topics that would probably appeal to this sub.

If you like scifi, then you might enjoy one of my favorite books: /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36161.The_Madness_Season][The Madness Season]]/ by C.S. Friedman. It has an interesting explanation for the existence of vampires in a scientific world rather than a fantasy one. Woven into the plot, there are some great explorations of truly alien psychology.

For a comedic take on vampirism, I recommend /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183274.Thirsty][Thirsty]]/ by M.T. Anderson. It's a satire of the typical teenage 'turned into a vampire' tropes, and the story contains some of (in my opinion) Anderson's best moments of dark [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism][absurdist]] humor.
