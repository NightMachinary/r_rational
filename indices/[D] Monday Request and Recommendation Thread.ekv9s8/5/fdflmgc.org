There's this really cool mini-game that I've been playing with recently called [[https://marctenbosch.com/news/][4D Toys]] where you get to interact with 4 dimensional shapes in a 3D plane as if you are a higher-dimensional baby learning about shapes for the first time. It's really cool how even though I can't see in 4D, I still can get a sense for how 4D objects are constructed and move. For anyone who had already heard of this, there's a new update with new star-shaped objects to play with.

Oh man, oh man, where do I start? [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/][All Night Laundry]] is an incredible webcomic that has just recently completed (except for the epilogues) and now was a good time to introduce it to you guys. It's a story that started as a short ghost tale that takes place in a haunted laundromat, but it rapidly spiraled into a much larger, intricate story which involves bizarre physics, doppelgangers, eldritch creatures, and read the story to find out! I don't want to say too much more since it's a very spoiler heavy plot line. Zack actually updated this daily for /seven years/ straight.

[[https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/][Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]] is another story that I'm sharing because it just finished. Kim Dokja is an avid reader of a Chinese webnovel, Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World, but the story has become real. However there are signs that he may not be anything more than a character in the first place. Really plays with meta-aware characters and use literary conventions as laws of physics.

The next two stories are short stories that were posted here a while ago that I thought deserved a repost:

[[https://physicsnapkins.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/all-paths-to-happiness/][All Paths to Happiness]] is an interesting take on how powerful a device to stimulate a version of Coil's power from Worm can be. But as discussed in the previous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4chu76/all_paths_to_happiness/][thread]], the execution was a little flawed since UFAIs would occur long before the protagonist actually accomplished his goals.

[[http://www.begoodenough.com/the-great-filter/][The Great Filter]] is a novel take on the Fermi Paradox where the Great Filter is time travel. Some interesting discussion in the previous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4mwcvl/rt_the_great_filter/][thread]].

Both authors also have some cool articles on their blogs if you want to explore their websites.
