I liked the first a lot, but the reviews of the second make it sound pretty meh. I think I've decided not to see it so as not to taint the first by association. In particular it sounds like they butcher the magic system via over explanation, a system I kind of liked in Maleficent for its vagueness yet sense of having a hidden logical structure behind it.
