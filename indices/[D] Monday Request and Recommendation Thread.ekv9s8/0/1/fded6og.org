The Last Ringbearer seems to fit your criteria. It's a 1999 published Russian novel/sequel of LotR from the perspective of the orcs. Elves are eternal, unchanging oppressors while orcs are designing new technologies and undergoing a industrial revolution. Got released free once copyright laws started applying to Russia.

I bounced off it from translation and political issues, but others might find it good. It is arguably a precursor of rational fiction in that the whole story tries to take an existing fantasy world and retrofit it into realism.
