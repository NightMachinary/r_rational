Any fics that feature mechs? (of any kind, real or super robots, rational or rat-adjacent, etc) I think someone recommended Daedalus a few threads ago, but the missing chapters and the constant advertising kind of put me off the entire thing. I'm pretty much up for anything, even fantasy (I remember reading Knights and Magic and liking it a lot).
