[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/]] Is pretty good. Never updates, though, so once you catch up that's all there is.

Gurren Lagann is fairly rat adjacent while also being good, but it's an anime; Neon Genesis Evangelion is even further out but is the next closest mech anime that I can actually recommend. There's also a few fanfics of those.

Forty Milleniums of Cultivation has some mechs (and more powered armor) but that's only a secondary focus and it has a weak start.
