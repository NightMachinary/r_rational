Are you averse to visual novels, anime, or LGBTQ themes? If not, I can recommend [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/][Heaven Will Be Mine]]. In an alternate world, Humanity launched a space program to defend against an Existential Threat which may or may not have been born from the collective Human subconscious. After that war was fought, and Earth started to be afraid of the diverging pilots, the program was scrapped and all pilots recalled back to Earth. Most of them didn't like that one bit, and now two factions are in open rebellion while a third faction tries to get them to come back before Earth loses patience and kills them all. You play as the ace pilot of one of those three factions, and choose how your encounters with the other two characters play out. Each of those three girls really cares for their mission, but they also care for each other a whole lot.

It's a heavily different world which seems to run on either narrative or subjective physics, expressed through Gravity which is how humans decide what is real, and you're often not going to comprehend stuff the first time you read it. Playing [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/435300/We_Know_the_Devil/][We Know The Devil]] might help with that, it's set in the same world, just earlier, and doesn't have mechs.
