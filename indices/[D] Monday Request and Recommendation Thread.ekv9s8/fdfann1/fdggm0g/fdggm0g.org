I'm glad you enjoyed it, but you robbed me of recommending my favourite horror story ;P

[[https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]] by Peter Watts was mentioned, so I'll go with his Echopraxia.

[[http://web.archive.org/web/20110411140643/http://squid314.livejournal.com/293753.html][The Story of Emily and Control]] by Scott Alexander - a great story that deserves a better ending :)

[[https://365tomorrows.com/2015/02/27/procrastination/][Procrastination]] by Jaime Astorga - not a horror story per se, but terrifying enough.

[[https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/][Coding Machines]] by Lawrence Kesteloot - a fictionalization of the [[http://wiki.c2.com/?TheKenThompsonHack][Ken Thompson Hack]].

[[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/muse.shtml][Muse]] by Alicorn is fantastic and horrifying (but not that rational).
