A fanfic of Good Omens: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]] (complete).

I'd recommend either the book or watching the show first (it's based on the show, but I read it based on the book with no problems). I can't recommend the show, not having watched it, but the book is pretty hopeful in tone.

The fanfic is one of the most hopeful things I have read in the past year.
