Not quite the same, but the Marcus Didius Falco books are quite good. It's more or less 'Harry Dresden solves crimes all over the Roman Empire' and a lot of pages are dedicated to his relationships with his friends and his eventually-wife.

Also, Max Frei's Echo books. It's an incredibly popular, uh, cozy slice-of-life portal urban fantasy mystery series from Russia. Warning though: the translation isn't that great from what I hear (I read like fifteen of these in Russian) and the series hasn't caught on in English so only four of the books have been published. But if you can find a copy of the first book for cheap, give it a go.
