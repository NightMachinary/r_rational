Killing off main characters can work, but it has to be done for actual story reasons, not to "create tension", "make characters experience loss" or other similar bullshit excuses. ASOIAF pulled it off particularly well when GRR established that /anyone/ can die by killing off one of the main protagonists in the end of the first book. The downside to that approach is that your world tends to end up as grimdark and that can be really depressing.

Also consider the real world: There's plenty of tension and suspense in many peoples' lives without anyone necessarily dying. A good writer should be able to do similar things without having to resort to killing people for that purpose unless the setting is particularly militaristic or violent.
