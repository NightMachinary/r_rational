Fun Fact:

Dr Horrible's lab is a house in the San Fernando valley that was remodeled by one of those reality shows, with the explicit theme of "Mad Scientist". The only things the crew brought in were lights and camera gear; all the props were just the every day decoration of the house. As part of payment, they gave the owner (note: a production biochemist) a cameo in the last scene, and when the guy pulled out his first choice costume (something he'd already had in his closet) is was item for item Dr Horrible's. So instead he got his second choice. :)
