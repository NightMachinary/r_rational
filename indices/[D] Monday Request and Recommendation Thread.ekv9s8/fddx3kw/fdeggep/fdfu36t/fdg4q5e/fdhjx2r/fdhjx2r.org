This is pretty much the anti-Worm webfic. Story tropes are employed and justified rather than subverted, pretty much /everyone/ is secretly a decent person (the Emperor is a nice guy even when it sometimes costs him, the Thieves Guild is more an unofficial anti-corruption agency dedicated to knocking power-hungry people down a peg, the slavering Drow actually have a divine mandate to serve as a barrier between the Surface and the even /worse/ Deep Elves, the Demon Queen cultists mainly try and curtail wild warlocks or demon outbreaks) - it just sometimes takes a few arcs (or a dozen) until that becomes obvious, and /noone/ ever dies.

I'd recommend it for its excellent party banter alone, but it's also got a great magic system and an interesting setting. Also, character development! It's taken a /long/ time until I warmed up to some characters, but by now I really like most of them.
