I suppose rationally speaking, fights at this power level involves:

- bringing an overwhelming amount of firepower and numbers (2x or more against 1)

- meticulous planning & a wide range of options to best exploit any opportunities to use that firepower

- catching the target alone and unaware, or isolating them from reinforcements

- unleashing everything you got at them in seconds so as to exhaust all their options of self-defence, self-recovery or escape

- leaving immediately after the deed whether you succeed or fail at the assassination

It'll be an endless series of alpha strike sneak attacks and ganging up on each other, unless the protagonist is the only one who is overpowered (in which case it's more a man stomping on ants). Either way it's difficult for the writer to make this relatable to the reader.

Edit: I just realised I described something similar to a DotA teamfight.
