If you're fine with Manga, there's "Teppu". It's basically a parody of the standard shoen manga, as the personalities of the protagonist and antagonist is reversed. It's pretty short, only 30-something chapters, but it does end properly.

The main character is extremely talented, so she looks down on everyone else (hence, the personality of an antagonist).

Hands down the best manga I know, both from a "I like overpowered characters" perspective, and from a character study one (You actually get to know why the main character acts like she does).
