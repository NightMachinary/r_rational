It's something I'd like as well. The problem is that overpowered + rational means conflicts get resolved pretty quickly (as others have noted). The bad solution is to randomly throw OP challenges or idiot balls at the protagonist (after noticing the fic is written into a corner). That's extremely unsatisfying because then i) the protagonist isn't OP anymore and ii) the conflict isn't foreshadowed and comes out of nowhere which is always unsatisfying. Many online fictions one finds also describe OP powers, describe how awed everyone is once they are revealed and then just stop (I guess because then comes the difficult bit about how to continue...).

A few categories to work around the problems a OP protagonist causes

- Working under heavy restrictions. E.g. being a god, but unable to take away free choice. Or one of my favourite HP fanfics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] (HP time travel; unfinished). I'd guess [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] that gets recommended here often partially falls into this category as well (protagonist is morally restricted).
- The fictions asking how having OP powers influences the character(s) long term and how the "normals" react. Unfortunately I can only think of "Mortal Gods by Bonnie Quinn" so far.
- The curb-stomp fics. Worm itself isn't one, since the power scales up during it (like a lot of fiction). But there is a lot of Worm fanfic with OP powers (e.g. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/acceleration-worm-au.284714/][Acceleration]] or [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/queen-of-blood-worm-castlevania-complete.363842/][Queen of Blood]]). Search for OP worm fanfic (reddit) and I guess you'll find most of it. Doing the canon challenges using OP powers begs the question a bit in my opinion (but I guiltily read those anyway).
- Throw a difficult problem at the protagonist. But then the question is if the protagonist is still OP. For example this quest was recommended a few threads ago here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]] or e.g. "A Soldier's Duty by Jean Johnson" (the latter highlights the problems with extreme competence)
- Fics where the protagonist becomes OP at the end. Worm was already mentioned. One with extreme OPness is e.g. "The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins". But really much fantasy falls into this category, I could list a lot of them. I wouldn't call those fics with overpowered protagonists (since they don't start off overpowered), but you have mentioned "I'm a Spider So What?"...
- Making a comedy (or "light novel"?) out of it, usually with the protagonist being oblivious of the power or the responsibility that comes with it. Like "I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level", "Evil God Average", etc. I haven't read/watched One Punch Man... would that fall into this category? There's tons of (bad) HP and Worm fanfic in this category as well (like the popular HP "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/3/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy by Nonjon]]"; haven't read it, but I guess...).
