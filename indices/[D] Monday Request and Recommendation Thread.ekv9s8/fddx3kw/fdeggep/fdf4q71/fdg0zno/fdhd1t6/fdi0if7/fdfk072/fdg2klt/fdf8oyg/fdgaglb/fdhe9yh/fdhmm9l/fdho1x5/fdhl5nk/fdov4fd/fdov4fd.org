I have just finished binging the fic over the last... 4 days? Maybe 5, not sure. The story starts out very weak, so like you I had some initial problems with it; this is actually my second attempt at giving it a read. If you can get past the initial bit, though, I would definitely recommend it. It's not the best thing I've ever read, but it's quite well executed. It's less rational than MoR or, I dunno, Luminosity, but it's definitely within the rat sphere and closer than quite a few things on this sub.

It's definitely the best Xanxia novel I have ever read, bar none, and by a significant margin.
