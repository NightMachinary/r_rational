You might have read them already because they are popular on SB forums, but [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-aka-chryssalid-writes-a-me-xcom-crossover.303390/][Psi Effect]] (Human x-com operatives go undercover as asari while postponing first contact . Mostly seen through the eyes of an asari maiden they recruit, which adds a lot of fun with how strange humans can be) and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The last angel]] (Humanity is mostly wiped out, AI decides to get revenge (think late-stage Chrysalis if you read that in HFY, if not then take a look). We follow different characters as they try to salvage a massive derelict ship without realizing what they've stumbled into).

Anyway, with those two out of the way there's my favorite [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]] story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2bbsqd/oc_the_year_after_next_part_1/][The year after next]]. Set around our time, it's a race for humanity to reach the stars because something (wont mention because slight spoiler for first few chapters) bad will happen if we don't. Interestingly, most of the story happens on earth, where we follow FBI agents getting involved with religious fanatics, a disgraced NASA scientist trying to set aside his humiliation so he can help. A woman dealing with an abusive stalker. People like that. Does have an end that wraps up everything, which puts it above 99% of internet stories. Aliens are also proper characters, not just wooden dolls to make humans look better, which is refreshing in the genre.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2hf1f9/ocjenkinsverse_monkeys_reaches_stars/][Monkeys reaches stars]] is in my mind, aside from the original, the only jenkinverse story worth reading. Absolute joy, but it's basically the same as every other hfy story so there's not much to say. "Human strong human smart raaaaagghh!". The aliens are the best part of this story, even has well written children in it, which I didn't think was possible to find on reddit.

A bit unconventional, but "The day the world came to town" is a feelgood book. It's a true story based on the events in a town called Gander after 9/11, where several thousand passengers flying to the US ended up. Not only is it fun with a plethora of fascinating characters (the CEO of Hugo Boss, an US general, a family of Jews who starves in silence because there's no kosher food and they don't want to intrude), but the whole book is basically humans being kind to each other. There's some heartbreak in there, but you'll definitely come out feeling good about the future once you're done.
