As a related recommendation to Forged Destiny, there's also The Games We Play by ryuugi on ff.net. It's not as good as Forged Destiny, but the lore is expanded in a very intriguing way and the powers have fascinating histories (plus it goes up to dbz power levels, which depending on your taste could be fun).
