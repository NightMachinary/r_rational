  Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier
#+end_quote

I finally got around to watching this and it was... okay.

There are a couple of really good songs (A Thousand and One Nights is a stand-out), and the actor for Aladdin pulls off a surprisingly great Smeagol/Gollum act.

That said, it doesn't have quite enough story for its runtime, so it lags in the middle. It's in desperate need of a straight-man for all of the jokes and references (they sometimes try to put Ja'far in that role, but they can't quite commit to it, instead getting him to make a bunch of those references himself). The plot... Let's just say that it faces the choice of being a plot that makes internal sense, or of being an allegory for the [[https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Disney_Post-Renaissance][Post-Renaissance]] Walt Disney Corporation, and it chooses the latter at every opportunity ("Ha ha! Pixar has conquered you, Magic Kingdom!" "We'll pay you a bunch of money, that would be yours anyway if you conquered us, to let the Magic Kingdom buy Pixar instead." "Deal!").

It's a credit to the show that it can rise above most of the stuff I just mentioned and somehow is still very enjoyable. I'm just a little sad at those moments of greatness, the profound emotional arc and the perfectly serviceable plot structure, that could have been expanded upon to make this so much better than "okay"... were pretty much all tarnished by making them subservient to the "Disney sucked between ditching 2D animation and buying Pixar" theme, instead.
