/Phantom/, by Susan Kay, re-tells /The Phantom of the Opera/ from the perspective of the titular character. I don't think the continuity lines up (it's trying to walk a tightrope between the novel and the Broadway musical), so this would probably fall under "alternate continuity."

If you like musicals, /Into the Woods/ isn't from the perspective of any of the villains, but it paints both them and the protagonists with a more complicated brush than "one side good, one side evil."

If you like /Wicked/ (the novel, not the musical; they're for very different tastes), Gregory Maguire has written other retellings of classic fairytales (/Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister/ (Cinderella), /Mirror, Mirror/ (Snow White)).

There's the juvenile but funny "The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!" which might not fit but is still worth checking out.

/The Mists of Avalon/ is Arthurian legend from Morgan Le Fay's perspective.

Those are the ones that immediately come to mind, but for more examples (TVTropes warning):
