The Disney adaptation wasn't /horrible/ ("Agony," in particular, was well-done but left incomplete by the omission of its Act Two reprise), but certainly, I meant to recommend seeing the show on stage if at all possible. It's a popular enough community theatre standard that it shouldn't be too hard to find an upcoming production.
