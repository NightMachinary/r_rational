Are there any good retellings of stories from the perspective of the villain, but made sympathetic and good and reasonable? Maybe set in alternate continuities, or else alleging that the originals were told from the perspective of a /very/ biased narrator? This seems like a pretty straightforward premise but I don't see it too often in fanfiction.

The best example that I know of would be [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA][Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier]], which I believe I've recommended here before and would be happy to recommend again. To quote the YouTube blurb:

#+begin_quote
  Long ago in a Magic Kingdom, one misunderstood Royal Vizier will go on a quest to save his city from its bumbling sultan, an invading prince, and the most notorious thief to ever live! With the help of the Kingdom's free-spirited, teenage Princess, the Vizier must find a magical lamp containing a wish-granting Djinn (who's really funny, by the way) and defeat the city's most-wanted criminal... Aladdin!

(mild spoiler for the above, unrelated to the main plot but a nice surprise: the other Disney villains [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA&feature=youtu.be&t=5831][have a song in there too]] -- any of /their/ stories fleshed out would also have been welcome)

(/Wicked/ could also qualify, maybe)

I feel that "rational/ist" fiction would be especially appropriate here, since often villain characters are already written to be methodical and ruthlessly calculating (e.g. Danz≈ç from Naruto).
