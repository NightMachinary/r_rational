I would like to recommend getting a drawing tablet. I just got a cheap one ($35, like a touchpad but with a pressure sensitive pen instead of your fingers) and was blown away by the quality. Paired with illustrator sketchbook (free for noncommercial use) or another art editor of your choice (e.g. gimp) they make it significantly more fun to make computer art compared to drawing with a mouse. I'm a garbage artist, so don't worry about needing to be any good to have fun. I can already tell I'll blow past my standard $1/hour cost/funtime ratio.
