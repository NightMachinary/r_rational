I'm going to make some different recommendations, perhaps stretching rational a bit. If you're here and going through [[/r/hfy]] you've already scoured for new ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7278544/1/First-Contact][First Contact]] - A Mass Effect Fanfic, unfinished / abandoned so be warned. Doe not requiring a knowledge of the game. Its a soft rational, in that the characters at least move to actively avoid a lot of the cliche's regarding alien first contact. Humans governments deal with alien contract a little to easily. Last Chapter has a very HFY discussion.

If you want longer HFY style things in scifi, I'd recommend this fandom as a whole. A lot of the stories are not rational, and hfy here can be very trope heavy. However their are gems.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] - Long, and very slow. To it's detriment at parts. It is not a [[https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-gamer/list?title_no=88&page=1][Gamer]] ripoff like a bunch of the RWBY stories are, but in a similar vein. Utilizing a non-combat 'skill' in a world based on vague RPG classes to become a powerful warrior.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With this Ring]] - LOOONG. I've given up on it even with TTS playing it in the background. MC has some amount of Self Insert Knowledge, but having an Orange Ring must operate on selfish motives at all times to function as a superhero. So a lot of the story is 'rationalizing' fixing the world via selfish motive. (In between the much more expansive, less annoying than canon teen drama.) Might strike your fancy more than my own. Make sure to download the thing.
