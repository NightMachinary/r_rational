Yes, the early chapters (â€˜early' in wuxia terms) are much more about signposting to the traditional wuxia crowd, and it only gradually grows into full-on rational fiction. Some things, like the MC being OP, are staples of the genre that will never go away, but they do fade to more just being background facts rather than the core goal the plot focuses around.

The translator changes a fair few times, from initial inexpert fan translations by a few different people, until Webnovel starts paying more real translators, first flycrane01 (starting Ch ~200) and then Henyee Translations (Ch ~1000), each doing significantly better work than the prior.

Though I don't mean to encourage you to do something you dislike. There are plenty of stories that start strong from the beginning, and there's never a guarantee you'll love the latter parts as much as I do.
