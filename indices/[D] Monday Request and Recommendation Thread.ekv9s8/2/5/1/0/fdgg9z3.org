Shit man! Read it! It's great. I recommend reading the first chapter to see if you like the style and structure, but otherwise, if you're looking for OP characters done /magnificently/ this is your go to.

Also, it's kind of long, but the story comes in bite-sized chunks called “arcs”. Don't feel pressure to read the whole thing. (I did, but as far as I can tell, few do).
