...Thinking about it, I've come to the realisation that there aren't many OP MC stories that I've actually liked. Off the top of my head, there's One Punch Man, The Eminence of Shadow, The Gamer, Solo Levelling, I'm a Spider So What?, Snake Report, and that's about it.

I think what I'm looking for is something where the protagonist actually takes full advantage of their powers and don't get needlessly underestimated by idiot antagonists, or where they are actually successful at hiding their powers / knowing the relative overpoweredness of their powers and aren't just obliviously amazing people left and right.
