[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28062/empire-of-salt][Empire of Salt]] has mostly been in the latter category so far; the main character has largely been underestimated /because/ she's done a good job of knowing how OP she is, and managing to hide it.

That being said the systems in the book are a little incoherent, and also there's not much salt yet.
