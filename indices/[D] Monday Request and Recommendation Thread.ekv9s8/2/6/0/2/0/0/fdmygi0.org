People recommend this in a rational context because it's a rational story, at times even rationalist, and very strong in that regard. It hits all of the marks: intelligent characters solving problems with legitimate thinking, genuine introspection of goals and motives in a complex environment, intellectual payoffs after every plot, the whole story is /about/ aspiring rationalism, and the worldbuilding is solid---that's just mentioning the points on the sidebar. I'm not sure what specifically you're concerned about with the linked post; ‘rational' doesn't mean ‘never makes mistakes under pressure'.
