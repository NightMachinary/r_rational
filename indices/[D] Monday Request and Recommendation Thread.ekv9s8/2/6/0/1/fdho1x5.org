100 chapters is about how long it took for the author to decide to take the story and characters more seriously than regular xianxia (before then he had set out to make a regular xianxia in a deconstructed setting). The events on the train is basically the point where the author turns over a new leaf.

There's still all the random powerups from the first 100 chapters to grapple with, but over time they're given less and less attention and Li Yao's successes start coming more from his own talents and ingenuity and the author seems to have (from where the translation currently is, at least) planned out how to justify all the powerups in big reveals later on.

Also the translation /does/ improve significantly, to the point where you should be able to easily acclimatize to it. I recommend you give it another shot.
