Does it ever get better? I got maybe 100 chapters in and it was a constant MC wank combined with asspull powerups. And tonal whiplash going from "MC is a cool guy that likes helping people" to "Muhaha I love breaking people who mildly inconvinence me bones" and then back again.

Literally not a single part of it was well written (horrible translation aside) or rational.
