Not rational /per se/, but amazing world building and characters that mostly act consistent in a slightly insane world (if I remember right), and beautiful uses of the German language:

The Zamonian books by Walter Moers.

I would recommend starting with "13 ½ Leben des Käptn Blaubär" or "Die Stadt der Träumenden Bücher".

"Rumo" is supposed to be much darker but still very good.
