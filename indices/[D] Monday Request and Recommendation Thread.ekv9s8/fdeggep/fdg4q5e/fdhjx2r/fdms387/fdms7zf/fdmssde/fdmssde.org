Yes, and? I don't particularly /want/ to be afraid for the characters. Why would I want to worry whether some element I like is suddenly going to be taken away from the story?

Not that you actually are in most fiction anyway, since very little fiction kills off the major protagonists (A Song of Ice and Fire being a major exception). A lot of the time it's just "Let's cause them suffering for the sake of suffering".

Take the end battle in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was 100% clear that J. K. Rowling was never going to kill off any of the protagonists for real (and certainly not in a satisfying way), so killing off Fred Weasley comes off just as a means of causing suffering for the sake of suffering with no actual effect on anything (unlike killing off Dumbledore and Snape which were required for the plot).

The point is that there are many - often better - ways of creating tension than killing off characters. In TGAB the major source of tension is whether and how far Justinian can pull off his scheme.
