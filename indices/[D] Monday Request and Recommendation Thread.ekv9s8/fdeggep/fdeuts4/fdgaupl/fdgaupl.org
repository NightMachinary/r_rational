If you like the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I also recommend the Phryne Fisher books by Kerry Greenwood. They have a similar wholesome vibe to the N1LDA books but are a little more exciting.

I'd like to know though, if anyone can think of a _third_ wholesome mystery series with such a cool sense of place.
