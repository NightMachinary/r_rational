Since the first round of nominations for the Hugos has begun, what are/would be yours?

Here are mine

Uncrowned by Will Wight

3zekiel by Peter Cawdron (novel)

Arkad's World by James L. Cambias (novel)

Perhelion Summer by Greg Egan (novella)

Knife Children by Lois McMaster Bujold (novella)

They also give awards for TV and film, editors, fan works, and essays. Web serials count as novels (I think). Any scifi or fantasy that was finished or published in 2019 is fair game.
