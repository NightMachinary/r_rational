By that logic, photons can never interact with anything, because they are traveling at infinite speed and pass out of the observable universe in no time at all. This is obvious nonsense.

Also, the Alcubierre drive isn't really more plausible. It requires exotic matter which probably doesn't exist and violates causality, and as long as you're using exotic matter you might as well just use element zero and come up with a backfilled explanation for why it works and doesn't cause time dilation (which is canon).

How I would work it: Maintaining zero mass requires constant adjustment of the current over the element zero drive, and therefore can be preset to drop out at a certain precalculated threshold which will bring you to your destination. For ordinary FTL drives, this is done in several short hops, which are more stable and allow more possible to maneuver; this accounts for the passing time on shipboard. Mass relay pairs maintain this offboard, so transit through those fields is subjectively instantaneous.
