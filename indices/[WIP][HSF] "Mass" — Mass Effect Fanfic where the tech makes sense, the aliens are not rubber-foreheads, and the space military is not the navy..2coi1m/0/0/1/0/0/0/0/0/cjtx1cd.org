The core setting premise as I see it does not pertain to the technology, but to what it looks like to live according to the wishes of post-human-level unfriendly intellects.

The mass relays provide easy, centralized transportation; FTL is possible and there are multiple humanoid-equivalent species running about.

I am taking an approach where most everyone is more rational and less adhering to tropes: including the weapons engineers and designers.

Call it advocacy for the age of drone warfare. I will be focusing on clever tactics and clever use of plausible technology and clever circumventing of bureaucracy; rather than saving the day with exploits and science.
