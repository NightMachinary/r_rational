I am familiar with the physics. Lemme go Einstein on you for a minute.

Say you are traveling at the speed of light in a spaceship. To an observer on earth, your time-dilation is infinite (and symetrically so is it the other way around.) You are traveling, subjectively, infinitely fast.

You will never have an opportunity to press the 'slow down' button; you will pass out of the galaxy and out of the observable universe in subjectively /no time at all./

Compare and contrast an alcumbrierre drive: You are moving at superluminal speeds; but not locally. Therefore you can hit the stop-button.
