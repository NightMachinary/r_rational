Yes, I am eliminating most of the canon tech (but saving the narrative,) in favour of something a little more sensible.

Shipwide unidirectional artificial gravity gives me headaches when I try to put it into a universe with sensible physics. Centrifugal force is real and simple.

And I completely fail to see how altering the mass of objects gives rise to FTL. Much better to go with space bending (and anyway what did the Relays even do? Let's make them wormholes instead.

Biotics is similarly, from a rational perspective, useless. Guns and bombs exist, why even use Force Push? Much rather have all the precog/mind trick parts (which will become apparent later in the story.)

And ME just hadwaves that the Asari can do the Vulcan Mind Meld. Like /oooh it's a sex thing/ except it's not: Liara does it to Shepard at arms length without physical contact.

And the big bad is an honest-to god race of superintelligent AI's. You can't win against that. Ever.

ME is a trainwreck from a hard sci-fi, Kurtzweil-inspired perspective.
