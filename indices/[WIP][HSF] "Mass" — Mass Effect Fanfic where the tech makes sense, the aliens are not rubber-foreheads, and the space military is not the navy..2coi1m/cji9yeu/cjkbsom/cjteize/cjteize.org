  And I completely fail to see how altering the mass of objects gives rise to FTL.

Energy required to accelerate an object of mass /m/ from rest to a speed /v/ is (1/sqrt(1-(v/c)^{2} ) - 1)mc^{2} . If /m=0/, there is no limit on speed, and travel can be instantaneous.

'Ah!' You might say, 'But massless particles also have kinetic energy!'. And indeed, they do. Through the mass-energy equivalence, they acquire mass. But because you can manipulate mass, you can constantly reduce this mass to zero, thus preserving the masslessness.
