Thanks for your reply! I'm not sure I completely understand what you're getting at, which is why I'll have to speculate about your opinion.

Let's start with "I don't agree with the characterization of irrationalityfic" and try to offer a definition of what I think that genre is.

There's been a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/73eze4/d_irrational_fiction/][post]] about irrationalfic in this sub which had not been there at the time this comment was written. You might be interested in this; the top comment holds a position which might be similar to yours.

If you define rationality similarly to that top comment, i.e. "that behaviour which achieves results", Cordyceps isn't irrationalfic, but I'd say that nothing really is. In that sense, it's also correct to say that the character you call "designated rational" is not rational at all.

If we say that rational behaviour is methodical and analytic, that it relies on /understanding/ a system as a tool to make better decisions, which usually is the behaviour which produces good results, the concept of irrationalfics as fiction which turns this expectation on its head starts making sense.^{1} (If you dislike this definition of rational fiction, that's fine, but I fear that in that case, we don't have a genre to talk about.) The "designated rational character", though despite their mental illness, is trying to work through the problem in a rational manner. Of course, they aren't a perfect rationalist.

Maybe my reading of your comment was wrong in regards to "the designated rational character isn't". I'd be interested in a further elaboration.

Now to get to your central sentence: "there's a solution that doesn't require irrational action which none of the characters considered."

I don't think such a thing immediately qualifies something from being irrational fiction. If, for example, there's a better "irrational" solution (as per the terms defined above) in a rationalfic which none of the characters ever consider and the text doesn't even mention, would that make it an irrationalfic? I think it would just make it a flawed rationalfic, which is okay, because authors are only human beings and no one can reasonable be expected to find the best solution to the fictional situations they create.

Nonetheless, I'm interested in the solution you propose. Please tell me more :)

^{1} In that sense, the recently introduced druidic magic system in /Worth the Candle/ is an irrationalfic-esque element of the worldbuilding, which is very fascinating as the (rather rational) main character quickly realizes that he will never be able to properly learn it.
