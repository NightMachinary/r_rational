Copied over from the previous suggestion thread. It currently holds the largest amount of upvotes in that thread, yet was not chosen. Sic Semper Tyrannis!

*Title*: Cordyceps by Benedict_SC

*Ebook cost*: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][free on ao3]] (the Download button is at the right side of the page)

*Word count*: 64k

*Genre*: Sci-fi, Irrationalfic

*Synopsis*: An unnamed main character wakes up with amnesia, in a strange hospital they do not recognise. As they attempt to figure out how they got there, the mystery they face soon becomes far stranger than expected.

*Why [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would like it*: On a first glance, it conforms to the rules of rationalfic; characters take their time to figure things out and act according to their motivations to solve a mystery placed in a world with coherent rules. In some ways, it's also a clever whodunnit; an astute reader will figure out what is happening before the characters do.

That is what the work looks like on the surface, but soon enough, it becomes obvious that the work is an irrationalfic, in which rational thought is not the optimal route. I found this to be very interesting and would love to discuss both this work and the genre in general with this sub.

Also, the work is of course well-written.
