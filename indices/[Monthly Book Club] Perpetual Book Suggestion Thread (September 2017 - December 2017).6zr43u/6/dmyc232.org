I'm going to be a blatant self pushing shill here! Yay! My book.

*Title*: Digital Me

*Ebook cost*: 2.99/ free on KU

*Word count*: 76,725

*Genre*: LitRPG Fantasy/Political Intrigue

*Synopsis*: Shawn Bradshaw has made a desperate gamble. To save his life he risked it all in an attempt to become digitized. Knowing almost nothing about the greater Digital community or if he will be allowed to join, how Digital existence is experienced, or even if he will be relegated to a Digital zoo.

Shawn's success in obtaining immortality is but the start of his journey. Thrust into the kingdom of Loson's political intrigue, friends become enemies, allies manipulate and control, Shawn must decide how much assistance he is willing to let his allies provide and if he wants to count them as enemies instead.

Oblivious and ignorant of the culture, manipulated, reveling in his new found freedom even as he is chained socially, Shawn must decide on his long term goals and what he is willing to give up to achieve them.

The Immortal Wizard must decide what kind of legend he will leave behind.

*Reasons [[/r/rational]] would like it*: I think the entry into the digital world and why the Digitals want people to enter the digital world is interesting. The different factions have reasons for what they do and why they do it, no 'evil for the sake of evil!' The main character has a pretty strong sense of reason and direction but not as clear a view as to how that works or what it will cause. One of the main themes of the book is the main character being exceedingly powerful but still being manipulated because of his ignorance and character flaws. An 'avalanche redirected by a tiny stream' type of deal.

*Content warnings*: Violence. I have some sexual themes but no sex.
