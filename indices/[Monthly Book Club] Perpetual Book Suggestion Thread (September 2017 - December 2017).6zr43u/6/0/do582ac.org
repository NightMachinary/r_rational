Thanks for posting a recommendation but it's probably a bit gauche to shill your self-published work that you are charging money for (but thank you for being honest about it!). It looks like the sort of themes that would interest a lot of people here too!

In theory I'd be happy to post novels that were suggested by their authors, but I'd probably prefer it if the novel were offered up for free for a few days (or a coupon code was made available or however Amazon can send review copies) so it didn't look like a money grab, you know?
