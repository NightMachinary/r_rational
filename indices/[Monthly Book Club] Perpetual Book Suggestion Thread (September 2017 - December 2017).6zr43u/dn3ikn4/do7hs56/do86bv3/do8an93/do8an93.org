I'm not really trying to rely on some janky definition of rationality or what is or may be deemed as an irrationalfic. The character doesn't need to become Willy Wonka to prevail in this world or to succeed. He didn't fail because his actions were too orthodox-rational for the setting. He failed because he was chiefly irrational despite the techniques and methodology at his disposal.

As for the solution, I don't want to spoil the fic, which I think is worth reading for the entertainment value alone.
