If you haven't read any of Christopher Nutall's "Schooled in Magic" series, go read it. I am fairly certain that most people on this sub would probably like it a lot. It is my favorite novel series, even more so than HPMOR. Yes it really is that good. The first book in the series only costs $1 as an ebook and there's an audio version too.

I suggested this here before, but iirc a bunch of people who had read the crappy space battles version of the first book jumped on to warn everyone (falsely I might add) that the SiM series sucks and they basically said it was my guilty pleasure or something, and when I tried to explain that the paid version of the series is actually REALLY good no one seemed to believe me and were all like, "I don't want to waste my money too risky" even though it's on Amazon and they should already have known they could try a free sample of the beginning of the book.

Seriously, go read it! :D
