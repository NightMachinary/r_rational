Most people didn't even read the free sample last time because iirc I didn't link it. Now could you please explain to me what exactly makes the sample read like bad fanfiction? I just took another look at it to try to see what you are talking about and I still don't understand how you could say that it is bad writing. I honestly do not believe that the whole sub besides myself would consider the SiM series that bad unless they were looking at the space battles version. It would be one thing if everyone was saying that it's not their cup of tea, but for basically everyone here who comments on it to say it's trash and that the writing quality is awful? I call bullshit. There is no way any sane person would look at SiM and say that it's as poorly written as bad fanfiction. So either you're crazy, or I'm crazy, or you are lying about having read the sample, or you're exaggerating about how badly written you thought it was. I know it's normally considered bad faith to say that, but sometimes there really is no other explanation that makes any sense.

*Edit: I just looked over the sample more carefully. It's not bad but it's not good either. It's been a long time since I read the beginning of the first book, and I forgot that it wasnt as good. Sorry for the stupid crap I said.*
