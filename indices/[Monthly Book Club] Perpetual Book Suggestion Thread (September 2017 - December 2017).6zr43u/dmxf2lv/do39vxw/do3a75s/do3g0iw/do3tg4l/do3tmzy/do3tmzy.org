For the suggestion thread, I was thinking having the monthly recommendation thread include a link to the current book suggestion thread (I dropped the ball this time), and letting the book suggestion thread otherwise just sort of languish in obscurity. Do you think that's a good idea, or do you think there's value in promoting the suggestion thread? Perhaps having the suggestion thread up for the last week of the "month"?

In other words, if I'm trying to post the book club on the 14th, having the suggestion thread from the 7th-14th, new book club from the 14th-7th? The 14th date I'm not going to stick to religiously though because given there's not a thread for each day of the week, I'd rather not post the book club on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays or Saturdays.
