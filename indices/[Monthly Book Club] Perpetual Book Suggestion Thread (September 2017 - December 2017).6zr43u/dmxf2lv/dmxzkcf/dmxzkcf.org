Very thoughtful of you to create a meta thread.\\
I have a few suggestions regarding the format.

#+begin_quote
  Ebook cost
#+end_quote

Perhaps "Availability" would be better: some books are free, and "$0.00" or "Ebook cost: Free" look rather silly, or even misleading.

Unless it's an attempt at subtle manipulation to discourage people from submitting books that aren't available on the Internet, in which case sure, leave it at that.

#+begin_quote
  Why [[/r/rational]] would like it
#+end_quote

"Reasons [[/r/rational]] would like it" would sound more formal.

#+begin_quote
  Any content warnings
#+end_quote

Is "any" necessary? With it dropped, the phrasing would be more formal.

(I also have a penchant for being annoyingly pedantic about some things.)
