RE cost: one of the "conditions" is that the ebook is available, just because it's not feasible for someone to locate and read a book within a month, whereas ebooks are available immediately after purchase. Whether "has to have an ebook" is a good condition is worth discussing probably at the end of the "trial". I hope it doesn't discourage people from suggesting fiction that is available online for free, though!

I've made the other wording suggestions though! Thank you for making them :)
