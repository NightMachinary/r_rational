Any thoughts on Robert Heinlein's "Gulf"? Only a novella, and old, but it has some good points.

Reasons [[/r/rational]] would like it: Interesting take on [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/55148880135/how-smart-is-smart][writing smart characters]]. Doesn't check all the boxes, but does put some thought into it.

Content warnings: Gruesome murder of NPC (writing is not heavy on the grue though).
