That's legitimately pretty incredible. I can't imagine having consumed that book (or any book, for that matter) by listening to morse code, much less transliterating it into morse code.

But no, if I could read 350,000 words in a day, my life would be a lot easier LOL, this was like two weeks ago. I should've recommended it a few days ago when I commented on that other thread, but like I said at the time, no internet at home and I had other things I needed to be doing with the internet at the time than commenting on reddit.
