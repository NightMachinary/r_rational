*Title*: Anna Karenina

*Ebook cost:* Free. [[https://archive.org/stream/annakarenina11tols?ref=ol#page/n7/mode/2up][You can read and/or download it here.]] It's not the best translation, but it's easily accessible, which is convenient.

EDIT: [[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/free_ebooks/Anna_Karenina_NT.pdf][Here's a less attractive version]], but it's the full text, whereas the link above is not. I'm partial to the first one's introduction though, and it also has illustrations.

*Word count:* ~350,000

*Genre:* Literary Realism

*Synopsis:* (From Wikipedia) Anna Karenina is the tragic story of a married aristocrat/socialite and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizing - something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others.

The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time - politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* It's Tolstoy. It's just one of those books that you really ought to read at some point in your life.
