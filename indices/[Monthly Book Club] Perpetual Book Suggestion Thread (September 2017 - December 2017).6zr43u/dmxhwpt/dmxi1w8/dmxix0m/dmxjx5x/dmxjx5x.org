Radiolab is a very popular podcast! Their most [[http://www.radiolab.org/story/radiolab-presents-rough-translation/][recent episode]] (that was released yesterday, hence me thinking you read it) was an episode of a new podcast /Rough Translation/ called "Anna in Somalia". It's about a man in solitary confinement in a Somali prison communicating with his neighbours by tapping on the walls in a home-grown version of morse code. Two years later, one manages to get the guards to let him pick a book out of his personal effects, which is /Anna Karenina/, and the 8 prisoners in the solitary confinement chain tap out the 350,000 words in morse code to each other. It tells the story of how one of the prisoners really related to Anna and her plight and how that affected his life. It was a really wonderful story, and spoke highly of Tolstoy's writing.
