Idk what Radiolab is. I started reading a book called /The Craft of Fiction/ by Percy Lubbock ([[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18961/18961-h/18961-h.htm][which you can read here if you feel so inclined]]) and it was mentioned in the first few pages, so I took a detour and read it before circling back to finish TCoF.

The quote from Lubbock that derailed me was "Of Richardson and Tolstoy and Flaubert we can say at once that their command of life, their grasp of character, *their knowledge of human affections and manners* [emphasis mine], had a certain range and strength and depth..."

I went looking through my mom's books for /Clarissa/ by Samuel Richardson, but I found Anna, so I read Anna instead. Probably for the best, since Clarissa has an estimated word count of 969,000 words. I'll make a point of reading that one after Christmas, but I don't have time for it until then, too many other books I /need/ to read, y'know?
