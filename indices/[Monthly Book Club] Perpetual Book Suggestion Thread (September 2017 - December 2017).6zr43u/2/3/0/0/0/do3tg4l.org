T'was [[/u/eaturbrainz]] this time, not I. I think that there are probably diminishing returns on any discussion thread, though there's probably a lag before people actually finish the book. In the future, I guess I would suggest that we have a clearly defined switch date (with an optional "okay, no one is talking" point, like "no new comments for 10 days"), and then have the two threads crosslink to each other for reasons of promotion and easy of access.
