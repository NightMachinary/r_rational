It might just be me but it seems a bit confusing the way it's arranged right now... Is there any way we could do it more like the biweekly challenge, where there's a stickied "Monthly Book Club: Friendship Is Optimal" thread which has ongoing discussion about the current book in the comments but specifies that Foucault's Pendulum will be the next book, w/ discussion starting Nov 1 (or w/e the date is..)

It could also have a link to this thread, but to me at least it'd much more convenient and encourage more book discussion to have the actual discussion stickied rather than this meta thread.

And thanks for organising it!
