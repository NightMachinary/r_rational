I want this specifically so the other Heroes get to wonder at how eminently reasonable the Black Queen is being. It's harder to think your enemies are pure evil when they're deliberately sparing civilians and banning WMDs and inhumane treatment of sophonts.

This looks exactly like something to get the Heroes to the table in the Liesse Accords. If she demonstrates that agreements made with her are always honored, they should feel much more comfortable with making concessions.
