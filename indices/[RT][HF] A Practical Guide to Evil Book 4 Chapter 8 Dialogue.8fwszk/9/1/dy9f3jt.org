I think it's a reflection of how he has a Good Name but understands Evil Names & the need to choose the lesser evil. Sure, he's still Good but he's had to do his fair share of evil deeds while trying to overcome villains and he isn't as die-hard as most heroes with a Good Name. I'd imagine dealing with the Above for fifty odd years doesn't let you keep the belief that they can only do good deeds - hence the "gray" part to his Name (I'm assuming he transitioned to this name).

Or it could be something else completely. I dunno :)
