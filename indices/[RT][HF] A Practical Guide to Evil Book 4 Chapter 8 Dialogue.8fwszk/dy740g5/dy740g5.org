This. This is what I've wanted since Cat was first given her knife. She is beginning to lay ground rules between heroes and villains, that *both* sides will stomp on if violated. No more Lone Swordsmen *or* Diabolist turning entire cities into graveyards. The battles between Above and Below will be fought by those sworn to Above and Below, not innocent bystanders. Greenskins and Praesi will not be killed or tortured as Willie "city-killer" of Greensborough did.

This is why I love this story.
