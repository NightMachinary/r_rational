  "My teacher dedicated his entire life to breaking this game, but that's a reflection of his flaw -- he can't conceive a world where he doesn't win. I'm willing to settle for the lesser prize. What I can't break, I would /regulate/."

Given that Catherine's initial pair of Break and Take stemmed from her having "something that would use what it could not break and break what it could not use" at her core, and mirrored Black's own Destroy and Conquer respectively, the distinction noted here would probably either diminish her enemies' power on breaking some kind of condition, placing a restriction on both her and the opponents-to-be, or empower her allies when enforcing some kind of pre-established agreement.
