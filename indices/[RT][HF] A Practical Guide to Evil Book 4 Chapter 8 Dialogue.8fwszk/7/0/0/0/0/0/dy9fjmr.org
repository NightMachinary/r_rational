Well, the quotes from future memoirs and treatises suspiciously don't mention her Name, they only call her Foundling (and refer to her in past tense). A Watsonian explanation for that would be that she'd have transitioned by then and her close friends (including Juniper and Aisha, who wrote those) would have already be more accustomed to her name than to her new Name.

A Doylist one would be either that the author doesn't want to reveal her future Name, or that she loses her Name instead of a proper transition. Either way, in the prologue she seemed to rely more on her fairy powers (portals, rebuilding the cunstruct of her body, glamour) than on her Name tricks (shadow spears and panes).
