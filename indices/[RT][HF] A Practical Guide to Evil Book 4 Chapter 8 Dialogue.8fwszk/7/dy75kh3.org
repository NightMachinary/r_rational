  I'm willing to settle for the lesser prize. What I can't break, I would regulate.

Nice callback. I don't think we're getting Break and Regulate Aspects this time, but if the terms hold, this may well turn into an invasion story instead of a proper Crusade.

Of cource, given the fact that Princes' Graveyard will still hapen despite Catherine's oath about sparing officers, I'm somewhat gleefully awaiting the good guys fucking this up.

EDIT: Nevermind, the terms they discussed were about /prisoner/ exchanges, not about refraining from targeting /officers/, both Headsman and targeting princes are very much in the cards.
