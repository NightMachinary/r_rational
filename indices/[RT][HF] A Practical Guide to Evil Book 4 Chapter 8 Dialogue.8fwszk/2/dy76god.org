Dude holy shit, this was Blacks end game in a sense. He got what he wanted at least for now. Evil fucking won, Cat being an Evil Queen of Callow is changing eon old narrative, no wonder why Black was supportive of her and fine with letting her take the throne, even offering his help. This was what he wanted all along way back in the earlier books when he said he wanted evil to win, this is so fucking cool. Callow has always been good but now its evil god damn black be playing 5d chess.
