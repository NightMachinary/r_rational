Yeah, and if this particular demon of Absence was indeed the one that ate the Ninth Crusade, it would have salvaged at least whatever troops were posessed by the mage-taking firefly devils.

It wasn't intentional, but retreating so the Hell Egg would be in he midst of the crusading army may pay off. Or it may just disappear the whole barony. Depends on how well the heroes prepare, really.
