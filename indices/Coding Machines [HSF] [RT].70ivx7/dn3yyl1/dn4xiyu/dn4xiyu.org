It is possible to probabilistically circumvent at KTH, by layering interpreters.

Write a C compiler in Haskell, a Haskell compiler in LISP, a LISP interpreter in Python, and a Python interpreter in C. Compile the Python interpreter with the dirty C compiler, run the LISP in the Python interpreter, run the Haskell compiler in the LISP interpreter, and compile the C compiler with that.

The resulting C compiler is most likely clean, since the initial C compiler otherwise has to contain a pattern match for inspecting through Python, LISP, and Haskell. This takes a lot of code, which takes up a lot of space, which makes the initial dirty C compiler very big --- a clear warning sign.

Small compilers contain simple KTH's, so layer your interpreters to get clean binaries.
