I'm disappointed that they didn't jump into checking the processors, there are overlaps on "undocumented" instructions between intell and amd that sound like cia bullshit, maybe just maybe they should have checked if any of the code runs differently on emulators to the real hardware that is not a known bug or intentional gap in documentation
