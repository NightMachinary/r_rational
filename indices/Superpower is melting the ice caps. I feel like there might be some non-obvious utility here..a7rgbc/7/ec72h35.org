Is it 10x before or after other climate forcings? Right now the ice caps melt in the summer and then re-freeze in the winter and the latter is slightly less impressive than the former statistically so the trend is a slow year-over-year loss of ice on a graph with a long enough time horizon.

If the melting is simply ten times higher, and the freezing remains precisely as strong as it is now, then the Arctic is ice free /this/ summer and potentially year-round in perpetuity. At a similar rate the Antarctic will be ice-free in a few years at most. Greenland and Antarctica will be reduced to a few stubborn glaciers within a matter of decades.

So the non-obvious utility is that the world will finally take global warming seriously, just as civilization collapses under coastal flooding and complete polar weather chaos.
