While you could interpret the question as talking about all polar ice caps, or just earth's specifically those are really the only grammatically plausible interpretations and the latter is very obviously what was intended and a much more plausible interpretation (if it meant all polar ice caps it would have said "all" instead of "the").\\
Plus it only works to accelerate polar ice caps which are already melting as per the description, limiting usefulness.
