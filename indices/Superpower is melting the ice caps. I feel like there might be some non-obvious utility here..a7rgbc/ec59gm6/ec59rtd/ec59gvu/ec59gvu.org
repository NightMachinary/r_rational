The problem with this idea - the critical flaw that limits the utility hugely - is you can't control the consequences if the power is as described. If your power melts all caps equally and raises sea level everywhere evenly the power is by definition more destructive than constructive. Like radiation for medical treatment would be if you have no control of where it goes. The lack of specificity is the flaw.
