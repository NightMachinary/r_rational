If it speeds up /any and all/ melting of the ice caps equally, then you can use it to build power stations based on heating polar ice. The rate of heat production is increased by a factor of 10, so you have a self-sustaining energy source that works incredibly efficiently.

(Once this energy source replaces all other non-renewable energy sources, the polar ice caps will no longer naturally melt on their own*, so the factor-10 increase is not a problem.

*ignoring runaway process effects**

**also not a particularly convincing claim since natural melting is only balanced by freezing, so multiplying one and keeping the other unchanged offsets the zero-point

Well, whatever, free energy matters more than a little silly flooding. :P)
