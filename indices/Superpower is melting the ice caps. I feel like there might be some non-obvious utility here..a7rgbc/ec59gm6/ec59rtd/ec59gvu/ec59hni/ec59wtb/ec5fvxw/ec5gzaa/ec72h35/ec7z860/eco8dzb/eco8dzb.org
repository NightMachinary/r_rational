If you can do it to specific parts of the icecaps you could work in research. Ex. ice cores and cheaply drill to examine lake Vostok. You could also work as an icebreaker for an icebreaker ship. If you have icecap senses in order to melt them you could track icecap melting. If you don't have a range limited to earth you could tell people what nearby planets have icecaps and whether they are melting. If it applies to any planet you are on then you could go on a mission to examine Europa and see if it has an ocean with life.

Once you get bored of that, you can go the insane supervillain route and threaten to melt the icecaps unless your list of demands are met. Lose any pursuers who try to bring you to justice in the endless tunnels and fallback bases you have channeled deep into the greenland icecap. With these powers it can't end any other way. Take a few potshots at svalbard or the antarctic to make them think you aren't bluffing. I suggest demanding one BILLION dollars.
