It depends on how the superpower works. If it works by generating heat to melt the ice caps it could easily be used to generate heat elsewhere which could be exceedingly useful. If it worked by turning any amount of ice-> water directly things would be tougher, but still doable. I'm not sure what exactly, but I'm sure that there would be some industrial uses out there that would benefit from being able to instantly flash melt water for no cost.

If it only works by directly turning iceburg size quantities of ice->water it would be impossible to use for good. It could be used for profit by sticking hydroelectric generators at the base of an iceburg then just melting it all over a day, but while that would generate energy and money it would be amazingly horrible for the planet.

The one /real/ use would be terraforming other planets. Go over on the next flight to mars and you could melt the ice caps over and over to significantly increase the global temperature and help form an atmosphere.
