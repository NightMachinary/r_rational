So what you're saying is... This superpower is kinda shitty?

Jokes aside, thank you for giving this much thought to the pros and cons of this power. I'm the OP of the post in [[/r/shittysuperpowers][r/shittysuperpowers]] and, though this is my first trip to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I personally would love to see more crossover episodes between these two subs.

Thanks to you all for giving serious consideration to some of the bullshit we come up with over there.
