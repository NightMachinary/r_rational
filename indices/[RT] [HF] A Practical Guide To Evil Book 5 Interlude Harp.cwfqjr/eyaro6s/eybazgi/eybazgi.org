The first one is interesting in the context of the fact that it's supposed to be related to the fairies Mavii were bargaining with. Beyond the general vulnerability to iron, we've seen Kilian make bindings for the barrier in Marchford from iron spikes (and also holly and apple tree). The curious part is “and rope to kill”, since the only connection that comes to mind is the hanging of a seven princes and one, which also happens to be the number of royals in Arcadia at the start of a season (and probably is the reason why there is a need for eight abdications to start up a Court in a fresh domain).

However, candle and harp were beholden, not gifted, so the readier haven't seen those yet might be because they aren't the methods available to mortals, but rather something glimpsed in Arcadia back then. Maybe they're related to glamour stuff, who knows.

To not derail the thread, I'll make a guess that the if first entreaty is about the means of containment that were gifted to Mavii, and the second describes the powers of either the giver or the far in question, then the third may have an instruction about the offerings that can be exchanged for the benefits of those powers. Perhaps there are going to be currencies used in the actual bargain, or we'll find out where the Callowan custom to appease the fairies with bread and milk came from.
