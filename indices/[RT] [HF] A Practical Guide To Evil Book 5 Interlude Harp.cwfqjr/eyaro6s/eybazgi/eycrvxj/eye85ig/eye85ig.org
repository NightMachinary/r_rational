  However, candle and harp were beholden, not gifted, so the readier haven't seen those yet might be because they aren't the methods available to mortals, but rather something glimpsed in Arcadia back then. Maybe they're related to glamour stuff, who knows.

"Beholden" doesn't mean "seen." It means "bound," or, more commonly, "indebted."
