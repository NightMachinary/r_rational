Oh yes, for shame, that is just so unfortunate...ly convenient for the narrative arc. And you're blindsided by your personal hatred, Balthazar: this has to fit in a Story of some sort. Which means the Bard is likely pulling Scribe's strings here.

Yeah, it's *Bad*.

(Edit) Close enough, Bard was indeed involved, but she was trying to manipulate Cordelia through Agnes, and it backfired spectacularly :)
