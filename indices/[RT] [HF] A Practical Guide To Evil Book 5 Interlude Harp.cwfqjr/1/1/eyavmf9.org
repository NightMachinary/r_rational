I'm pretty sure Mercy doesn't want their prodigal sons fancy alliance to fall apart. I'm also fairly sure that the choirs in general don't want the Grand Alliance to fall apart on the eve of war with Keter. I guess we'll just have to see if the choir of justice is okay with all of that because they're more in favour of a bunch of corrupt ambitious people who are lying about demon summoning in order to burn down a portion of the city.

Playing into the hands of a villain to destroy the bulwark against Keter seems like an odd thing for Justice to do in general. I feel like Hanno is going to start executing a bunch of priests.
