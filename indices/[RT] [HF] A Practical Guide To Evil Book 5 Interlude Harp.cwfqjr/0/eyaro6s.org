So that explains where these chapter names are coming from:

- Interlude: Iron
- Interlude: Rope
- Interlude: Candle
- Interlude: Harp

  “First, gifted:\\
  Iron to bind\\
  And rope to kill.”\\
  -First of the three so-called ‘Mavian Entreaties', found on raised stones across much of eastern and Procer

  “Second, beholden:\\
  Candle to blind\\
  And harp to still.”\\
  -- Second of the three so-called ‘Mavian Entreaties'
