I had a January term class in college that was all about that book. January term is the thing that some colleges have where you have a single class for a whole month rather than taking four or five classes over a semester. So we'd spend a day or two on each of the chapters, talking about them for several hours each. It was one of my favorite classes I took, though there was nothing particularly practical about it.

Though I think that if I reread it now I would just say, "Well duh" to a lot of it, since I've now read so much of the material that came from it. Sort of the same phenomenon as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny][Seinfeld Is Unfunny]].
