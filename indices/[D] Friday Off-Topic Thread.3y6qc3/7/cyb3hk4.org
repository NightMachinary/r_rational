I got /Godel, Escher, Bach/ for Christmas (and a second Hofstadter book called /Metamagical Themas/, which I suspect I won't get to until much later).

Is anyone else starting to read it? It would be great to have a reading/discussion buddy. I remember there was an attempt at a community read through here last year that seemed like fun.
