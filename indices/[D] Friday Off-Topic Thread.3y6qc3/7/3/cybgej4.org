I started reading it a few years ago. At one point early in the book, it describes this puzzle and challenges the reader to solve it. So, being someone who enjoys puzzles, I thought I'd give it a shot.

At first look, the puzzle seemed unsolvable- but since the book heavily implied that there was a solution, I figured I must be missing something. What followed was an hour of struggling to figure out how such an apparently unsolvable puzzle could in fact have a solution, and feeling like an idiot.

Eventually, I gave up and went back to the book, only to find that the very next page opened with something like "Ha, ha! Bet you thought that puzzle had a solution. Actually, it's unsolvable!"

At that point, I was too annoyed to keep reading, and I never did find the energy to pick it up again.
