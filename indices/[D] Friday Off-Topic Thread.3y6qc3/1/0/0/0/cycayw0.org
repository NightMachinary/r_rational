I'm confused as to why you said "seems to be". What exactly is the event? Didn't you attend it?

Also, why does a rationalist community seek to worship a ball of gas? Is it just an excuse to group together and socialize (which is fine) or is there some other inherent significance (which may or may not be fine, depending)
