I started reading Polyhistor Academy a few days ago (It's been posted on here, which is where I found out about it). It's about a university of magic where murder is allowed and only 10% of the students are allowed to survive to graduate. I'm one semester into the story and I don't see why anyone would send their kid there if they didn't just want an abortion 19 years after conception, but if you just set that aside it's entertaining. No idiot balls so far, and the forum readers get to vote on lots of decisions, from which classes to attend to hobbies to independent magical research. They have been wise enough to make the MC learn how to magically make himself better at learning, and have seemingly maxed 'learning speed' in just over one semester. Sadly, they also spend like half the MC's time painting, which gives them some illusion magic and the chance to flirt with second best girl. Clearly a better choice would be to let the mad shark toothed doctor install interesting upgrades and get the chemistry teacher best girl with a crush on him to secretly teach him advanced magical chemistry.
