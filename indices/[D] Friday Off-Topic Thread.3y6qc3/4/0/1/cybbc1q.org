Sorry, don't think it's in one piece anywhere, and it's still ongoing. It also requires an account (free), which is why it took me so long to give it a try. The link to the table of contents is [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/][here]], though you need to make an account to see it. It links to all the chapters, so at least there is no need to crawl through old forum threads.
