You can covert to mobi/epub from nearly any source with the FanFicFare Plugin in Calibre. I found this interesting, and I also like to lounge, so I grabbed a copy.

I uploaded it [[http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=31934790331961111069][here]] as it took almost 30 minutes for the story to download. Story is 568,000 words long, not the longest, but it is up there.
