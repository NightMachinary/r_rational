I am more confused by the lack of violence the other kids seem to give. If I was going there I'd get whoever my parents were to make me a nuke before I came along, and in that opening assembly where every student was gathered just nuke it. Then you can sail through the rest of the things with the only requirement being the minimum pass grade.

Can't remember where I was (pg 100+ in the forum) in but I've put it to the side for a while, the growing feeling of missing information by only reading the story updates and using the forum as a reading interface was becoming a pain.
