Reposting this because it probably wasn't seen and I think it's interesting.

Check out this paper about quantitative style features of more and less successful literary works: [[http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D13/D13-1181.pdf]] I am most surprised by the fact that more successful books are found to use more prepositions. Does that resonate with the wisdom of the writers here?
