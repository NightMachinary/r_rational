Their most successful metric was unigrams (basically, word choice).

  Interestingly, less successful books rely on verbs that are explicitly descriptive of actions and emotions (e.g., “wanted”, “took”, “promised”, “cried”, “cheered”, etc.), while more successful books favor verbs that describe thought-processing (e.g., “recognized”, “remembered”), and verbs that serve the purpose of quotes and reports (e.g,. “say”). Also, more successful books use discourse connectives and prepositions more frequently, while less successful books rely more on topical words that could be almost cliche, e.g., “love”, typical locations, and involve more extreme (e.g., “breathless”) and negative words (e.g., “risk”).

A lot of this is just "show, don't tell", which is the very first rule that you hear if you're a novice writer walking into Creative Writing 101. You don't say, "John wanted the bread," you describe how John is hungry and express his desire in other ways. It's basically the same reason that you're supposed to avoid adverbs. I sort of think this might be why prepositions are so favored; they represent markers for time and place, manipulations of other words.

The finding that increased readability is not correlated with success is also not too surprising to me, mostly because readability comes with tradeoffs in terms of prose style and sentence complexity. I think I would have liked them to separate that out into a graph that measures readability against success, but they only say "increasing readability decreases success", so my guess that there's a trade-off is pure speculation.

I don't know, I don't think quantitative analysis at this level is all that useful because of all the confounding variables involved, which is probably why most previous attempts were qualitative.
