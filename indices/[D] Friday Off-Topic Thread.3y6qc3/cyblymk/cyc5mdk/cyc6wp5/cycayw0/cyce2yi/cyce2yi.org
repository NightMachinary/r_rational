I attended one, but it wasn't identical to all others: we customized somewhat.

And the accusation of paganism is just me being way harsh on seasonal holidays, due to being Jewish and thus conditioned to view all nature-centered celebrations as idolatrous. We only had /two/ things in our service that made /vague/ reference to the concept of a sun-god, and everyone was actually secular. This is as opposed to singing a whole song listing off mythologies about the sun and solstice before reaching our modern scientific understanding.
