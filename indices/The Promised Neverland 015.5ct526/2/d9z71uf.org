I wonder what Emma would even do if she knew what Ray is trying? She was 'pissed' this chapter at Ray, but she still wants to save everybody. So her options are limited.

Maybe on the day of the escape she'll make Ray go along with the escape whether he wants to or not, making it impossible for him to back out? If she takes away his ability to choose sides, then he'll have to help her with her plan no matter how impossible it is or how much he doesn't like it, because it's his only option.

I don't really know what she could do to put him into that situation though.
