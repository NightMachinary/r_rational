The translator for this series has commented that they're getting tired of translating it, here: [[http://mangastream.com/r/wsjac/%2322/3795/3]]

I don't think the author is enjoying the series as much as we are. If they drop it, I hope we can find someone willing to translate for us. This has seriously been a highlight of my weeks for a couple months now.
