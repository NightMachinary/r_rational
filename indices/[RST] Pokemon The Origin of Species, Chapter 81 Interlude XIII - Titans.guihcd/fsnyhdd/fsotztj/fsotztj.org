I imagine the Lake Guardians of Sinnoh this way, as well as the "fairy" mythics (Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, Shaymin, etc, the term existed before Fairy did as a type), as well as the Swords of Justice in Unova and the Tapus in Alola. Also probably the sword and shield dogs?

In a sense these are actually "neutral" by the way they don't cause massive destruction, but in that sense Ho-oh and Lugia fit the bill too. It's hard to justify actual "helpful" pokemon because that implies some level of sapience, unless they just have a passive positive effect, which is how I imagine pokemon like Xerneas working. My headcanon for the Swords is something like "they seek out powerful opponents" which is why there are stories of them only ever fighting rampaging, powerful pokemon, rather than killing humans.
