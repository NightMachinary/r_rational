Yeah that's kind of what I meant by "neutral" more than anything. I see the the Tapu in specific as being fiercely territorial of certain areas, which leads to instances like that, while not actively rampaging generally, and also defending the islands from sufficiently powerful invaders, leading to people would worshipping them as (fickle) guardian spirits.
