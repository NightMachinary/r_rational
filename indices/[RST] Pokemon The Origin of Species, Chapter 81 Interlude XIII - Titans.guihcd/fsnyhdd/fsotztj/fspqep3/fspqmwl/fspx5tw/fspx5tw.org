True, sapience itself would be too big a departure. A more realistic situation could be the protagonists coming across a Pokemon without a trainer they're unable to immediately catch (for whatever reason) but isn't immediately hostile, which an encounter with one of the "fairy" legendaries would maybe provide. I'd be curious to see the different reactions from Red, Blue, and Leaf, and potential discussions from each of their points of view, because it seems like it'd be an unusual situation within the context of this world.
