We get a little of that in this chapter actually with the latis. Its been stated before that the only real problem with them is if they break the sound barrier too close to settlements. Otherwise they seem to have a thriving taxi business transporting 10 year olds to battlefields. In the games, legendaries are also split into two categories: those in the game and those gifted at events. The latter ones are called the mythics (mew, celebii, darkrai, arceus, keldeo, etc). It seems daystar is more or less following that trend where the gift legendaries are the fairy tale pokemon and the in game legendaries are the force of nature pokemon. The only legendary group that might break this trend is probably the lake trio since their lore is closer in feel to that of the mythical pokemon.
