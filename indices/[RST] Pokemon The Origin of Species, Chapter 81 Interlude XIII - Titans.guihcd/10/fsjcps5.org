Amazing chapter. Initially I was disappointed to see an interlude right after last chapter's cliffhanger, but reading about the events in Hoenn definitely works as a substitute.

I won't lie, after this I'd be incredibly interested in seeing more of the protagonists from other regions. If you decide not to elaborate much more on them, I'd be expecting a few metafics to pop up down the line.
