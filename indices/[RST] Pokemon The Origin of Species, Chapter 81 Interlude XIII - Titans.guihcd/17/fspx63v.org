The problems of Kanto and Johto look almost quaint by comparison to the problems the Hoenn team seems to be dealing with! I love how interconnected the regions feel in this story, which makes me curious how the main team will fair once things start kicking off in Sinnoh... EDIT: Oh wait, I think the Sinnoh events start around the Lake of Rage incident in Johto, so maybe not.
