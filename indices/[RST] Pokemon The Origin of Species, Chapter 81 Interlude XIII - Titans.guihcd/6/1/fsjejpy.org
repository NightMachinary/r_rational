So the Lake Trio seemed like the most likely legendaries to be non-destructive? Or at least non-walking-disasters. One thing I've been very aware of whenever I mention other regions is that, if people want to write OoS-fanfics in other regions, I don't want to stomp on too many of their own ideas for how things would work/go (this chapter in particular was hard to write because of picking up a story so close to the end without focusing on any of the major characters).

I know Hoenn introduced the titans, but they were locked in caves. Since Regigigas is in Sinnoh, and to awaken him you have to bring all the regis to his location, /and/ there are regis in Sinnoh as well, the way I'm envisioning it is that there's actually multiple regis, and if Regigigas in sinnoh rises during "the Sinnnoh story" it'll be because the ones there converged on its location. Whether that means there's a Regigigas in every region that has titans, I'm less sure. Maybe it can just be formed anywhere that the titans are awake?

In any case, this is the event that causes the titans in Hoenn to wake up, so ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Couldn't think of a way to work it into the weather trio before/during other than them trying to fight Groudon and Kyogre, but that seemed like it would take too much away from them being each-other's fated enemies.
