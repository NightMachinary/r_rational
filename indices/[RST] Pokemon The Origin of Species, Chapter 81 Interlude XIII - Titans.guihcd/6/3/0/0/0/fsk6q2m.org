He has them, but he seems to have discovered the minerals. Ee dont know anything really about them or where he got them. But he also doesnt seem to be aware of their capability to Mega Evolve yet.

He may have discovered it during his studies of evolutionary stomes and may tie it to a specfici pokemon, but I feel pile if he discovered mega evplution, people would know.
