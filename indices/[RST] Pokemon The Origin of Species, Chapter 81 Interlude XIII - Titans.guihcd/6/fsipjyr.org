I liked this chapter overall, even though I have some problems with Magma and Aqua being dumbly evil. I guess Giovanni as mafia boss was a realistic evil mastermind, and Archie and Max are the most unrealistic of the entire series. Really liked Steven chacterization, also Phoebe and Drake. Cant wait to see Brendan and May and Rayquaza.

Also, the Sinnoh titans are the Regis? I had though them to be Hoenn's, Sinnoh's trio being the Lake one, which would be pretty cool.
