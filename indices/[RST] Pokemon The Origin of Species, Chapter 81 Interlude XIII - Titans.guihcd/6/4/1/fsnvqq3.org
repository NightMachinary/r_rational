We have Aiko encountering Ho-oh, which is implied to be the missing Spring-time Stormbringer. Aiko and all the other pokemon on the ranch experience the Pressure. Sadly she never told anyone before she got herself killed :(

In the anime, spotting Ho-oh is what happened to Ash (minus the Pressure, which isn't a thing in the Anime). It was a little weird, cause it happened in the first episode when the Gen 2 games weren't even out yet.
