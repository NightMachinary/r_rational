The legend where Ho-oh returns 3 pok√©mon to life to create the Legendary Beasts takes place 150 years before the events of the games, in what is now only known as the Burned Tower.

They only appear after a certain point in the game but it's more for gameplay reasons; narratively, it's vaguely implied they took an interest in the player character as a potential trainer (like most legendaries across the series) but they weren't "dormant" before you "woke" them in any direct sense
