Of course, in fanfiction, anything can happen; if an author chose to interpret the Burned Tower sequence from the games as "kid exploring abandoned ruins stumbles into hibernating lions' den, accidentally unleashes hell on earth where previously there was none," it wouldn't be /that/ much of a stretch.

Keep in mind that in the original canon, the Legendary Birds wait patiently for you to confront them in their roosts, and the whole Stormbringer thing is, if not /entirely/ original to OoS, a deliberate and well-reasoned departure for the sake of drama and education in risk assessment.
