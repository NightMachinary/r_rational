BEST. CHAPER. EVER

Yes I am a Hoenn baby. I was lucky enough to experience gen 3 as a kid, so my imagination made everything greater. But it never EVER came close to this level of disaster. I don't think words could explain how this chapter makes me feel, a deep part of my mind finally watching its childish adventures adquire the size and horrifying terror they should inspire. I feel like... like justice has finally been made for Hoenn.

I am so happy right now. My only regret is that we don't have a whole book of this. Bias aside, the story of brendam and the others looks much more interesting, they even got latios and latias! And wally is with them! And bias inside, you even sort of confirmed mega evolution!
