So there are definitely hints that this is more ORAS than RS mostly from the whole riding of Latias/os, the emotionless girl running with Team Magma, the pirate reference in regards to Team Aqua, the Mega-stone-element-type-things, also the teams having the right orbs and the legendary they're associated with getting larger within a visible timespan is probably foreshadowing it's primal reversion. The whole Groudon and Kyogre conflict thing being "solved" in canon by rayquaza is less than encouraging in the general sense. I really think it's funny that where our group of Red, Blue and Leaf got stalled by the appearance of a Mobile Disaster Legendary that Brandon, May and Wally weren't stopped and that their plot speed progression went apace which leaves their climax months of time in advance.

Also nods to the fact that Dark-trainers cannot be teleported (yet) which is internally consistent and appreciated. Also small island is probably mirage island, Birch isn't a former trainer from his being tree-ed by a route one mon which in this canon was much more of an actual threat and less of a joke in context. I also appreciate that Groudon is literally hot enough to burn through/sublimate the ozone layer above it.

Also Mewtwo is riding along with Kawabata which means the AI has officially breached containment and may the basilisk have mercy upon them all.
