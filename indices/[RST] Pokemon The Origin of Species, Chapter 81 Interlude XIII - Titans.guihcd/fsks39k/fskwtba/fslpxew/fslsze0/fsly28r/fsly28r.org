It's certainly possible. I still feel wierd in retrospect that like N is running around and while Leaf isn't the opposing hero that like Reshiram and Zekrom aren't like the big ticket legendaries of Unova. I mean even within the canon of Alola like the Tapus are just a force of nature and it's hard to ascribe either malevolence or benevolence to them. Like even StormBringers are explicitly compared to like giant storms and it's hard to imagine a force like choosing */now/* to intervene minus like explicitly a force of i dunno stasis or something? I mean it kinda does give Lugia a counter theme to Ho-oh's rebirth if it's stasis in contrast.

Edit: like yeah no it seems like most of the box art legendary mons are either secluded or outright sealed, but like it's even wierder to think that anything could seal them. Or that say Reshiram and Zekrom would be forgotten given their place in history. Also calling it now that AZ's weapon weakened the non-active Legendaries or like made it so that they were dormant till now.
