I mean that's possible but like we've never seen any legendary that was willing to help people I wasn't sure that we could even count it as a possibility. It does make some sense that in general Rayquaza is the force that balances Groudon and Kyogre, but like we don't have the same kind of benevolent Legendary context of most other canons. I mean even a neutral would probably be good enough in this situation but like i'm not convinced that Rayquaza doesn't just still the air around it to the point that even getting near it suffocates you. At the same time Brendan and May riding the Lati-twins so it could go either way.
