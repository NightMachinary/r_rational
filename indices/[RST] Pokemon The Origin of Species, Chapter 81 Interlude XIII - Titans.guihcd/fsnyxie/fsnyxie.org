I like that Groudon and the Big Aquarium Fish don't seem to have Pressure (consistent with the games, too!). If only so we can see Prof. Oak fight again.

The truce with the +villains+ renegades gives me Worm-vibes, but it's not like Stormbringers aren't obviously similar in concept to the Endbringers. I like it, especially because these two friends are very much more so in the end-bringing business.
