I'm also curious about this. Don't the 3 Regi's call Hoenn their home? I also assumed they'd be sleeping, perhaps even moreso than the weather trio... But then, who would wander and wreak havoc on Sinnoh? Darkrai and Cresselia? The Lake Trio? Surely the Creation gang slumbers as well.... Maybe Sinnoh is as safe as Hoenn (or it was, anyways...)

Come to think of it, most legendaries start the series comatose and are brought to life. Makes you wonder how many of these plots overlap; obviously gens 1 and 3 are occuring. We heard rumour of Giovanni's son, Silver, implying that perhaps gen 2 plot is underway, or just being setup to start after gen 1. But then who woke the Dogs? Or where they 'always' active, like the Birds?
