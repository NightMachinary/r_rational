  One thing I've been very aware of whenever I mention other regions is that, if people want to write OoS-fanfics in other regions, I don't want to stomp on too many of their own ideas for how things would work/go

Reading your story /always/ makes me want to write my own OoS fanfic, so I'm happy to see you've considered it!

Also I just want to take this opportunity to say I love your writing, even outside of OoS. Thank you so much for taking time to do so!
