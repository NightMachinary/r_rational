It also reflects the flaws of rational enemies without trust. Archie seems to have betrayed Maxie. This means Maxie cant trust not to betray him again. Archie knows this and cannot trust Maxie either.

This lack of trust causes the prisoner's dilemna. Each is worried about the other getting the Titan, thus needs to get it first. Each is worried about the ideology they believe the other holds that surely endangers the world. While in reality they each are likely not as extreme.

Also in the Manga, Maxie was a bit more altruistic, while Archie was a complete monster.

It also doesnt help that Giovonni is involved somehow as a wildcard.
