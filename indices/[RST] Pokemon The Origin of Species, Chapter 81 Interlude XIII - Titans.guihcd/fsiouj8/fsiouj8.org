So this is what an outside context problem feels like. You go around having an adventure in Kanto. There's some ecounters with the storm birds, and they are terrifying but at least a known quantity. There's mysterious renegade plots afoot. A hidden conspiracy to create a manmade pok√©mon that you might be let in on because of your special psycic abilities. There's many plotlines going on, but every day you and your friends learn more and grow stronger, hoping to make a difference in the world.

Then it all ends because some idiots down in Hoenn played around with forces they couldn't control and you die in an earthquake, crshed by debris. Or maybe survive, but only due to dumb luck. You're not even getting involved later on, there's some other kids having their own adventure who are working on it. Because not everything in the world revolves around you, and the planet is filled with lots of people all living their own lives and being the protagonists of their own stories.

But hey, maybe you find a secret team rocket base in a basement and fight the secret evil boss and get some magic ghost goggles and everything works out somehow. Who knows, it might happen.
