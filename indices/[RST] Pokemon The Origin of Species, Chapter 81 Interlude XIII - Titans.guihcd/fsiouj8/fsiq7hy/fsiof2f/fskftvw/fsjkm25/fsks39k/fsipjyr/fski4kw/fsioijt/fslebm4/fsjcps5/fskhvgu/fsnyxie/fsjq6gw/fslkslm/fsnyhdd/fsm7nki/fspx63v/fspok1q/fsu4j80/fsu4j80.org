At first I wondered if Steven's confusion over Tabitha being male or female was a rib on his name being feminine. But on retrospect, maybe that's a somewhat sexist notion. I guess it's a rib on his cartoonish character design then? With his non-gender-conforming name just a point of additional confusion for later, if poor Steven tries to follow up on that train of thought.

Another point of curiosity: Brendan, May and Wally had other companions with them? In a way it makes sense, since breaking into a renegade hideout is something you probably should have numbers for, but Birch's PoV didn't indicate he was aware their group was bigger than the main three, like it would if he thought to get around the "glitch" by locating where Brendan and May's friends are clustered...unless the "other trainers he's keeping tabs on" passage specifically meant he was trying exactly that? (I actually thought the extra members could have been Latios and Latias, since in some stories they're depicted as being able to shapeshift into/create illusions of humans - but probably not, considering what was said elsewhere in this comments page, about pokemon with sapience breaking the setting.)

Another thing this comments page enlightened me to: the Pokemon games apparently have a canonical ordering, where Gen I and III takes place at approximately the same time. So the awakening of two of the Weather Trio here wasn't /just/ a matter of unfortunate coincidence wrecking the floor of Celadon casino's floors and presumably some of Team Rocket's secrecy along with it, huh.

Further random thoughts: high-profile Dark trainers like Sidney and Karen seem to consistently favour Dark pokemon...or maybe it's the opposite, and Dark pokemon, at a high enough level, tend to come under Dark trainers. Either way, that's probably not helping the perception of Dark trainers being attracted to Dark pokemon. Also, looking back, it probably should seem odd that everyone refers to Norman by first name and Birch by last name, and only doesn't by virtue of the fact those are the only names for them that we know. From an in-universe perspective though...is Birch's first name something really embarrassing? That might explain why even a (presumably) close friend like Norman refers to Birch via last name. Well, the alternative is that Norman is just strict enough in character that he refers to most people by last name...but nah, the idea that Birch's first name is embarrassing it too amusing.

Not sure if the next chapter's going to be another interlude to finish off the side-story in Hoenn, or we're heading straight back to Kanto to see how things are going down under the Celadon casino, but looking forward to it regardless.
