  At first I wondered if Steven's confusion over Tabitha being male or female was a rib on his name being feminine. But on retrospect, maybe that's a somewhat sexist notion. I guess it's a rib on his cartoonish character design then? With his non-gender-conforming name just a point of additional confusion for later, if poor Steven tries to follow up on that train of thought.

I'm basically treating them as genderqueer/non-binary, if not outright trans, due to the translation error of their name, and yeah their new appearance is fairly androgynous.

As for other characters like Norman and Birch, I tend to cobble together names from their Japanese and English ones, so if one of them is missing it's just easier to treat them like the kind of person everyone refers to by their first/pseudonym (gym leaders) or their surname (most professors... who also might just be using pseudonyms, because goddamn are there a lot of plant-based Professors somehow)
