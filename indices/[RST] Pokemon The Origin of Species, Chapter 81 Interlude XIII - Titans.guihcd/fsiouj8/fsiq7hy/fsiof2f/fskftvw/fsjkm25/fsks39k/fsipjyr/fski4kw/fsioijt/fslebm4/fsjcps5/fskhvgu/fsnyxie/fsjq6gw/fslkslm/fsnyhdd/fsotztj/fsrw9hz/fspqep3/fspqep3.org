Interesting, I would've thought that some level of sapience could have been something separating the "fairy" legendaries from the rest of the Pokemon species, though without that it further highlight's Mewtwo's uniqueness. Perhaps this is just coming from a personal desire to see the protagonists team up with powerful yet independent Pokemon a la the 5th Pokemon movie (or really any other Pokemon movie come to think of it), or the idea of hidden forces of (mostly) good acting in secret or being able to be awakened or called on.
