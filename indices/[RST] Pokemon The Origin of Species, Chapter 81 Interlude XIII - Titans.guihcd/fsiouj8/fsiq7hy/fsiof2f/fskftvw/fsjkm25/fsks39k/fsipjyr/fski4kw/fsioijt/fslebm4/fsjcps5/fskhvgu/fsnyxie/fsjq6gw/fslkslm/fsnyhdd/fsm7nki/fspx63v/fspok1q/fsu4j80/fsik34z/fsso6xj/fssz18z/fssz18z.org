1: Since Ultra Beasts apparently aren't quite "legendaries" of their own world and don't even have a BST of 600, I would basically treat them like very powerful but not godly pokemon, on par with pokemon like Snorlax or even the pseudo-legendaries, despite their lower stats.

2: Congrats! And... maybe! :D
