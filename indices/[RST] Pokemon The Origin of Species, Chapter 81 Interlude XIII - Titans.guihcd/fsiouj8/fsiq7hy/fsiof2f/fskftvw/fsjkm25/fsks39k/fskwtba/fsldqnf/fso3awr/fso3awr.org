The sky pillar and mirage island are not the same.

In the games, the sky pillar has the crumbling floor you need to bike the really fast, and in the manga, it requires two people (one adult sized and child sized) working together to traverse. In both, it is an enormous tower with powerful pokemon that Rayquaza sleeps at the top of.

Mirage island, on the other hand, is an island that only appears under rare circumstances. In the game, it's the only way to get the wynaut line and a rare type of berry, and has no impact on the plot. In the manga, time alternates between flowing quickly and slowly, and it's somewhat sheilded from the outside world; as such, it's where Ruby and Sapphire practice teamwork to take down Kyogre and Groudon while Steven Stone uses the Regi trio to stall them in sootopolis.
