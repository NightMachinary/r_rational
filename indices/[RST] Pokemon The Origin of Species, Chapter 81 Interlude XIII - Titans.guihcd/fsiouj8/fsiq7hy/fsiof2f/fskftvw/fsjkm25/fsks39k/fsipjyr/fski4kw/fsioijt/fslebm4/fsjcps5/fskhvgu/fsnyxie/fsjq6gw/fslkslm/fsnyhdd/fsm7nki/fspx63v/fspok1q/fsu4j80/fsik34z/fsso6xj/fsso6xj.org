I loved this. It makes we want to revisit my D&D idea of someone summoning an Atropal in a neighbouring locale and the characters having to deal with the effects during a different genre adventure.

I have a couple of questions.

1: Regardless of whether they actually show up in the story, which seems unlikely, how much of a threat do you figure the Ultra-Beasts to be? How would you have them work in this setting? The games and show have both depicted parallel versions of their worlds that were wrecked by them, and there is a chilling theory that the universes where the original games were set were ultimately destroyed by Ultra-Beast incursions because they lacked the power of mega-evolution and Z-moves necessary to contend with them.

2: I caught a shiny Groudon in Pokemon Go. Is there one of those hiding below Hoenn too?
