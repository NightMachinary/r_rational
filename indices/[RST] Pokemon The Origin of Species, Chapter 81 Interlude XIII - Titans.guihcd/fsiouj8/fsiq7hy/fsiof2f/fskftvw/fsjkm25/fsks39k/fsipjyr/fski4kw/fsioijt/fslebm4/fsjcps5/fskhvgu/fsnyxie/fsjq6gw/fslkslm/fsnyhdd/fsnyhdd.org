So DaystarEld, I have to ask something that's been on my mind lately about your world's setting. It's obvious at this point that legendaries and mythicals split into two categories: well-known terrors who roam the world, or myths and legends that no one is truly sure if they exist or not. It seems like the only legendaries that the populace as a whole acknowledge as existing are the violent legendaries that threaten people's lives with their very existence. But, surely there must be some benevolent legendaries and mythicals that people know exist, right? Are there truly no well-known legendaries in this setting that are considered benevolent or helpful? I know that in your setting, the idea of the legends being actual beings of nature or gods is blurred, but certainly, there has to be some legends that are helpful, right?
