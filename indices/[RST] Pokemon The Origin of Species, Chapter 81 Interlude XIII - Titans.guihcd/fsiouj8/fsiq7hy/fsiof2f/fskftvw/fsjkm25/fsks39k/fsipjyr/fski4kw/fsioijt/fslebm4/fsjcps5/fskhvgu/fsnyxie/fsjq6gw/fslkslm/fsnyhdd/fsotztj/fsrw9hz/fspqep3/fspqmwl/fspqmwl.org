I definitely get the appeal of that kind of world, but I feel like sapient and good pokemon would fundamentally change the pokemon world as presented, let alone sapient, good, /powerful/ pokemon. As soon as someone with the ability to change, say, the weather, or enable time travel, or heal wounds, becomes a "character," the genre changes entirely. This is in fact a big part of why canon takes on the pokemon world are so often nonsensical.
