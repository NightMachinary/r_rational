I figure that there's an inherent Legendary bonus going on here. That, or they've exceeded level 100 by a considerable bullshit margin.

Obviously the most effective strategy is to feed the Titans experience until their level exceeds 255 and ticks over to zero and they can be caught in a basic Pokeball. Or perhaps a butterfly net.
