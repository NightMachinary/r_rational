I'm not going to lie, when I saw that this chapter is an interlude, I was a little sad.

...for about five seconds. Then I remembered what happened last time, and what this interlude was likely to be, and holy shit am I so glad to be right.

This chapter was so cool! It felt almost like a peek into an alternate universe where this story is an adaptation of Hoenn, and the Birch scene is the culmination of a fic-long character arc about his insecurity about not being a battle professor but wanting to help, haha. Seeing the hints at Brendan and May's journey from third-party perspectives trying to figure out what the heck is going on was really cool.

I think the Weather Institute head is my new favorite character.
