Not too familiar with much that happens after Pokemon Blue, but these last two chapters are really making me want to pick up some of the more recent games.

Honestly, I'm hoping that things don't get too serious. Lots of serious things have happened that are still unresolved, and having the party get swallowed up in another impersonal tragedy does feel somewhat exhausting. It would be great if their own involvement in the fallout remains something close to home.

Still, curious to see where this is going.
