Another MLP story, which actually is MLP fanfic, fits your request pretty well: /[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/181949/at-the-inn-of-the-prancing-pony][At the Inn of the Prancing Pony]]/, by [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/33111/McPoodle][McPoodle]]. An mysterious power has enabled D&D gamers in a parallel-universe version of our world to take control of ponies in Equestria, and changed Equestria into a more stereotypical D&D world. Princess Celestia, recently awakened from enchanted sleep, struggles to get to the bottom of things and break the connection.

The meta-lore behind the connection isn't developed so well, but the story does do a good job exploring the relationship between player and character.
