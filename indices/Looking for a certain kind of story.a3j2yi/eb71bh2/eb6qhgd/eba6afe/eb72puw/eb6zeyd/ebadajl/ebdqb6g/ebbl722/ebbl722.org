[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21597/small-medium][Small Medium]] on RRL and [[https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Faces-Game-Minus-Book-ebook/dp/B07KMMT9TX/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1544224138&sr=8-2&keywords=Changing+Faces][Changing Faces]] on Kindle Unlimited fit the bill here.

- Small Medium is about an NPC in a world that was made for players. It's still early in, though.
- Changing Faces is about an NPC that switches souls with the PC that killed him, and being respawned in a New Game+ type manner, which was clearly intended for a PC, not him.
