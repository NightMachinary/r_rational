Oh I can't remember the name of it but there's a story about a character who is playing a video game and the love interest character turns out to be sentient and has an existential crisis over it (and also is a bit jealous of his irl girlfriend). Turns out it's all an elaborate prank by his irl girlfriend except in the end he is still left wondering for some reason

(spoilers which ruin the ending but are probably necessary for identifying the story)
