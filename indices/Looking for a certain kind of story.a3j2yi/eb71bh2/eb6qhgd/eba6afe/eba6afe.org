I don't know if I'd consider it "rational", /or/ if it has an English dub, but there's an Italian movie from the 90s, "Nirvana", that confronts exactly this issue. In a cyberpunk future, an unspecified glitch causes the main character from a game that's about to be released to become sentient and able to retain memory of each playthrough, and having understood the limits of his existence, he begs his developer to delete him before the game is distributed and his mind is copied over the entire world so many times he'll basically become immortal and forced to relive his limited story over and over again.
