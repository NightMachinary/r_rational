It didn't for me, at least in the original. It's a paperclipping AI, but instead of paperclips, it's friendship and ponies, a fact which is played for horror rather than to indulge a love of ponies (at least, in my opinion).

As for the derivative works, it's kind of a crapshoot. Some people have a different take that's rather more heavy on the ponies and light on the existential horror, which doesn't really work for me. The original is worth a read though, definitely, even if you're not into ponies (which I'm not).
