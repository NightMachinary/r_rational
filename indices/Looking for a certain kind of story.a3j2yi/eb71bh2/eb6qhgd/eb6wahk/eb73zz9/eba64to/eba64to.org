It's funny that I once saw a take on FiO that was basically "these rationalists are crazy, who the hell could think this scenario is desirable" and I was surprised because for me it doesn't /feel/ like the fic describes a desirable scenario at all - perhaps better than some of the most nightmarish paperclipping ones, but at the very best extremely ambiguous and with some rather horrifying undertones. But obviously it's subjective, and I'm not entirely sure about what the author's original intent even was.
