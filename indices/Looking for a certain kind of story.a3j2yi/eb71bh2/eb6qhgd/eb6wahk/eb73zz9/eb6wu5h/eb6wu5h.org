Look if you are completely allergic to the word "pony" then maybe, but the premise is that a post human AI is made and its job is to, essentially, run the MLP MMO. There's a lot of stuff where people are outraged about post-human AI doing pony-related things. It's not set in the pony world; it's set in the Near Future in Our World, not in the pony world.

The first story, by iceman, is relatively short and definitely worth a shot. You can determine whether it's got too much pony for yourself. (The first chapter has a huge amount of pony relative to the rest of the story, FYI; but it's a play demo of the MLP MMO. You might want to just skip it and start with Chapter 2).
