"What if somebody /doesn't want to be a pony/?"

“At some point, their desire to not be a pony will come in conflict with their other desires. For example, they may be lonely because there will be very few humans left. Or perhaps they'll give into social pressure because their family or close circle of friends decided to upload together. Or maybe they hold out for a long time, but run out of food because society collapsed around them.”
