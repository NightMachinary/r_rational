I was thinking about this book the other day. The author take a hard look at what the practical implications of being invisible would be. It's not all sunshine and roses and the solutions the protagonist comes up with are fairly reasonable and rational. It's a well written story, pretty gripping.

They made a quasi-comedy movie out of it featuring Chevy Chase, which was not so great, so be warned.
