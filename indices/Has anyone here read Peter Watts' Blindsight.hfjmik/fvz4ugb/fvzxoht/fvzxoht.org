I think re-posts are fine to a large extent, on any sub (or similar 'venue'). Once a day is probably too much even for the largest subs, but, based on the search to which you linked, this book hasn't been discussed in over a year. No sub is going to be composed of the same people over periods that long. (And it's an inevitable tragedy of all old-timers to 'constantly' see the same things brought up by newcomers.)

  In fact I think even askreddit would not allow this question

This seems particularly ironic given that I have /recently/ noticed a surprising amount of near-duplicate reposts on [[/r/AskReddit][r/AskReddit]].
