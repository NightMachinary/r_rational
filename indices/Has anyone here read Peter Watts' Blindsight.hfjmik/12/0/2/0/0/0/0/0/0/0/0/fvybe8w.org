And category error is a category error as well.\\
The doubter or skeptic never thinks he is right, he never thinks that there is any right, but neither does he thinks there is any wrong, if he is sincere in his scepticism. He really cannot think at all, because thinking involves accepting certain things that cannot be proved, but can only be accepted on faith.\\
All thinking begins with assumptions that cannot be proved in logic, we call these axioms. But the real skeptic has nowhere to begin because he must doubt everything and so, so he sinks through floor after floor of a bottomless universe.\\
Reason can only be built on faith and that faith is the foundation of our civilization and our self-awareness.
