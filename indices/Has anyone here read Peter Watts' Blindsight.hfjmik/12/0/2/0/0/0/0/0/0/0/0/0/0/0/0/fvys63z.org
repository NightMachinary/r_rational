You look in the mirror and make the assumption "It's me". In the world that you're only the result of. Of course, it's not you, it's just your reflection.

  Shee was as light\\
  As Mee, and as bright;\\
  But Shee was, strange to tell,\\
  Hanging down\\
  With starry crown\\
  Into a bottomless well!\\
  Her gleaming eyes\\
  In great surprise\\
  Looked upon to the eyes of Mee:\\
  A marvellous thing,\\
  Head-down to swing\\
  Above a starry sea!

  Only their feet\\
  Could ever meet;\\
  For where the ways might lie\\
  To find a land\\
  Where they do not stand\\
  But hang down in the sky\\
  No one could tell\\
  Nor learn in spell\\
  In all the elven-lore.
