Making or acknowledging?

From your subjective perspective, you have no possibility to judge surely what is more illusionary, "you" or the "system."

Even the separation between "objectivity" and "subjectivity" in your mind is illusionary.

However, the "self" is self-made. Once you have the "illusion of self", you have the "illusionary meanings" for yourself. And obviously, all the attempts to act and think as not-self are second order illusions -- and the fragility of these illusions is easily proved by pain for the first order illusion of "your self".

How is it typically solved? We take the concept of Truth. To the question, "What are you?" you answer, "Truth knows." And to the question, "What is meant by it?" -- if you're sincery, you only can start to answer with "That whatever I am, I am not myself."

And once a thinker has thought to a definite end, the person can be called dogmatist.

It's just you can accept dogma and know it, and you can accept dogma and don't know it.
