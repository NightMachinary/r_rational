I'd argue that that definition can't really be used here, because (as others have pointed out) "winning" is a term whose precise meaning varies between individuals. You'd change the meaning of that sentence at least a little if you tried to translate it into different human cultures and/or languages, nevermind the mess that results when you try to apply it to non-sentient beings with no concept of language.

If I had to term 'rationality', I'd call it...

#+begin_quote
  A term broadly referring to the absolute level of efficiency and effectiveness with which a complex system affects changes on it's environment, particularly when those changes fall into consistent categorizations such as, but not limited to,

  'Increasing the probability of the continued existence of the complex system.' or

  'Increasing the susceptibility of the environment to change by the complex system.' or

  'Increasing the rationality of the complex system.'

I would say this definition captures the essence of rationality, /without/ having to involve such incredibly messy, subjective, and difficult-to-define words as 'conscious', 'winning', 'sentient', 'sapient', etc. And it can be applied to humans, the aliens in question, and just about anything else that would be defined as a 'intelligent being'.
