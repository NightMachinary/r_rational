I think it's a /feature/ of 'winning' that it's varied, i.e. dependent on what individuals want (or maybe what 'enlightened'* versions of individuals want).

- I'm hinting at, not that there's 'a unique optimal utility function' (for all humans), but that for any specific /human/ approximation to something like a utility function (i.e. whatever it is that we /do/ use), there /is/ probably something like a 'unique optimal utility function' for /each/ approximation, and that almost everyone is very far from acting according to that 'enlightened' version.
