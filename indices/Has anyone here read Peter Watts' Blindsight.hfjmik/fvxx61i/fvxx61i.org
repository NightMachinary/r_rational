I have seen it recommended here many times when people ask for novels, along with /Echopraxia/.

General review from what I remember: I really enjoyed his take on vampires, and felt that the story neatly slid in to the cosmic horror genre without actually leaving sci-fi, which is a rare but laudable occurrence. The aliens are well formulated and the suspense is executed well in general, though I didn't like the AI twist near the end. At the conclusion of reading it I felt like the book had effectively argued for the meaningfulness of the core self-awareness =//= intelligence premise.

On the other hand, the characters and much of the social speculation left much less of an impact, even considering the interesting ideas that some of them were based around. Not they they were incompetently executed, just that they didn't really compare to the other stuff in terms of being strikingly memorable.
