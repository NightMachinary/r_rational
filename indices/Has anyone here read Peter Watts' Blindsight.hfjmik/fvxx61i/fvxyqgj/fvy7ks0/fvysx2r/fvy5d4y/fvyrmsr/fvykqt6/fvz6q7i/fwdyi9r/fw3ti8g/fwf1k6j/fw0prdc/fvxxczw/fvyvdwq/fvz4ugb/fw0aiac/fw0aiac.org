Blindsight felt like the science fiction version of some book written by a crank who has an incredibly questionable belief about a field of science outside of their expertise. Which, to be fair, could be said about a lot of science fiction novels, and isn't necessarily a bad thing. But Blindsight is pretty standout due to the pessimism about it all.

Honestly the premise seems to me as kind of humanocentric in a roundabout cynical way, because by positing sapience and self-awareness as unique to humanity it's basically discounting the idea that there could be other kinds of sapience that we as humans would have trouble recognizing as such. In the same way that we often discount the intelligence and emotionality of some species of animals because they don't express it in ways we can relate to.
