  Has anyone here read Peter Watts' Blindsight?

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=blindsight&restrict_sr=on]]

Why not word the title as "Let's discuss Blindsight?"

If you wanted to know if anyone has read it you could have used the search bar or looked in the monthly recommendations where Blindsight justifiably gets regularly posted.

I know as this subreddit gets more readers people will do these titles but I hope we can be more like [[/r/askhistorians]]

In fact I think even askreddit would not allow this question

Regardless you can use the link above to see previous discussion threads on this topic
