No worries on a /long/ post -- totally disagree about it being /rambling/ tho :)

I don't think 'winning' is tied to language. I wouldn't trust /humans/ to be able to accurately even approximate the actual 'approximation' of their utility functions.

I also don't always know what people mean by 'consciousness', 'sapience', 'sentience', etc.. I'm inclined to think that they're more the result of our confusion than anything. I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't used by future people with better understanding of 'intelligence'.

(I haven't read Blindsight yet myself but I've read about it and have a copy to-read too.)

The 'not seeing themselves as individuals' is confusing to me. I can better understand it if the individual Scramblers were, in a real concrete sense, a 'single mind', like the tines in A Fire Upon the Deep. So, one Scrambler identifying another as "Rorschach" /should/ also (easily) understand that their statement was equivalent to "That's another part of me, Rorschach. I am the ship.".

I do remember reading something recently, that linked to a bunch of examples elsewhere too, of people claiming that they remember 'waking up as conscious', e.g. as a teenager. (It might have been the comments on Slate Star Codex's recent post reviewing the 'bicameral mind' book.) Like with other mental epiphenomena, those of us that /are/ conscious might be just /assuming/ that all other people are too, when they aren't. I'll admit that seems like a stretch.

I sympathize with your lament about imprecise definitions, but that seems inevitable when discussing confusing/confused topics. It's perfectly fine to debate or discuss those definitions -- examples help! It's also fine to just taboo the unclear words and directly debate or discuss whatever you think are the relevant aspects or components.
