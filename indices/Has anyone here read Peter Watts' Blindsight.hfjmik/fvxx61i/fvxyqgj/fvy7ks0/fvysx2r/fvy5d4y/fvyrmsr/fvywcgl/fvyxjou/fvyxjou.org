Oh, I didn't meant to imply Siri was a vampire. I was referring to the fact that, in the background material, it's revealed the vampire genotype was discovered in an attempt to cure autism with a retrovirus, which resulted in the first human test subject--an autistic nine year old--becoming a vampire. The idea being that autistic traits are at least in part a legacy of vampiric genetics. Savant skills and all that.
