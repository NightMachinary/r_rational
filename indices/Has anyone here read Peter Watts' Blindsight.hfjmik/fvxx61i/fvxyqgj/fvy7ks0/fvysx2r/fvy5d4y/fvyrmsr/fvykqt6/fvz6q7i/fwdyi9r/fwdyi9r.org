I was torn about this book, as on all Watts books.

One one hand, the writing is brilliant, the plot is masterfully crafted and the world and ideas are just perfect in their sci-fi hardness.

On the other hand, the characters are all unlikable, the tone is bleak and depressing, and the whole theme borderlines on grimdark.

I would say that reading Blindsight was an absolute thrilling experience, but not a pleasant one.
