Note that Sarasti disregarded Siri's intuition at his (imminent) peril. I don't think this is the story asserting Siri is terrible at it so much as a character.

edit: Also the ending is kind of appropriate, no? The topology Siri is meant to translate isn't Starfish to Theseus, it's Theseus to Earth, or rather to us, given how Earth is kind of dying.
