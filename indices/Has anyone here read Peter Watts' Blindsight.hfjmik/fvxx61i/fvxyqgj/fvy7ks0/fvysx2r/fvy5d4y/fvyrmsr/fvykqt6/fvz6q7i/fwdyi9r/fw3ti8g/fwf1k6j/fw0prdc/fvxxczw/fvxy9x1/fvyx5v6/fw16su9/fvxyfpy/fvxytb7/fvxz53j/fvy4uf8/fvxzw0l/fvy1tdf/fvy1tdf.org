See? You need self-aware ones to to ascribe "goals" to non-self-aware ones and to argue about "winning".

For example, you can make the decision to die/become non-self-aware to achieve something. But the value of the achievement in question still is a subjective value which was reflected in your self-aware conciousness. You think about the value of the wanted achievement as about something applying to the question "who am I?"
