(bit of a rambling post, sorry.)

I agree that you can more-or-less assign humans (individual-specific) utility functions, define 'winning' as optimizing it, and then define rationality as winning.

But the entire ongoing argument in the other comment threads is based on "winning" specifically and whether or not that term, which is intimately tied to language and the self, is meaningful when it comes to nonsentient beings with no concept of language. The normally-significant ambiguity that people tend to overlook with words is cranked up so far that you can't even begin to figure out the specific definition that the Scramblers would use, because they don't even have language.

So in my eyes, the problem is that /no one is considering other possible definitions for 'rationality'/. The given definition would otherwise be fine, but it just doesn't work properly in this context. So offering a more general definition that doesn't (or at least tries not to) make a bunch of assumptions about the nature of the intelligence involved is prudent.

Also, on a bit of a side note, I bring up the whole "words mean different things to different people, and entire arguments can hinge on that" because everyone is talking about consciousness, sapience, sentience, etc, and, speaking for myself, I have /no idea what those are/ or how they're being used here. Not for lack of thinking or reading about it, either.

Am I conscious? How would I tell? Is it hinged on the ability to recognize one's self as existing in the world and make changes utilizing that realization? Because lots of things can do that; /ants/ can pass the mirror test. And the Scramblers do too, they apparently just don't see themselves as individuals; when one was asked to identify another Scrambler it said 'Rorschach', the ship they were a part of. That's a bit like if you asked a ant to identify another ant and it said "That is Colony." And it goes without saying that they're capable of understanding that injury or death is a impedance.

Does that mean that Scramblers /are/ conscious and self-aware? Are they /not/ conscious or self aware just because they only care about the well-being of their colony/ship and don't bother with individuality? Because if so, you could say that a sufficiently dedicated soldier for whatever country is also less or non-conscious, if they're putting the wellbeing and needs of their country above their lives. Or that individuals from any cultures which value the group more heavily than personal identity are also less or non-conscious.

Are they non-conscious because they don't understand or use language? Are humans who are (metaphorically, literal cases are rare) raised by wolves, and end up with no concept of language non-conscious? GPT-3 is reasonably competent with language, it can regularly write text indistinguishable from human-written text, is it /conscious/? Is the Chinese-room that Rorschach utilized conscious, or is it not conscious because it broke down when it faced a context outside what it was normally equipped for? Because a similar thing can happen with humans with poor language skills.

All of these are very important points, and I'd wager that no one should even be /using/ these words in a argument until some sort of consensus is reached and we know we're using similar definitions, because otherwise we're basically arguing completely different points and it doesn't take a rationalist to know that's bad in a debate.

But we are, and it bugs me.
