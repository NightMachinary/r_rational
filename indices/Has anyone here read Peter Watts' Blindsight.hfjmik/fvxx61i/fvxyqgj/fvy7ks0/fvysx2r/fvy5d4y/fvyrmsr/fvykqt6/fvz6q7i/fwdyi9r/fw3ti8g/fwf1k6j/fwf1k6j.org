Yes, because [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][it's free to read online.]]

The vampire stuff is too hackneyed and silly for me, all it served was to bookend the futility of it all and a greygoo nanomachine monster could have done the same and been more rational.

What I do like very much is how it presents humans as rather inferior, which I feel like is completely necessary in a sci-fi setting that has any sufficiently advanced AI.

Space Fantasy Star Trek TNG never made a bit of sense logically, unless you assumed it was a Matrix/Sword Art Online fantasy world and Picard was cosplaying in a video game. Otherwise it buggers belief that they don't just have a robot doing the daring-do.

I read complaints about how the characters are freaks that had to modify themselves to the extreme just to still be obsolete, and it's like what... you want humans to be a shonen protagonist in a world with mechanical super intelligence? You want someone willing to augment themselves to the extreme, to have the personality of a normie like the people in the alternate reality box? These things can't co-exist without embracing complete fantasy.
