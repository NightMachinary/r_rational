  the question "is self-awareness valuable for winning?" is just as legitimate as any other.

Ok, but the answer is clearly "self-awareness is required to win, because otherwise who experienced the victory?" A computer does not win at chess; it moves electrons around until a stop condition is reached. 'Winning' is a thing that conscious beings do; victory being a state of mind, it requires a mind to experience it. The question Blindsight raises is rather whether self-awareness is valuable for /reproducing/, which is not the same thing.
