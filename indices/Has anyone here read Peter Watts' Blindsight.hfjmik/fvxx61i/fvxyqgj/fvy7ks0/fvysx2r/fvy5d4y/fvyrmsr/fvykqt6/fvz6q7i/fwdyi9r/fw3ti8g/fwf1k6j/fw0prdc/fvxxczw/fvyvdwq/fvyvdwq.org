Read it. Didn't really like it.

The vampire addition felt pointless to the whole theme. The intelligence without sentience argument did not convince me. IMHO to compete and evolve you need to model the future and hence you need to work with very abstract objects. I believe sentience derives from there. Maybe I'm just stupid and I didn't get some of his arguments. Also monster did not feel interesting.
