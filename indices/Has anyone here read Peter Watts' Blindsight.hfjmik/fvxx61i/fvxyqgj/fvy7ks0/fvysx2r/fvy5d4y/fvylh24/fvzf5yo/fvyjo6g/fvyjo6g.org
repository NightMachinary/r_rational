Exactly, it didn't feel like the characters were relatable, they just accepted dystopia as normal, and the “intelligence without consciousness” felt more like the characters and/or author simply finding aliens' consciousness too, well, alien to recognize. I enjoyed the explanation of Chinese Box A.I. and the vampires though.
