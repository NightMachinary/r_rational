Yes. Really enjoyed it. I particularly liked the way none of the main characters are neurotypical. Well written aliens too, with a genuinely different form of thought to our own. Also plenty of great descriptive work to appeal to the science fan; +1 for turning 'coriolis' into a verb.

Anyone planning to read it should know that discussions on this thread on the nature of intelligence etc may well turn into plot spoilers. OP may want to mark some of their post as such.

Although I don't remember the details, I found myself disagreeing with his take on all that stuff. There was some assumption or other underlying the whole argument that I rejected. Didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book, though.
