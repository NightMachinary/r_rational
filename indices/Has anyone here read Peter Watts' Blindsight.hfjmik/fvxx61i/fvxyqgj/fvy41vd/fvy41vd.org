Yeah, I think the vampires are a touch shoe-horned in the first book. Which kind of makes sense. The vampires owe their genesis to Watts being press-ganged at a con into a vampire panel, because they wanted a "hard sf" representative. The vampires were something he just sort of made up on the fly.

So yeah, the vampires, to me at least, feel like a fun idea Watts was very fond of, but couldn't figure out a story for them specifically, so he added them into /Blindsight/ for a good pop-culture hook. For what it's worth, I think they add a lot more to the sequel.
