Yes, I agree. The narrative, while true to the protagonist's unusual thought processes, also makes the book harder to follow.

It was an interesting book with some cool ideas, but it wasn't a book I particularly /enjoyed/ reading.

(Aside: my use of this username predates the book's publication by a few years, in case anyone is confused by my lukewarm opinion of the title.)
