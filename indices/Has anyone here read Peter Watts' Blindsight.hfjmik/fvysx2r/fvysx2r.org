Sapience is intelligence, the ability to understand the world in a sophisticated way. Sentience is the ability to experience the world via qualia, being conscious. Dogs are sentient, but not the most sapient, for example. Blindsight argues that we can be sapient without being sentient.

I really enjoyed the book. Its central premise is fascinating and thought provoking. I would recommend it.
