HP was supposed to come across as awesome but hint at underlying issues, which you had to slightly pay attention to pick up. (Because HPMOR is a coming of age novel...) Siri reads more like ... he doesn't come across as humble so much as handicapped. Also he's part of a competent military command structure so there tends to be less of the "arguments with authorities" that turn people off in HPMOR? I'd say that one depends on whether you believe Sarasti on Siri externalizing his disdain for Sarasti's authority. But I mean, they both have a dark side and a seemingly logical/explicit approach papering over social deficiencies and self-unawareness. I feel like they'd be good friends.
