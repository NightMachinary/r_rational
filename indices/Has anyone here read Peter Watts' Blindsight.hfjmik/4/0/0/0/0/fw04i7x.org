Anticorrelation here. Hpmor was too smartass for me overall. Possibly I didn't like that it reminded me of some of my own bad traits ðŸ˜†. There were some good bits as well but I got bored and didn't finish it.

Fwiw I never read actual Harry Potter either and much though I wanted to like the films, felt they were made more for those who had read the books.
