Sure, but you could also give that answer without writing a sci-fi novel or any novel at all. He fits the theme of everyone on the crew being very different, and reflecting on those differences supports the central theme. I admit I found it weird having a vampire in hard sci-fi but the weirdness of the book is one of its good aspects imo.
