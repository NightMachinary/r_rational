Victory cannot be experienced without experiencing. A non-conscious mind does not experience anything, that's rather the point. I'm taking 'self-aware' and 'conscious' as synonyms here, as Blindsight also seems to do; the vampires are non-conscious in that there is nothing that it is like to be them, any more than there is something that it's like to be a desk.

I do not know why humans are conscious and computers are not, but I see no need to call the boundary metaphysical: Clearly the physics of a human brain is very different from the physics of a Neumann-architecture computer. I'm not claiming that it's impossible to build a conscious computer (which indeed would win chess games), only that current computers are not conscious.
