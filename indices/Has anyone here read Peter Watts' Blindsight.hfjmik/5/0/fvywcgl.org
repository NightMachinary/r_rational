For correctness, Siri Keeton (the protagonist) isn't a vampire. He's a human who had radical surgery performed on him as a child.

Sarasti, the captain of the ship, is a vampire- he's a completely different species that humans used biotechnology to resurrect. Neurologically, the book implies that vampires are less sentient than humans but have the advantage of multiple simultaneous thoughts occuring in parallel.

Vampirism isn't a treatment, it's being a completely different species.
