Red had the dual advantage of a novel strategy that lets him use coordinated attacks with excellent timing and experience in at least 2 leader level catastrophes. Even given identical other resources he would probably have the edge. I would compare his current battle ability to chapter 1 Blue, with the lack of combat instinct and training made up for in real world experience and tactics.

Leaf is an entirely different situation. I feel like even though she's been in the same situations, her goals and thoughts about them are different enough that they wouldn't help her nearly as much in a battle. She also cares too much about Pokemon to put her all into a battle that isn't protective.

I think that Red would be able to earn three Thunder badge if he worked his way up through the gym, but Leaf wouldn't be able to handle the militaristic nature of Lt. Surge.
