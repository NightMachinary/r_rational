  despite the fact that it's his first trainer battle
#+end_quote

First trainer battle with strangers* :) He's been training with Blue here and there since Pewter, mostly to help Blue, but their first "real" match was in Cerulean.

  Could Red get the Thunderbadge if he wanted? Could Leaf?
#+end_quote

Both could almost certainly get their first badges at this point, if they put their minds to it: they've been journeying for months now, and even though they have less trainer experience than Blue, they've fought in wild situations and have spent time training their pokemon.
