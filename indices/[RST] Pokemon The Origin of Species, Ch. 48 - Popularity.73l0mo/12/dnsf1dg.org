Feels like some growth for Red, coming to accept as a researcher he can (and should) also actively work on getting stronger in battle.

Also feels slightly inconsistent with /some/ parts of his character that this apparent hesitation to battling exists. For example, his promise with red to fight legendary birds. Or was he planning on helping outside of battle?
