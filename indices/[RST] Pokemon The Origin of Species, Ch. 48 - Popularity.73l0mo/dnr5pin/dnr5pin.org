Another pretty awesome chapter!

I wonder, is Red right now essentially the psychic equivalent of a savant? Weak to nonexistent telekinesis, slightly crippled telepathy, but a unique, highly developed (compared to other psychics, who apparently can't do it all) ability to passively, and stealthily detect attempted intrusions into his mind. Because Red training so hard that he could become useful to the Mewtwo project would require you making an unforeshadowed sudden genius. But the Mewtwo project being interesting in a savant with a relevant skill that could be made useful without having to be told to much....

Also, considering that Red can do something that apparently no other psychic (human or pokemon) can, he might be the one person with something to offer Mew-two. Perhaps in order to learn Recover, Mew-two doesn't have to just mimic what Alakazam does, but actually force his mind into the exact same mental-state or something? Perhaps Recover isn't like mental math or calculation, which can be learnt by mimicking the rules others follow, but is actually like the No-Thought state I hear about in meditation, and must actually be discovered and experienced for oneself. Or in this case, psychically enforced on oneself.

Because I've been thinking, and my personal theory is that the reason Mew-two can't use Recover is because his mind is too human. Normally his increased intelligence combines with his Pokemon granted abilities to make him truly powerful. But when it comes to Recover, maybe there is something about full human consciousness that prevents the ability from working? Maybe full human consciousness and intelligence is actually a self-affecting psychic move humans are running all the time, and isn't mutually inclusive with Recover? Who knows?

Anyway, to get back on point, I just think that Red's journey, and unique psychic abilities, leading him to discover a way for humans to use Recover would be an awesome; and the thing about human intelligence, in the PokeVerse, just being a psychic move has always been my personal fan theory. I never got how in Pokemon some people can be psychic if everybody else wasn't at least a little bit psychic (for example in real life some savants are really good at math, and some people with synaesthesia can see numbers as colors or taste sights, or etc... but everybody else can also do math, or taste and see), and I always believed that psychics were just humans powerful enough, or lucky enough, to learn other 'Moves'.

Anyways, I know you can't deny or confirm a lot my story predictions and theories, but I hope you found these ramblings at least a little bit amusing :)
