  It seems as though challenging the e4 and champion is rarely done in this world, but it seems that there are basically zero gym challengers attempting the Kanto league coming in from other regions.

Assuming you mean trainers who live in that region, and not people from other regions who grew up there, there are, but it's not common: to be Champion in more than one region doesn't hold a lot of extra political benefit, if anything it kind of shows a lower devotion to your own region (since you're obviously not sticking around to help it out), and so very few trainers care to: only those who are really devoted to getting as strong as they can be and finding every challenge available to them.

Thanks for reading, and happy Halloween :)
