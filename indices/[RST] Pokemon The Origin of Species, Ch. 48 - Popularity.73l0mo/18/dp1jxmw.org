Woah man, did I arrive to this month's party late, on the plus side, 99 comments to read!

First off, its crazy that Vermilion City would let some crazy kids up on to the roof of an 80 story building overlooking the coast; those girls must have some crazy courage to just nonchalantly talk about their aspirations under strong winds while looking over a drop to their doom. Good thing that didn't happen, hey? ;]

That bit about how container tech would change the nature of the ports and the city's layout was really interesting. I can only imagine how the introduction of affordable teleportation would further impact the nature of Vermilion's port city status. Maybe it'll end up competing with Cerulean as a seaside resort kind of place, but with the added benefits of peninsulas such as calmer beaches and more prime real estate. Only time will tell I guess.

That veteran trainer Lin got me curious, do trainers often go challenge other leagues aside from their first? It seems as though challenging the e4 and champion is rarely done in this world, but it seems that there are basically zero gym challengers attempting the Kanto league coming in from other regions.

Anyways, happy Halloween to everybody who celebrates it!
