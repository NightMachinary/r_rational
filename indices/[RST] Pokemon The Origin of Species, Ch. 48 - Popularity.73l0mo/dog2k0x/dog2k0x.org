A short critique of P:TOoS.

Strong points: * Easy to connect with, even if you are out of the rat community! * The characters showcase rationality skills in a way easy to replicate. * Introduces weird ideas in a way that makes sense in universe, like pokeballs / cryogenics and AI safety / mewtwo

Weaknesses: * I think the start of the series is rather bland. Until the chu's attack in the forest I did not feel committed to the story. * The stakes during the interludes are mismatched with the stakes in the main story, which makes the main story seem dull by contrast, which I do not think it is! * The way AI Safety is talked about in Bill's house feels rather condescending and violates the 'show don't tell' principle. This is in stark contrast with how cryogenics / pokeballs or AI Safety / Mewtwo is handled.

Looking forward to next episode!
