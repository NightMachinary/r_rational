There is not /nearly/ enough shipping convo's going on in these threads, where are my fellow degenerates?

When Aiko first joined the group, the Red/Aiko chemistry was pretty clear, with Aiko giving off some mad hero-worship eyes. Here though we got some good Leaf/Aiko bonding over shared values, with some added teasing thrown in. No real romantic sparks though, but its a foundation.

Also Blue totally noticing Aiko's hairstyle, a classic sign of interest! But I still think Red/Aiko has the most cards in play.

Love to hear other's obviously-reading-too-much-into-it reactions...
