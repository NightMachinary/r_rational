I have to say, I'm /extremely/ disappointed with the direction you took the Vermilion gym. Lt. Surge's role in encouraging young trainers to rummage through random trash cans until something happens is foundational to my experience of the Pokemon universe. ^{^{/s}}

That being said, this truly was a great chapter. I actually am finding myself quite drawn to Leaf's story arch. I think there is a lot of cool work to do in Utopian literature now that Social Media has been invented.

Also, I have been doing a bit of reading during the down time at my new job, and I found it pleasing that the past-chapter I had just read was the very one were the Ho-oh myth was first mentioned.

I thought I had while rereading that I may as well comment here: Are Ground-type Pokemon actually Rubber-polymer type Pokemon? Similar to steel type, what makes a pokemon "Ground-type" is some kind of material infusion that makes them particularly flexible and therefore good at maneuvering beneath the earth. As a side effect, they are not very conductive, giving them their signature Electricity-immunity in game. Nothing particluarly "groundy" about a Gligar or a Mudbray, but they are all still adapted to be immune to electrical attacks.

The main exceptions are pokemon that are dual-rock type, and Claydol and Golurk lines. All seem to actually be made of earth in some way, and can do more than just push earth around. The dual rock types are easily explainable by the rock types, and perhaps the claydol and golurk were made of a similarly non-conductive material, so people just assumed they were also Ground types because of it.

Can't wait for the next chapter!
