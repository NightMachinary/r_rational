I was wondering what your take on the fossil Pokemon is, regarding their consistently present rock-type. My hypotheses are as follows:

1: The rock type is introduced as a (currently) unavoidable consequence of fossil revivification, making them more "genetically engineered theme park monsters" than true prehistoric species.

2: Only rock-type Pokemon had the sort of biology that is sufficiently conserved during fossilisation that they can be revived (either as a fundamental property or, again, as a limitation of current technology).

3: Consistent with Brock's beliefs, life really did come from rocks, thus species from earlier epochs were more likely to retain that trait than modern species. Fossil Pokemon are thus type-transitional forms.

4: A misleading coincidence.
