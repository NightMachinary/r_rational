  I actually tried coming up with some HPMOR-type "this thing that's stupidly simple was stupidly simple on purpose for X secretly brilliant reason" that has to do with searching through garbage cans for hidden switches, or taught some moral about rationality, and failed to come up with anything compelling enough.

Yeah, teaching the hacker technique of trashing really seems more like a Koga thing (digging up a note with the passcode for the gym's arena). Or maybe Blaine (combine the contents of his garbage with obscure trivia to figure out some of his tricks).
