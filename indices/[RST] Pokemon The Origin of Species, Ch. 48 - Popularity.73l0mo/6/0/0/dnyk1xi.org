Yeah, I really feel like gens 3 and 4 really did Legendaries well, with Hoenn winning out a little on the hunt side of things but Sinnoh working its legendaries really well into the lore and atmosphere of the region. And ugh, yeah, I hate that legendaries are always just gifts nowadays! I mean, I never want to go back to the days of never being able to get any unless you get really lucky with an event location, but I wish they'd at least be handled like gen 3 did, with the events unlocking a new area where the legendary lives or something...
