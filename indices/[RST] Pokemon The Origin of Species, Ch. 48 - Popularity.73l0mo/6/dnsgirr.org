Okay, /now/ I like Aiko as a character. I was a bit worried about a seeming rando joining the party, but now that she fits the pattern of representing a cool aspect of the pokemon games, I am completely on board with her having a presence for the rest of the story.

Hunting legendaries was always my favorite part of the games.
