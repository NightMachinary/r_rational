  Lt. Surge's role in encouraging young trainers to rummage through random trash cans until something happens is foundational to my experience of the Pokemon universe. ^{/s}

I actually tried coming up with some HPMOR-type "this thing that's stupidly simple was stupidly simple on purpose for X secretly brilliant reason" that has to do with searching through garbage cans for hidden switches, or taught some moral about rationality, and failed to come up with anything compelling enough. I guess there's still time to :P

  Are Ground-type Pokemon actually Rubber-polymer type Pokemon?... Nothing particluarly "groundy" about a Gligar or a Mudbray, but they are all still adapted to be immune to electrical attacks.

My basic idea for this is that for most pokemon "Ground Type" is an emergent property of pokemon that can travel beneath the ground or rely heavily on it for their maneuverability and attacks, which leads to them having a strong resistance/immunity to electric attacks in most situations. Pokemon that seem like clear exceptions to this like gligar and mudbray are the "physiologically unique" ones that actually carry their immunity around with them, but also have some "earthy" properties that link them to the Ground typing, unlike many other pokemon that are immune to electricity without being Ground types (Lightning Rod ability).

Thanks for reading!
