You know he's based on the Eurypterid sea scorpions, right? I first figured that out by trying to design an anthropomorphic sea scorpion, and ended up two swords short of Kabutops. There's also some /Cheirurus/ trilobite in there too. I recently became a little bit obsessed with prehistoric marine arthropods, which made Kabutops rapidly ascend my favourites list.

Though it seems to me that the Kabuto line has the same claim to the bug type as does Krabby and Corphish, who don't get it.
