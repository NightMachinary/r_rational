Hey everyone, welcome back! Not a whole lot to announce this month, was hoping to get the second chapter of Guardian up but lost a week to the hurricane early on. Ideally it'll be done sometime next month, along with another episode of Rationally Writing. Thanks for reading, and all feedback welcome, as usual! Enjoy!
