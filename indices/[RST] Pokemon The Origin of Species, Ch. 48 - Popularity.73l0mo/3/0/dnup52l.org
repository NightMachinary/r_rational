I try to make it a point to comment on every one, and IM not stopping yet :P

I like what you did with surge. Good character concept, modified well to be within your world, but still makes perfect sense in canon.

I don't like that red isn't going for badges at all. He could clearly get one (you even mentioned it yourself) and I see 0 downsides to getting one. Especially the thunder badge, as it is clear he wants to train people for emergency responses, and red should love having some psuedo ranger training.

I find the name changes to be interesting. it shows that he doesnt ever really want to use the abra in combat, OR that the brainwashing is more powerful than I thought

The myths are interesting. If you want the whole world to be perfectly rational, I'm curious how you are going to handle the reality warping.

For some reason it still feels weird to me to see things like "a kalos district" I think that is just me being used to the game worlds almost never referencing the other regions.

Excellent chapter, while some I complain about, these are the ones I am here for :P
