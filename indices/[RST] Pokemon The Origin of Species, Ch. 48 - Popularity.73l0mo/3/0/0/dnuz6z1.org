Thanks! I enjoy consistent reviews particularly, for what that's worth, since it lets me get a feel for how individual clusters of values/perspectives are enjoying the story's progression :)

  For some reason it still feels weird to me to see things like "a kalos district" I think that is just me being used to the game worlds almost never referencing the other regions.

Yeah, this is something that has been slowly changing in the games, as far as I've seen anyway, with NPCs often showing up from other regions, sometimes even important story ones, and references to the other regions appearing now and then. It makes the world feel much more lived-in, which is obviously something I enjoy :)
