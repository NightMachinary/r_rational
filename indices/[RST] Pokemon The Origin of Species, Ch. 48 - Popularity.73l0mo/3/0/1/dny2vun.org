  I don't like that red isn't going for badges at all. He could clearly get one (you even mentioned it yourself) and I see 0 downsides to getting one. Especially the thunder badge, as it is clear he wants to train people for emergency responses, and red should love having some psuedo ranger training.

Is there any actual upside to getting badges in this setting though? In the games they let you use HMs and train pokemon to a higher level, but in this setting all I can think of is that they're required to challenge the Elite Four, which Red has no interest in.

It occurs to me, however, that with the advent of easy teleportation if they ever change their minds they can go back and challenge the gyms very easily - even more easily than by using Fly, given that unlike in the games flight does have a travel time.
