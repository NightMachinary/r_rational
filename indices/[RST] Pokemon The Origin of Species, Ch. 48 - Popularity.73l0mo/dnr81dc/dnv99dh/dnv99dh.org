I feel like having a shiny pokemon isn't usually the /sort/ of special that makes you a protagonist, especially in rational fic. (definitely the others, though).

For myself, I suspect that the intersection of a legendary pokemon hunter, the strongest and best battler in Kanto, a psychic researcher who probably understands orthogonality, and a journalist who also happens to be one of the few people with an ethical system that a Pokemon might agree with is going to culminate in a big Mewtwo arc, and all of them are going to be essential.
