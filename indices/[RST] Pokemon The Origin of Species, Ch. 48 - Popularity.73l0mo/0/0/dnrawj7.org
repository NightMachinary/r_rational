I'd be kind of disappointed if this story only has one main protagonist. I read HPMOR, and liked it, but I felt like the element of the prophecy really restricted the roles Hermione and Draco could play in a story that wanted to fit all of Harry Potter canon into first year.

I'm excited for The Origin of Species because I expect all of the three view point protagonists to achieve something 'Main Character Worthy'.

That being said, I really do want Aiko to become a view point character next chapter. If Red is in training to become 'The Professor', and Blue wants to be 'The Champion', and Leaf will eventually become something like a wandering reporter, Aiko seems to be the closet Origin of Species has to a traditional Pokemon protagonist, like Ash Ketchum, adventuring not because she wants to learn more about Pokemon, or wants to be the best Pokemon trainer, but simply because she loves Pokemon. And I do wonder how that kind of worldview is going to meshed into this rational reinterpretation of canon.
