No problem. Since I'm still reading through it, these two also popped out.

#+begin_quote
  can bring life back from even ashes.
#+end_quote

from even -> even from

Probably not a real error, but it would keep me from mentally adding "as opposed to odd ashes."

--------------

#+begin_quote
  But I don't think I would have made up that feeling, the Pressure.
#+end_quote

Again, maybe intentional, but capitalizing "Pressure" here seems a bit forth-wall breaking.

Edits for additional issues, as I go:

#+begin_quote
  That first day, as Blue walked across the campus to start his challenge matches, watched a formation of gym members jogging side by side with their pokemon, passed a line of trainers practicing their pokemon's aim and timing against targets, and heard the cries of battle commands mixed with shouted orders, he knew he'd been wrong.
#+end_quote

On my first read, I read this as "That first day, as Blue walked across the campus to start his challenge matches, *[he]* watched a formation of gym members jogging side by side with their pokemon." Eventually I figured it out.

While I think the whole bit could probably be revised, just getting rid of the first comma would help with the readability:

That first day, as Blue -> On the first day when Blue

--------------

#+begin_quote
  I think it's better to put some the tanks on either side
#+end_quote

some the tanks -> some of the tanks

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Haven't gone far from the city yet just toward the eastern coast and back, and to the north a bit.
#+end_quote

yet just -> yet. Just | yet, just

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Red blinks as the determination the two suddenly show.
#+end_quote

as -> at

--------------

#+begin_quote
  He's got three badges, old and strong enough to travel on his own, and good at listening and following orders while still being creative in accomplishing them.
#+end_quote

Because "He's got" is short for "He has got", the rest of the list reads like "He has old" and "He has good" (rather than "he is old" and "he is good"). Quick suggestions:

Original -> "He's old and strong enough to travel on his own, good at listening and following orders while still being creative in accomplishing them, and he's got three badges."

OR

Original -> "He's got three badges, he's old and strong enough to travel on his own, and he's good at listening and following orders while still being creative in accomplishing them.
