Very good first chapter. Sadly, I have no criticisms, only praise.

I tend to find original web fiction difficult to get into. This chapter was the opposite - it really drew me in from the get go, with no snags along the way. It explained what it needed to explain, but didn't overshare information.

I was surprised to find that this was meant to be a YA novel. One chapter isn't much to judge by, but it didn't feel as simple as typical YA fiction. This may be good or bad. It appeals to me, but I'm not in the target audience. On the other hand, the very best writing /should/ appeal to all ages, IMO - look at Avatar: TLA.
