Hey everyone, this is the new story that I've mentioned a few times on Rationally Writing. It's aiming to be a YA novel for eventual publication, and I have no idea how quickly I'll be able to get through it, or how much of it will end up going online, but for now I'd like to put it up here for people to read and give feedback on.

Title is still a work in progress. Enjoy!

(For those of you that might be worried, I can promise that this won't interfere with Origin of Species, since this one chapter took me a few months to write with whatever spare time I had between all the other projects. It's nice to be able to switch gears and work on something fresh, but the new Pokemon chapter is still being worked on too.)
