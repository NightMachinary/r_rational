I don't have an authoritative guide to hand, except that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash/][wikipedia]] looks good.

^ you don't see this in a (deliberately) typeset book. You'd see an em dash, /or/ as a variant style, an en dash preceded by a space.

So that's what I was nosy about. But resolving it doesn't seem to be quite as simple as I was hoping.

- use the em dash style throughout, or the en dash style?
- use a variation where the em dash is spaced (like AP style - maybe less used for books / longform)?
- how to generate your chosen characters

I think I read it wrong about WP rendering "--" as an em dash. I think "--" shows an en dash, and "---" shows an em dash. But e.g. if you ever edit in Word with the default auto-replace, then it may permanently replace the characters, using a /different/ conversion.

(Editing in Word is another thing I'd say is Probably Wrong, but serves a purpose & takes more effort to describe what a preferable approach would look like).
