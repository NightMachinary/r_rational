Hmm, okay, so it looks like em-dash would be used for an interruption in dialogue, but I can't find anywhere saying that it's used for an interruption in narrative too. I guess the same principle might apply? But it's curious that it's not mentioned there, since it goes over it pretty thoroughly but specifically only mentions speech.

For now I'll replace the dashes where speech is interrupted, and keep the ones where narrative is :) Thanks!
