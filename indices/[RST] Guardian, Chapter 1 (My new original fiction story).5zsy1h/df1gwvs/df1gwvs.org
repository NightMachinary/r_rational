I really enjoyed this. The adversarial dynamic between Terra and Puck hooked me immediately, because it introduces a source of tension right away. I'm interested to see what mistakes Terra will make and how Puck will exploit them. (One possibility that strikes me is that Puck might take advantage of Terra's assumption that he'll only give hints if he thinks Terra's wellbeing is at risk--since it's an assumption on Terra's part, it wouldn't require Puck to lie.) And the part with the figs was clever and immersive. It made me /feel/ the memory trick.
