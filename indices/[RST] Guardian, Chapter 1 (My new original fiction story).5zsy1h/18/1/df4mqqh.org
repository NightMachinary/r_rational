I'm also nosy about why you don't use em-dashes. I think the use of dashes looks ok, they're just not using the specific character. AFAIK both the default wordpress editor and Microsoft Word will format "--", replacing it with a single long dash character. & it should still round-trip fine after conversion, if you have a more complex workflow. (More often I'll see someone blogging code, and the automatic replacement breaks the code).
