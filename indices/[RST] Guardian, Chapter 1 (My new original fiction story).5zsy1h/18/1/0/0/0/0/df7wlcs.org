Heh. Perhaps "good" is over-estimating Wikipedia, at least for how clear it is.

I guess speech is the most traditional use for dashes.

  For now I'll replace the dashes where speech is interrupted, and keep the ones where narrative is :).
#+end_quote

Absolutely up to you, what style you want to follow. What I'm mostly confident about, is that the ASCII hyphens that were used are /not/ considered dashes. And there's no traditional style that uses hyphens to show an interruption or pause (except stuttering, as Wiki points out to me).

(You'll also see pedantic references to the ASCII character as a hyphen-minus, since it is overloaded to represent both hyphens and minus signs. But if someone's worried about typesetting math, they've probably used something like Latex or MathJax, or already wrestled with fonts & encodings to get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_figures][text figures]]).
