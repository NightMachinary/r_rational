  I mean, that's exactly what it is.

Right, but Pullman didn't say that, he tried to make an argument about how the past tense is intrinsically a better medium to tell stories in, for various reasons, and how the shift to present tense can be used artistically. I feel kinda the reverse. The hand-held cameras comparison is a good one, but I do think that it's just as natural to tell stories in the present tense as the past tense.

Like, a friend could be telling you a story and describe it like this:

"So I was at the bar last night, and this big guy came up to us and started making fun of my buddy's shirt. I stepped between them and tried to calm everyone down, but he took a swing at me! I got knocked on my ass, and I was like, 'what the hell,' you know?"

Or they could say it like this:

"So I'm at the bar last night, and this big guy comes up to us and starts making fun of my buddy's shirt. I step between them and try to calm everyone down, but he takes a swing at me! I'm knocked on my ass, and I'm like 'what the hell,' you know?"

And in my perspective of how people react to this, no one is confused or taken out of the story because they know that the person isn't literally at the bar right now as they describe it, they're just using the present-tense as a form of immediacy/immersion, unconsciously.

That's how it is for me: when I write, it comes out in present tense because the events are happening /now/ as I envision them. The reason I don't change it is a bit of wanting to break taboos and buck tradition, but it's more because I'm stubborn rather than the first cause, which is that it's just natural to me :)
