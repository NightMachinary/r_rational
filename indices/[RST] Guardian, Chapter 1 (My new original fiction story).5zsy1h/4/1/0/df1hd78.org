Honestly, I read the comments first and saw people saying the present tense took them out of it, so I went into it knowing this was a concern people had--but when I actually went to read the chapter, I immediately forgot and didn't give the tense another thought all the way through. I didn't even really register that it was in present tense, despite having been "warned" in advance. I might be outvoted on this one but I think it's fine, personally. The writing flows smoothly enough, and the plot is immersive enough, that the tense doesn't get in between me and the story.
