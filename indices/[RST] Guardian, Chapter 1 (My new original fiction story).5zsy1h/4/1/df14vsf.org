Fixed the typo, thanks! And glad you like the premise :)

As for the tense, yeah, this is one of those things I feel like I might be most irrational about. I /know/ that I'm losing readers by having Origin of Species and this novel in present tense, but... something in me resists the notion that this is wrong or taboo, and wants to fight back against it out of sheer stubbornness that others have such an aversion to it.

No disrespect to Phillip Pullman, I love his work intensely, but I find the argument unconvincing. I think it's something that's evolved as a taste simply because of convention. The idea that present-tense is just not how stories are told is strange to me, who finds it a natural voice to tell written stories in. The Dresden Files makes sense to be in the past tense because the writer is documenting his past. Stories explicitly about past events ("Long ago," or "Once upon a time,") make sense to use past tense because it's part of the setting.

I'm not writing a journal, nor are my narrators or characters recalling things that occurred in the past. The narration serves as a simple lens of a story of what's happening /right now/ in the world my readers are reading, as they read it. I find it engaging, personally, and it allows me to use past tense as it's intended: to describe things that happened in the past.

If I end up getting to the point where I have to get this thing published and all the editors notes and denial letters are saying "gotta put it in past tense," I'll cave. But if I can help contribute to normalizing present tense as a form of storytelling, and have people able to more easily read both, I count that as a plus :)

In the meantime, I'm sorry if it bothers you, and hope the other aspects of the story make up for it!
