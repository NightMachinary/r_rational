I'm noticing a good amount of influence from Pact here, so I'm guessing that this story is partially inspired by the question "What would Pact be like if things didn't always suck everywhere forever?" You'd still have the clever words and mind games, the blood magic and assorted other magics, and the severe /risk/ of horrible fates if you're careless, but put instead in a package where, if you play your cards right, you can win or at least break even.

The fig trick was intriguing. Terra somehow knew that he was being affected by /something/, even though he was being blocked from comprehending it when not seeing it, but it was only when he had physical proof of her existence that he could actually remember her. I'm not sure what that means for the nature of glamour and illusions, but it's an interesting data point.

Naming scheme so far seems a bit esoteric, what with Terra and Puck. I'm guessing Terra was given an unusual name by his dad, who presumably was thoroughly immersed in the spooky stuff, and Puck's not even human, but I wondered for a moment there if this was a 'fantasy academy where everyone has weird names' story.

So far, it looks like it has good potential to get Terra more and more sucked into the supernatural world like Blake did, though hopefully less tragically. I can say right from the get-go that I hope Terra finds some peers to confide in and drag along with him. Alternate perspectives and reactions are a significant chunk of what makes stories compelling for me, so loner stories don't resonate quite as well.
