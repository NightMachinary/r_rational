  Terra somehow knew that he was being affected by something, even though he was being blocked from comprehending it when not seeing it

My interpretation was that he was able to recognize the memory trick because he could only remember three girls, but he remembered them /acting/ like there was a fourth person there. Like their body language didn't make sense if there were really only three. So the memory trick made him forget the fae, but it couldn't alter how he saw the human girls behaving.

Puck's definitely not the fae's true name or I'm sure he would have objected to Terra revealing it, so I have to assume that he adopted it (or someone gave it to him) as a joke. I mean, assuming that Shakespeare is a thing in this universe.
