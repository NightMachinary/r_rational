  I think that you may be projecting your feelings as the author onto the reader when you say that it gives a feeling of things happening "right now".

Very possible! But it's also me as a reader, when I come across present tense stories.

Don't get me wrong, I don't get bothered by past tense stories because I'm very used to them. But I do find it interesting that you find it harder to remember previous events in present tense stories. I wonder if anyone's ever done research on this... I'll have to look for some tomorrow.
