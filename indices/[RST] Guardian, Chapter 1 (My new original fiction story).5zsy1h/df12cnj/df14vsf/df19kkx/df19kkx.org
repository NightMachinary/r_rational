I think that you may be projecting your feelings as the author onto the reader when you say that it gives a feeling of things happening "right now".

For me as a reader, past tense works as a way of mimicking how I would sort through my own memories, discovering things as the chain of association makes its way through my memories of a series of events.

By contrast, present tense makes me feel like an observer, not a participant.

But I can definitely see that present tense might be more conducive to writing.

Also, anecdotally, present tense narration makes it harder for me to remember past plot events. I remember liking Ra, but I don't remember anything that happened in it. In your Pokemon Origin of Species I find myself having to go back and review more often than in other fictions.
