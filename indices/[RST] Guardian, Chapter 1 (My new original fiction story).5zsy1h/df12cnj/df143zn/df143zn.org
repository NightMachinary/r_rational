  not insignificant number of potential readers have negative associations with the use of present tense in fiction

Huh, well I guess you learn something new every day. I didn't even consciously notice it was present-tense until you pointed it out.

I wonder if it's a native language thing - a lot of Polish fiction I remember was in present tense, and it's not really a weird thing.

ETA after reading the article:

  I agree with [[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/sep/18/philip-pullman-author-present-tense][everything Philip Pullman has to say about the matter]].

That rant is really confusing. It's somehow assumed that using present tense as the base of the story means that only present tense will ever be used?

  But if every sound you emit is a scream, a scream has no expressive value. What I dislike about the present-tense narrative is its limited range of expressiveness. I feel claustrophobic, always pressed up against the immediate.

  I want all the young present-tense storytellers (the old ones have won prizes and are incorrigible) to allow themselves to stand back and show me a wider temporal perspective. I want them to feel able to say what happened, what usually happened, what sometimes happened, what had happened before something else happened, what might happen later, what actually did happen later, and so on: to use the full range of English tenses.

Starting with the present tense as what's happening /now/ in the story doesn't prevent you from using the past tense to talk about what happened /before/, nor the future to talk about the future. In fact, talking about the future seems easier in english if your base is the present tense - you can now simply use future tenses, rather than have to reverse the relationship and use past perfect, or use some kind of contextual expression to provide the 'jump forward in time' and then get back ('A. Later, B. But for now C').

I must be missing something. Guess this will be a thing to pay attention to next time I read something streatched over a large time scale

ETA 2: I am now thinking of a story written mainly in future tense. I don't think it works well in English, alas (too much 'will'); but for something like Polish where the tense is built by transforming verbs, and so without annoying repetition, it could be a fun read.
