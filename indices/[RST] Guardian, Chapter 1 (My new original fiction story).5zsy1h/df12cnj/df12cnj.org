"Terra's feels nauseous" ought to be "Terra feels nauseous." I believe this is the only error in the entire text. I find the premise interesting. I like the characterizations of Puck and Terra.

Personally, I have a pretty deep-seated aversion to the use of present tense in fiction, it pulls me out of the story and completely destroys my suspension of disbelief and makes me hyper-aware of the fact that I'm reading a book, and I agree with [[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/sep/18/philip-pullman-author-present-tense][everything Philip Pullman has to say about the matter]].

It's /your/ story, and you ought to do whatever it is that makes /you/ satisfied with it because that's all that matters at the end of the day, but if you intend to legitimately publish this then you ought to be aware of the fact that a not insignificant number of potential readers have negative associations with the use of present tense in fiction since the vast majority of fiction isn't written in the present tense. You might very well already be aware of all that and made the creative decision to write in the present tense in spite of it. To quote a famous philosopher, "you do you, and I'll do me, and we won't do each other... probably."
