I liked it a lot. Two minor things that may or may not be intentional: I wasn't really clear what age teh characters were supposed to be, at different points I oscillated between 8 and late teenage. That changes how I interpret the protagonists behaviour.

Secondly, I kept thinking the protagonist was female because of the name "Terra", but the comments here seem to imply they were male.

General thoughts: I'm interested to learn how different the world in this story is from ours, whether its 99% the same with the magic happening invisibly to most people, or something more like unsong where the world is radically different.
