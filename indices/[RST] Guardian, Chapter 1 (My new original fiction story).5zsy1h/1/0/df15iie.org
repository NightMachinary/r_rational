  Incredibly fun to read, I love the premise so far

Yep, +1

  The bit at the end (!), as well as all the other little places where you injected context felt very natural, and it flowed very well.

Actually that last reveal was jarring to me, because it didn't feel like something anyone would actually say. Compare:

It makes sense for Terra to be thinking about the background. It doesn't feel natural for him to point it out to Puck explicitly.

  I'm unsure what Terra's motivations are for approaching the fourth "girl".

I felt like he was just looking for more interactions with fae, with the feeling of security that Puck would intervene if he was doing something really wrong. It makes sense, he does need to learn how to interact with them better if he's to ever improve on Puck's oath.
