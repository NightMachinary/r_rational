Glad you enjoyed it! Can you point to what made you think the characters were 8? I don't explicitly mention their ages, but this line is supposed to help:

  Puck currently looks like a lanky teenager about Terra's age

Along with the "pair of 10th graders" that walk by to give an idea of what year Terra's in.

As for their gender, I never realized Terra would be a female name: I'm really bad at coming up with names, and the only place I've seen it used is for a male character in Kingdom Hearts. Maybe I'll change it at some point.

  I'm interested to learn how different the world in this story is from ours, whether its 99% the same with the magic happening invisibly to most people
#+end_quote

99% the same but with the masquerade of magic and monsters in place :)
