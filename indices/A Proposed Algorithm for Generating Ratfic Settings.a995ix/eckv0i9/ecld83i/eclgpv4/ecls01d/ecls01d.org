Not sure. All my knowledge about Homeopathy came from Wikipedia and was filtered through my own expectation that it's probably not actually as stupid as it sounds, but also probably doesn't work to any intellectually honest degree.

So roleplaying as a believer a bit: The reason "like cures like" is that your body has existing adaptive defences against poison and disease, but they don't work if your first encounter with a threat kills you as they need time to learn. So controlled exposure to something dangerous lets your defenses adapt without putting you at serious risk. That the mixture's potency increases with dilution is a misconception, the reality is that a more potent agent must be diluted more to bring it into the proper range to train your defenses without harming you.

Beneficial substances usually don't provoke the same defensive responce, so you won't be in danger from limited exposure, though over use of beneficial substances (like most "mainstream" medicine) can cause your defences against what the medicine cures to atrophy leading to dependence. But that won't happen with homeopathic concentrations of even beneficial substances.
