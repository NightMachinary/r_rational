Yeah, but they say weaker dilutions are for local symptoms, stronger dilutions for general ones. Your idea of it being interpreted as a purification certainly makes sense, but while it does avoid saying outright that "more diluted = more powerful", probably because of how counter-intuitive and stupid that sounds, it does imply it.

Anyway, I guess to make some world-building out of this you would have to tweak a bit the rules. When the way it works is by definition "it only has positive effects, no negatives" that's basically cheating.
