  To clarify, I doubt you will find any actual seller of homeopathic remedies, or believer in homeopathy who is willing to defend the claim that diluting a substance makes it stronger in the general sense.

I wouldn't be so sure. I don't hang out with quacks very often, but see for yourself what the website of Boiron, the main company in the field, has to say on the matter:

I agree that it's not literally "diluting makes all the substances' properties stronger", but the idea is that stronger dilutions ARE stronger medication. Though they also magically never cause side effects because reasons.
