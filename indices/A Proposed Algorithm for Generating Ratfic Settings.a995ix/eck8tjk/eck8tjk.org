I love this idea. New age bullshit is some of my favorite bullshit.

If you don't feel like tracking down your own new age woo, try picking a random video from [[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritScience/videos][Spirit Science]] for this exercise. They make excellent, well-produced videos about the author's world views, which include seemingly every new age belief and new age themed conspiracy theory. I usually recommend the crystals movie since it's mostly nonsense supported by casual asides to even more outlandish nonsense, or the human history movie since it's an hour straight of the most gonzo D&D setting ever except it's supposed to be real world history. But those are actually so dense with this stuff that you probably shouldn't try this challenge with those specific videos (or at least do as OP suggests and stop early).
