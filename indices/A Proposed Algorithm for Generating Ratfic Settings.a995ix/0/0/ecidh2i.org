If the skull maintains a mostly consistent thickness as it wraps around the brain, its bumps on the outside correspond to small pockets of additional space on the inside - space which the growing infant brain expands to use. In this way, the causal arrow goes from minor variations in skull formation to brain capability and personality, not the other way around. The first experiments done to prove this involved intentionally adding volume by deforming young childrens' soft skulls, specializing their future brain development. Increasingly capable phrenologist surgeons can create hyperspecialized infants or apply desired personality modifications to entire groups. Some mental traits (those that correspond to regions not on the easily guided exterior of the brain) have remained impossible to manipulate for most of recorded history, but new surgical techniques allow for early brain growth to be guided to give more or less room to specific internal regions. Other new surgical techniques may have found a way to trick the brain into expanding to fill an artificially constructed cavity four or five times its original volume. The hope is that such an augmented brain will be able to create techniques to create a further augmented brain, and so on, and this will definitely go very well and nothing will go catastrophically wrong.
