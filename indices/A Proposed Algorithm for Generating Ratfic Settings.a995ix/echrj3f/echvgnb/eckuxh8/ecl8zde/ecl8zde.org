Are you talking about the general cosmology such as the celestial sphere? The idea of getting power through saying Names of God is kabbalistic; it isn't found in the actual Old (or New) Testament, so Unsong clearly goes beyond Christianity at least in that regard.

But regarding cosmology, I dispute the assumption that a Christian cosmology should be clearly grounded in the Bible. There're some things the Bible doesn't cover, and Christianity has always filled them in by observation. As C. S. Lewis said, when the Bible tells us to feed the hungry, it doesn't give us cooking lessons. If the Bible explicitly says something on a point, that's another question... but as far as I know, the Old Testament references to a celestial sphere are all vague or poetic?
