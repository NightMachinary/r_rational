The Hell in Unsong is a very Christian (or perhaps Islamic) conception of Hell. Jewish Hell (in the strains of Judaism that have a well-defined idea of what Hell might be like, and think it exists) is very different. Not disagreeing, just elaborating on what parts of the setting come under 'a few other things'.
