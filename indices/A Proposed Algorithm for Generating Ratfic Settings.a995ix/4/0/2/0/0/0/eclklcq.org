  It just says stuff that makes it sound like it was very likely written by people who thought of the world as a box with the heavens acting as a lid of sorts, but it never outright comes out and says that's how the world is, I think.

I agree too, as far as I can remember the OT. And the NT doesn't even hint in that direction, except for implications from Jesus' ascension and Paul's one reference to the "third heaven."
