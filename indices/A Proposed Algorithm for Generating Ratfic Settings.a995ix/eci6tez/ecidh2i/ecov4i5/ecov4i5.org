The starting point was reached when the Flathead tribe of Native Americans was encountered by European explorers. Though genetically identical to surrounding tribes, and no less similar to the European explorers, their society exhibited a unification unseen in the rest of the world. European scientists immediately began exploring the concept in new directions and Phrenology was born.

But the tradition of using a headboard to control the growth of the forehead produced a people whose capacity and propensity for certain thought patterns was shockingly uniform. Though they'd not experienced the inventive upheaval of the European enlightenment that was leading to accelerating rates of technological discovery, their unity allowed them to conquer their continent, and successfully repel the settlers from across the Atlantic. While European technologists were creating new generations of specialized people to fit the new industrial revolution concept of a division of labor, the Flatheads had created a society so dedicated to the same mindset that they saw similar gains in productivity and societal power through their induced harmony. Keeping up in technology often by stealing the inventions of the artificially more inventive Europeans, they remained a formidable world power.

Naturally this massive divide in philosophy between two sides of the world led to a world conflict. Those who were unified valued their unity and demanded others unite with them. Those who were specialized valued their specialization and demanded that others specialize. Both saw the other as a disgusting affront to morality. How could you force children to all become the same person? How could you force children to all be alien to each other?

The twist came as both sides petitioned the Asian countries to ally with them, and to everyone's surprise this created a third side in the conflict. How, they replied, can you force children to be anything they aren't already? Conformity and specialization are both abhorrent. They're both a moral affront to personhood. And so the conflict became truly global as each of three idealists failed to accept the value of the others.
