I think the idea of the world as a tabernacle is usually read in the O.T., but you're right in that it's probably not very detailed in its cosmology. It just says stuff that makes it sound like it was very likely written by people who thought of the world as a box with the heavens acting as a lid of sorts, but it never outright comes out and /says/ that's how the world is, I think.
