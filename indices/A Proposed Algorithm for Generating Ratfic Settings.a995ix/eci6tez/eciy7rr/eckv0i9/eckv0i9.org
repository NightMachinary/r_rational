A common argument I've seen about homeopathy and "memory of water" is that if it was true, then drinking any random glass of water would mean feeling the homeopathically-amplified effects of every poison and every excrement that was ever dumped in its source. I'd say "imagine how that would go" except I think life would literally be impossible in such a world.
