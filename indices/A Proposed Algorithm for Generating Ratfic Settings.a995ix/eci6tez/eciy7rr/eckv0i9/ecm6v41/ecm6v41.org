Actual homeopathic practices care about the intent and mindset of the person mixing the water, which means the universe where homeopathy works doesn't actually diverge from the universe we live in until minds exist.

It also breaks reductionism, hard: there are physical laws that specifically care about human minds and seem to act on human terms. But it's still a well-defined universe; it's not immediately self-contradictory, just absurdly unlikely.

So: water, specifically, has an extra property of memory^{*}, which is a weighted reference to a specific chemical structure. Diluting a substance in water produces a tiny amount of memory-weight for that substance. Diluting water in more water normally averages out the memory, (so natural water has basically no memory,) but when this happens it checks the chain of causality backwards for somewhere between five and thirty minutes (this has been surprisingly hard to experimentally nail down), and if it was caused by human intention, it instead spreads the intended compound's weight to the other water with /higher/ weight, up to 10x the volume and 10x the weight. Returns drop off dramatically if you try to dilute more than 10x, so of course chemists do this in multiple stages.

I'd like to point out that, since I haven't actually introduced a way to interact with memory-weight yet, we could be living in the universe I just described and there's no way you can disprove it. The next line will change that.

Water inside a human body, specifically, acts as a reverse-catalyst of any chemical it remembers, but only if that person knows what the chemical is. That is, chemical reactions that would be triggered by the remembered chemical but not use atoms from it will happen in reverse at a rate proportionate to the memory-weight.

When this was first discovered, people naturally tried chain-diluting various toxic substances. Some of these worked, notably most antivenoms, though until the correct dilution ratios were discovered, homeopathic antivenoms were frequently more dangerous than the venoms they treated. Many but by no means all medicines work on homeopathic principles, and these days few of them still work on "like cures like" even though this is still taught in grade school level texts. One notable drug is the miracle diet-drug homeopathic amylase, which can (but shouldn't) be mixed in your home using spit, and will let you eat sugary foods without gaining weight, but which also has dangerous side effects when administered in the wrong dose. There have also been terrorist attacks using homeopathic poisons (just about any homeopathic substance can be brewed to a lethal dose), but their effectiveness has been limited by the 10x volume rule and the need to inform would-be victims of what the poison is.

(Now feel free to find amusing ways to break this.)

^{*} This also breaks reductionism but by nowhere near the same magnitude.
