  That the mixture's potency increases with dilution is a misconception, the reality is that a more potent agent must be diluted more to bring it into the proper range to train your defenses without harming you.

But that's the essence of homeopathy. There are legitimate things that work the way you described - vaccines, to begin with, and "mithridatism", aka poison immunity acquired through small doses of the same poisons. Homeopathy instead relies on two ideas:

- looking at symptoms, not root causes: so to cure e.g. a cold you'll take a toxin, /any/ toxin, that would cause the same effects as the cold. It doesn't matter if it's the thing that actually causes it.

- dilution increases potency: this is the really wacky part. Modern practitioners try to justify this with some mumbo-jumbo about quantum mechanics and water memory, which is the idea that I brought up above. If you removed this, you'd have a relatively legitimate medical principle, and then there would be no magic at all to munchkin.

(as a matter of fact, yes, it absolutely /is/ as stupid as it sounds. More, in fact. The original inventor of homeopathy recommended practices such as shaking the mixtures on top of a Bible. And one of the most popular homeopathic 'remedies', Oscillococcinum, is literally an extreme dilution of a bacterium that doesn't exist: its inventor only thought he had discovered a micro-organism when all he was seeing was bubbles in his microscope)
