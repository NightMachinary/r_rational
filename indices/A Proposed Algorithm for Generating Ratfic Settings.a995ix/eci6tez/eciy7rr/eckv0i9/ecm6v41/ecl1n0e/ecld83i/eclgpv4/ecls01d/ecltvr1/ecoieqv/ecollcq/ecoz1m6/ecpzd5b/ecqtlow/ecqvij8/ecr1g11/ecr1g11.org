I did assume that, but also this is a thing: [[https://www.homeoanimal.com/]]

However you're assuming that Homeopathy harms the pathogen. Homeopathy is suppsoed to actually act on symptoms. If you remove all the negative symptoms that pathogen causes, you also remove the need to get rid of it. Humans have a number of benign microfauna living inside them normally what's one more?

Anyway you're also assuming that the remedy directly harms the pathogen rather than via a second or higher order consequence. When in a competitive environment things need not be so direct.

For example consider two colonies of microbes (call them A and B). They compete for food and have evolved symmetrical but distinct chemical agents such that each colony can tolerate its own toxin but can't tolerate the other colony's toxin.

Now, We introduce a homeopathic remedy to inoculate microbes against colony A's toxin. Both colonies (considered independently) get a purely beneficial effect with no side effects. However the consequences of making colony B immune to Colony A's toxin without also making Colony A immune to Colony B's is likely the extinction of Colony A as Colony B can now invade Colony A's territory and push Colony A out.
