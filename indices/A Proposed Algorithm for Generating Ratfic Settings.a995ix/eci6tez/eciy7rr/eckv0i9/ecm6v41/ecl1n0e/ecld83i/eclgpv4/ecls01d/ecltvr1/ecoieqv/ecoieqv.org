To clarify, I doubt you will find any actual seller of homeopathic remedies, or believer in homeopathy who is willing to defend the claim that diluting a substance makes it stronger in the general sense. Quackery tends to either appeal to common sense or encourage repeat business. Diluting things making them stronger doesn't do either.

I'd expect them to have an explanation for why the effectiveness of the remedy is separate from the potency in the conventional sense. And that THAT is the whole thing behind the "water memory" woo. Rather than an explanation of why some easily observable fact is wrong.

It's the difference between:

I put a drop of beer in this keg of water thereby making a keg of the strongest beer ever!

and

I took a drop of beer, then diluted it according the the proper practices thereby making a remedy (no longer containing any alcohol) which will cure your whisky hangover. I can also mix a stronger version that will also work for migraines but that costs extra.
