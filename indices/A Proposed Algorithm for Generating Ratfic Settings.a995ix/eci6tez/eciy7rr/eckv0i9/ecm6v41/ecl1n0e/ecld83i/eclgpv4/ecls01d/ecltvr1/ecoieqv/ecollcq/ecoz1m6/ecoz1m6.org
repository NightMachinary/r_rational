Reading that FAQ I'd say it supports my point regarding people not actually believing the dilution=stronger thing. Or at least, in the seller not being willing to make said claim.

In several questions they state that any undesirable properties of the original substance are absent from a diluted mixture. They also claim the dilution process is transforming the solution into a medecine, and they are (I suspect deliberlty) vague about what actual change in properties facilitates different levels of dilution being suitable for different symptoms. It would be posible for example to read that explanation an interpret the dilution process as a way to selectively remove undesirable properties from the solution by somehow protecting the desirable properties from the normal weakening caused by diluting them. In which case each dilution makes the remedy "purer" not "stronger".

They did take a different approach to explaining why the dilution is important than I did in my RP. Theirs is probably a bit more resilient in that somone who knows math could call mine out by proving the concentrations recommended can't have any active ingredient and my explanation required there to be some active ingredient. Theirs makes fewer falsifiable claims which makes it better woo.
