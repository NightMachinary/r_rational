I've always liked this idea; I actually had a very, very similar one back in the day, when I was getting into world-building. Only instead of going through occult/new age stuff, mine was more about looking through the history of science, picking certain key, fairly logical but ultimately discredited, and trying to imagine what a sci-fi world would look like if those theories had been true.

What would modern technology look like, if phlogiston, as it was first conceptualized, was actually a thing? How would the ecology of a world develop and operate, if Lamarckism had turned out to be the true theory of evolution? Stuff like that.
