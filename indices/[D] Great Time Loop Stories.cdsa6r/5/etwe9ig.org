[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341735.Replay][Replay]] by Ken Grimwood - what if you die at 43 and wake up in your 18-year-old body with your memories intact.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509784.The_End_of_Eternity][The End of Eternity]] by Isaac Asimov. The Eternity is an organization that trades between the various centuries to reduce human suffering. They also have to guarantee their own creation. A technician within the organization falls in love and learns that in the new reality planned for his time, his loved one will not exist.

Ted Chiang's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life][The Story of Your Life]] (the Arrival movie) and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223379.The_Merchant_and_the_Alchemist_s_Gate][The Merchant and the Alchemists Gate]] are both amazing.

Since you liked Edge of Tomorrow, check out the [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/62887/All_You_Need_Is_Kill?q=al%20you%20need%20is%20kill][manga]] or the [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/18511/All_You_Need_Is_Kill][novel]]. The manga is better than the movie and I enjoyed the latter.

I was way too young when I read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/624122.The_Man_Who_Folded_Himself][The Man Who Folded Himself]] by David Gerrold and was not prepared for the (sexual) plot. It was too long ago for me to remember if this is a valid recommendation ;)

Non-fiction: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36442813-the-order-of-time][The Order of Time]] by Carlo Rovelli is a short, physics/philosophy book that explores the meaning of time. I highly recommend it.

Media: [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856][Dark]] series, [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/][Los cronocr√≠menes]] (should be more known), [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/][About Time]] (a light, feel-good movie based on [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72695.About_Time][About Time: 12 Short Stories]] about time travel).
