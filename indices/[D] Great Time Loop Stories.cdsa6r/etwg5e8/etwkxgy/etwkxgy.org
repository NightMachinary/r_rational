I remain astonished that anyone is able to read Purple Days, much less enjoy it. I can understand why people are divided over Time Braid - it has great qualities as well as some very questionable content. And Wastelands of Time as you say is a matter of preference.

But Purple Days is so badly written it causes my eyes to bleed out of my skull. I sincerely do not get it.
