Starting in medias res is fine. Giving the reader a preview of what is to come is important in fanfiction especially, since the audience doesn't have a lot of patience. You can see it as a pilot episode if you like. I'm even fine with the blatant wish fulfilment and power fantasies. It's not like I'm trying to be a snob.

But you're right that the story affirms everything the author believes, and that is just bad writing. There's a whole segment where he riffs on Catelyn Stark and then all the characters go "hahaha that is so true she does suck". Ugh. It's not just annoying, it means that his characters don't have any life or experiences of their own.

But what gets me the most is that he obviously hasn't read his own writing even once. One read-through is all it would take to fix 95% of the spelling and grammar errors, and he can't even be bothered to do that. That kind of disrespect towards one's own story... I cannot comprehend it.
