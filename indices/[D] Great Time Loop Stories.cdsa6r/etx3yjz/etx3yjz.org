- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]], which has been mentioned below, is fairly well-known within the community, but has some... questionable consent issues. It does actually have the benefit of reaching a coherent ending, though.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][Chunin Exam Day]] is another Naruto timeloop. This time with Naruto in the drivers' seat. It has also been commonly cited as having been a big inspiration for Mother of Learning. It has issues, but has a reasonably strong start.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY][One-Minute Time Machine]] is adorkable, if not deep.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/timelooping-tinker-worm-fanfic-au.17681/][Timelooping Tinker]] is a timeloop crackfic involving Bakuda from Worm.

- [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] is a My Little Pony fanfic that sticks Twilight Sparkle into a timeloop as changelings invade Canterlot. It has a [third-party] sequel [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]] which involves multiple loopers, but I've never read that one.

- [[https://www.amazon.com/All-You-Zombies-Robert-Heinlein-ebook/dp/B008MOKW22][--- All You Zombies ---]] by Heinlein and the film adaptation [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/][Predestination]] involve a closed time loop, but not a groundhog day loop.

- [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IYITXE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Time Enough for Love]] is another Heinlein classic, but er.. it hasn't aged well. Stable time loop, not groundhog day loop .

- [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei][The Tatami Galaxy]] explores a time loop over the course of the protagonists' schooling.

- [[https://storiesonline.net/s/63138/magestic][Magestic]] involves a time loop of sorts with a big-picture how-to-save-the-world scale plot.

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/][Moon]] feels like a time loop .

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect][Butterfly Effect]] has a time-loop-like effect where the protagonist gets to go back and do-over things from his writings, and was shot with 4 different endings, so you can almost choose how it ends, Worm-style, for good or bad.

- [[https://storiesonline.net/s/57098/deja-vu-ascendancy?ind=1][Deja Vu Ascendancy]] is porn but has a sort of side-ways time-loop like effect going on, including several do-over opportunities. It has a rational-seeming or at least mathematically-inclined protagonist, who spends a lot of time in advance planning his heists and trickery, mostly visible to the audience. That said, milder versions of most of the squick issues from Time Braid also exist in this story, and it completely fails at having a decent ending. Oh, and it is absolutely massive.
