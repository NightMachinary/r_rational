It's an acknowledged fandom classic, but it blurs the line between "in the style of" and a straight port of the movie into Equestria. Some lines and scenes are copied verbatim.

Personally, I made the mistake of leaving a long gap between reading chapters 4 and 5, which may have contributed to not finding the ending as satisfying as others did. I didn't feel like I had a clear sense of why, exactly, the loop ended when it did and not after the first "perfect" run.

Also, it was sad how even at the end he wasn't willing to tell Rares the truth. I assume that that happens in the sequel.
