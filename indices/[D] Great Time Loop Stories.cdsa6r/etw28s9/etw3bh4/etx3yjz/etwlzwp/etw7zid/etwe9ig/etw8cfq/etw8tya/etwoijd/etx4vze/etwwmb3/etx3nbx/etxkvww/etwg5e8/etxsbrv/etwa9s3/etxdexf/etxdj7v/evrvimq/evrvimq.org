Don't get me started on that series.

First there's the totally unheroic protagonist, with a sense of empathy so local that it borders on object impermanence; committing shocking acts and not suffering any lasting guilt or consequences, let alone making any attempt to atone or make amends.

Then there's the twist, with no (or all the wrong kind of) foreshadowing, that the whole first story was actually an elaborately framed coming-out story; and an almost comically generic one, seemingly imported wholesale from the real world without regard for pony society.

Then there's the entire first two thirds of the trilogy being part of a predestination loop, which the characters deliberately adhere to; and the rest of the story revolving around the predestined events' consequences. Related to that is the incoherent metaphysics; seeming to employ the /X-Files/ technique of "if you repeat something enough, people will believe it makes sense". How did Celly know that her particular timeline was the one that Star Swirl would be summoned to? What does it mean to "tie off" timelines? Why do the Regalia split timelines? What did/do the apparent ultimate antagonists, the forces of Time and Destiny, actually want? Did they achieve it, and if not, why not?

Then there's the dropped plot threads. What happens to the untransformed changelings? Why couldn't Star Swirl perfect the loop spell? What are the secrets Luna won't tell? Who altered Star Swirl's letter, how, and why?

For a huge plot hole (or plot-induced stupidity), why didn't the trapped Twilight just follow the "Perfect Run" and /not/ use the Regalia? And later on, if she was always planning to betray her other self, why did the spell she gave her ultimately work perfectly?

At the end, why (besides more object impermanence) doesn't Star Swirl jump further into the future, in order to be with both of his wives? What will happen to Shooting Star's timeline, especially given the previously stated consequences of altering established history?

Glad other people enjoyed it, at least. It was certainly a page-turner in parts.

Also, "the changelings win and kill everyone in Canterlot" is false or misleading in a number of ways.
