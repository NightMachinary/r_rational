The -expression- of the main character in the second movie, during the first loop of the movie, was pretty much my highlight from the film.

Imagine going through the movie Groundhog Day, becoming a better person, making friends with everyone you met in the loop, escaping the time loop, having several weeks or months of life, and then suddenly ENDING UP BACK AT THE START OF THE LOOP AGAIN. She's -pissed- at everyone and everything and all that character growth? Not on display that particular loop.
