[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever][The Best Night Ever by Capn_Chryssalid]] is really good. The standout element is the emotional and narrative arc. Through the intersession of a time loop Prince Blueblood, a snobbish manchild in the series, must grow up and become a man (well stallion ;). Very well written and in the style of the original Groundhog Day in that the primary journey is emotional rather than grinding skills.
