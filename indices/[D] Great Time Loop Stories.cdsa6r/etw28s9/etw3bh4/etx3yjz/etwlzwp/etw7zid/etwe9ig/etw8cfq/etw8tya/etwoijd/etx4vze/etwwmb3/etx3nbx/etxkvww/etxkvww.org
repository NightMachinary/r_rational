'ALL YOU NEED IS KILL'

Either the original light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka or the (very faithful) manga adaptation by Ryosuke Takeuchi. Since you liked Edge of Tomorrrow, you should also be able to enjoy its source material. Personally, I liked the manga the most out of the three.

'Source Code'

A movie from 2011 by Duncan Jones. It's not your usual time loop story but nevertheless really good. Though if I think too much on it, the ending gives me headache...fucking time travel.
