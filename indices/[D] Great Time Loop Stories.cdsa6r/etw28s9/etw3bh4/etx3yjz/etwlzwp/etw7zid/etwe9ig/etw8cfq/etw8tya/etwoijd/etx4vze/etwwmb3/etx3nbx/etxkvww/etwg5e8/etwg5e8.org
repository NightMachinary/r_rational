State the obvious technique: Time Braid would be on many lists including mine. Purple Days is another fic that aspires to greatness and definitely touches it, but it's still running so we don't know if it will nail the ending.

Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon is deadfic and probably not everyone's cuppa, but I liked it while it lasted. HP&t Wastelands of Time, likewise not everyone's cuppa, likewise I happened to enjoy it.
