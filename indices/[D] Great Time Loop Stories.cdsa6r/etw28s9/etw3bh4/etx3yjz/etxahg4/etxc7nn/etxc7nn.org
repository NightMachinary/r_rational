Hard Reset is phenomenal. What makes it special is how the time loop itself is only the first third or so of the story, but the lingering psychological effects are explored in a way I haven't seen in other time loop fiction. Plus, there are two complete sequels which aren't time loops, but involve time travel.

Hard Reset 2 is a fork by a different author, and it's fun rationality-porn, but sadly incomplete.
