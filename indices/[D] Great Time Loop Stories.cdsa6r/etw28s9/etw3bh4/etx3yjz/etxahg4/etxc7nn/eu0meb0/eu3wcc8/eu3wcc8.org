As someone who made it through all 3.5 million words, there is a decent story in there, but it is in serious need of editing. The crazy girlfriend is extremely cringe inducing for the first 3rd at least. And the middle section moves incredibly slowly until the author suddenly decides to end it and accelerates the plot 1000%. Ultimately I'd say I enjoyed it, but it took me 3 attempts to get into it and I had to brute force my way through several sections. If the concept doesn't super intrigue you and you aren't desperate for something to read, it's probably not worth the effort.
