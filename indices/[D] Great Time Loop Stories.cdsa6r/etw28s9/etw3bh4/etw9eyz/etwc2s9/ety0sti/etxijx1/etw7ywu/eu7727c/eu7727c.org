Slight spoiler, but if you're interested in Getting the Hang of Thursdays, be warned, it turns into a really creepy HermioneXSnape fic. The spoiler here is indeed a spoiler, but if you'd want to know about something /now/ that might ruin your enjoyment of a fic when you learn about it once you're already invested, then it may be worth revealing. Discussion follows, spoilered. If it weren't for that there's a lot I really like about it; it's not your typical time loop fic where the protagonist uses the time loop to become obscenely strong; the fic focuses much more on the hopelessness of the situation, along with some moderate existential horror towards the end. But the creepy romance ruins it for me, and if I had known about that I probably wouldn't have started it (that said, I did finish it, because I was too invested by that point and the writing is pretty good).
