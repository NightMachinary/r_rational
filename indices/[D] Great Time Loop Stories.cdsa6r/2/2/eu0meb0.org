Re: Deja Vu Ascendancy

The preamble in which the author happily admits that his story is 3.5 million words and it takes almost 60k for something plot-relevant to actually happen, alongside a dozen "unique" grammar conventions is extremely scary. This guy does not know how to sell his story at all lol, it could not have put me off of reading it any more.
