There's a couple relatively obscure ones that I wouldn't call /great/ but are probably good enough to be a fix for fellow time-loop addicts.

Right Moments is a Ranma 1/2 time loop fic where Ranma gets cursed to repeat the day until he's perfectly satisfied with how it went. Ranma being who he is, that means he'll only be satisfied if he can accomplish a bunch of tasks with really high bars like fairly defeat the grandmaster of his fighting style (who is monstrously powerful) and resolve his series-long romantic crisis. It does a good job exploring the premise in sufficient depth to satisfy my time loop urges, though I'm not a skilled enough reader to judge how good it is apart from that, other than that it didn't repulse me or blow me out of the water.

Getting the Hang of Thursdays is a Harry Potter time loop fic where Hermione's Time Turner breaks and casts Hogwarts into a day-long time loop. It's probably not that unknown, but I bet there's still a bunch of people here who haven't heard of it. Snape is the main character and looper, and the story as a whole trends more to feelings of claustrophobia and low-grade cosmic horror than power fantasy. It's got some... less than comfortable events in it, but as a time loop story I think it does its premise justice.

On the more open-ended community side of things there's The Infinite Loops, a collaborative project spanning a lot of fictional universes to create an opening for authors to write small snippets in a flexible time loop universe. Basically, the world tree computer thing running the multiverse (From Ah My Goddess) takes a ton of damage from an unknown attack, and in a desperate attempt to stabilize things the admins start setting universes to loop, with an Anchor who remembers each loop and other characters close to the anchor looping occasionally. The universes will have to loop for billions of years or some other 'large enough' timeframe, so with loopers sometimes showing up in other universes or other variants on their universe authors have a lot of flexibility to write whatever catches their fancy. There's threads and compilations out there if you look.
