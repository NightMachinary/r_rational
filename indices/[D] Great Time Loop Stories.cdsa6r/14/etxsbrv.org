I'm surprised no one brought up [[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/happy_death_day][Happy Death Day]]. It's a horror comedy that was popular enough to earn a sequel (with a third installment in development). The characters are genre-savvy enough to make it entertaining and the whole thing is about fun rather than a serious exploration of time loops or philosophy.
