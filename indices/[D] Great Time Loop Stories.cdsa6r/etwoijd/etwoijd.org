I'm not sure whether you'd count it as a /loop/, exactly, but The Many Deaths of Harry Potter has him resetting to an earlier point each time he dies. Which is often, because apart from his reset ability, he doesn't wear any plot armour. Run down the wrong street when being chased by Dudley? Death Eaters take him to Quirrelmort and he gets stabbed. Walk down the Hogwarts Express alone? He gets shoved onto the track and crushed. Fight the troll on Halloween? This one's easy to guess.

And the reset point keeps jumping forward, without him having any control over it nor identifying a pattern except that there's a good chance that it will be too late to prevent tragedies other than his own death.

All in all, I found it quite a good take on, "what would it really be like to be the Chosen One?" (hint: there is a substantial bounty on his head)
