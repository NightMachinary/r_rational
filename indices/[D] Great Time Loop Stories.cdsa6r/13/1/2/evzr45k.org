If you skip over Joffery's speeches and read it with the effects his meddling has on the wider world in mind I think it's pretty good. And in truth, Purple Days nails the painful and hypocritical process of becoming a better person in a way that few things I've ever read could. You don't go from a gleeful torturer to the promised savior without a /lot/ of back and forth in between.

Personally, I found the final message of the Deep Ones deeply moving on an existential level.
