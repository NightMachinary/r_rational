I had to agree on Purple Days. Really didn't enjoy it and gave up.

I think part of the problem is that it started in medias res. We are introduced to a Joffrey who's already nice. He likes everyone the audience likes, hates (almost) everyone the audience wants him him to hate. I think that was a massive mistake for a Time Loop story. Time loops are about the development of a character - skills, yes, but more importantly emotion. By jumping straight into the end point, it skipped the point of the timeloop.

And yes, it then jumped back and started showing stuff in order but by them it was too late for me.

This ties into the "likes everyone the audience likes" bit I mentioned. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe if we saw him get there step by step, it would be different, but by opening with that end state it lost me. It just tasted too damn saccharine.
