Random shoutout to [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106188/][12:01]]. It's not an especially good time loop story or anything, it's just literally the first time loop story I watched as a kid so back then it blew my mind even if in hindsight it's probably terrible XD.

I don't know if it properly qualifies as a time loop, though it has many of its characteristic, but the Doctor Who episode [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_%28Doctor_Who%29][Heaven Sent]] is great, achieving the impressive feat of giving you temporal vertigo with a story that literally spans billions of years, something rather unusual in mainstream fiction. Too bad it was the first half of a two parter that had a rather disappointing ending...
