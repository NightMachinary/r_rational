You have firm evidence (in the form of extensive documentation containing many easily-confirmed details, which may be used to solve a considerable number of old unsolved crimes) that a machine has been created which, given access to a sleeping person, will permanently make them obedient to the user of the machine (ie, they will follow any order to the best of their ability, regardless of their personal code), at the cost of a typically small but variable portion of their general intelligence. (In the vast majority of cases, the intelligence loss is hard but possible to detect; in rare positive cases it is entirely negligible and in rare negative cases it's an extreme effect that renders them completely incompetent.) You do not possess enough information to recreate the machine. You also do not possess enough information to determine what's happened to it - whoever currently has the machine has covered up their tracks well enough that your evidence does not lead you directly to them; the original inventors of the machine are dead or disappeared. What actions do you take and what protocols do you implement?
