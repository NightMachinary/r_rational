Password hashes? Input 1 is a list of password hashes, Input 2 is a list of passwords (which you generated in order to create the hashes). Map it, then swap Input 1 for the list you hacked from the database, and get their plaintext passwords.

Protein folding? 1 is a list of a (single, well known) protein's amino acids, general structure, and effects, and 2 is a precise 3D model of its structure. IIRC, the first is well known in biology, and the second is extremely difficult, but "just" a problem of computation. Using the magic flash drive could cut the time to about 1 year (1 million proteins * 30 seconds each ~= 31,536,000 seconds = 1 year).

Atomic data? Input 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 etc. Input 2: the properties of Hydrogen, the properties of Helium, the properties of Lithium, etc... Use that mapping to see what happens with numbers like 119 or 258 or whatever.

Precognition? Input 1 = L, XLIX, XLVIII, XLVII. Input 2 = Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Baltimore Ravens. Map it, switch input 1 to LI, then see if you get the 2017 Superbowl winner.
