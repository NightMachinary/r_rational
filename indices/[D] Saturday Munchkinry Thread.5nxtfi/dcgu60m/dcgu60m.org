An 'immortal' person exists. They are immune to the effects of aging and disease. If someone kills them (or whoever the current immortal is), the killer inherits the immortality (including all new aspects), and additionally becomes immune to the means/location combination they used to kill the previous immortal, with the solution being semi-randomized.

If you killed the immortal by shooting them through the heart, your torso may become bullet-proof up to somewhat more than the caliber you used to kill them. You may no longer need your heart instead. In general, attacks along the same vector, to same degree, or slightly more, or any less, will no longer harm you.)

The immortality requires that the killer have a body sufficiently similar to an ordinary, unaugmented human body. Additions are acceptable, but if more than half the body-mass that 'should' be there is missing, the transfer will fail and the immortality will be destroyed.

You know the immortal personally, though you do not know who out of the people you know personally it is without testing. You know they exist, and do not doubt it. You know how the immortality inheritance works, and do not doubt it.

What do you do?
