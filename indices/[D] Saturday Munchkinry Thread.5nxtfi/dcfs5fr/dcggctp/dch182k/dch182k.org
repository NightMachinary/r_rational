Vampires are made of flesh and blood; they interact with light, mirrors, etc the same way any other object would. Your vampire companion is happy to look at a mirror you bring her, be filmed, etc. If the flashlight experiment is proposed after all that, she finds it rather undignified, especially in light of the evidence you already have, and declines to participate.
