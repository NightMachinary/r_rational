So, it turns out that vampires are real. Since "Our Vampires Are Different" means that there's no one consistent vampire mythos, what sort of things would you test and how?

Sub-situations if you desire:

a) Knowledge vampires are real is put into your mind supernaturally, but you know it's 100% reliable (conceit of this hypothetical). You also know that you are the only person who has been given this knowledge in this way - any vampire hunters or allies that may exist would presumably know about them, but it's not a worldwide "coming out of the coffin" type event. What do you do?

b) Knowledge vampires are real is given to you by you meeting a vampire. This vampire is cooperative to a point, and will answer some questions, but you know she will lie if she thinks it's to her advantage, and generally speaking "humans finding out my true weakness" is not a good thing for her. This vampire likes you for her own inscrutable reasons, and doesn't seem to be keen on killing you, but who knows how long that will last.

Goals: kill all vampires, or take over the world, or "merely" become rich and powerful. Your choice.

(Happy to GM if you'd like that, in which case I'll be using the specific vampire "rules" from my yaoi novel.)
