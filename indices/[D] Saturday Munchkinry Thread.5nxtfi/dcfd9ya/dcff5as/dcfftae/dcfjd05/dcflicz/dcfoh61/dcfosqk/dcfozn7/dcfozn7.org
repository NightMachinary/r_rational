I assume the opponent has no potential dirt that would cause a large portion of the voters to run into the "violate their moral code" clause of the mind control? Does the choice limitation on the knowledge source preclude some kind of what-if search to find a way to manufacture dirt?

Alternatively, could your protagonist do something to get the opponent off campus for a large chunk of the campaign? Or otherwise tied up, so they can't just spam their ability.
