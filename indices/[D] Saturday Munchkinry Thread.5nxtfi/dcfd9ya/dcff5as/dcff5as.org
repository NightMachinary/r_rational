/He does have access to a source of knowledge that can answer any question he asks/

Extract as much lucrative information as possible to build up a huge financial and resource base (stock market futures? winning sports teams? winning horses?). Also, extract as much information as you can about your political opponent.

There are two broad paths here that I can see:

1. The person with the mind control ability is, broadly speaking, 'bad', having done bad things in the past and planning to do 'bad' things in the future. Use cutouts and proxies and never directly contacting the mind-controller, establish clear evidence that you can use to blackmail the political opponent, and demonstrate it. Allow them to win the race for election, ideally don't even run against them (they will probably hypnotize you if you do). Force them to, while in office, fulfill your wishes in whatever important ways you wish. They will likely be able to further your wishes in this way better than you can yourself if you were elected and working without the benefit of hypnosis.

2. The person who has mind-control powers is, broadly speaking, 'good', and so are you. They will probably be amenable to working with you on betterment of the human race; team up with them to exploit mass hypnosis and omniscience for all of humanity's benefit - acting through proxies and so forth as above. If you disagree about specific policies or whatever, consult the omniscience source about factual bases for disagreement.

3. The opponent is 'good' and you are 'bad' - go see a psychiatrist and/or therapist and/or priest or whatever until good, ideally.
