Okay, this is a scenario for a story I'm doing that has me stumped for a solution. If you're running in an election against a candidate that can use hypnosis/mind control, how do you actually beat them? The protagonist is aware of this ability, but he doesn't have any magic powers of his own. He does have access to a source of knowledge that can answer any question he asks, so he knows of the limitations of his opponent's ability, like:

1) The person under hypnosis can't do anything extreme that would break their moral code.

2) The power works by twisting the victim's perception of reality. It's not that the user can order a victim and the victim follows a command. Technically speaking, the victim is still making their own choice.

3) It requires personal eye contact for thirty seconds. The user can't just do it to a crowd all at once.

The hypnosis works more like a sharingan genjutsu than Lelouch's geass. At least, that's how I want it to work. The only way I can think of winning here is exposing the user's ability to the public, but short of having the user confess it, I can't see a way to prove it to anyone who isn't already aware of it. Any thoughts?
