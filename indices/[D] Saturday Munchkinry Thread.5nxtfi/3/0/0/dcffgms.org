Just fyi, to your first idea, rainbow tables for reverse-hashing passwords are already a thing and have a straightfoward defense - for each password, randomly generate a string and add it to the password before hashing. Then store the string in plaintext along with the hashed password. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table#Defense_against_rainbow_tables]]
