Then he should abuse the source of information to build up a reputation for overwhelming knowledge and prescience. Even if he can't predict future decisions, he could still "predict" the consequences of decisions already made, things like Russia invading Crimea and whatnot. Spend an entire election season making prediction after prediction about the effects of policies, the behaviors of foreign actors, what topics the opponent will pivot to next, etc. Build a reputation as the best, most accurate wonk in history.

And honestly, depending on the scale of the election, the opponent's ability may not even be relevant. Even if the opponent was able to spend exactly 30 seconds with each person, with zero seconds between them, that's only 120 votes gained per hour. 2000 per day would be ludicrously optimistic, assuming he spends 16+ hours with perfect efficiency. In which case, your protagonist could easily have tipped off a news publisher to look for the curiously precise amounts of time spent with each person. YHou don't even have to expose their ability, just use the exact 30 seconds thing to generate a meme that the opponent is weird and clearly insincere.
