  Extract as much lucrative information as possible to build up a huge financial and resource base (stock market futures? winning sports teams? winning horses?). Also, extract as much information as you can about your political opponent.

The protagonist is doing exactly this, but got caught by someone before he could accrue much influence. He's actually being blackmailed into running in the election, so he can't just not participate. Also, he doesn't have access to anything involving the future choice of an individual being. He can know the outcome of a coin flip, but he can't know who will win a sporting event or stock market fluctuations. I kinda had to put that restriction on him because it broke the story.
