Looking for an online RPG to play with a friend of mine, I've been wanting to run one for a while but I finally recognized that finding that much extra time is unrealistic for me right now. Is there anyone looking for members for an online game they want to run? D&D or World of Darkness are the two systems we're most familiar with, but I'm willing to learn a new one if it's interesting enough :)
