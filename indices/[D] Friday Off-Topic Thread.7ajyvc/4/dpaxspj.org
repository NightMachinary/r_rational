What?  Only one post?  How odd.

All the worse that I have nothing to report, then.  I'm in a very strange-feeling conundrum, and perhaps venting about it will garner enough understanding to extract good advice from the good denizens here at [[/r/rational]].  So, the rest of this has nothing directly to do with Renegade, just a bunch of whining and excusemongering.

--------------

So I started this project over a year ago, in August of 2016.  My time has always flipflopped between thinking about how I want various systems to work, and at times prototyping or building tools.  Before this recent funk started, I had gone four solid months with a code commit every day on the weekdays and hefty code changes on the weekends.  At the end of this period starting a few weeks ago, I suddenly found myself without drive.  

I've been burned out before--I'm familiar with the feeling of revulsion, it's almost like when you eat pancakes for six weeks straight until just the /smell/ of syrup makes you want to gag, only for working on one's projects.  Trying to open visual studio or even one of the various google docs I keep info in makes me almost feel like squirming when I put the mouse cursor over the relevant icons, and I search for something, /anything/ else to do.  I say this because I'm familiar with that burnout, and this is something else entirely.  

For context, a few weeks ago I was promoted at my job, which lead to becoming responsible for several processes that until then I had kicked off but not maintained.  I've spent a month or so documenting, reorganizing, and revamping all the various projects.  I have worked no additional hours (well, except for that one time that I had to come in on Sunday) and, if anything, the amount of stress I feel at work has gone /down/, since now I'm in a position to fix all the shit that caused me problems previously.

I had also decided somewhere around the same time that I ought to consider my sleep more important than I had been, and made a goal to go to bed around 11 or so each night.  I then shortly after made the discovery that I had apparently unintentionally made a rule that I was to sleep through my most productive hours, and my progress on Renegade all but halted.  The obvious answer is to renege on that restriction, but at the same time I probably /shouldn't/ keep up the ~5-6 hours of sleep that I was getting.  My memory has always been fleeting, but I've been noticing more and more that my brain just flat-out can't keep up the way that it used to, and, well, it's reminded me a lot of the way my grandparents used to be absent-minded when they were still alive.  That frightens me, to be honest, more than nearly anything, that due to poor sleep habits I might be accelerating mental aging, and I /have/ to put a stop to that if that's the case.  Since keeping (mostly) to the 11'o'clock rule, I've noticed my alertness levels rise and my ability to think through problems increase, although my short-term memory is still shit.  

So here I am, with the majority of the hours that I was once productive in lost to me.  On top of that, I think that the changes at my job have been nothing but positive--which is to say, I think that I've been scratching some major programming itches that used to only be fulfilled by my work on Renegade, but now I have a whole /slew/ of poorly designed processes and projects that I am happily taking the axe to.  This increased job satisfaction means that rather than coming home gunning to implement some concept or other that I've designed that day, I'm coming home ready to just play with my son, maybe play a few games of dota, and then hit the hay.  

I would think that weekends would then fill the void, but besides the random Saturday or Sunday that gets filled to capacity with other things, I just haven't felt the need. I no longer have an overpressured valve that is desperately calling for release, I'm just...content.  And so I do whatever idle thing catches my fancy and never feel the need to boot up visual studio or open a document or anything.  

/And yet/, this universal satisfaction is itself unsatisfying to me.  I have shit I want to /accomplish/, and no matter how I crank the wheel I can't get the engine to start.  

So, I'd like to ask you for advice: how does one motivate onesself to work when the previous fuel for the fire was based on discontent that has been addressed?  How do I balance the desire to get things done with keeping my brain healthy via proper sleep habits?  Any thoughts or comments are most welcome.
