  This may sound dumb, have you tried just getting up later?

Not really an option, sadly. In an ideal world I'd work like 11AM to 8PM, but I have meetings that start at 9:30. Besides that, my wife has to take care of the kid all day and is begging for relief by the time I get home even at 6, so extending that time out is bad for her.

  Was there a specific itch, a feeling of "there should be rational games out there but there aren't so I need to make one"? Or was it just that you wanted to build interesting architectures?

A little of column A, a little of column B. I've attempted to rekindle here and there, but while I've found discussion topics that I get invested in, nothing has translated over to fueling actual work yet.
