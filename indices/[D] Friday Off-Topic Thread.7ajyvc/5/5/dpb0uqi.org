I don't think I could GM, but I've been looking to play a Fate game for a while now and the rules are easy to learn without being too simple. There are a lot of supplements for a ton of different settings, though I'm especially interested in /Transhumanity's Fate/ and /Base Raiders/. I'm also open to creating a custom setting with the worldbuilding game /Microscope/.
