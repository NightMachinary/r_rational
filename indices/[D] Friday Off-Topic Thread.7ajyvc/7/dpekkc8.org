I'm late but I don't care I'm excited BECAUSE I'm applying for a new job!!!!!!

New job is basically a sideways move with some different responsibilities, not really any more money, but it'll be different and i'm getting sick of my exact current role now and I think some more general and practical project management experience will really help me.

In Australia government jobs require a ~5 page document that describes, in detail, how you are capable of doing everything required for the job, so I did a first draft of that on the weekend and will polish it this week and put together a resume (the resume is the least important part of the entire application).

Even if I don't get it, the application process with help me apply for /my own job/ (long story) if/when I get the opportunity to do so in ~3 months or so. So that'll be good.
