  I had also decided somewhere around the same time that I ought to consider my sleep more important than I had been, and made a goal to go to bed around 11 or so each night. I then shortly after made the discovery that I had apparently unintentionally made a rule that I was to sleep through my most productive hours, and my progress on Renegade all but halted. The obvious answer is to renege on that restriction, but at the same time I probably shouldn't keep up the ~5-6 hours of sleep that I was getting.

This may sound dumb, have you tried just getting up later? It would probably involve some negotiating with your boss, and if you get both sleep and work then you have to spend less time on /something/, but otherwise it might do the trick (or it might completely wrack your sleep schedule forever).

  So, I'd like to ask you for advice: how does one motivate onesself to work when the previous fuel for the fire was based on discontent that has been addressed? How do I balance the desire to get things done with keeping my brain healthy via proper sleep habits? Any thoughts or comments are most welcome.

It depends on why you started the project in the first place.

Was there a specific itch, a feeling of "there should be rational games out there but there aren't so I need to make one"? Or was it just that you wanted to build interesting architectures? If it's the later, leaving the project aside for now isn't such a bad thing if you're already satisfied by your job.

If it's the former, then you need to find reminders that make your itch flare up again. Existing video games that make you feel "Damn, I like this game, but if only it were /a little more like this/, and it could have this, and that part should have been done this way instead", etc.
