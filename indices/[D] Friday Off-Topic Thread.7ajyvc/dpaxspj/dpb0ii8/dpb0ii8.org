Look at the success you have had. The benchmarks you have reached. The creative aspects can only be realistically held to benchmarks to a limited degree. For the technical holdups, you'd at least have discovered which avenues are a waste of time, maybe not as soon as you liked, but the lessons have been learned and now you can save your time or the time of your friends in the future.

Motivation comes and goes. The goal is to create and deliver a good product.

As for sleep, have dedicated hours for the project that you will meet if not exceed. You've got 16-18 hours per day within which to place that block. Sleep when you sleep. If you feel tired go to sleep earlier. None of that should interfere or brush up against your project schedule.
