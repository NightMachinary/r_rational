I don't know. It sounds like this book would have a lot of navel-gazing, and generally the things that people look down on post-modernism for, but maybe I'm wrong. I wouldn't be that surprised if it had interesting points to make.

Maybe look at the Rationally Writing podcast, since this is the kind of thing they talk about (though I'd expect your book to be way less diluted because of the format).
