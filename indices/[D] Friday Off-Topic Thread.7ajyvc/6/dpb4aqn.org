We've had arguments and discussions, here and elsewhere, not just about the merits of r!fic but about its very nature, and which stories are or aren't r!fic and why.

The genre isn't old by any means, but I think that it's aged enough that we can take a look at where it came from, what it's done, and what it's become (and may be becoming). I'm thinking of writing a book, one part history, one part analysis, and maybe one-half part speculation on my part.

The focus would be on the discussions about what r!fic is, since we've spent so much time discussing that, but I'd also like to set some of this in the context of, say, literary realism; I want to talk about the idea of ur-genres; and I think that there's some interesting stuff in how r!fic may be found in both original works and fanfic but was incubated in the latter, which is pretty unusual ('How fanfiction is influencing original fiction" is a really interesting topic in its own right, but I'll only be talking about it in relation to r!fic for now). Might also have a discussion about the r!fic community if I can get enough material together, there are some people I'd like to interview, and obviously it's going to have a hugebunch of footnotes.

Does a book like this sound interesting to anyone else?
