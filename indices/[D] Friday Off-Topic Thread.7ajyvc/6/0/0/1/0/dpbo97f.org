Thanks! That's really nice to hear. I'm not sure if I'd actually /sell/ this or just release it for free, but if I got a lot of material then I'd probably release a free condensed version (along the lines of a Slate Star Codex article of moderate length) and then offer the really chunky, full-of-footnotes-and-delicious-details version for, IDK, $1.99, or $2.99 tops.
