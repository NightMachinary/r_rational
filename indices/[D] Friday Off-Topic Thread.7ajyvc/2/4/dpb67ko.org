(3) is most likely the worst, but I dunno how bad (1) and (2) are versus each-other. I mean, is it worse to force someone to /experience/ their whole nervous system absolutely refusing their normal motor/mental action pathways in favor of some foreign owner, or to alter their nervous system so the same thing happens but they experience it (falsely) as their own will?
