(2) is definitely worse than (1) imo. Both cases result in your body doing the same thing, but at least in (1), you know when you're being controlled. And then, since the control is temporary, in (1) you can make plans to escape control.

In (2) you can't escape. Any plans you make are dubious: did you really make them? Or were you puppeted into making them? Are any of your thoughts really yours? Or are they lies fed into your head, steering you deeper into the unknown puppeteer's control? Were you ever really controlled in the first place? What if those evil thoughts were really yours? Can you say the blood on your hands wasn't something you chose for yourself?
