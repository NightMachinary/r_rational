It depends on what the thing is. If you make someone do some task for you and in the process permanently alter a person's mind to make them more diligent, that would be better than briefly controlling their mind. Ditto for vegetarianism or being more frugal. Conversely, if you permanently alter them to make them your slave, that would be much worse than briefly controlling their body, which would itself be much worse than briefly controlling their mind.
