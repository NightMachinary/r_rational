That's a rather vague question. What did you mean to ask?

#+begin_quote
  Comparatively, how evil are these actions on the part of the perpetrator?

  Comparatively, how frightening (or damaging) to the victim are these actions?
#+end_quote

*=are= is singular. =each= is plural. The subject of a verb must agree with that verb. A better way to word the question might have been =How bad are these situations in comparison to each other?=.
