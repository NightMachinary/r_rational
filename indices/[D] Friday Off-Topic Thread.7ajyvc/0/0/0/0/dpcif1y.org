I think for me personally, the characters were what pushed it over the top. They're not "best of all time" material, but so much more than what you'd expect from generic pulp fantasy. Kamahl beautifully subverts the "dumb barbarian" stereotype, Laquatus is incredibly hateable, and the entire archetype of dementia summoners is just so, so much fun, from Skellum to Braids. And the way each of those both embodied and struggled with their respective colour philosophies (think of Kamahl's friendship with both Seton and Chainer, who are very much at odds), is just beautiful.

Still think Kamigawa has some of the more epic scenes, though. Characters like Hidetsugu are forces of nature.
