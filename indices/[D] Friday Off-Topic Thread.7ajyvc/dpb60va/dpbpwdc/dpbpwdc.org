Willingly or unwillingly? That is the question.

If someone asks you to make them stay on their diet, you could brainwash them into staying on their diet, and that would be a good thing.

If it is unwilling, then isn't the answer clearly in the order you presented them?

1. Subject remembers doing something they didn't want to. Subject remembers not being willing to do thing, but were forced to.

2. Subject remembers doing something they didn't want to. Subject remembers wanting to do thing. Now has to live with the guilt of doing evil thing and/or paranoia that whatever thoughts they have are the result of more mental puppeting rather than their own.

3. Subject is dead, replaced by your puppet-mind.
