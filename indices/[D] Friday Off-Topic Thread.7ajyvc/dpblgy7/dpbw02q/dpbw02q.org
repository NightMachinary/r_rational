Partially relevant answer, here. I've read only pre-Mending novels (Odyssey, Onslaught, Mirrodin, Kamigawa, and maybe Ravnica? I know a bit about the last one, but I'm not sure whether I've actually read it). "Pre-Mending" refers to all the blocks before Time Spiral. Back then, Planeswalkers were basically small-g gods, traversing the planes and warping reality, not the kind of mortal mages the lore uses now. As an example of power levels, the silver golem Planeswalker Karn took some time off after the Weatherlight saga to /create a world from scratch/. (Mirrodin, in case you're wondering. Yes, that's why it's made of mostly metal.)

As you might imagine, Planeswalkers didn't duel much, pre-Mending, and if they did, it was in titanic conflicts like the aforementioned Weatherlight saga, which spanned five years' worth of sets. Then, the whole space-time continuum got kinda screwed up during Time Spiral, and as a result of the fix, Planeswalkers in general lost most of their powers. They're still able to traverse planes, but afaik, they're mortal mages in any other respect. (In case you were wondering, this is why Bolas is always plotting for some cosmic source of power; he got used to the god lifestyle over the centuries.)

But I haven't answered your question, yet. Except for the Weatherlight saga, I can't point you at any sources for Planeswalker duels, and I haven't read that one. I hesitate to recommend the newer books as well, mostly for the same reason. What I /do/ recommend is the Odyssey block books by Vance Moore, Scott McGough and Will McDermott, respectively.

As might be expected from tie-in novels, they're essentially pulp fantasy, but kinda fun if you're into that kind of thing, with larger-than-life heroes and villains of all colours duking it out for an absurdly powerful artifact on Dominaria, Magic's core "classic" world. And /all/ characters, even the barbarians, use magic, both in the form of spells and summoned creatures. To me, it's always been the depiction that was closest to how I imagine the card battles to be. I think if your standards for rationality/general quality aren't set too high, there's a lot of fun to be had with those books. And you can get them used on Amazon for pocket change!

If you haven't had enough after that trilogy, try the Onslaught block, which is a direct sequel that goes into somewhat more surreal/intense power levels with several god-like entities getting built over the course of it. If your need for Planeswalker battles is satisfied after that and you just want more Magic lore, I've always been a fan of the Kamigawa novels. (Yes, game-design wise, it's one of the weakest blocks, but the lore is really done well, especially the book's protagonist, Toshiro Umezawa, who presents a really well-done black protagonist (in the sense of Magic colours, not race).)

Imho, the lore is one of old Magic's strongest points. While the books were always an excuse to explore different worlds, they're also tied together by some pretty strong themes, like the colour philosophies, which get new and interesting twists every time. Thank you for asking, and do get back to me if you want to talk about Magic lore.

EDIT: TL;DR: Characters in the lore don't do anything remotely similar to the card game, except in the Odyssey block, where they do.
