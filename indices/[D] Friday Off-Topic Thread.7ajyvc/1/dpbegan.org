Well, seasonal affective disorder has made itself known again. It somehow always sneaks up on me, ready to sap me of my desire to do anything but sleep and eat. I've suffered from major depressive disorder before, and they're quite different for me, mostly in terms of how they affect appetite (depression leaves me unable to eat, SAD leaves me with a near-constant craving for comfort foods) and enjoyment of things (depression leaves me feeling hollow, SAD mostly takes the joy from active things like writing, leaving passive things like watching television unaffected). I guess I would say that under the influence of seasonal affective disorder, I feel like a hibernating bear. They share a strong desire to sleep the days away and general low energy.

So this year, I've resolved to be more active in treatment:

- Get better sleep.
- Take 300mcg of melatonin an hour before a reasonable bedtime.
- Take vitamin D supplements.
- Do lightbox therapy for half an hour in the mornings (I am still calibrating this; currently it's giving me a bit of a headache).
- Spend something like a half hour exercising every day.

So far, this hasn't really been helping, but it's still early on. I think the only thing that's left to add is cognitive behavioral therapy, which I would need to do more research on; there was at least one study that indicated that this helped with SAD, and given low cost that's enough for me to try it.

The big downside here is that things like "actually get the 'proper' amount of sleep" really cut into my limited free time, which I think further exacerbates the depressive part of SAD.
