How do you best maintain a transition to immortal existence for humanity as an immortal who can immortalize one mortal per year? Each immortal may immortalize one mortal per year. Immortals also exist permanently in the peak of health and also have immortal children. I mean unkillable+unaging+regenerative. Entropy is solvable in the long term.
