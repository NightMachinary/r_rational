I guess the utility function is to minimize the deaths.

Without considering using the immortal's children you would have achieved total immortality in 23 years, just from the geometric growth. Clearly the most troublesome period would be the beginning, as you must be able to assure that

- the immortalizer group is free to operate independently
- everyone is motivated to continue immortalizing people

If children can immortalize from from early age then one could think to ways to jump start the immortalizers at the begining to reduce the timeframe.

At what age one can immortalize a person? Do you feel hunger if you don't eat?
