This thread seems fitting enough for a discussion on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_%28film%29][/Oculus./]] (spoilers from here on)

Oculus is a horror movie about [[https://imgur.com/F7FKjhx][a large antique mirror]] that:

- seems to have reality-warping (mainly malfunction of electric devices) and mind-warping (hallucinations, rationalisation of actions dictated by the mirror, gradually increasing insanity, etc) abilities;
- tends to protect itself from being damaged;
- tends to eventually kill living things (plants, pet animals, humans) in its proximity (radius of influence /appears/ to be ~30 feet.) with extreme prejudice, often using the same living things as the instruments of murder;
- was responsible for at least 45 deaths in the four centuries of its recorded existence, the trail starting in London of 1754 (I'll maybe upload the death descriptions scene later).

If you were aware of these properties of the Mirror, knew were the mirror itself was (soon to be auctioned with a starting price of $10,000 not far from where you live), and had enough money to buy it but not enough for going Lex Luthor on it, how would you try to acquire, experiment, and benefit from it?

edit: [[https://a.desu.sh/rmqaip.webm][Here's the scene as a webm]] --- ~12min/~1gB, with some skippable parts in the middle (maybe I'll add a lower quality version later). As a bonus, try to count all the blunders and mistakes the protagonist made in her preparations. : )
