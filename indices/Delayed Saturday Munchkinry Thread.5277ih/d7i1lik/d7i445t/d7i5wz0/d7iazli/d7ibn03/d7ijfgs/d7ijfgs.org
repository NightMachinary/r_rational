The mirror isn't actually invulnerable, it just uses its mind effecting powers to protect itself. If a human tries to damage it, they find themselves unwilling and then rationalize it. Later in the film, it also manipulates people into protecting it from the device they set up once it had more power over them. The most dangerous part of the mirror is its intelligent use of its powers.

On a point unrelated to that, it was my impression of the film that the mirror doesn't effect electronics, it just alters people's perceptions so that they think they're seeing something else. The video cameras in that house recorded everything exactly as it happened, the protagonists just couldn't tell because they were under the mirror's influence.
