Reliably switchable/controllable invulnerability is actually even more interesting than plain always-on invulnerability.

Imagine if you could harness that and apply it to general products. Build products (everything from smartphone cases to bridges and rockets) out of tinfoil/cardboard/wax, then apply the invulnerability. When the time eventually comes to replace/upgrade the perfect unbroken product which has never required maintenance, switch off the invulnerability.

Heck, if the invulnerability protects against things like melting at high temperature or being affected by extremes of pressure, build products out of carefully textured ice or frozen air. Instead of throwing anything away or trashing it, just switch off the invulnerability and it evaporates.
