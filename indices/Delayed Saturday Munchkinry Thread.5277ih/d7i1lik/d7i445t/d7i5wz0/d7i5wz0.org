Based on the fuzziness of its known abilities, experimentation would seem to be in order. Use various forms of life from bacteria to plants and animals placed at various distances from it to see if there are any patterns in what dies when (orientation of the mirror, orientation of the planet, moon, etc, local environmental conditions, where the mirror is located on the planet) and whether it's notably affected by placing shields of various materials and thicknesses between the mirror and the subjects, or encasing the subjects/mirror entirely.

In addition, monitoring of the mirror's damage-prevention process might be useful. Can it actually be damaged at all? Does it regenerate? What does the regeneration process look like through an electron microscope? If it can't be physically damaged, what happens at the submicroscopic level when things (matter, various forms of energy) strike it? Can it be heated or frozen? Does the material(s) it's made of expand or contract? How about interaction with chemically active materials?
