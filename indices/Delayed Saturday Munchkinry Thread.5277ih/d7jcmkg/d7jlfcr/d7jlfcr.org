Newtonian, sure. Special Relativity, nope: you got yourself the equivalent of an infinitely stiff rod and can signal faster than light with it. Not to mention the question of how length contraction works for motions... General Relativity is even worse, as "parallel" no longer has a meaning except for things at the same point.
