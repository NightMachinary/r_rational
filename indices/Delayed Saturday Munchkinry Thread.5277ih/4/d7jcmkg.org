You can create pairs of magically-linked forcefields. The 'magic' of the fields is that they will always maintain their relative positions.

Their initial positions are up to you, but the fields must start parallel to each other

--------------

The idea is that you can apply force at a distance.

For instance, it's possible to build a magic staircase. One field acts as a step while its partner lies on the ground. They move together, so they'll compress the ground just as if you were standing on it directly.

If I designed them right, the fields should be mostly compatible with physics. Since they're always parallel to each other, they should conserve momentum. And they shouldn't break conservation of energy, either.
