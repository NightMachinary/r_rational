I'm thinking of a person holding one and spinning, and the other one starts out on the other side of the Earth, so it moves in a circle twice the size of the Earth every time they spin.

Even if energy is strictly conserved, it's a great way to launch objects into space - no need to carry the fuel onboard, so no rocket equation.
