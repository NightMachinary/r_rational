You only need to see a brief period of time during which you precommit to hold a piece of paper for past you to see. On the paper you will detail notable events that have happened in the future they have experienced.\\
However on the paper, /future you/ will also write important stuff that they read on the paper from /future/ future you 2 months in the future. You can see how this works, you must have forgotten the specifics of what he did in the story.\\
In the story the paper holds two messages, one from you one month in the future and the other passed back from the message farthest in the future that anyone can see. Basically the first message is your first message and the second message is your last.
