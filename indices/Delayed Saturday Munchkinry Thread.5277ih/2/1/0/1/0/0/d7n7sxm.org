I've seen the original, and read those responses. I guess it's a matter of interpretation.

Can you write down what you're seeing, as you see it? Or does "seeing" it require your full concentration? I assumed the latter; seeing a minute of future requires a minute of present. In which case the amount of info you could send back, and how far you can send it, would be limited by how fast you can read/write.
