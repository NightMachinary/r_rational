I assume that mind /reading/ is impossible, otherwise anything you do can be trivially subverted. I'm also assuming that perfect memory and memory modification are relatively rare and/or difficult, or else the world would have solved all of the easy solutions and there's really nothing you can do about it as an individual.

Subvocalize a diary to yourself, preferably the day (or week, or month) after the events in question. If you remember something you didn't subvocalize, you know it's a false memory. If you subvocalized something you didn't remember, you know it has been erased.

For more secure memories, store them as riddles/puzzles so that they don't have direct associations (Also, make sure you don't solve it early, so that the manipulators can't follow the new memory and delete it.). For example:

- I am the first in earth, the second in heaven, I appear two times in a week. You can only see me once in a year, although I am the middle of the sea.

- I am a pirate's favorite letter.

- What is the only word in the English language that reads backwards to forwards, and if turned 180' would still read the same?

- I am a pirate's true love.
