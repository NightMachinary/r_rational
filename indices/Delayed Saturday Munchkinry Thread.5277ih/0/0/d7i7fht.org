*Item #:* SCP-XXX

*Object Class:* Keter

*Special Containment Procedures:* SCP-XXX must be held in a locked room no less than 20mx20mx20m in size. It should be at least 10m above the floor of this chamber, accessible via a scaffold or catwalk for testing purposes. No living thing should be allowed anywhere within a 10 metre radius of SCP-XXX, including vertically, except for the purposes of experimentation.

Any damage to the chamber caused by SCP-XXX's effect should be repaired by standard Foundation remote-operated robots. Such robots should be removed from the chamber and checked for malfunctions by a qualified technician after repairs are complete, or after 6 hours of use, whichever is first. Document XXX-1 details typical malfunctions caused by SCP-XXX.

Foundation personnel who are inadvertently exposed to SCP-XXX must be removed from duty and given a full psych evaluation.
