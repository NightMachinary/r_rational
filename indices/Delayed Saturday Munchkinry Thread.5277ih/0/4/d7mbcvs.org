Having seen the movie, my instinct is "buy a gun", but no - we can do better than that. C'mon. Genuine magic?

Have it delivered, and remain /well/ outside the radius (preferably "other side of the country") at all times.

Get a couple of confederates to move it and set up equipment. Buddy system, one person goes in, one person stays out. Use chain (not that expensive. but tough) to keep the one inside the radius able to be pulled back out at all times. Then, honestly, basically the setup in the movie - put some animals and plants near it and film everything. (Using a camera outside the radius, rather than the film setup, just to be safe - although I don't recall it ever actually messing with electronics.)

What I'm saying is, I would /definitely/ die because I assumed the thing has a hard range limit.
