It's implied in the movie, and confirmed by the creators, that the mirror can be damaged by something that doesn't require human interaction. The protagonists attach a large hammer to the ceiling in front of the mirror and set it to go off when a timer runs out. If they had walked away at that moment, the mirror likely would have been destroyed, but since their goal was to prove the mirror had preternatural abilities they only used it as a fail-safe.
