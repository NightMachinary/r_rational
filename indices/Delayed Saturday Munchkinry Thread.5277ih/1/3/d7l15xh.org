Keep a diary. Turn back to (and read) previous pages often, checking for differences with previous reads.

Keep a note somewhere, visible to you every day, that reminds you that you have a diary, and why (e.g. painted on the inside of your bedroom door).

...this is vulnerable to a forger editing your diary, of course.
