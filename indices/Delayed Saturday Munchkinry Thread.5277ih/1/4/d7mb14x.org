For anything important keep a hash.

seeing as people can not actually read your mind, they wont even know how to manipulate your hash. and you can keep the hash on a computer for redundancy.

depending on what you feel like you need to protect from editing the hash function could be quite simple, how many people did i meet, how many times did i look at my watch, how many times did i use the predefined word X etc., and the frequency of the hash could go from every 5 minutes to every day depending on the level of temper detection you need.
