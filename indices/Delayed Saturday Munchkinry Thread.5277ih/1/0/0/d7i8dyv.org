Yes, mind reading would be impossible. At the very least, it would be completely impractical to use on somebody with this perfect memory, as the sheer quantity of memories would make digging through it would take literally millions of years.

In the setting I'm working on, there's only a handful of people with the perfect memory ability and an unknown number of entities with memory modification, but can be safely assumed to be extremely rare.

The diary method is solid, especially if you double the information with some sort of cipher. Even if the second copy was just using pig latin, it'd still be enough to defeat the memory manipulator.

The riddle method may be overkill, though. Since they can't read your mind, they can't follow memories anyway. Although I suppose it would make things more interesting if the manipulator was also able to delete "nearby" memories (e.g. deleting the memory of a person also deletes any memories you associate with them, even if they don't directly contain that person). That would make the riddle method pretty useful for small data sets (could take ages for a larger one), which I think is a good change.
