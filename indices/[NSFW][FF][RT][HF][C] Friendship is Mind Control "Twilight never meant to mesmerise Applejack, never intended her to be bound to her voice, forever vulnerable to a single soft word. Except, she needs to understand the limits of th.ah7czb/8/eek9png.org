I had been wondering when someone would post it here XD

As you noticed, I had mentioned in before, when the whole "can porn be rational" discussion came up, where I presented FiMC as an example if rational porn.

I'm honestly quite disappointed that this gets so many downvotes, especially as the main reason for that seems to be "I don't like pony porn", which isn't really a reason to downvote a rational fic on [[/r/rational]] - I'm not a big fan of science fiction, should I therefore downvote all SF works posted here? I'd expect people - especially on [[/r/rational]], of all places - to give a reasoned argument (like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ah7czb/nsfwffrthfc_friendship_is_mind_control_twilight/eeie12b/][/u/FormerlySasparilla did)]] to explain why they think FiMC doesn't belong here, but the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ah7czb/nsfwffrthfc_friendship_is_mind_control_twilight/eec1df3/][only (!) root comment to actually give any explanation]] is just "I don't like it".

Seriously, we can do better.
