  anthro pony mares

I am nnnnot adverse to mind control erotica. But I'm not into quadrupeds, and in its choice of vocabulary this fic skews more pony than human. In fact if you hadn't explicitly mentioned anthro I might not have noticed (though yes, there's occasional mention of hands and human articles of clothing).

When character from the show use their iconic voices, it gets pretty hard to keep /pony/ out of the mental picture.
