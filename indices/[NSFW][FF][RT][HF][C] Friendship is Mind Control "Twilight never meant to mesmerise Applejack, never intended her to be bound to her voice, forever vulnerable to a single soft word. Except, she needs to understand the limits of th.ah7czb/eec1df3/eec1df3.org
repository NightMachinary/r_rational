Let's get the inevitable out of the way; this is a clop fic (for the non-bronies among us, "clop" refers to pornographic /My Little Pony/ fanart or fanfics). And I don't mean it like a Harlequin romance novel, where there is 1 page of fucking for every 250 pages of build-up; the /majority/ of this fanfic consists of anthro Twilight Sparkle having anthro lesbian sex with other anthro pony mares. If that wrinkles your sprinkles, you can just go ahead and close the tab right now.

So why in the hell did I post this to [[/r/rational]]? Because the premise of this fanfic is that Twilight discovers a mind-control spell but she has no idea how to use it. First, she learns how the spell works through a combination of experimentation and trial-and-error. Then, she begins munchkining the spell. And /then/, she realizes that she is not the only pony in Equestria who knows this spell, and that she had better think very carefully if she wants to get through this with her harem and her free will intact...

Edit: I see that this fanfic [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6nce5u/meta_rational_porn_fanfic_does_it_count/#dk8qf3g][has been mentioned]] in this sub before.
