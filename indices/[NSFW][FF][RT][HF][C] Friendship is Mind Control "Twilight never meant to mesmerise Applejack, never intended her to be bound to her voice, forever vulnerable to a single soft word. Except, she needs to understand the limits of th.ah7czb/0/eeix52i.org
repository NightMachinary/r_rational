Yeah, I'll admit I read this. Sunt, the author of Mind Control University (which is honestly a better fit for recommendation to this sub, since it approaches all of the same issues in more depth and with no explicit smut, in fact [[https://fiction.live/stories/Mind-Control-University/uScpa3Z6TKhEjYhta/home][here's a link]]), described it as "the best piece of mind control fetish fiction he's ever read" or something to that effect. I remember thinking "well fuck, how am I going to avoid this now?"

Honestly it's not bad. They're anthropomorphized versions of the character, so the fact that they say "everypony" instead of "everyone" on occasion is pretty easy to ignore. Other than tails and manes, they're described as having all the right anatomy in the right places and most of it's up to the reader's imagination anyway.

That being said, I wouldn't have recommended it on here. Even moreso than Erogamer or Time Braid, this is porn. This is a story about sex that sometimes also has a plot interweaved between the sex. I'm not even sure that I'd recommend it as porn to anyone who isn't either a brony or a hypnofetishist. If you aren't either one or the other, then I'm not sure how it holds up. I'm also not saying don't read it, I'm just saying that I'm not sure, because I have an obviously biased perspective. I've enjoyed some absolute garbage writing that happened to perfectly suit my kink, but that's not the same as something actually being well written.
