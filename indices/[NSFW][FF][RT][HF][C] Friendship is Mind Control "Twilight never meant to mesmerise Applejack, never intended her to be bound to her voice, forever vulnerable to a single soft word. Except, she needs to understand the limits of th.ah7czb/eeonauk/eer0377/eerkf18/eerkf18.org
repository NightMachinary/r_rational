I understand your issue with later recontextulisation, it's a tough one to figure out what to do with especially on web serials, but my position and one I think is the only reasonable is that there has to be published recontextulisation before the story can be posted. You can't post 6 books before the 7th book which reveals the explanation of the sheer stupidity has been published, otherwise you're just posting irrational content with a potential future payoff.
