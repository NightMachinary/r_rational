Not interested in this but I have no issue with it being on the subreddit and while plot is the primary driver of rationality I don't think that overly descriptive texts should be excluded, or ones that have sex scenes which basically amount to the same thing (non-rational content to rational content ratio).

Maybe some would say there's a point where you need to read 200 pages of poems and descriptions and/or sex scenes before you have an action that is qualified as rational but in my opinion as long as the actions that do exist are rational it fits, even if people uninterested in poems, description, sex scenes, or what have you, would be better off simply reading a summary.
