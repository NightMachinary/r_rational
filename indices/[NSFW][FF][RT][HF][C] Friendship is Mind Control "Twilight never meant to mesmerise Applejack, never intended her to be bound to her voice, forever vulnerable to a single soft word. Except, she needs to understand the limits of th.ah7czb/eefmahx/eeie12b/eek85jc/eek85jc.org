  this one is mostly just porn

That simply is not the case. It has a lot of pornographic elements, especially in its first half, but it devotes just as much time to the plot even then, and by the second half (starting with Past Sins), the plot takes over and porn only occurs occasionally. There are entire chapters in this without any pornographic elements.

Is it more pornographic than Time Braid? Yes, definitely. Is it a work with a distinct rational plot? Most certainly. And as the definition of rational fiction doesn't include a clause about such a work needing to be non-pornographic, well, FiMC is qualified for this [[/r/rational]].
