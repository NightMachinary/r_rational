I read enough of it to think that the plot is pretty poor [edit: or rather, not comporting to [[/r/rational]]'s usual standards], though it's possible that later parts of the story somehow recontextualize earlier parts. Most of the plot is propelled forward by Twilight repeatedly making trivially obvious mistakes, and her primary focus is on having sex with the other characters (rape, by my standards) rather than learning more. There are also a bunch of contrived coincidences.
