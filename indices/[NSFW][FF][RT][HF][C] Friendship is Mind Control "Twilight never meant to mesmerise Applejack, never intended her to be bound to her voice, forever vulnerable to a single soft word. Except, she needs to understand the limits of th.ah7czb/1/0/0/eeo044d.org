  Ultimately it's a very gatekeepy argument which is probably why I don't feel comfortable making it. If the mods are cool with it I'm not going to argue, but if I had to give a vote this is one of the few I'd want to see some exceptional evidence about before I gave it any kind of "rational fic" sub stamp of approval.

I wouldn't say that the mods are "cool with it", we just don't have any existing rules that would prohibit it, and in an ideal world, if people see something that they don't like or doesn't fit, they downvote it, and the curation is done that way (ideally with a message saying why it was downvoted).

Your humble mods /don't actually have the time/ to quality check everything that's posted here, and having the mods try to sort things into "rational" or "rational adjacent" or "not rational" is a rabbit hole that we couldn't fit down even if we wanted to. (We /do/ sometimes police discussion threads, removing the low effort ones, or redirecting people when they should have posted in one of the weekly threads, but that's a lot easier, because it doesn't require reading tens of thousands of words to make a judgment call.)

I specifically approved this post after it was removed by Automoderator because it's not in violation of our rules. I hope that if people would like to see less of any content in this sub, they downvote it (which I did, after reading the first chapter).
