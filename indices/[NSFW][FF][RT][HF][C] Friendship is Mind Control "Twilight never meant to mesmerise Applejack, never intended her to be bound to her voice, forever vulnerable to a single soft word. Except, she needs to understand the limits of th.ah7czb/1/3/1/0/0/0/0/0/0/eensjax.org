I had to go back to get context, and yeah , you are definitely correct that Sakura is not a good person, and she does things that are horrifying, yet despite the lack of our values set she's trying and might end up with a value set we could respect.

You're damn right that the original setting is about as dark ages horrifying as you can get with near /transhumans/ as the characters and victims.
