Thanks for giving a proper review, for those of us too hesitant to actually read it. I'll also check out mind control University when I'm free.

Also if you like mind control stuff [[[https://gamejolt.com/games/adventure-high/191489]]] (Adventure High) is a NSFW videogame where you play as a character with mind control, which has a lot of branching paths and overall is quite well written for a game.
