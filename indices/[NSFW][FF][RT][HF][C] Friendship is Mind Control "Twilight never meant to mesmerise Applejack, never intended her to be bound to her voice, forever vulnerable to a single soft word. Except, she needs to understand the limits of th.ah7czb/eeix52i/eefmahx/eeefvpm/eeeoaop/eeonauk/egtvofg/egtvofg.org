Thanks for sharing!

I both like and dislike how this turned into a meta-discussion of perverse and emphatically sexual ratfics. Personally, I tend to enjoy those: I love the erogamer, enjoy time braid, and I'm excited to have discovered a rational my little pony mind-control erotica. That's some kinky stuff.

IMO, it's clear that rational fiction is defined by whether the characters act rationally, with coherent personal goals or at least realistic psychology, when they empirically approach unanswered questions, that sort of thing...*when* their thinking and decision making is the current focus of the story. You don't disqualify a ratfic by fitting in *too much* of another theme that is of itself perpendicular to rationality, such as fighting or scheming or sex; only irrationality and making characters hold the idiot ball to serve the needs of the plot do that. Personally, long kinky sex scenes interspaced with sound reasoning and decision making to move from each one of those to the next sounds like a perfectly valid sub-genre of ratfic, and like something I might enjoy reading!
