Well it's not like down votes are that big of a deal in a relatively small sub , or that there's is a clear criterion of when to downvote something.

You could just downvote all sf stuff, other people that likes it would upvote. And yes we can also use it as a measure of how much people approve of something being on the sub.

But we haven't officially decided what reddit karma is for , other that it's not for signaling that you disagree whith someone. So I don't think it's so bad for people to downvote stuff that they don't like.
