I've had that same problem before, not just with anthro pony fanfics but with any written fiction where my initial impression of what the characters look like contradicts their official appearance (as canonized in book covers, movie adaptations, etc...). My solution, when reading online at least, is to keep another tab with an accurate depiction of what the characters look like open, and refer to it whenever my mental picture of what the characters should look like starts to slip, until I internalize what the characters' appearances are supposed to be (in this case, [[https://derpibooru.org/1816822][anthro]] [[https://derpibooru.org/609132][images]] of the mane six).
