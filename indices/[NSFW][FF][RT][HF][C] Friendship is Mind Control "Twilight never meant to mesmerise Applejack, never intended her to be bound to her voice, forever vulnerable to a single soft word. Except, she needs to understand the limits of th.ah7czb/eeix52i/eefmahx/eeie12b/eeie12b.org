I mean, I wouldn't say that the objection is that it's about /status./ We've had MLP fic in here, and some of it makes the recommendation lists practically every month (hello Friendship is Optimal, hello Maretian). We've had plenty of vaguely NSFW fic in here, though it's rarely the explicit focus of the story.

I think the objection, if there really can be said to be any in a thread with only 16 comments half of which are the OP, is that this one is mostly /just/ porn. For me, I come to this sub to get fiction recommendations because there's a pretty good hit ratio- out of every ten stories people recommend on here I find two or three I like. When the sub starts to blur the line on what actually counts as ratfic and people start posting recs for terrible manga or the latest anime fic-stravaganza, that ratio goes down. Pony pornfic is the kind of thing that'd have to be really /exceptionally/ rational to clear the bar of "sub-worthy" for me, because there's /so much/ of it and just kind of allowing it willy-nilly is likely to dilute the pool of stuff I'd consider rational and worth reading still further.

Ultimately it's a very gatekeepy argument which is probably why I don't feel comfortable making it. If the mods are cool with it I'm not going to argue, but if I had to give a vote this is one of the few I'd want to see some exceptional evidence about before I gave it any kind of "rational fic" sub stamp of approval.
