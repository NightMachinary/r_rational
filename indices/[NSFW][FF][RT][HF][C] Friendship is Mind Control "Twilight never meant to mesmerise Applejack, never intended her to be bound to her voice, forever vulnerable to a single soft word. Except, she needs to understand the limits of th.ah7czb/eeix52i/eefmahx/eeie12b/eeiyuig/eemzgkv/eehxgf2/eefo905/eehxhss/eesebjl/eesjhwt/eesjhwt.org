Take a look at the wiki pages for [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sakura_Haruno][Sakura]], [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki][Naruto]], [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha][Sasuke]], [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hinata_Hy%C5%ABga][Hinata]], and [[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ino_Yamanaka][Ino]]. They are all listed as being 12-13 at the time of part I, which is when the Chunin exam takes place. /Time Braid/ never contradicts this, and in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][chapter 1]] Sakura explicitly mentions that she is 13 (and that when she uses Naruto's Sexy Technique on herself, she looks like she has aged to about 16).

Sakura loses her virginity to Sasuke in a threesome with Ino in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/2/Time-Braid][chapter 2]]; both of them are non-loopers, and Sakura has been looping for less than 6 months at that point (she spends 3 days trying to tell her superiors about the loop, then decides to try passing the exam; she makes it a week into the exam, then gets disqualified after a double knockout with Ino; she has a breakdown that lasts for several days, then decides to try the exam again; it takes her 2 months to work her way back to fighting Ino, then she spends 1 month training with Ebisu; she is killed in the invasion and resets, then decides to try seducing Sasuke instead; she spends 3 weeks asking him out with no results, and a few more days going on dates with other boys; she talks to Ino and the two decide to seduce Sasuke at the same time using the Sexy Technique, which works).

The characters in /Time Braid/ do not act like children, but neither do canon characters. The difference is that canon characters only act like adults when it comes to fighting (typical for a shonen manga), while the characters in /Time Braid/ act like adults when it comes to fucking as well. Whether this is a realistic way for child soldiers to behave or not is up to you, but these are definitely not the smothered, overprotected children of a 21st century first world country.
