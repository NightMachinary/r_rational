So are your saying it's unrealistic, that minor humans in that situation would do that, given the circumstances, or you don't like it and dont want anyone else to read it? Not trying to be a pendant, but you've said this doesn't belong in the community. I understand where you could be coming from puritanically, but I've changed a lot of opinions I had from puritanical origins. I'm uncertain if moral outrage about minors engaging with minors where the writing seems to not be for purile purposes (at least it's pretty tame) is warranted.
