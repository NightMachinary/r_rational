Man goes to the afterlife, gets assigned a subby succubus, has adventures. Good amount of world-building, which is why it used to be posted here. Though IIRC it eventually fell out of favour for having too high a porn-to-rationality ratio.

Glowfics, specifically the [[https://glowfic.com/boards/1][Effulgence]] and [[https://glowfic.com/boards/18][Silmaril]] continuities.

Sort of sequels to the ratfic [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]]. It turns out Bella is not an individual, she's a /pattern/. A Bella shows up in a wide variety of fanfics and original settings, where she (generally) acquires blatantly unfair amounts of magic, takes over the world, and dates someone interesting. Eventually, magic breaks the boundaries between worlds and the Bellas (including /Luminosity/!Bella, in those continuities) start meeting each other and solving each other's problems.

(If you're reading The Erogamer, this is what the "[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-26#post-1307983][From Sheen to Glow]]" perk is about.)

I don't /recommend/ Glowfic, mind. It's not for everyone. It's written by two authors as forum roleplay, /very/ long, uneven in quality, and optimised for exploring personal interaction rather than advancing plot in a satisfying manner.
