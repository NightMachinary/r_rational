I was more leaning into Power tripping super users.\\
because the warp is obviously stronger than the imperium, so early super user have an enormous advantage in keeping their personal power and amassing more.

I likely timeline would be :\\
- classic "virtual" versus "material" debate that veer to war\\
- virtual win, they create their paradise\\
- the first super user came about, create false history in the virtual world in order to legitimize existance, create super species to protecte backdoor access, invite a friend to stave off loneliness/lack of creativity, name themselves Mork and Gork.\\
-others super user came about and fight each other in order to keep power. the one with better planning, better warcapability, easiest concept to understand win (in order : Tzeentch , Nurgle , Khorne )\\
-at the same time, non-super user find way to fight off super user (like - super computer simulation that looked like premonition for eldar, ultra resistance for necron, numbers for human)\\
- then you have the latest super user who found a new backdoor via synergized emotional emulation data-overflow (Slaneeshi)

and among all of that you have strange min-max player of the materium that are the cosmic "god" (C'tan and other such entity)\\
the tyranid is either that the galaxy computer that simulate the materium is in contact with an older galaxy computer and is in the mist of being comverted, or there is a fundamental flow in the computer way of emulating the materium that break the world and that is not patched by the current super user because they are too occupied by other super user.
