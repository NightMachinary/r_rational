Help me out with some timeline stuff.

August or September of 2020, Earth is invaded by aliens. Think "portal opens, aliens pour out and start eating people" kind of thing. Military response happens but conventional weapons aren't super effective. (I'm going for an almost magical girl sort of setting so "shoot it with guns" isn't a viable solution, even though they do try.)

By 2034, the United States and several other major nations have fallen and begun to rebuild, some on a much smaller scale.

My question is, what needs to happen in those fourteen years? What kind of events need to happen, what kind of infrastructure needs to fail, to collapse a major modern empire in under a decade and a half? Assume nuclear war is still not a serious option, but opportunistic invasion by foreign countries along with the actual alien invasion is. (I'm actually thinking that an unstable President giving the order to nuke an American city after it falls to the aliens factors in, but I'm not sure how heavily it would.)
