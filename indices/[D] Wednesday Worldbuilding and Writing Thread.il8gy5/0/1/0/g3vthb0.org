The aliens are functionally nonsentient. Physically they're described as lizard- or bug-like, while the way they spread is more like a plant: in ebb-and-flow patterns. They're largely indifferent to humans except that we constitute an easy source of biomass to be reprocessed to make more aliens.

You can largely consider the aliens to be of the "mindless and/or monstrous" persuasion.

I'm not trying to get into politics in terms of people doing things, only in terms of the infrastructure of government. Like you said, that fractal nature means that I need to have a lot of things go wrong fairly quickly, but /only/ down to the state level, for my needs. I know enough about the fictional personalities I want to represent, but I'm less well-versed in the actual structure of things, so that's a very helpful insight.
