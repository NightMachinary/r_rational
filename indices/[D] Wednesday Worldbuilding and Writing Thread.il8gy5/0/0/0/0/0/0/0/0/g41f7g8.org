I don't know that much about it myself, just that it's in the rust belt where there'd be a lot of heavy industry cities nearby, and if the invasion spread east from there it could encompass a lot of cities (columbus, cleaveland, pittsburgh) and eventually washington. philly and new york are just past that. that's a pretty big % of industry in the US while restricting it to less than 20% of the landmass. Assume it gets as far as New york, chicago, and St. Louis but stalls out at the rivers and you've gutted a lot of the US's manufacturing and Federal Government, plus all overland transport of goods, without having to wipe out the whole country.
