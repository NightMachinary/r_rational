The thing that makes a state a state is its monopoly on the perceived-legitimate use of violence. Once that's broken, whatever new armed group is providing government services will become the new state; or multiple states if that's competing groups.

In your alien invasion scenario, I think the fastest way for the US to fall apart would be if it lost a significant chunk of ground, prompting an internal refugee crisis. Something like losing a chunk of the southwest, large scale displacement into California, a geographically-charged disagreement on whether to commit forces to resettling folks or to fighting the aliens, and failure to succeed at either. Then the de-facto government becomes whichever armed groups successfully relocate refugees and repel further alien invasions. After that you need a few years of those groups raising their own flags and doing the work of governing before it becomes official.

The US's empire would fall apart during this, since the various subordinate states would see the same loss of legitimacy and start their own resistance and revolution movements. The US's carrier groups are a bit of a wild-card, where they're very beholden to the existing government, which is making decisions they might not agree with, and the supply chain to keep them all operational would be failing. So if one went mercenary or rogue, that'd be a possible source of sudden extra power somewhere else in your story.
