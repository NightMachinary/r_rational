[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kumKtY1n7Mo][This video]] is a fairly good overview of Cincinnati as a city/urban area, but doesn't get into some of the smaller cultural stuff. A few other, minor things that might help:

1. Cincinnati is part what they call the Tri-State Area, which includes Kentucky and Indiana (plus, obviously, Ohio). Like a lot of mid-sized Midwest cities, a lot of people live in suburbs and then commute in for either work or entertainment.
2. Cincinnati was a major part of the Underground Railroad and the abolition of slavery, and there are a number of landmarks/historical connections to it.
3. Cincinnati chili is their most iconic dish, which is basically a more runny type of spiced chili served over spaghetti noodles with cheese and raw onion.
4. There's a long history of racial tension in the city, though like a lot of race stuff, it's complicated and has deep historical and demographic roots.
5. Cincinnati has bled off a lot of industry over the years, and like a lot of cities, has been trying to find replacements for it, doing a bit better than some of the others.

(I lived in Cincinnati until I was ten years old, and have been back a few times since then, so I apologize if any of this is out of date. A lot of what applies to Cincinnati also applies to mid-sized Midwestern cities.)
