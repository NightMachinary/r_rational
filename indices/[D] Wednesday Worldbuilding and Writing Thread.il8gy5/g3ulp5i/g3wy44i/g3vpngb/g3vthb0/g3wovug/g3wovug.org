OK, assuming that the Aliens are basically a fast moving zombie horde:

Lots of supply chains are Just In Time Supply with little redundancy. This will quickly fall apart and (where it recovers) be reversed to have many more redundant storage. But before that .... Cities can run out of gas in a day or two (many gas stations refill multiple times per day).

The federal government has some massive stockpiles (the strategic oil reserve, etc), but their ability to deliver during the opening days will be significantly curtailed. Some states are going to be winners and some will be losers. It is not unreasonable for some locals to basically grab whatever they can to fight and survive. And the army (etc) will be busy.

People will be reluctant to "punish" people who maybe didn't do anything by the book. And commanders will be loathe to put their soldiers to position where they may have to attack their hometown/state/etc. Look at the percentage of soldiers in WWII wouldn't even fire their weapons. And we didn't particularly like our enemies. Now that they are just random other Americans who (we assume) probably wouldn't have fractured without an alien attack ... ....

So ... it's a question of political will. If (say) 20% of the states fragment, particularly if they do not make a declaration but just kind of say "Yeah, we're americans, but right now we're busy fighting aliens, so we can't be bothered to help remit the payroll taxes to DC .... we trust our people are doing the right thing..."

Would you (as a leader) want to attack your fellow humans in that situation? Sure. But it probably wouldn't poll well during a hot war.
