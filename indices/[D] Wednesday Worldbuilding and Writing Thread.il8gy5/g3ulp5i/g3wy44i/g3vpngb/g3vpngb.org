You need to answer a couple questions first, namely, who are the aliens, and what are their goals? Do they want to preserve our infrastructure, steal our resources, subjugate us, re-educate us, kill us, or what?

How a war is conducted depends a lot on the goals of that war. War tends to be fairly costly for whoever is waging it, so they'll usually want to make sure that it's "worth it", whether that's in terms of their economy or ideology. A war where aliens come in with the intent to round up and kill all the humans looks /very/ different where their goal is to command human industry and labor for their own desires.

If these aliens are mindless and/or monsters, then that's quite a bit different, and response should (in theory) look more like disaster response, with the fallout being a bit different.

As far as political stuff (and bearing in mind that discussion of U.S. politics has a general ban in this sub, largely to avoid the culture war), there are two primary scenarios. The first is that the mechanisms of governance break down so completely that there is a temporary or prolonged state of anarchy. That seems very unlikely to happen across the board, since I would expect the impacts to be very unevenly distributed, depending on what the specific scenario is. That said,

The second scenario is one in which something or the other causes a fracture in the United States, splitting off states from each other. I would suggest reading [[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states][the declaration of causes for the seceding states]] from the Civil War, which gives a look at grievances given by states prior to their withdrawal from the Union. For that to happen in the modern day, even in response to alien invasion, would require you to consider the backdrop of the Civil War, but looking at the Civil War itself (specifically, how it got to that point) might be instructive.

One big thing to remember is that governance is somewhat fractal. If the federal government ceased to exist, the state governments would still be there, and if /those/ ceased to exist, you would still have county/city governments. They would lose a lot of their current supports, and need to quickly replace functions, but unless the people outright revolted, I would expect those smaller governments to mostly stay intact, at least in the short term.

If you can answer some questions about what the nature of the aliens is, whether they're razing everything or attempting occupation, it might be a little easier.
