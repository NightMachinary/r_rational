I have a new warhammer 40K headcannon : the reverse theorie,\\
The Warp is the real world and the Materium is a simulated universe.\\
The asumption is that the "iron men" won their side of the war and greygooed the universe, the grey goo is/was housing the sentient mind of everyone at the time of the war, from both side.\\
This theorie hand wave simultaneously all the plot hole of WH40K.
