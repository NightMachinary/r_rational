The guthark tribesmen were Wood Primes and used /Pole Weapons I/ skill. It looks like the guthark chieftain is using the edged weapon skill. Since it was also augmenting its attack with elemental Fire, it's almost certainly a Fire Prime - implying that edged weapon skill is Fire-based.

The Physical stat and some of the passive skills seem counter-intuitive to me at times. A very strong character would come in with a high Physical score. Someone else with a lower score and /Strong Body II/ could, in fact, be physically superior to the original character in every way. Fridge logic would suggest that there are ways to prevent passive skills from working, perhaps via debuff.

Asahi has a remarkably good base Physical stat - for a 50-year-old man. A younger man, or extremely physically fit woman with military training would probably score better.
