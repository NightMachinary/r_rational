The low-tier skills available to the players seem to be about halfway known.

- /Tough Skin/, /Strong Body/ and /Expansive Mind/ work on similar principles.

- /Improved Heart/ and /Improved Lungs/ seem likewise very similar.

- /Earth Shield/ and /Water Shield/ look very similar.

- /Blunt Weapons/ and /Pole Weapons/ are similar skills from differing elements.

It will be interesting to see if skills fall into two exclusive categories - those randomly rewarded, and those unlocked by player actions. Maya's prior inability to learn /Wilderness Survival/ hints that this may be the case.

I strongly suspect the players will get a NP bonus for initiating the dungeon. The Guthrak Chieftain will probably drop something interesting - hopefully his machete for Iliya to use.
