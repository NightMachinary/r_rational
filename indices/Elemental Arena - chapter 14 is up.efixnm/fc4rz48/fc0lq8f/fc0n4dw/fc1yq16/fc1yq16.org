Like a lot of RPGs, the several of the skills seem to be re-flavorings of one another (Earth Shield & Fire Shield, etc). From both a mechanical and practical standpoint, it makes sends that we'd see different variations. Fire Shield, Metal Shield, & Wood Shield are extremely likely to exist.

Blunt Weapons & Pole Weapons existing already clarifies the existence of different weapon Skills. Since the machete was (seemingly) dropped, I expect the "Edged Weapons" Skill to show its Metal-element face. I am of course only conjecturing since I don't have the the answer.

Tough Skin & the other non-elemental Physical/Mental Skills seem like the building blocks for making characters truly superhuman. In particular, the 35% increase in strength from Strong Body could be absolute essential for any Melee combatant. Assuming the term strength is specifically referring to muscular explosiveness, her 1-hit damage potential sounds ludicrous. for the purposes of combat. Combine that with a weapons skill, and she's the best physical fighter in the group.

(WARNING: Tangent up ahead)

Speaking of Physical, Lilly having a base 131 Physical sounds like something Nathan would have noticed when first meeting her. The lack of comment could be because of the fact that Physical is simply an average of physical scores and not simply muscle mass/strength. For example: Lily may have a super high Physical, but her average is skewed by an extremely high Dexterity/Agility/Coordination/etc. (Similar to how Kean's Mental-Score skewed him into being a candidate, but within the Physical-Score itself). This could also explain how fucking Asahi, a (seemingly) active-duty military officer has 5-points lower starting Physical than Lily.

Now that I think about it, The composite Physical & Mental Scores, as far as we know aren't taking the average of each aspect of Physical/Mental

Physical, as stated from chapter 2:

/[The Physical attribute statistic is a numerical assessment of the player's average physical abilities.  The Physical stat encompasses traits such as strength, speed, stamina, hardiness, reflexes, flexibility, constitution, etc.]/

What i'm getting at is that, just like Lily may have had her average skewed, others may have as well. Nathan, iirc, was a track runner and went on frequent hiking and camping trips. His "stamina" and "speed" ability may be above average for the group but he may very well be lacking in reflexes, flexibility, or even strength.

This concept also makes Asahi even more valuable. As a military man (I'm using my knowledge of U.S. Marine Core training to make a conjecture about Japanese military training, so take this with a bowl of salt), he likely has above average Strength, Stamina, Hardiness, Reflexes, & Constitution compared to the rest.

â€‹

- /[The Mental attribute statistic is a numerical assessment of the player's average mental abilities.  The Mental stat encompasses traits such as raw intelligence, creative problem solving, pattern recognition, stress management, willpower, mental health, etc.]/

This attribute is a bit more abstract, but definitely no less important. High Intelligence could very much get someone included in the arena despite them lacking in mental health, willpower, or stress management.

I think I had a stronger point to make, but it's about midnight for me and I think I should quit while I'm ahead.

Enjoyed the chapter. Hope to read more. Hope to join the the discussions.
