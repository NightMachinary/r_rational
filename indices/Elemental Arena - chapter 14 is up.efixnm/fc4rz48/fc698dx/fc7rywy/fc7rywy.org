Don't be discouraged, I have a huge personal bias and my opinion should be taken lightheartedly. I am a refugee from [[/r/litrpg]] and let me tell you man the most idolized and recommended works I have seen there will give the most battle hardened ratfic reader PTSD. They glorify OP MCs with illogical progression, harems filled with damsels from around the world, and a shiny road of world building ridden with plot holes upon plot holes. The end destination of said road is where the MC power creeps themselves to godhood and proceeds to solve the mystery of "The System."

Your fic is a cut above the rest and the quality does not compare from the absolute filth that comes from [[/r/litrpg]]. My only critism is that the story should lean toward an apocalyptic nature emphasizing survivaI at all costs(the human race kind of depends on it). Cynicalism and Anti-heroes is what we need. It should shy away from petty high school drama where the MC has to micro manage every character to keep them cohesive. I am really enjoying it and no matter what direction it goes, I eagerly wait for every chapter.
