I get where you're coming from. Though I'm not expected a harem at all, mostly considering that the MC seems extreme undesirable to all the women shown. I'm not super into the amount of flirtation on both sides from MULTIPLE characters, but I'm going to give it more time to see if the execution goes well.

I'm not as opposed to the MC sexualizing the female characters as long as it remains in-character and doesn't become more like something out of [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]]. The Male Gaze exists and its how a massive amount of men perceive their interactions with women, but I hope it doesn't go to extremes.

I'm not super familiar with the grimdark genre. Would you have any grimdark fiction you'd recommend? Bonus points if its Rational!
