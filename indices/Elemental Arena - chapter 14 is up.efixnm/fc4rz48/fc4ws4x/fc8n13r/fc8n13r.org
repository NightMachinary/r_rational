Thanks for the feedback. I will admit that romance may not be my strongest suite as a writer, so this kind of feedback can be helpful. I'm not afraid to edit or adjust something either if it will improve the story so feel free to give opinions, even critical. :)

Firstly, there will not be a harem trope or anything resembling it. There will be some romantic complications though. I actually added more romantic tension in my second draft, because it didn't feel realistic enough without. A bunch of random fit people surviving horrors together, it's only natural that they will want some way to feel normal or distract themselves, whether it is superficial or not. Most often it's superficial.

Many of the awkward moments Nathan has with the female players is to highlight the lack of resources they have, clothing specifically. It's something we take for granted, but clothing is on the bottom level of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs along with food, shelter, etc. The fact he is awkward about it is more to characterize him as a gentlemen, as opposed to someone who is ogling all the girls. Notice not a single female player's breasts or butts have been given a physical description once in the story, even though we are seeing everything from Nathan's point of view.
