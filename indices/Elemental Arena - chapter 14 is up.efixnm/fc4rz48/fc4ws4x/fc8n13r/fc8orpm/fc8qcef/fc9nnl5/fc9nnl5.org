I hope I didn't harm your mood by commenting.

Truthfully, there's evidence that spoilers can enhance one's enjoyment of a work. However, most people have a mindset that they can only really enjoy something without spoilers.

I'm not in the latter category. However, that latter category is the majority of people (at least in the western world). I personally just wanted to say something so that someone more sensitive to spoilers wouldn't feel discouraged to keep reading.

For future reference, if you're comfortable with advice from someone who isnt currently writing rational fiction, it may be good to not speak about plot-important or character-important aspects of the story which haven't already been shown or that you, at some point, intend to include.\\
For example: in WtC (no spoilers), there is a character that owns a cheese factory. The fact that the character owns a factory does not appear in the plot. It was simply stated by the author that they did and it was a location the author decided not to use for [SPOILER].

I HOPE I made sense and that mu example felt reasonable. I'm really enjoying your story and am excited each Wednesday to read more. I can tell you're enjoying the process, which I'm glad to hear
