I'm not a fan how the mc is sexualizing the female protaginists so much every chapter. All cliche harems start out this way and I am getting ptsd. Sure it adds into the "romance" story, but I feel that there is no depth to it. It actually takes away from the whole apocalyptic death game scenario. I feel people should be more tense and grimdark rather than flirty.
