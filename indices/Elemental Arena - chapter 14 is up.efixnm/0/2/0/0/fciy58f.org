Just to clarify, [[/u/Gilgilad7]] is the author. I'm another reader, and a bit of a fan.

I find poorly-executed sexuality pretty cringe-y as well, by the way. The chapter 14 bra scene wasn't particularly bad by my view. Iliya isn't coming on to Nathan. She's playing with him because she finds Nathan's awkwardness uproariously funny. This is very consistent with her outlook from previous chapters since her introduction.

If all their interactions follow this formula, of course it will be problematic.

Antiheroes aren't normally my thing, but they can be if done with good motivation and a large measure of wit. A Practical Guide to Evil is a great example of this.
