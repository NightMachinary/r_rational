Without the capacity limit they can carry a whole castle along. Which, why not you know? As long as they take the time to insert and remove it piece by piece. Basically the item provides an in-game justification to ignore non-weapon carry capacity, especially if you use "within reason" rules. When's the last time someone had to account for all their stuff's weight? If you fudge that anyway as my group always does I'd just call it the same level as a bag of holding. The 2 round delay cancels the extra space for level adjustments as far as I'm concerned.

Ok, for the rest of this the next sentence is a tldr.

I'm pretty sure the sharp objects thing is an accidental house rule. The rules as written only say the bag can be cut from within a sharp object, they do not specify that a sharp object will or can cut it on their own. It comes down to the reasonableness rule - can a knife placed into a masterwork bag cut it open? I know I've put kitchen knives in a backpack when moving without issue, and I prefer to assume due diligence done by characters unless the player states otherwise, though dropping unsheathed weapons in during combat might justify a percentile check.

If we assume items lose their momentum and other such properties when placed inside the bag I'd say there's a reasonable argument to be made that the item won't cut the bag unless a creature within attempts to cut it or the bag is filled to the point that it's impossible to avoid the blade being pressed against the side of the bag.
