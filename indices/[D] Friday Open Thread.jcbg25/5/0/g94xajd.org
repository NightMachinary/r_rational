Having given something similar to a group at level 1, I'd say that the answer is level 1 ... with some caveats. The two biggest problems are:

1. stuffing enormous amounts of water into it, which then get deployed as area denial, to drown a castle, or some other such shenanigans
2. stealing stuff with what /should be/ big bonuses, or looting beyond normal capacity

I don't consider those to be problems, but it would depend on the campaign. Other than that, it's not game-breaking, because generally speaking, you usually get a bag of holding pretty early in your career, and /most/ of what it does is make it so that the party doesn't need to worry about carrying capacity, which isn't all that gamebreaking.

Things that you'd want to settle and/or cover:

- No touching a door for ten seconds and sucking it out from its hinges, whole, un-connected objects only.
- Creatures that are alive can get out as a free action.
- No one can survive in there much longer than they can hold their breath (this means that the capabilities grow with the party's ability to shore up weaknesses).

(In a normal D&D campaign, lvl 1 is basically just a single session, and lvl 2 isn't much longer than that, so if it's overpowered at that level, then it doesn't stay overpowered for long.)
