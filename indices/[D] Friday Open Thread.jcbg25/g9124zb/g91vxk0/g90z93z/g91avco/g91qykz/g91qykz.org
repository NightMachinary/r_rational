I'm going to be honest, I think the manga is a very poor adaptation of the light novel. The story is generally split into two portions, the first part with the MC grinding levels in the labyrinth and generally more comedy-oriented and generic, while the rest of the story takes place in the overarching world, with interactions between the other characters and a focus on the larger plot. This latter part of the story is where all the great writing and plot reveals that totally change the perception of the story come into play, and the manga hasn't reached that far.

The manga seems to go all in on the comedy aspect of the series, and even among the parts of the story it covers, it cuts out the POV of Shun, said human prince and generic isekai protagonist, which takes up half of each volume so far and provides crucial worldbuilding and sets up important plot points and red herrings for the future.

The manga is a poor experience of the story that basically cuts out half the content it even covers, and hasn't reached the shift in the story that really changes the entire story, and won't reach there for a while at the pace it's currently releasing. I'd highly recommend the light novels, because the later volumes are spectacular, especially when they delve into the blossoming friendship between Kumoko, Ariel, and Sophia and the plot reveals.
