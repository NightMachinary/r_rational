Isn't that part only in the web novel? The escalation of power in the web novel is pretty rough in that part, the light novel handles it much better and spreads out the power ups at that strength. I'd give the light novel version a read, it's a lot more refined than the web novel, although there are still robots, in particular tanks and fighter jets and a bigass ufo, but the robot stuff is actually pretty important to the story. The illustration for that battle is hilarious too, there's something absurd about an Arachne holding a rocket launcher riding a dragon through a horde of fighter jets It doesn't come out of nowhere either, if you pay close attention there are some parts that foreshadow that development.
