I liked the first half. Unfortunately the second half utterly ruined even my enjoyment of the first half. The whole time I was looking forward to what would happen when she finally met people again, only to timeskip and shift perspective away from the only character I actually cared about. Honestly, the second half was a mediocre story only barely related to the first half, excepting how it made all the build up in the first half feel ruined.
