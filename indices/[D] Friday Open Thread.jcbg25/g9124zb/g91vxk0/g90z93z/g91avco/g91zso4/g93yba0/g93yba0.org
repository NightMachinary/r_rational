I would also like to throw in my praise for this. A lot of the light novel is easily available on Kindle, which makes accessing it far easier to access than other Isekai novels. The writing is fast paced and amusing. The translation is great and easily understandable. There's more foreshadowing than other LNs I've read and the main character is quirky and excellent to follow.

Possibly my favorite part of the series is how realistic the characters feel. They're frustrated by the limitations of the system they find themselves in and are afraid of how unknowns might affect them so they're constantly working to gain any edge they can.
