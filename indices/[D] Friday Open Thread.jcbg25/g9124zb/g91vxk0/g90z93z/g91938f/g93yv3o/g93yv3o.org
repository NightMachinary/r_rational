Does anyone remember who offered to be an editor for some money for NaNoWriMo? I'd like to hire them and also offer my services as an editor as well. Id also like some beta readers as I am returning back to writing a Worm/Cosmere fiction I had a lot of work done on but lost everything when my motherboard and harddrive failed after an electrical surge.

Additionally does anyone know good sites to host a podcast for free/cheap? I want to try my hand at audio narration for stories now that I have a functioning computer again.

Furthermore I was just introduced to a game on Steam called Hades that has finally exited early access and it's so much fun. Id highly recommend it for anyone that likes roguelikes or even if you don't. The game has a permanent power system so you do gain strength even if you fail your run. It has so many additional bells and whistles that it feels like a completely different game from other roguelikes. Highly recommend.
