  I guess it's not inconsistent until you start thinking in terms of applications. A real ball can't be reconfigured into itself and a clone of itself, and a pea cannot be reconfigured into the sun. That's not intuition, it's conservation of mass-energy.

Yes, well, that's why I said it's "not /mathematically/ inconsistent". I was talking about math, responding to claims that appeared to have been made about math. I didn't say say anything about peas or suns, and I didn't say anything about how our own universe works.

(Furthermore, it is not even the case that one needs "ε" to rule out Banach-Tarksi. For example, if we're only allowed to work with measurable sets, the Banach-Tarski construction is impossible. Or as I said above you can exclude the axiom of choice.)

  As I mentioned ε is another linguistic convenience.

Well, I'm not sure how to reconcile that with your claims like "conventional mathematics breaks if we don't eventually define a minimum value".
