I assume you're talking about the Banach-Tarski paradox.

For one, the Banach-Tarski construction follows from the Axiom of Choice. You can dismiss the Axiom of Choice while still talking about infinity.

Secondly, the only reason humans take issue with the Banach-Tarski construction is our physical intuition - it's not /mathematically/ inconsistent.

Also, we're in agreement that "infinity the number" does not exist (as long as we're talking about real numbers). However, there's this other point, which is that you seem to think that this implies there must be some smallest number, and again, this is wrong. The real numbers have no smallest number.
