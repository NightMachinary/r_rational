I'm gonna reply in 2 sections first the what then the why.

--------------

There is a minimum mass, charge, etc. because infinity is a mathematical impossibility. We use it in calculus but only as a shortcut, and ask any mathematician and they will tell you infinity is not a number and that infinity, as a numerical value, does not exist. If infinity doesn't exist, neither does 1/inf. For this case we have other shortcuts such as the limit of 1/x as x approaches positive infinity, also denoted as 0^{+.} In this case the shortcut works for calculus but in other types of analysis it's not enough. Thus we have a quantity defined as the smallest positive real number (again in a shortcut sense, it has no actual value) often denoted as ε or ε_0. But this is another short cut. After all if ε/2 can be calculated then we were wrong about the value of ε.

What all this boils down to is that the smallest possible number is a finite number. ε_0 is a countable value despite the fact that we don't usually care what this value is, and just treat it as "basically zero." This is fine. If we multiply anything by ε, we get a number so small that we can usually drop it from the equation without loss of accuracy or generality (unless the entire equation is multiplied in which case we set it to the side as a multiplication factor and work with the rest of the equation). If we add ε to a number we get the same number back with a rounding error so small it may as well not even be there. But the point of the number in the first place is just as another shortcut to deal with infinite and infinitesimal amounts despite the fact that these are both not amounts, or values, and in fact neither exists in a mathematical sense.

So where does this leave us? Well, for

1. conventional mathematics breaks if we don't eventually define a minimum value, because the most basic operations depend on countability, and going below this arbitrary point we use logical analysis methods, or avoid quantifying things in the conventional way, or we define a new smallest number.

2. ε is not a permittivity constant here. If the value matters we're getting away from the point of having a value defined as "basically 1/inf but a real number"

3. Quarks may be one of the types of elementary particles in the Standard Model, but nobody considers that model to be a final form. A few decades ago, Hadrons were considered the elementary particles. Several decades ago Atoms were. Before 1905 many scientists even believed Atoms to be an illusion and the closest known thing to an elementary particle may have been a speck of dust or an iron filing if they even considered elementary particles as a meaningful term.

In conclusion, *tldr*, the smallest numbers we use and define are there as a convenience and because we haven't observed anything smaller /yet/. They are not by themselves evidence of a simulation.

As for why someone would simulate our universe, a few religions attempt to answer this. I'm partial to the interpretation that the engineer of our simulation is creating a lot of souls for a project and this simulation tests the quality of said souls. The souls are thrown into a simulated world full of suffering and those who successfully relieve the suffering of other souls beyond a certain threshold while keeping the resource expenditure below a certain threshold pass the quality check and become part of the project, while the rest are broken back down to their raw materials and reworked into new souls.
