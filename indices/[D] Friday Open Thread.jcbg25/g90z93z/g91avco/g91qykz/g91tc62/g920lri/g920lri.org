I understand what you mean, litrpgs and especially litrpg isekais are usually pretty bad, the litrpg is usually meant to serve to shore up the author's weakness in writing combat or a shallow and irrelevant attempt at appealing to readers through a game-esque world. Then they also fall into the shortcomings of the progression fantasy genre, which is very difficult to write well, much less for completely amateur authors which typically tend to write said litrpg and progression fantasy novels.

I've been reading a lot of litrpgs and isekais myself, and I totally understand what you mean. There's a lot of trash in the genre, especially when the litrpg or isekai aspect doesn't even matter to the story for many of these series. It can be quite frustrating.

That's what I really appreciate about Spider, it's that the litrpg elements and System actually play a major role in the story. There are lots of mysteries hidden within it, and the way it's explored and becomes relevant really makes it unique among litrpg isekais.

Really though, the litrpg and System isn't even the main focus of Spider, which is why there are occasionally readers that are confused and dislike the series and drop it when the series shifts to focus less on power leveling. At first it seems like it's just another litrpg grinding-focused novel, but it completely shifts away from that aspect to focus more on character interactions and the plot, which can turn away fans that came for the litrpg. It's just one part of a larger story, but the way every element of the story comes together is done really well. I was personally very impressed when it became more character-oriented.

I've always found isekai to be a really interesting genre ripe with possibilities, and was constantly disappointed with the same trope-y, low quality, generic, and shallow isekais that don't take advantage of the setting. Spider takes this set up and actually makes it interesting and well-written in every element, from a litrpg System that's interesting and important, with even the fact that the reincarnations have “cheats” being extremely important to the overarching plot, a MC that has actual personality and a functioning brain(and one of the better representations of a completely antisocial person), characters that are unique and well-written and add layers and depth to the character interactions, motivations, desires, backgrounds, and contrast against each other in the overarching conflict, and a plot that doesn't have constant exposition dumps and respects the reader's intelligence and is actually well-written. The twists and turns, foreshadowing and red herrings, and major reveals are all really well handled and never cheap, and is a lot better than what you'd expect from an isekai. Literally, some of the biggest twists are foreshadowed from the very first chapter or even earlier.

But perhaps this is all just my bias, overhyping things up has never served well for anyone, so take my words and opinion with a grain of salt. People have different tastes and I might as well have very trash tastes for all you know. This is just what I feel as a person that read to the very latest in both the light novel and web novel, and a lot of these things don't become apparent until quite a ways in. It's much better than other litrpg isekais and isekais in general, for however much that's worth.

I will 100% say that for those looking for an well-written and unique “normal” isekai, there's nothing that does the genre better than Spider. The illustrations are really cute too.
