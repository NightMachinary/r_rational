I guess it's not inconsistent until you start thinking in terms of applications. A real ball can't be reconfigured into itself and a clone of itself, and a pea cannot be reconfigured into the sun. That's not intuition, it's conservation of mass-energy.

And replacing the 0^{+} with ε in Banach-Tarski gives us a result that matches reality.

  you seem to think that this implies there must be some smallest number, and again, this is wrong. The real numbers have no smallest number.

No, I suspect this might be the source of our misunderstanding. As I mentioned ε is another linguistic convenience. Divorcing the infinitesimal from infinity allows us to get results that can be applied to the real world. But if ε must be finite then there must be a finite real-world value to match up with it.
