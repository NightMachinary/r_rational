But why should that matter? Let's say for the sake of argument that the elementary particles under the Standard Model are actually made up of "substrings" vibrating at a particular set of frequencies that resonate in certain ways. While we could have any combination of "substrings" and frequencies, the resulting compound (elementary) particles only interact with other compound (elemebtary) particles if they resonate in a similar way. We'd get the same integer multiple effects despite the existence of an even smaller particle. I'm not saying that these substrings exist, but that their existence provides one potential alternative reason for the integer multiples of charge. Thus we don't have proof positive that the smallest particles we have theories about are the actual smallest particles full stop.

But as to the point about infinities which you probably question, paradoxes arise if infinitesimal and infinite values are treated as real. So to avoid paradox we either find a math error that's been undiscovered for centuries, or conclude an elementary particle must exist.

I'll restate the point I'm trying to make as I've gotten off on tangents and rambled in both posts now: /the existence of an elementary particle doesn't imply a simulation because an elementary particle, or a set of elementary particles, must exist anyway./

Do you have a possible reason? The "why" seems like a very open ended concept.
