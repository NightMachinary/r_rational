  Let's say for the sake of argument that the elementary particles under the Standard Model are actually made up of "substrings" vibrating at a particular set of frequencies that resonate in certain ways.

So, you're postulating that we half half-charge particles that do not in any way react with full-charge particles? Hmmm. But they would react with other half-charge particles. And a sufficient concentration of mass would (by special relativity) imply measurable effects on time and space, visible as a distortion of light passing through the area...

...so there might be ways to notice those particles, in which case they are part of our physics. But that just makes the minimal charge smaller.

  But as to the point about infinities which you probably question, paradoxes arise if infinitesimal and infinite values are treated as real. So to avoid paradox we either find a math error that's been undiscovered for centuries, or conclude an elementary particle must exist.

I will admit that this is a part that's bothering me. Not the infinite values - I can see plenty of ways in which infinite values lead to trouble. But I'm failing to see why /infinitesimal/ values cause a problem.

  I'll restate the point I'm trying to make as I've gotten off on tangents and rambled in both posts now: /the existence of an elementary particle doesn't imply a simulation because an elementary particle, or a set of elementary particles, must exist anyway./
#+end_quote

That's fair. But - making the elementary particle substantially /bigger/ in the simulation will make the simulation easier to, well, to simulate.

That doesn't mean that we are in a simulation, you are correct. But it does suggest that, /if/ we are in a simulation, then the world outside that simulation might be a world in which charge, mass, and other such things are /not/ quantized to being integer multiples of a (small but finite) minimum value - or, if (as you argue above) that it impossible, then it might merely have a minimum value ten trillion times smaller than ours.

  Do you have a possible reason? The "why" seems like a very open ended concept.
#+end_quote

It is! It's an incredibly open ended concept, and I have a /multitude/ of possible reasons.

The one which has currently caught my imagination is this - the universe is /massive/ compared to out little insignificant mudball. What are the odds that the actual /point/ of the simulation is going on somewhere else - perhaps near the centre of the galaxy - and we're just a statistically unlikely anomaly that the simulators haven't noticed yet? If that is the case, then we might get some sort of reaction when they finally spot us...
