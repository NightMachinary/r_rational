So, I've recently been thinking about the simulation hypothesis for a bit. In short, the simulation hypothesis is the hypothesis that we - our world, out universe, and all that is in it - is all one great big simulation, running on one great big computer.

Let's step away from the question of 'why' for a moment, and simply consider the mechanics of it. Now, unless the Great Big Computer is capable of literally infinite computation, it's clear that it cannot simulate itself (down to the last decimal place, the last subatomic particle) while also simulating any extra matter. Does that imply that our universe is simulated on a computer bigger than the universe? No, because it is possible to /cheat/. If we don't simulate every last particle to every last decimal place, then we can simulate more matter on less computer.

Modern FPS games, for example, might simulate a bullet. But they won't simulate every electron, every proton, every neutron in the bullet, saving an inordinate amount of calculation.

And, interestingly, looking at the physical laws of out universe... I do notice that everything is /quantized/. There's a minimal electrical charge, and all charges are integer multiples of that minimum. (Apparently that minimum is one-third the charge on an electron - you get some quarks that use that one-third figure). If the minimal electrical charge in the universe that holds the Great Big Computer is not quantized, then an immense amount of information can be stored in those further decimal places; allowing a small piece of computronium to hold a much larger piece of our universe.

The other way that one can cheat is by simulating the universe in parts. Simulate this part for ten seconds, then that part for ten seconds, then that part for ten seconds, and so on - once you've done enough parts, then the entire universe has been simulated (piecemeal) for ten seconds. But, in order to get this right, then you need to be sure that /this/ bit of the universe won't (significantly) affect /that/ bit for the ten-second interval. And, again, there is a law in our universe that would appear to permit this; relativity tells us that nothing goes faster than light, so as long as those parts are more then ten light-seconds apart, all is good.

And separate solar systems are /way/ more than ten light-seconds apart.

--------------

But then it struck me. If, somehow, my vague, idle musing is somehow on track - if these natural laws are indeed in place to make our world more computable (and thus make it possible for an outer universe with indescribably more powerful computers to simulate us), then that implies that the outer universe does /not/ have these same limitations in place. That out there, they can have an electrical charge of a zillionth of an electron, or fire a bullet at ten times the speed of light. (Or maybe the speed of light out there is infinite, and everything runs on Newtonian physics).

But - if that is true - and it seems plausible to me - then it means that we are /not/ a simulation of their history. (It's possible that that was originally intended; but as soon as we began to discover these simulated physical laws, as soon as we began, to to speak, to identify the stage settings, then we must have diverged from their history. Slightly at first... but hugely by now).

And yet... we still exist. Therefore the simulation is still running. And if they weren't running us as a re-run of their own historical eras... then why /is/ our simulation still running? What's the point of simulating our universe?

(I have a few guesses, but I'm interested to hear what other people think)
