The problem with looking at reality and saying "look at how it was designed to be computed" is that computers are subject to the psychical limitations of reality. A large enough simulation built in a reality with speed of light limitations would have to implement similar speed of light limitations in order to operate performantly as an example.

I think you're mixing up correlation and causation. I suspect you're actually looking at the limitation in our own ability to compute things, but from the other direction.
