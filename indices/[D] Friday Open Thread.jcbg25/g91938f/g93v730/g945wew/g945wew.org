I've been trying to avoid limiting my idle musings by the requirements of our world's computation capabilities; though I have been assuming that information theory is the same in our world and in this theoretical outer world, and trying to find the limits of that only. While it's true (for example) that a system built in a reality with speed-of-light limitations will gain better performance from being built with speed-of-light limitations, it also seems true that a system built in a universe /without/ speed-of-light limitations would /also/ gain performance improvements from being built with speed-of-light limitations. So I don't think that we can (or should) assume that the universe which is simulating us (if we are, indeed, simulated) has those limitations.
