This sounds like a semantics argument. Throughout the post I clarified that I'm talking about "infinity as a number" not "infinity as a linguistic convenience" and even differentiate the two in the very next sentence beyond what you quoted there. A number of paradoxes are neatly and only addressed by recognizing that infinity is not a number but a linguistic convenience.

If we take a circle and divide it into an infinite number of infinitesimal domes we can reconstruct 2 circles, both identical to the original circle. If instead we separate the circle into as many Îµ length arcs as we can, we can only reconstruct the orginal circle. So which do you think is wrong? Infinity, infinitesimal, or an euclidean axiom?
