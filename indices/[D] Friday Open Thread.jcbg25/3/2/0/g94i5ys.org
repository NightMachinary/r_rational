  There is a minimum mass, charge, etc. because infinity is a mathematical impossibility. We use it in calculus but only as a shortcut, and ask any mathematician and they will tell you infinity is not a number and that infinity, as a numerical value, does not exist. If infinity doesn't exist, neither does 1/inf.

Sorry, but this is nonsense.

First, "infinity is a mathematical impossibility" is wrong, because there are many mathematical theories that allow manipulation of a concept we'd call "infinity".

Second, you claim that because there is no infinity, there must be a smallest nonzero number. This is again wrong: the real numbers do not have an infinity, but they also do not have a smallest nonzero number. You say "the most basic operations depends on countability" but again, this is false for the real numbers.

A priori, there's no reason to think a universe couldn't be based on real numbers. If we think otherwise, it's because our own universe seems to operate out of smallest discrete units, but here we are hypothesizing the existence of other universes. Those universes do not need to have physics remotely resembling our own. They simply need to have the ability to perform computation. They might have physics based on real numbers at the most fundamental level, or possibly something even more exotic.

However, even ignoring the simulation-hypothesis / other-universes thing, your post is simply full of wrong claims about pure mathematics, like that "conventional mathematics breaks if we don't eventually define a minimum value".
