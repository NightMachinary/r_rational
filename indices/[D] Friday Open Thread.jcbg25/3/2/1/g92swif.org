As to your first point; I'm not entirely sure that I agree with it, but even if you are right and there is a minimal epsilon, then it does not follow that all charges must be an integer multiple of that minimum. After all, 1.5/epsilon is still greater than epsilon; and even if there is a minimum, one and a half times that minimum is greater than the minimum. Yet, ever since Millikan's oil drop experiment in 1909, we've been able to base our scientific endeavours on the idea that charge is always an *integer/ multiple of the minimum charge.

That is certainly a possible reason for our universe, and one that can be applied beneficially in everyday life. It /could/ be a way to generate new intelligences, with some sort of a filter on the output; and attempting to self-select for that /particular/ filter will certainly improve the world as it stands.
