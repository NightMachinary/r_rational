Has anyone here read the Japanese light novel So I'm a Spider, So What? It's rational, or at least rational adjacent, and definitely the best litrpg isekai out there, and the best of the traditional JP isekais.

Everything in the story has a purpose or deeper meaning. The System actually has a very important role and meaning, and it's mechanics are pretty interesting. The MC is full of personality and approaches her situation quite rationally, although she can be a bit goofy at times, but never to the detriment of the story. And the few decision fuck ups serve to further her character growth and fix her flaws and understanding of herself.

She'll grind out her skills, even constantly damaging herself or setting herself on fire to train her abilities up to the max. In particular she sets out to give a new companion the most optimized training regimen possible, which stomps all over most of the other people in the world, old and super powerful beings excluded.

The author is also quite masterful in crafting his story, he loves to put in red herrings and sneaky foreshadowing throughout the series, and the major plot twists never feel cheap.

The character writing in this series is handled really well, the interactions, backstories, and quirks of all the characters really play into their relationships with each other. Every character's backstory from their previous life, their experience in their new life, and their goals all play an important part to the character as a whole and to the overarching story, it's handled really well, like in the crucial details that set the monster reincarnations apart from the rest of the reincarnations, or Katia feeling conflicted about going from a boy in his previous life to a noblewoman now, and her conflicting emotions towards her previously best friend. There's also the POVs of other characters, in particular another isekai'd classmate, who reincarnates as a human prince and is in the complete opposite of the MC's position and is your “typical generic isekai protagonist.” This dynamic is actually one of the best parts of the series, it puts into perspective all of the MC's struggles and beliefs and strength, and plays an important role in the story, especially in the effectiveness of each person's goals and their motivation as they fight on two opposing sides of a conflict.

This series is really phenomenal, it's essentially the typical JP isekai, but made perfect. I'm surprised I've never seen it mentioned on the sub before, it's to JP isekai like what Cradle(and FMoC) is to xianxia.
