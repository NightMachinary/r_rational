An incomplete taxonomy of sports and bar games

Been thinking about this a bit, seems like the kind of nonsense you all would enjoy.

*Goal games*: Two teams compete to get the same object to goals on the opposite ends of the play area. The pure version - just get the ball to that side of the field - is pretty dumb. Picking up the ball and running to the goal with it is boring (and requires tackling to be stopped), so most versions invent some reason you can't do that, like a handling restriction (feet only, sticks only), movement restriction (no running with the ball) or awkward field (iceskates, horseback, water). The other problem that's typically addressed is throwing the object into the goal, which is usually handled by making the goal small and putting a dedicated goal-keeper in front, sometimes handled by putting the goal somewhere hard to reach (basketball), or sometimes handled by requiring someone catch the object in the goal (American football, ultimate frisbee).

Examples include football, the other football, basketball, hockey, lacrosse, polo, rugby, ultimate frisbee, and handball. In video games there's Rocket League, and in bar games there's foosball.

These tend to be the most popular sports.

It's pretty easy to invent a new one of these by coming up with a reason you can't just run with the ball. For example, I'm not aware of any versions that stop this by making the ball too awkward to handle, which could be done by using a very large beach ball.

MOBAs (League of Legends, DOTA, et all) are very distant cousins that use three "objects" on three fields, which might be an interesting angle to explore. Take some ball game, give it three fields, allow players (but not balls) to freely run between fields, and give each team between 2x and 3x the usual number of players, so they're always a little short.

*Net games*: Two teams with two separate play areas compete to make the object touch the ground in the opposing team's play area. Typically there's a net the object has to go over, which prevents just spiking the object directly into the ground. Some of these are played by hitting the object directly and some are played by hitting the object with a racket.

Examples include tennis, badminton, table tennis, and volleyball.

These tend to be less popular than goal games. I suspect because the net restricts the maximum size of the play field (anything more than one throw / racket hit away from the net is unreachable), and popular games tend to be physically large.

*Safe haven games*: One member of one team throws the object to a member of the second team, who attempts to hit it into the field. Doing so successfully permits the second team to run around on the field in an attempt to complete laps before the object is retrieved. Some areas of the field are "safe" for runners, in all other areas the player can be removed by someone posessing the object. Yeah, baseball and cricket are weird games.

Examples include baseball, cricket, kickball, softball, and tee ball.

These are not as popular as goal games, but there are countries where one of these is the biggest sport.

I feel like these would be improved by making the challenge easier and the field more complex, so the question becomes where to hit the ball, rather than whether the ball can be hit. Like kickball but with more bases, branching choices of bases, and bases to the sides of and behind the kicker.

*Target games*: Two teams take turns to land an object as close to the center of the target as possible.

In games where the object travels perpendicular to the target, teams take all their shots at once and get points based on where they land. Examples include darts, archery, and shooting.

In games where the object travels parallel to the target, teams take turns making shots, possibly moving the opponent's objects, and at the end only shots closer to the target than all opponent's shots are scored. Examples include curling, shuffleboard, crokinole, and bocce ball.

The version of scoring used by the parallel games just seems flat out more interesting.

It might be interesting to combine one of these with the pitching element from a safe haven game.
