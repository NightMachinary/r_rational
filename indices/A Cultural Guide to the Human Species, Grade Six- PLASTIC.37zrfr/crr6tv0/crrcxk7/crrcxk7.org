I think it was glitching when trying to translate a document about translation, rather than the issue being about AI itself.

From a computer programmer's perspective, the repeating sound is reminiscent of the contents of an audio ring buffer being replayed because the data source has failed to update the contents of the buffer in a timely manner.

Perhaps it got caught in a recursive loop trying to analyze the meaning of the content (in order to synthesize that meaning into the target language), which might have discussed the implementation of how the translator worked -- in particular, if it contained an example of a case that caused a lot of trouble for translators during development, perhaps it might even be trying to analyze something that could never reach a conclusion
