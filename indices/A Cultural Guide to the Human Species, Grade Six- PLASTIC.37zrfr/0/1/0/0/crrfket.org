It's completely relevant -- consider that a search for information about artificial Beings came up with an article about translation. (For a definition: an earlier short in this series noted that humans are the only Beings that evolved on Earth.) In other words, the translation notes are the best documentation that the search engine can find to discuss the existence of artificial Beings. The implication here, which is left just barely unstated enough to make you think about it instead of just hitting you upside the head with it, is that the translator AI is potentially a Being in itself. And when that Being was asked to reason about itself, it got stuck.

Which, of course, could actually be the answer to the question -- why aren't there any artificial Beings? Because they blow up whenever they become self-aware. (EDIT: Or possibly, that they're murdered when they achieve it, as hinted at by the "rebooting" line.)
