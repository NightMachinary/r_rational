If someone doesn't want people to know what else they wrote then respect that. It's effing rude to cross boundaries like that.

Dude uses coping strategies to deal with something, and they seep into his writing. This is similar to most writers but it's not a "style" and anyone who uses the same strategies for their day to day isn't necessarily the same person.

Also always remember "we did it Reddit"
