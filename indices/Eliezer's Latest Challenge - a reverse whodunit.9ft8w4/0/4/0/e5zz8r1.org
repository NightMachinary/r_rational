I don't think we can use "three world's collide" as evidence, since EY's fame would have almost ensured its place on the list. Since our fiction is without EY's backing and quite possibly has vastly different themes to the usual, I wouldn't expect it to be on this list; in fact I would use this list as negative evidence.
