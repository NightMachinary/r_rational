[[http://rationalreads.com/][Here's a list of rational fiction which is pretty expansive]]

With EY's statement that nobody will get it, I'm assuming it probably /won't/ be something that we would usually call rational fiction, and is more likely to be otherwise-nonrational fanfiction; because if it's rational fiction and has been posted here before, somebody would think of it. There hasn't been /that much/ posted here.

Might be worth checking [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]] for other potential things, but that rather significantly increases the number of possible stories.

I'm not sure how much merit there is to this sort of discussion, though---EY has already said he will neither confirm nor deny it even if someone /does/ correctly guess what this mysterious piece of writing is. We have virtually nothing to restrict the possibility space except for the fact that 1. the writing doesn't sound like his and 2. he occasionally sees it mentioned on "Best Of" lists. Given the varying tastes of people on the internet, those things don't narrow it down by any significant margin.

"9 other works" is a fairly arbitrary number, and not one I would describe as "an enormous list". This in itself could be a hint to the work's identity.
