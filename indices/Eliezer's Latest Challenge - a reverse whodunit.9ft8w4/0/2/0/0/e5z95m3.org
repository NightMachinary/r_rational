  First, EY does frequent this sub and comment, so he is being exposed to conversation here and people's preferences.

  Secondly, an anonymous work on the internet would be unlikely to garner attention of mainstream "best of" lists -- publisher reviews and bestsellers, etc.

Not a safe assumption: Eliezer has read a /lot/ of non-rational fanfiction. Consider /Finale/; consider the amount of anime fanfic referenced. Consider that Eliezer's trialfic is probably old. It might be showing up on best-of Evangelion fanfics, best-of Naruto fanfics, hell, best-of /Fate/ fanfics. Though we can probably exclude all fanfiction explicitly referenced in Finale too.
