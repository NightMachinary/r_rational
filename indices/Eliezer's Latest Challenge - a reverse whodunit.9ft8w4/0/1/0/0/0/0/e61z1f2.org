I just did an analysis. I looked at all the texts I listed above, plus all of Wildbow's works, plus a few more of yours. The ones of yours that I looked at are:

- A Bluer Shade of White
- Branches on the Tree of Time
- Glimwarden
- Shadows of the Limelight
- The Last Christmas
- The Metropolitan Man
- Worth The Candle

Of those, the groups of similarity were:

- [Branches on the Tree of Time, The Last Christmas]
- [The Metropolitan Man, Glimwarden, Shadows of the Limelight, A Bluer Shade of White]
- [Worth the Candle]

On top of that, it said that the two large groups were fairly close to each other while Worth the Candle was a lot further away from them and more similar to Time Braid, Luminosity, Animorphs: The Reckoning, and all of Wildbow's works.

So apparently you unintentionally changed writing styles by adopting a pseudonym!
