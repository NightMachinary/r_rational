A couple of years ago, I did an lexical analysis of Waves Arisen (based on [[http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20script#stylometrics][this script by Gwern]]) to try to identify the author. It was fairly inconclusive, though one interesting result was that all the Naruto fics were lexically very similar, although that might be because of shared vocabulary. Since EY said that he tried to make this stylistically different, it probably wouldn't show up, but here's a summary of relevant information that I found anyway.

I compared Waves Arisen with:

Popular rationalist fics:

- #Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - Yudkowsky
- Luminosity - Alicorn
- The Metropolitan Man - Alexander Wales
- A Bluer Shade of White - Alexander Wales
- Branches on the Tree of Time - Alexander Wales
- Three Worlds Collide - Yudkowsky
- The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant - Nick Bostrom
- Mother of Learning - nobody103
- The Last Christmas - Alexander Wales
- Friendship Is Optimal - Iceman
- Animorphs: The Reckoning - WhatWouldEnderDo
- Pokemon: The Origin of Species - DaystarEld
- Harry Potter and the Natural 20 - Sir Poley
- Time Braid - ShaperV

Examples from [[http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20script#stylometrics][Gwern's analysis]]:

- #Trust in God, or, The Riddle of Kyon - Yudkowsky
- #The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover - Yudkowsky
- #Peggy Susie - Yudkowsky
- Mandragora - NothingPretentious
- To The Stars - Hieronym

Top seven rated Naruto fanfictions on fanfiction.net:

- Team 8 - S'TarKan
- Naruto: Myoushuu no Fuuin - May Wren
- The Sealed Kunai - Kenchi618
- The Lives Worth Saving - cywsaphyre
- It's For a Good Cause, I Swear! - Sarah1281
- The Prodigy Namikaze - SoulReaperCrewe
- A Drop of Poison - Angel of Snapdragons

From all of that, I found that "Trust in God, or, The Riddle of Kyon" was similar to "Time Braid" and "Luminosity"; that HPMOR was similar to "HP and the Natural 20"; and that "Three Worlds Collide" and "Finale of the Ultimate Mega Mega Crossover" were similar to "Branches on the Tree of Time," "The Last Christmas," and "To The Stars." I feel fairly confident that it can't be Time Braid or Luminosity, since the author of Time Braid has written other things and other people know the author of Luminosity. It also could not be "Branches on the Tree of Time" or "The Last Christmas," since AlexanderWales has written widely.

The remaining options are "HP and the Natural 20" and "To The Stars," so those are the only suggestion that this method gives with the corpus I looked at.
