I haven't actually read it in the slightest; I just looked down the list of things on [[http://rationalreads.com/][rationalreads]] and investigated the second few that I didn't recognize the authors of. (The first one I looked into was Pokemon: Origin of Species, but then I saw that that author runs the rationalfic podcast, which takes them out of contention.) So if, independently of me picking it on priors, it seems plausible, then it may now be the top candidate.
