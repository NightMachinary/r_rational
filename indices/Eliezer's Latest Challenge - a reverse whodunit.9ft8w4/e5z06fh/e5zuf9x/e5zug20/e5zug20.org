This is a long shot. I'm guessing this based on a few things, none of which I find particularly persuasive but I don't really have any other ideas.

1) Scott Alexander recommended it at one point. I forget where. He doesn't recommend a lot of fiction, much less anime fanfiction. He even said in his recommendation that it wasn't the kind of thing he normally reads but that he was enjoying it. My hunch was that he knew the author or knew someone who knew the author and wanted to give the story a bump in readership. Eliezer could be the author he was looking to help out.

2) Timeline roughly matches up, maybe? In particular, Bavitz (the pseudonym for Fargo's author) seems to have joined fanfiction.net and started posting Fargo a few months after HPMOR wrapped up. I'm not entirely sure when Fargo finished and when "A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?" was written, but it seems like it might be close to lining up too.

3) Bavitz's profile claims he's an "internationally-read writer". That would be true of Eliezer. The wording there also makes it sound like he isn't really a professional author, per se, but his work is relatively widely read nonetheless. That would also be true of Eliezer. I believe Bavitz's profile said he was a published author at one point, although I was unable to corroborate this with [[https://web.archive.org/web/20151027190436/https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6749809/Bavitz][web archive]].

4) Eliezer has mentioned enjoying both Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Homestuck - the two canon sources for Bavitz's stories.

5) It fits Eliezer's claim - Bavitz's style is very different from Eliezer's. His stories are also not very prominent but they do get mentioned from time to time.

6) While Bavitz's stories don't sound much like Eliezer, [[https://twitter.com/imbavitz][Bavitz's Twitter]] sounds not entirely unlike Eliezer (although with more gramatical/mechanical mistakes than Eliezer's Twitter account has).

It's worth noting that this was half-jokingly speculated about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8h7l60/rtff_chicago_madoka_magica_fanfiction_fargo_sequel/dyhxk7l/][here]] about four months ago and was shot down on account of the styles being too different.
