To offer a different perspective from [[/u/GeneralKenoA]] (also hey that is a pretty funny username that I didn't connect the dots on until just now), I personally like OoS more than HPMOR! It's been a long time since I read the latter but I feel like the characters are more realistically portrayed in OoS, and the worldbuilding is really interesting to me. That said, I also prefer Pokémon over Harry Potter, and have seen more other attempts to worldbuild in Pokémon...
