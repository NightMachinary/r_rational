Possible reasons for why EY isn't telling us what story it is:

1. It would be embarrassing. Maybe it's a pornographic fic except more intelligent and less cringeworthy to read. Notheless, I doubt he would want to be known for writing rational porn fics.
2. It's something poorly written which he wrote a long time ago before HPMOR. I think EY said somewhere in the sequences that he doesn't consider the EY that existed before 2005 to be really him.
3. He's trying to reach an audience that wouldn't give his work a chance if they knew who he was. There's a lot of people online who are prejudiced against rationalists and rational fiction, referring to all of it as "sneer culture" or worse, as a "cult". This might be his attempt to write a rational fic which appeals to a wider audience that isn't already interested in rationality or rational fiction.

Depending on which of these three motives EY has for not telling us, the consequences range from mildly bad to very bad. Maybe we should respect his wishes? Just a thought.

Edit: actually I recommend locking the thread. Seriously guys, EY said he doesn't want us to know. We should respect his privacy. The whole premise of this thread is kind of rude and inconsiderate. How would you feel about a thread specifically created to invade your privacy against your own expressed wishes?
