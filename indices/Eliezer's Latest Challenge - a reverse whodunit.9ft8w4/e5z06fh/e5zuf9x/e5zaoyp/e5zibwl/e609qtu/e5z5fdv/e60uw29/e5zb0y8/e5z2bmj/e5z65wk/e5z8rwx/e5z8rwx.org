FOR:

The Erogamer author signed on to the Discord server for glowfic (the large sprawling collaborative RP subgenre centered around Alicorn and descended at a couple removes from Luminosity), and revealed that several minor details were already references to Alicorn, glowfic, and some other ingroup-related fiction. The author, gtwalker, does not wish to participate in glowfic. Eliezer has explicitly expressed in the past that he does not think he could mesh glowfic-writing with how he writes, and if this was not so he would write something collaborative with Alicorn.

I do not know Eliezer to have another Discord account. Ambiguous evidence: he certainly does not openly have an account on that server.
