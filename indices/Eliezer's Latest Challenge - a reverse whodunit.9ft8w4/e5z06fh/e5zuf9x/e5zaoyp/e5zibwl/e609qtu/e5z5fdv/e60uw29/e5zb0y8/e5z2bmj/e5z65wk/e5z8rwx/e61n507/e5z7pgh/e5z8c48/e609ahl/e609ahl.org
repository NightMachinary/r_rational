Stephen King references Stephen King novels in Richard Bachman novels, and King doesn't seem to be a particularly egotistical guy. It's not unusual or signs of conceit, I think, to put in such nods and winks. Plus Erogamer has two characters that argue about HPMOR, one for and one against. It's a pretty self-aware reference, if he wrote it.
