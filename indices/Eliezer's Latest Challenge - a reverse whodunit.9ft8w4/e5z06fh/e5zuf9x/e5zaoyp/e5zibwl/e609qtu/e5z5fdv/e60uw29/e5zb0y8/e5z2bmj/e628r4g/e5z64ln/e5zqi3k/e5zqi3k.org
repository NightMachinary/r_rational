I read the Waves Arisen yesterday, and while it feel eerily like an EY work, somehow I think EY didn't write it.

There is something off about its pacing and style, and for majority of the story, the protag and his friends feel massively overpowered. EY always maintained that Jedi-Death Star balance in HPMOR.
