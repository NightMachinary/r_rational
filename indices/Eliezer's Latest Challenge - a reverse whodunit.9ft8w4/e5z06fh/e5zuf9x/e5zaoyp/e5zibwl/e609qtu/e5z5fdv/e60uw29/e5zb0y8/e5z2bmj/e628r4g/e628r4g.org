He comments here ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sword-art-alternate-ending-oneshot.429412/page-2#post-25623956]]) that he “likes writing Tomione” i.e. the clever heroine paired with the dark mentor figure.

Since HPMoR doesn't particularly contain that dynamic, it's possible his statement is based on prior writing that in his anonymous story.
