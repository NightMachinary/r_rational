Neat, thanks! I do wonder about the things that might confound style, but I doubt there's much to be done about them. First person narration is definitely one of them, but others include time and place (many more modern cultural references in /Worth the Candle/), intended tone, etc.

Ideally each work is written in the style that most suits it, and the language in many Romanesque anime battle school story /shouldn't/ be similar to the style I use for fantasy-kitchen-sink-with-meta. You'd have to figure out some way of /only/ getting those things that stay constant between works, which you can probably do, but might take more advanced stylometics. For example, there are probably some words or turns of phrase that I use much more often than baseline, even when I'm writing totally different things, but you'd have to have a large canon of work to actually see that in a statistically significant way.
