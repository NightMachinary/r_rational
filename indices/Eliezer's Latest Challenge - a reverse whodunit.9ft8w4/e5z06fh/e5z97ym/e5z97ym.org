I... am not sure this is /possible/ to narrow down given what we know. We have no suggestion that it's any sort of rational work, it was just written to test his abilities. Even assuming it was written when he wasn't writing something else, there are so many stories published online we would be looking at thousands.

The only things I can think of that would help us find it

- time published- he probably wouldn't write it alongside something else, and if it was a test it may have been before HPMOR

- venue published on- probably somewhere he frequents

- thinking style- he may have changed his writing style, but it's the same person. We should look for deconstructions, reconstructions, and works that take something to the logical conclusion.

- length- if it's a test it's probably short

- throw away account or anonymous- EY is aware of opsec, he probably wouldn't risk a more personal account like this. On top of that, he probably would have made an account specifically for this and then no longer had a reason to use it given this is just a test. So accounts with one or two stories and little activity could lead to him.

- best of- by far our best clue. If we were to compile "best of" lists on the places EY frequents, remove stories that are attributed to authors we know aren't EY, and check against the other filters above we might be able to find it. I don't know what places EY frequents but here though, and AFAIK there's not a way to search for comments containing a string in reddit.

My suggestion: we all compile our "best of" lists and look for possibilities. Not much I know, but worth a shot. I haven't read much of this thread, so if anyone has said all this already, sorry.

My list is: Metropolitan Man, Dungeon Keeper Ami, Chiaroscuro, To the Stars, (will add more as I think of them).

Note that this is the entire best of list, I haven't narrowed it down.
