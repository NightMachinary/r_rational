  1. he occasionally sees it mentioned on "Best Of" lists.

I think this is a pretty big hint. I take it to mean he sees it in "best of" lists of people in the rational fic community. I interpret it this way for a few reasons:

First, EY does frequent this sub and comment, so he is being exposed to conversation here and people's preferences.

Secondly, an anonymous work on the internet would be unlikely to garner attention of mainstream "best of" lists -- publisher reviews and bestsellers, etc.

This means it must be 'best of' webfiction of some sort. While it's POSSIBLE he frequents other non-overlapping webfiction communities, I think it's unlikely that he would have written a story that ends up on best-of lists elsewhere on the internet and goes unnoticed by the rational fic community.

If true, this dramatically reduces our search space. It should be a story that has been mentioned on rational fiction websites and forums, possibly including this sub, and has an unknown author. This list is probably pretty short - which is why his "9 other works" shotgun list definition is so small.
