We can, I think, exclude HPN20 because the author is also publishing RPG modules at drivethrurpg.com, and I don't think Eliezer, next to his dayjob, also runs D&D campaigns. (For one, somebody would have mentioned it.)

To the Stars is also still updating. So it's probably not a rationalfic; in fact, it probably predates HPMOR. Hell, Eliezer's phrasing, which may reference Quirrell's description of his Voldemort trial persona, would imply it's something trashy.
