I've been trying, because there's one of these stories in particular that struck a chord in my head and I'm convinced it's the one and I want to see whether the AI agrees with me or not, but I have't been able to get it to work. She doesn't progress past "Please give me some time. It won't take too long. Promise." She won't even let me feed her chapter 63 of HPMOR, let alone EY's collected works. Is it supposed to take her /hours/ or /days/ to process text, or is it supposed to be just minutes?
