Pro: EY's goals include warning the world about runaway optimizers, and teaching people about rationality. HPMOR fulfilled the latter goal, so why wouldn't he use the same tactic for the former?

Pro: EY had written extensively on the topic of a runaway optimizer. Furthermore, in 2013, Nick Bostrom had not yet published his work on the matter. It was starting to look like EY was the only one who believes this. A fanfic from a third party supporting the idea would boost his credibility more than a fanfic known to originate from the same source. So there is motive to conceal his identity if he wrote it.

Pro: EY has talked about the fic without directly denying he wrote it.

Con: The comment history of FiO's author on lesswrong doesn't really look like an EY alt. It is also long enough to require an effort intensive charade.

Con: EY has criticized story elements of FiO from the perspective of realism and story structure, and seems to have a much lower opinion of the characters and outcome than the author.

Con: The work EY seems to have written is not supposed to be one of the most prominent. FiO is relatively prominent (compared to Chiaroscuro, say). Optimizer fics were basically not a thing before this was written.
