Î™ doubt it. I remember EY offering comments/criticism on a draft version of FiO that iceman had shown on LessWrong. EY also has said that in his take of FiO, it would be populated by mortal ponies, not effectively immortal ones, merely because that's what's shown on the tv show -- thus his take on CelestAI would be more clearly an Unfriendly AI.
