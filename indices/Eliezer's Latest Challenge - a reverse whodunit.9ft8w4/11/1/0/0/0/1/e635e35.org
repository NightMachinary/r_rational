I only read the first couple chapters, I didn't particularly enjoy it, and that was a year or two ago. HPMOR is 11/10 IMO, it isn't actually perfect and has many flaws, but it does do so many things so well it's probably my favourite work of fiction. Pokemon OoS I think I wasn't terrible, just that the writing style didn't click with me and was trying too hard to be rationalist. Maybe 5/10. I'd recommend reading the first chapter at least, it's not a big commitment and there are lots of people on this sub who like it although I don't think many /love/ it.
