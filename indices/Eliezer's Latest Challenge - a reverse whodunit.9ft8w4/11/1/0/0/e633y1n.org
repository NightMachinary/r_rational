The shark guy was threatening and came close to potentially killing Sasuke if Naruto didn't have that syrup technique.

Earlier in the story, Orichimaru would have effortlessly crushed Naruto if Naruto didn't unleash the nine-tailed beast.

It's all subjective, but personally at least I felt like there were stakes and that Naruto could lose or face setbacks. That's something that I feel isn't that common in web fiction. All the good super-well known ones have it, e.g Worm, HPMOR, but in less popular ones like stories on Spacebattles, it's fairly rare.

Also, besides that Pokemon rationalist fic, I don't think there are any rationalist fiction that take such an educational approach where they try to teach people about stuff like game theory.
