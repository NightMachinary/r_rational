Threats that are significant? Which ones? Except Pein, Naruto didnt even have to think for more than a Page to defeat the others. And him getting all the ninja advantages so easily just somehow doesn't sit right. Specially because I'm sure the infinity chakra bit with the clones was made by the author and not the original series. Juat making up the regen rates to get that infinity chakra hack was not rational imo.
