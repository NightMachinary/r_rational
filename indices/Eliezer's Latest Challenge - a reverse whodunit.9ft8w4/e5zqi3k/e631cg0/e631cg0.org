I'm reading Waves Arisen now, I think it is an EY story, just with a slightly different style. One of the big points I think in favour is that there's no one claiming to be the author of it, that's pretty rare and would be explained by EY trying to be anonymous. The protag is very powerful, but he also regularly encounters threats that are significant- again something that's actually pretty rare for web fiction where the protag gets really powerful really fast.
