Seconded (though more than "it's good", it's more that the main character's inner monologue early on sounds /a lot/ like EY wrote Hermione), and I'll submit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6rmm7w/erogamer_411_distracted/dl6vpl3/][this]] additional piece of evidence I found while trying to solve a puzzle.

I'll also mention the way the story focuses on the implications of sexual assault reminds me of that one controversial tidbit of Three Worlds Collide, but I guess that's not really strong evidence. But yeah, I don't think that was the solution to the puzzle, Erogamer is far from obscure and still gets regular threads here.
