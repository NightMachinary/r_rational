Of all the candidates proposed I think that's the likeliest, but I hope not, because I don't want two of my favourite authors to end up being only one of my favourite authors.

I don't think it's probable though. In his interaction with fans I felt Groon is displaying a different and more modest personality than I think EY has or could fake. And I'm having difficulty imagining EY writing a character like Charles Adan without making him a straight out villain.
