I really think this could be the case, for a bunch of reasons; however, I went on a bit of a hunt for Groon's identity a while back, and when I met someone who seemed pretty sure they knew who it was, they indicated that this person definitely wouldn't want to be found.

The quote above seems to strongly indicate that Eliezer would be impressed if someone figured out which fic he was secretly writing, so...assuming my friend is credible, which I'd really think they would be, either it's a different person, or it *is* Eliezer but he'd be upset if people found out.

So my move here is to avoid making further guesses at Groon's identity, and if it turns out to be Eliezer: yeah, that would make a lot of sense and be cool. But I don't want to press, since my friend tends to know what they're talking about, so I'm pretty sure they're right about Groon not wanting to have people knowing who they are.
