The criticisms could be explained as misdirection and/or intentionally distancing himself from the characters opinions and the direction the story went (things he has had to do with HPMOR). Maintaining distance from the characters and story elements would be further motive for anonymity. But... I think EY would probably just write the story differently for some of these, as he takes it seriously.

I've also updated downward on this after looking at iceman's comment history. (I peeked at it before, but the new site layout confused me into thinking it was shorter than it was in reality.) For a long comment history like that, it would be too much non-fun work spread over too much time with too little reward.
