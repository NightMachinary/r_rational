EDIT: WELP NEVERMIND I got a "can't comment on this" ambiguous-ass response when I asked him directly, all bets are off.

I briefly considered it too, but I've talked to Bavitz a couple times on Discord and he sounded nothing like EY. Very focused on symbolism too, even outside the work itself.

If Bavitz was EY then he'd have to have crafted a whole other personality for the purpose of messing with the Homestuck discord server, which is just really unlikely even for him.

Also, while I don't like Fargo that much, I love another of his works (and have been recommending it in my flair since ancient times) and it reads nothing like EY, not even like EY-trying-something-new.
