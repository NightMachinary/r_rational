I actually believed it was a possibility at the time (at 60%) when I posted that comment, but wrote it down as a joke, because I didn't think anyone else would take it seriously due to how different the writing style was. Totally forgot about that comment and /Fargo/ until you posted the link to it.

Looking at Fargo again, I think it's a viable candidate for the reasons mentioned and you saying that it's a long-shot (due to how different the writing styles are) in my mind raises the probability of Bavitz being Eliezer. Eliezer is a smart guy and if he says that the writing style is very different and hard to recognize as his, then I would distrust any story that reads as being too similar in style to HPMOR. For example, /r Animorphs: The Reckoning/ is very reminiscent of HPMOR's Ender-style games and when reading it, I am often reminded of Eliezer's ability to make multiple Level 3 characters interacting in chaotic ways.

Long story short, I think this is the most likely story to have been written by Elizer suggested in this thread.
