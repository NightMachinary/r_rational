Flicker from [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] and sequels. I wrote her as very much in control when she is moving at high speed, but she has to slow down to sleep and talk to people, and she frequently gets clobbered by her own emotions when she does this.

She is on the autism spectrum, has PTSD, and has been known to suffer from dissociative identity disorder.
