I actually didn't notice anything that seemed like it was PTSD, even though I noticed everything else. It's probably due to a lack of knowledge on my part, but can you tell me what symptoms she was exhibiting? I'm actually planning on writing a story with on of the characters having a psychological disorder and am curious how PTSD can be demonstrated.
