I get the impression the point is that these are terrible people who play games with each other. Going by the n.x chapter divisions and named arcs I'm guessing you have an inspiration.

Let me know when your characters kill a baby to save the world, otherwise what little I read is too negative and canned to interest me.

Seriously that first chapter is a real fucking turnoff.
