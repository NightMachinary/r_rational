Aw shit I didn't even see your username lol. You definitely have read Worm.

Yeah, your first chapter sets it up nicely. At worst these are unlikable people you want me to like because Taylor is "unlikable" in some way and you think that momentum works for you. At best they're all total game theory optimal jackasses who are going to go ham on each other in some deep, masterfully characterized, socially insightful reading of how shitty people can be and the potential that yet lies inherent in the games that they play.

But the problem with this is that I stopped watching The Americans too. I couldn't stand people who hated each other that badly and their attempts to reconcile with being evil, self hating bastards taking up the entire narrative.

Simply put I doubt your web novel is going to suddenly crack wide open and blow my mind. But even if it did I can't stand your characters so I'm not gonna read 1.2 yet.
