Listen don't rewrite stories based on feedback from internet strangers. Take the advice, keep it in mind with a grain of salt for future stories, but if you go back and edit the story then it wasn't written by you but by a committee. Noting made by a committee comes out non-garbage.

Take what I said with a grain of salt too. I only read the original so how would I know if the redo is any good. :) (But seriously, if the advice isn't coming from a professional editor who knows what they're doing, the original is most likely much better)
