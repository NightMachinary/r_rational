I agree, the intro into the group made me dislike everyone for different reasons. I wish it had started with a few moments of the group working well together instead of starting with a game disaster and showing everyone's bad traits right away. There's still tension at the end of the first chapter, but it would be a lot better if I liked the group or characters by that point.

Edit: the second chapter made it far worse, I hoped he was just going to make someone fail a task while he watched/recorded the card to check for magic, not decide that he both wants points and doesn't want anyone else to get them.

Also pulling a bullet out of a buddy's wound untrained is absurd, and the need to immediately do this is similar in accuracy to action movie's explosions knocking people down unharmed.
