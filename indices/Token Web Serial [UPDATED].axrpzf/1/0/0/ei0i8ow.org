Another question I had, is Alec on the autism spectrum? A few things like him commenting that he could never reliably read Addy's expressions and the panic attack where he wanted something heavy to wrap him up make me think so, but at other times he seems fairly socially adept. I love reading neuroatypical characters but he seems to go back and forth a bit.
