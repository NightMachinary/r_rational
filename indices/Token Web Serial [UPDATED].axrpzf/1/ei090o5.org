People are being pretty harsh in this thread. Addy's a real asshole, and the other characters are kind of bland, but I think it's a fun premise. Just finished 1.2 and am enjoying it, though I could definitely use some character development/differentiation ("Brad is tall, Blaine is also tall" doesn't really let me distinguish between them). I assume having 2 A characters and 2 B characters is going to come into play, even though I'd love to never see Addy again.
