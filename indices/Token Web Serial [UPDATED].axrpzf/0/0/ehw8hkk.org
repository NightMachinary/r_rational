Thanks for the feedback. I understand that I need to put some real effort into making some of the cast more endearing to the readers.

To address the sabotage, I originally had the characters ignoring the game and working together. It was feedback from this sub-reddit that had me re-write Arc 1 to focus more on playing the game. I'll be interested to see what others think about this point before coming to a conclusion.
