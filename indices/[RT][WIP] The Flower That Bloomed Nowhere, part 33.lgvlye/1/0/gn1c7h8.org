Ahoy Badewell! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

Utsu's thoughts on thar body helped mine along, I'd been a bit confused about thar lack o' viscera so at least I be in jolly good company.

(n' me completely missed thar bleach aaargh)

Very interested in what Kam's deal be. I'd be surprised if it were just wanting thar presentation t' sail well fer career reasons, seems like that would be a minor setback at worse n' nay worth thar risk in covering up thar body. There's been so much foreshadowing fer Utsu's problem that I'll bet there's some fer Kam's as well, I'll need t' sail back through it keeping that in mind.
