Utsu's thoughts on the body helped mine along, I'd been a bit confused about the lack of viscera so at least I'm in good company.

(and I completely missed the bleach aaargh)

Very interested in what Kam's deal is. I'd be surprised if it were just wanting the presentation to go well for career reasons, seems like that would be a minor setback at worse and not worth the risk in covering up the body. There's been so much foreshadowing for Utsu's problem that I'll bet there's some for Kam's as well, I'll need to go back through it keeping that in mind.

And Utsu needs to remember to remember her oath! Although actually there might be something in there about not covering up possible murders and the last thing she needs is more guilt.
