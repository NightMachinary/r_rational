Since this is a murder mystery, I've gotta wonder if we even met our entire cast of potential culprits yet. How many people are even +on the island+ at the order's hideout?

The glossary mentions 13 people: Utsushikome, Ran, Kamrusepa, Theodoros, Ptolema, Seth, Ophelia, Lilith, Mehit, Sac'Nicte'Ic'Nal, Bardiya, Linos, Neferuaten.

But it doesn't list Anna, Durvasa, or Balthazar, just to name a few. We also haven't yet met Samium (who is supposedly here) and Ezekiel (who is supposedly here). I'm not sure if I'm forgetting anybody else. (Edit: also, Yantho)

But also ... I think they mentioned that there was going to be a huge audience for the presentations, which suggests there's actually a boatload of people that we haven't met yet. While I assume we've at least met most of the /narratively/ relevant people, this makes it difficult to narrow it down factually.
