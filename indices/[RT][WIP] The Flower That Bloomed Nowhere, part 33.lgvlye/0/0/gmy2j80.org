I really need to update the character section of the glossary. To be honest, since I got rid of the silly character cards, I sort of forget about it.

And I believe it's passingly mentioned that the other people are going to be watching the conference remotely, not while physically present. Without saying too much, though you haven't /seen/ everyone directly yet, at this point all the people in the Sanctuary have been mentioned.

The ten students: Ustushikome, Kamrusepa, Theodoros, Ran, Lilith, Ptolema, Seth, Ezekiel, Bardiya and Ophelia.

The six council members: Hamilcar, Neferuaten, Linos, Zeno, Anna and Durvasa.

The two servants/'stewards': Sacnicte and Yantho.

And three other guests: Mehit, Balthazar and Samium.

...Bringing the established total to 21 people. It's tipping my hand just a little bit, but that's not the /complete/ final count, although we are extremely close and, again, anyone left over has come up by name already. Once all potential suspects are on the table, the story will make that very clear.
