ok some actual speculation here

It's hard to come up with a motive since we don't know anything about the victim, but Balthazar is hella sketch, which in turns make Zeno sketch (oh, that's someone else I hadn't mentioned yet). But that all seems too obvious, I guess.

It seems likely that the note was given to Su in order to make her go looking for the "archive" and find the body, which would mean that the culprit wanted the body to be found.

But then why does it appear like the note was in the book for over a year? I wonder if it could have to do with the pantry that had some kind of chrono problem, although I'd probably need to reread the sequence of events to see if I can get anywhere with that hypothesis or if it implicates anybody.

Or maybe it was /actually/ put there a year ago, which would mean someone had been planning this for a long time? But that seems kind of ridiculous, why would you prepare such a tiny details so far in advance?
