Brag: this is the first (UK tax) year where I donated a full 10% of my income, and as such I'm finally taking an official GWWC pledge and should soon show up on [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/][their members page]].

In the end since the end of tax year was approaching and I still wasn't decided on where to donate, I chose to put 5/6 of the total donation budget towards [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/trust][GWWC Trust Fund]] (i.e. basically 'givewell-chosen charities'), and 1/6 towards existential risk ([[https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/][FHI]], because they get gift-aid and so my donations are immediately 20% more valuable).

This actually took quite a bit into my savings - maybe not half of what I saved this year, but probably at least a third. Seems like I wasn't anywhere near my 45% saving goal; I'll have to start watching my spending much more closely.
