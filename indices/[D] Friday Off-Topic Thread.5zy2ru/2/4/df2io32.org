I can't prove you wrong, I sympathise. What I think of as the "standard" answer, is that you try not to make things worse while continuing "basic research", because you don't want to be part of a problem while you perceive it might be a problem, and you need to give your future self a better chance of solving things / thinking better than your current self.
