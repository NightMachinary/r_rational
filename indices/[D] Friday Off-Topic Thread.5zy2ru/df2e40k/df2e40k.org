I'm kinda lost on the whole point of becoming skilled at something. From what I've seen, pretty much none of the problems which need to be solved (i.e. work that needs to be done) are solvable using what I've learned in my major / internships / jobs / etc. I don't see any potential contribution out of a degree or career in computer science. Maybe I like proper role models, but the people around me are wanting to make little mobile games and apps and I can't help but find it /astoundingly/ pointless. Like, what the /hell/ are they doing? What do they know that I don't? Facebook is one of the largest and most complex systems created by man, but /it's not an improvement/. But I don't see how I'm supposed to do any better than /that/, and it basically invalidates the entire field for me. I've talked to scientists and other engineers about what we actually need to do to make progress, and it's all /politics/, it's all /tangental/ to my expertise. And if that's true, then what on earth is it for? Is it really so ineffective? Somebody please prove me wrong, because I can't comprehend how other people cope with this.
