  From what I've seen, pretty much none of the problems which need to be solved (i.e. work that needs to be done) are solvable using what I've learned in my major / internships / jobs / etc. I don't see any potential contribution out of a degree or career in computer science.

Do you mean "the things I learned do not seem applicable to the problems I'm solving", or "the problems I'm solving, while helped by the skills, are not contributing"?

  Maybe I like proper role models, but the people around me are wanting to make little mobile games and apps and I can't help but find it astoundingly pointless. Like, what the hell are they doing? What do they know that I don't?
#+end_quote

Well, most of little games and apps are not actually very useful, sure. Though, providing good entertainment to people /is/ valuable. Do you play games? Do you not enjoy the fact that they exist?

But if you do not like the idea of people playing your game / using your app, you probably shouldn't be building those things

  Facebook is one of the largest and most complex systems created by man, but it's not an improvement.
#+end_quote

Do you mean Facebook alltogether is not an improvement, or that it's large and complex is not an improvement?

The first is a pretty big claim; and I know it's been popular recently on both reddit and ycombinator (and facebook) to say that, but I really don't think I've seen this argued well. Facebook is /great/, it's a constant source of amusement for me, and it helps me stay... well, maybe not /in touch/, but at arms-length with people that I would have become complete strangers with otherwise.

  But I don't see how I'm supposed to do any better than that, and it basically invalidates the entire field for me. I've talked to scientists and other engineers about what we actually need to do to make progress, and it's all politics, it's all tangental to my expertise. And if that's true, then what on earth is it for? Is it really so ineffective? Somebody please prove me wrong, because I can't comprehend how other people cope with this.

What do you mean by /progress/? In any case, it's most definitely not /just/ politics. Politics steer people towards certain tasks; you still need boots on the ground skilled with those particular tasks to solve them. You can't, as a single person, change the world. But you can make the world a brighter place for some people (games and other entertainment), or build tools that make other people's work easier (business service/product development), or make personal life easier for some (personal product/services). And that's really enough.
