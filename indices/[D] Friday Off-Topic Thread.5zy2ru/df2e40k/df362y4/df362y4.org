I joined computer science because I think it's the easiest way to change the world. Automation and interconnection give us new possibilities. However, they are not used to their full potential. Thus, I come. I learned stuff about CS because I had projects. Not the other way around.

If you don't what you can make, you can either search for what you can make, or leave the field and go where you think you will be more efficient. What do /you/ think we need to make progress?

As for other people, it has already been said that a majority does not care about changing the world. So they don't have to cope.
