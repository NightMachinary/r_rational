Not sure which is best for high level, but there are a heck of a lot of classes online these days. I see stats courses at Coursera, Udacity, MIT OpenCourseWare, Stanford Online, and EdX. [[/r/statistics][r/statistics]] or [[/r/askstatistics][r/askstatistics]] may have helpful info.

Also if you have the time and discipline to focus on learning without the carrot/stick of a degree, worth noting that most college professors won't chase you off if you sit in on their classes. [[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/the-man-who-snuck-into-the-ivy-league-without-paying-a-thing/386917/][This guy]] apparently sat in on Ivy League classes regularly. The main advantage of doing that over online courses is that you could make social connections typical to a university experience (and become socially acclimated to the types of people who graduate universities). I imagine the social/networking benefits of "ghosting" at a high end / ivy league university would be higher than at a local community college or state university.

For getting college credit on stuff you've learned, there are various options like CLEP, DANTES/DSST, AP (which is supposed to be high school, but has no actual age restriction), and various other options like portfolio evaluation and challenging the class. One possible way to graduate high end school without paying as much tuition would be to get most of the requirements met at lower-end schools and then transfer the credits to the high end school for the final semester.
