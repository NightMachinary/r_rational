If anyone's in the mood for some light satire, I enjoyed some of the "clickventures" at Clickhole, a clickbait-parody site run by The Onion. These three in particular may be of interest to some here:

1. [[http://www.clickhole.com/clickventure/youre-computer-can-you-pass-turing-test-4009#27,][You're A Computer. Can You Pass The Turing Test?]]

2. [[http://www.clickhole.com/clickventure/youve-decided-upload-your-consciousness-hard-drive-4977#1,][You've Uploaded Your Consciousness Onto A 250 MB Hard Drive! Please Customize Your Perfect New Digital Life.]]

3. [[http://www.clickhole.com/clickventure/youre-adam-first-man-can-you-eat-right-fruit-and-o-3957#1,][You're Adam, The First Man! Can You Eat The Right Fruit And Overthrow God?]]
