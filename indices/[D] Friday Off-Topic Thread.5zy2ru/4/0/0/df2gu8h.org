(shrugs) I'm a simple person with simple tastes. I prefer fun Hogwarts adventures with goofy protagonists to grimdark attempts at taking over the world in which the author perhaps tried a /little/ too hard.

(Compare, e.g., [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185][the /Harry the Hufflepuff/ trilogy]] with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685][the /Firebird Trilogy/]].)
