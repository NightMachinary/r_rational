[[http://www.reddit.com/r/meiouandtaxes][MEIOU & Taxes]], the biggest mod for [[http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4][/Europa Universalis IV/]], is on its way to becoming /even more/ historically-accurate (and /slightly less/ processor-straining) than it already is, if you weren't aware.

(The modders are too lazy to consolidate their own updates in a concise forum thread or cross-post them to Reddit, and I apparently was the only person who cared enough to take up the mantle when the previous archivist abandoned his post.)

I got around to finishing /[[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]]/, on my second attempt. Mister Egeustimentis was pretty cool (remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/82][that /Partially Kissed Hero/ sequence where Queen Alice of Wonderland turns Harry's soul into a garden for the secondary characters to trim]]?), but the [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/04/significant-digits-chapter-one.html]["frontloaded mysteries"]] that permeate the story really grated on my nerves (I dropped my first attempt at reading it because I was too impatient for the exposition to catch up with the story's events). So far, IIRC, /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11117811][Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence]]/ is the only /HPMoR/ continuation that I've particularly liked--though I can't at this point remember my reasons, since I read it /quite/ a while ago and only once. I guess I should re-read it...
