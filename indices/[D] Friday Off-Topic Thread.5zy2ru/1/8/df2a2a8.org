From memory I would say "The Time Traveler's Wife" is the most consistent and logical time travel story I know, although it's probably not what you're looking for as it's more a man vs nature type thing.

If you are specifically looking for time travel battles 'Primer' is definitely the most acclaimed.\\
"Time braid" has some exploits but indeed restricts contact for most of the story.\\
I suppose you're right that it's just hard to get a functional story from the premise as I can't even think of bad examples.
