It's admittedly been a long time since I watched it (and it's played for laughs, so I can't promise how /consistent/ it might be, but I remember it doing time travel better than most), but /Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure/ is a movie where a duo of hedonists is bootstrapped into completing a closed time loop to uplift humanity into a golden age inspired by their ethics and example, involving multiple precommitment-triggered acausal strategies (including a precommitment fight over which side would defeat the other and set up both sides attacks once they had control of the time machine) and characters realizing that 'wait, we're not good enough at this, but we have a time machine' and going back to train and vacation and party with historical hot babes for a few years in the middle of an important challenge. My favorite part is that these characters are lovable idiots, but it's /still/ really obvious to them (when they take a few seconds to think about it) how useful time travel is.
