It's not exactly that 'events are fixed' which bothers me, it's more that said events are so human-level. It's not even "X dies in Y circumstance" it's "X dies" and any circumstance which results in X dying is allowed.

Even /that's/ not fundamentally bad, because it could've made sense if they talked about souls and said that a soul is a fundamental thing which time travel does care about, so if a person dies Time makes sure their soul ends up leaving their body even if you go back. But they /didn't/, they just sort of said the death is a 'significant event' somehow and sort of assumed we'd be okay with the fundamental laws of the universe working on macroscopic, human-intuitive rules.

If you had certain, arbitrarily-defined areas of time and space (as in "Within this volume from time A to time B") where things couldn't change even through time travel, that could make sense where Time acts as an agent to cause minute changes to the world such that, in a reverse butterfly effect, events there happen in exactly the same way. Even if you attach it to souls as fundamental objects and have Time say 'yeah, this soul's dying at this time, butt out time-travellers' it could still make sense. You just have to not shove it all off onto 'well a death is a major thing, don't think about it too much'.
