I think the [[https://www.amazon.com/Clockwork-Rocket-Orthogonal-Book-ebook/dp/B006NZBFD2][Orthogonal Trilogy by Greg Egan]] is an edge case. I think it has the single best time travel mechanic of anything I've ever read, and the story is centred around using it to save the word.

That said, there's no real time-travel based conflict since time travel is somewhat difficult and takes a lot of manpower and energy, but there's some cool stuff in there nevertheless.
