Primer is boring, but I don't think that's even the biggest problem. The incredibly bland acting and writing are just icing on the cake for a plot that /doesn't explain anything/. It's incredibly frustrating to watch and have no idea what's going on, especially since the few explanations we are later shown to be incorrect. It is internally consistent, but only if you go looking for an explanation that the film never gives you.
