I don't find that entertaining, and I question whether it can even be considered a story. When I first watched it I was so frustrated and annoyed I didn't want to figure out what happened. When I finally looked it up I thought the explanation was overcomplicated and still had some holes.

Maybe it's just because characters can often be a deciding factor whether I enjoy a story or not, and these guys were not only very uninteresting but I didn't understand their motivations. They just...did stuff. Even the timelines explaining the plot offered no insight into why the characters did this stuff.
