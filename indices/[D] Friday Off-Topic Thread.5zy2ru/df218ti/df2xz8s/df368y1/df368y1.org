Idk, Steins Gate has that BS time travel trope wherein certain (human level) events are supposedly fixed and can't be altered (thus convoluting things enough for there to be a story). I mean I certainly can't think of a better time travel anime, but it still uses the kind of tropes the author says he's avoiding.
