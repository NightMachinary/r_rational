Anyone knows examples of works of fiction with complicated yet internally consistent time_travel-based conflicts? I know /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer][Primer]]/ is supposed to be one, though I didn't watch it yet; anything else?

From my experience, time travel in fiction is either:

1. Inconsistent. The time travel mechanic is vague, and used as Deus Ex Machina which can do anything/can't do anything as the plot demands. The story's plot is either /intuitive/ (and therefore easy-to-follow), no matter how meaningless if you stop to think about it, or reduced to non-TT-based conflicts. (Example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho][Doctor Who]]/.)

2. Underused. The characters who have time-travel devices forget to use them, or use them incompetently. Again, the plot is either reduced to non-TT-based, or intuitive yet meaningless. (Example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary][Mirai Nikki]]/.)

3. Restricted to reduce complexity. Only one side of the conflict has access to the time machine (example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MotherOfLearning][Mother of Learning]]/), or the time-travel devices' capabilities are restricted, by the mechanic or by the society (example: /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality][HPMOR]]/). Basically, in the end it's /not/ a story about time-travel battles, the time travel isn't central to its main conflict.

The works that can't be fit into the three above categories are very rare, which is understandable: their plot would get ridiculously complicated, hard to both write and follow. Alexander Wales' /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]]/ would be on the /simpler/ side of the spectrum, to give an example.

Which makes it all the more interesting, doesn't it?
