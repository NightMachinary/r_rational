I'm not sure we know whether that's the case. But it is true that an entad was used to allow Thargox to puppet somebody else as their council representative.

God I love WtC. Wish we had two AlexanderWales, where the second one just wrote non-canon or non-canon-relevant reams of material for us to read daily. Just like interludes or something low-stakes he could output 6k words of, nightly. And maybe a third and fourth AlexanderWales too. Is that too greedy?
