I fully understand your issue.

The problem is that you expect Harry to be better than that.

He spent so much time in the earlier chapters espousing to Draco, Dumbledore, and Hermione that he had learned to think /properly/, that his mind did /not/ shy away from the dark and dangerous thoughts he did not want to think, things it would be painful to think about.

He mentioned that he had trained himself to turn his mind /toward/ the painful thoughts instead of away from them. To confront them.

And that's exactly what he's not doing here. He's running away. He's fleeing as fast as he can from his actions and the consequences of those actions, and stopping himself from even considering what he's done in a rational manner.

There's probably a joke or reference to be made here about how Vol d'Mort "Flight from Death" would respond in a similar situation. There's also a pragmatic argument to be made. But I see where you are coming from - Harry seems to have abandoned a lot of what made him Harry.

  A burglar breaks into a man's home. The man kills the burglar with a shotgun. Then, instead of calling the police, he digs a shallow grave in his backyard, buries the body, cleans up the blood, and wipes down his gun. When the police come by the next day - someone thought they heard the gunshot - the man lies to the police and says that nothing happened. His motivations for this might be sympathetic. Perhaps he's worried that castle doctrine in his state is far from secure, and that he might be in legal trouble. Perhaps he's worried about retaliation from the burglar's friends or family. Perhaps he just doesn't want anyone to know what he's done. But this deception still erodes my sympathy for the man, and it makes me see the man's grief over what he's done as somewhat suspect.

I think the problem with this analogy is that you are looking at it from a modern context, where the burglar's friends may retaliate, or the state might object, but one would be minor and physical and the other would be ordered but major.

That's not the real situation though. Harry in a similar metaphor to yours is a man who has just killed a Nobleman's firstborn son in the middle ages, inside that Nobleman's city. He hides the body and his act now because he knows that the entire society he occupies will target him regardless of circumstance.

He killed many of the most prominent purebloods. They have children, political allies, and huge fortunes who could now be turned into finding and punishing their killer, in a culture that still believes in honor-debts, death-duels and revenge killing or punishment.

He also took an ancient artifact which half the world would search for and happily murder him to take, and which helps to accomplish some or all of his stated goals. Keeping that hidden is again, the only choice if he wants to live.

And on top of all this, he's lost Dumbledore. The powerful wizard who was protecting him from the rest of the world, a strong political and combat figure, and one who trusted him implicitly.

(As an aside, I just realized that Voldemort defeated Dumbledore and then Harry defeated Voldemort - It is possible Harry is now Master of the Elder Wand.)

The actions Harry has taken are realistic for his position, they are the best way for him to ensure both his future survival and his own plans. In taking them however, he's lost some of his idealism, the Code of Batman has already been sacrificed, but now he's also dropping the Code of Truth. He's sacrificing what he needs to sacrifice now in order to save himself and his future plans. It's a very Slytherin move.

That these actions seem cold and callous is a consequence of the story's realism.
