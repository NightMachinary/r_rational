Thanks for the insightful comment. And yeah, I think you're right. Harry is losing all of the things that made me like him. He used to believe in truth, and he's thrown that away because it didn't seem practical to him. I see in his actions a cynicism that's replaced his idealism.

  "The truth is sacred," Harry said tonelessly. "One of my most treasured possessions is a button which reads 'Speak the truth, even if your voice trembles'."

That was one of my favorite passages.

Heroes are supposed to overcome their flaws as the story reaches the climax. They're supposed to triumph through their virtues. Harry's biggest virtue was his belief in /life/ and /truth/, and he won by /killing/ and /lying/.

I thought that Harry was a hero, but it turns out he's not - he's just a protagonist. And that bums me out. I'll grant that it might be realistic, but that's the source of my discontent.
