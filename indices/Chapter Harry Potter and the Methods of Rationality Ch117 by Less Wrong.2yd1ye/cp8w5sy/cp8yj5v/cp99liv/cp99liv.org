I don't know. The fact is that my sympathy towards Harry has been heading rapidly downhill these last few chapters, and I've been trying to figure out why that is, when relatively few people seem to be having this same problem (though I have seen some).

It might go back to this paragraph:

  Harry Potter was speaking rapidly but loudly. "Voldemort - tried to revive - he summoned Death Eaters /and he killed them/, stole their blood and life - Hermione's body was there, I don't know why, maybe Voldemort was planning to use it for something - Voldemort came back, he resurrected himself, but Hermione /followed him back/ and she /destroyed him/, he's gone, it's over. It happened in a graveyard near Hogwarts, it's," Harry Potter rose to his feet, still swaying, "I think it's in that direction." Harry Potter pointed in the rough direction the CRACK had come from, "I'm not sure how far. The sound from there took twenty seconds to get here, so maybe two minutes on a broomstick -"

This lie feels so calculated, and so ugly to me. Maybe I can draw an analogy here - an analogy of what it feels like to me, not necessarily what it is.

A burglar breaks into a man's home. The man kills the burglar with a shotgun. Then, instead of calling the police, he digs a shallow grave in his backyard, buries the body, cleans up the blood, and wipes down his gun. When the police come by the next day - someone thought they heard the gunshot - the man lies to the police and says that nothing happened. His motivations for this might be sympathetic. Perhaps he's worried that castle doctrine in his state is far from secure, and that he might be in legal trouble. Perhaps he's worried about retaliation from the burglar's friends or family. Perhaps he just doesn't want anyone to know what he's done. But this deception still erodes my sympathy for the man, and it makes me see the man's grief over what he's done as somewhat suspect.

Anyway, that's what I think I've been feeling. It probably doesn't match what you've been feeling. But I don't think it's necessarily wrong for me to feel that way.
