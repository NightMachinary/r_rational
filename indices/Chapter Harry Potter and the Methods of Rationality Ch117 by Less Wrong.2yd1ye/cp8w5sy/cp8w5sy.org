So I've been thinking about what my problem with these last two or three chapters has been, and I think I've figured it out: we don't get much of an idea about what Harry is thinking.

This starts midway through chapter 115, after Harry does all this moralizing about what's to be done with Voldemort and ends up removing almost all of his memories and transfiguring him into a gem.

And then Harry has an idea, which the audience doesn't get to see, and begins putting a plan into motion, which the audience can guess by the end of the chapter. But we don't actually see any of what Harry is thinking - what train of thought leads him down that path. We can only make guesses, and the guesses ... they don't endear me to Harry, because they seem so self-serving.

So then the next chapter is told entirely from someone else's point of view, and we're still left in the dark about what Harry is thinking. We see him sitting quietly in the bleachers after having killed all those people, and then we see him put on this act and lie to everyone. We still don't know what his motivations are in this plan, we can only guess at them, and we certainly don't know what he's feeling while he's sitting there watching the Quidditch game. And in the next chapter, there's so much glossed over - a long conversation with McGonagall where he spewed more lies? Harry hiding the Philosopher's Stone so that no one would find it? Surely he spoke to other people, and listened to the gossip.

And it's not until the news of the Death Eaters dying that we get back into Harry's head again, and it's only then that he realizes that he's killed anyone. It strikes me as disingenuous, or maybe just inconsistent. It's part of Harry's story that he tells at the Quidditch stands that the Death Eaters have been killed, and he says this with horror. It's implied that he's told this story against to McGonagall and the Aurors.

Are we supposed to believe that he's entered a dissociative state? That he has enough presence of mind to enact a self-serving conspiracy where he tells people that the Death Eaters were being slaughtered but doesn't have the presence of mind to realize that he was the one who killed them?

I don't begrudge Harry having killed them, or even necessarily that he failed to think of reviving them (though the moralizing about his children's children's children does ring a bit hollow for that reason). But there seems to be this disconnect between "Harry is a traumatized eleven-year-old" and "Harry is lying through his teeth in order to serve his own goals", and I think that quite a bit of the reason that I feel this way is because there's a very long time where Harry's thoughts are opaque.
