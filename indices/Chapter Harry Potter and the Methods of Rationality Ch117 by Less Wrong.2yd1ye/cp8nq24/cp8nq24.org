  For it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it.

I am confused. How could Harry go eight to nine hours since the fight and still refuse to recognize he killed thirty-six people in self-defense. Nothing he says now about "the value of human life" or "death would be sad" will ever mean anything, /ever/. Harry has had more than enough time to calm down and think, and yet the thought of killing actual humans never crossed his mind? Not /once/?

Harry fails as a rationalist. He completely fails. Despite all his minor triumphs and improvements, he is still exactly where he began when it actually counts. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yczbl/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/cp8dhqu][I'm going to have to agree with]] [[/u/alexanderwales]] that Harry cannot call himself the hero of the story anymore -- he has acted in the most selfish ways possible.

/Damn/, he really, really needs Hermione.
