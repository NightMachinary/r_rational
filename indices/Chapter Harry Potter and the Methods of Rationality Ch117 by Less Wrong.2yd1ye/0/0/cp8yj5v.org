From wikipedia:

It is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality. [...]Fugues are usually precipitated by a stressful episode

Why is Harry acting out of character? Because he is out of character. Author said so, right at the top of the chapter. We can see in chapter 115 that every time his mind gets too close to thinking about what he has done, it shies away like a kicked puppy:

  What he'd just done - The thought was shut off, making space for an awareness of other things.

  The silver masks stayed on, making all the hair originate in skulls instead of human faces - The thought was shut off, making space for awareness of other things.

Given all of this, I don't understand why we are suprised when there is a giant blind spot in Harry's thinking in regards to the death eater's fate.

They were nazis, or stormtroopers, or substitute in your favorite faceless bad. LV, twisted as it is, was inside the monkeysphere, and therefor was a person to save. Being a rationalist doesn't actually repair the broken mechanisms in your brain, it just gives you firmware to counter act them. Break the firmware, and ymmv.
