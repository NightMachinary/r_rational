Re: Truth-telling.

Harry liked, from the very start of HPMOR, to make a game of speaking the literal truth in a deceptive manner intended to mislead and deceive even though the exact words were not technically if adjudicated by a court of law a "falsehood". I never really counted him as a fan of straight-up truth - if you say a combination of words that you /strongly believe/ will cause the listener to believe X, while you instead believe Â¬X, then even if your words are in some sense technically "not false", for all moral and ethical intents and purposes your use of words to mislead makes you a liar anyways, and not meaningfully different morally from someone who speaks straight-up lies. Harry's always been deceitful and manipulative, but also for some reason a fan of pretending to himself that speaking no sentence that is not technically false is the same thing as honesty, which it really, *really* isn't.
