I have not read the book, but changing satellite orbits or shifting space vessels around takes fuel, and if this book is realistic to current propulsion methods, fuel really isn't there to be wasted. If they are using remote fuel methods, there might be fuel available, but we haven't started using remote fuel methods outside Earth orbit yet.
