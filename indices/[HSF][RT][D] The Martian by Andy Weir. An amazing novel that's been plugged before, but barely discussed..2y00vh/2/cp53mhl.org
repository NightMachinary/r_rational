For the puzzle of "Give NASA a backup way to communicate with Watney", let's make a few assumptions. Radio is totally a lost cause. the strongest receiver antenna he could make simply couldn't hear the strongest transmitter in orbit. The only ship between Earth and Mars is the Ares ship.

How powerful would a visible light laser need to be to cross 18 light seconds and still be visible to the naked eye? A simple satellite in orbit around Earth might be easier, but I'm not an optical engineer, I don't know the right equations to calculate the strength needed to make Earth visibly change in brightness from mars.

My other idea was to use the Ares and the manuevering jets to slowly turn a dark/light side towards Mars. Considering how heavy Ares was, this plan would likely have a very small data cap.

But really, those solutions are extremely silly, when I have one that requires foresight, but would offer the most bits available to communicate to Mark. There are Satellites in orbit around Mars. Some of these would be visible to Mark. When in high bandwidth mode, the entire orbital situation should've been uploaded to Mark's computer, and kept updated. If high bandwidth is lost, the satellites visible to the naked eye are logged and watched. If Mark wants information from NASA, he writes out in rocks his question, and the designation of two satellites visible the next night, marking one as yes, the other as no. NASA then moves the right satellite so it's no longer on a course in sync with the record. With this, he reliably has as many bits of data possible.

That could've made the later half more interesting, knowing he could literally and accurately divined the sky like the Nazca lines. It would've been intersting to see how he'd spend, say, 7 last bits of data (or more accurately, 7 bit flips. If the question was simple and low-risk, he could ask the same question every night, and have the system return 0 (no change) instead, like "Do I need to pack up and move ASAP?"
