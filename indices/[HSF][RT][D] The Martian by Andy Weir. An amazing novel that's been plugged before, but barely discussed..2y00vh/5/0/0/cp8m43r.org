I wasn't aware of anything surrounding the game when I bought it. I got it as part of a humble bundle which I bought for the other games. I can understand where you're coming from and I'll have to look into Subnautica.

That said, it's a complete (short) game that I still think is worth the price of a movie. But, yeah not much replay value once you've finished and I did leave wanting more. Keep this in mind if anyone wants to buy it.
