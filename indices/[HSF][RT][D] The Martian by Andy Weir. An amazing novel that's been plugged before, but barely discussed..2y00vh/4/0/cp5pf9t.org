His character did feel weaker in the last arc of the story, but honestly I didn't mind too much. Most of his big problems were solved, and the last few obstacles that Mark dealt with were relatively minor compared to past events. It's understandable though, they were the likeliest problems to arise, and the story was very strong about making plausible problems for the character.

It's reasonable that Mark's strength of character was weaker in the final arc, extended isolation hurts the psyche. The author made a good decision when he used that arc to mainly focus on filling in the last details of the initial disaster as well as the characters of the other people.
