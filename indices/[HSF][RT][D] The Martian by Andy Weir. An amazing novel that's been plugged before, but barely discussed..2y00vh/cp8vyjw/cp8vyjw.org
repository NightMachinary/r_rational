  Who knows how far south the storm goes? Well, NASA probably knows. And the news stations back on earth are probably showing it. And there's probably a website like [[http://www.watch-mark-watney-die.com][www.watch-mark-watney-die.com]]. So there's probably a hundred million people who know exactly how far south the storm goes. But I'm not one of them.
