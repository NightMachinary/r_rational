Yup, the movie is scheduled to come out in november, and I'm cautiously optimistic. It feels like it won't be very faithful to the source though, considering the main character's being played by Matt Damon. Hardly the first choice for a botanist-engineer with a wonderful sense of self-deprecating humor.

Between his sense of humor, creativity, determination in the face of pure diablos ex machina, and the scientific accuracy across the fields covered in the book, I fear that the movie will fail to convincingly capture one or more of the core elements that made the book a masterpiece.
