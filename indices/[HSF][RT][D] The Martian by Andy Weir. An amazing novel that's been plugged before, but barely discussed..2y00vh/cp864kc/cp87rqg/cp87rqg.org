I nearly got Farsky when it was in a humble bundle, but after researching it I fled. Poor dev behavior coupled with stopping updates without even implimenting the promised multiplayer isn't something I'm willing to support.

The devs of Natural Selection 2 are making a similar game, Subnautica, and they've got a much better reputation, So that game's on my watchlist.
