I also really enjoyed this book.

On an almost unrelated note, while reading it I was reminded of [[http://www.farskygame.com][Farsky]], an indie game with a similar theme. Basically you're stuck under the sea rather than on Mars. While the game is much less realistic and not 'rational' it captures the atmosphere very well I feel. So if you want to relive a similar adventure yourself I'd highly recommend Farsky! It's not too long either, my first playthrough was just a few hours.
