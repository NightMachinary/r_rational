This original ending (of The Martian) seems more genuine to me. I just finished the remastered audiobook and when he began talking about the huge cost of rescuing him, my thought was "Was it really worth it? Probably not." And then he mentioned how it's basically just human nature to want to rescue people, and so the implication is that intentionally not rescuing him despite have a good chance to succeed if they throw enough resources at the problem would just seem like a bad idea to most people. Yet in reality, I think that tough choice would probably be the right one in real life.

Although actually, by the sounds of it I don't think the original ending implies this other view, so perhaps the new feel-good ending is better than the original.
