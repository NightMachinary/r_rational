Hard disagree. Sure, it's not in the subreddit rules, but it's a bit of a common courtesy here.

Enough people do it and it's not some immense barrier to post. I would prefer if whenever someone recommends something to actually explain why it's relevant to the rational subreddit, instead of just doing a drive-by posting. Summaries aren't enough; I want to know why it's a /rational/ recommendation.
