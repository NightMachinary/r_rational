Great points, I didn't really get Saitama enjoying helping King, between Saitama's seeming indifference and King calling him a dolt at the beginning, and Saitama's comment of "I defeated you 10 minutes ago..." distracted me from smiling at the challenge. Rereading it I can definitely see Saitama enjoyed the challenge of Boros, and the time crunch from King was challenging.

Awesome story by the way, thank you for writing it!
