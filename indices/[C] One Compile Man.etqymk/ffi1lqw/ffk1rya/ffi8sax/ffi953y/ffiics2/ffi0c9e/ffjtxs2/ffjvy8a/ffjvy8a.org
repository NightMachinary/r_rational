Thanks for the comments! Just my opinion as the author: when I adapt / remix other works, I'm not committed to keeping all the themes and characters absolutely identical to the originals (e.g., in my Rick and Morty posts from a while back, Rick and Morty aren't /quite/ like they are in canon, either). My opinion on Saitama is that his true power is almost literally plot armor - no matter what happens, he will always have a successful counter, and that's just how it is in the OPM universe. He's depressed that he is never challenged. Here, he also faces that, but the combination of all the stuff he had to do still exhilarated him and pushed his limits, and also he felt good helping King. So he ends the day fairly satisfied, though this may not be permanent for him. As for King, well, I just thought it was funny. My version of Saitama doesn't care whether King gets the credit in the end. Anyway, that's just what was going through my head while writing.
