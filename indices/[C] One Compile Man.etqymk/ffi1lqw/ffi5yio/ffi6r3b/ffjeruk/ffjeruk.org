I mean, while I agree there doesn't really seem to be anything to this one to make it "rational" or even adjacent, I'm not sure I agree that the lack of realism in terms of capability itself disqualifies it. If, for example, the story were to realistically explore how people would actually respond to an inhumanly competent programmer, I'd say that could qualify as rational.
