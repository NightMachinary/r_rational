The most obvious approach, IMO, is to make the protagonist (or one of the protagonists) a third party rather than the overpowered coder themself, and turn it into a mystery story, trying to find out the identity of the coder, what they're trying to accomplish and why they can do the things they can do. Which of course this story does quite a bit of, but they were clearly going for style and humor over rationality, which isn't necessarily a bad thing IMO.
