up to "Bang sat down at Nakamura's desk and opened his laptop" and I haven't seen any technobabble, believe it or not this is all /very real stuff/ being mentioned, so I don't particularly have confidence in this assessment, but obviously I might have to update on that later

EDIT: Okay, after having finished there was /no/ technobabble, all of the technical language used are absolutely real things, and obviously the achievements here are over-the-top but still ultimately grounded in reality in /some/ respect, there's no terms being made up to sound impressive or techy or anything, but it's obviously absurd in the standard way
