Not exactly rational but it was entertaining. Definitely drives home the sheer absurdity of powers that make x skill infallible!

Code that's magically written to handle circumstances outside of specifications, and the vast amount of intelligence/problem solving involved is so much less believable to me than canon one punch man! I do think the happy ending missed the point though, Saitama was still never challenged and King was still claiming unearned credit. Missed the themes of the characters and didn't line up with the story in my opinion.
