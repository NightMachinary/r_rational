One Punch Man palette-swapped so that all references to physical capability or violence have been replaced with hacking/programming jokes.

As a Unix systems engineer, it was fun to see a few references to utilities and methodologies we use in the real world (shoutouts to grep, awk, gdb, python etc), but I have to agree there's very little about this one that makes it RT or even RT-ADJ.

I'll say one positive thing about it, which is that I enjoy the treatment of "programming as a muscle" insofar as /yes/ practice is truly the only way to learn...

But that's kinda as far as it goes. "MY CODE ALWAYS COMPILES ON THE FIRST TRY" is a silly fun superpower but also in real programming, errors are a huge part of the computer's way of telling you what's /really/ going on with your code.

Failures and errors are part of a conversation you have with a machine. But that can't be explored in this fic because Saitama just gets everything right the first time.

So yeah. Silly, fun. Nonrational.

Edit: if you enjoyed One Compile Man but hunger for something meatier, I recommend [[http://thecodelesscode.com/contents][The Codeless Code]]. It's largely about the philosophy of programming and is fairly educational. (Anthology series of vignettes, not an overarching plot. Some mild worldbuilding.)
