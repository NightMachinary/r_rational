The second point, that moving an object while moving is more difficult because of the relative motion, doesn't make much sense.

Surely any object that you move while stationary is going to have relative motion as well. How are you able to handle that sort of relative motion but not the sort where you move too, or the sort where an object is moving before you "grip" it?

I get that it might be more complicated in the case of running, where your centre of gravity may change quite a bit over your run cycle, but what about walking or using devices which don't affect your centre of gravity?

Also, why is telekinetically moving yourself impossible? "Centre of mass" is a property of the "you system", not any individual part of you. You should be able to move, say, your torso to the same effect, unless telekinesis for some reason operates only on the human definition of an object like HPMOR's definition of canon transfiguration.

There's a lot of questions that aren't answered, too. Which of Newton's laws apply? Could you lift a planet? Could you rotate a rapidly spinning object against its plane of rotation? Could you stymie a telekinetic by draping strands of cobweb between two objects? Could you move something you were standing on?
