The last image bothers me about not being able to move myself because the power works by using my own body as the center of a reference frame. Even if I can't use another object as the unmoving center of a reference frame, it should still be possible to move myself.

Assuming that I am strong enough to lift someone up from the ground, I should be strong enough to 'push' down on someone with the same amount of force. If I then 'push' down on the ground, then I should be able to lift myself up, because the telekinesis is exerting force and the force has to go somewhere. So either the ground is compressed or I lift myself up depending on the hardness and density of the ground.

Another way to explain my problem is that if telekinesis works by increasing the distance between myself and another object, there should be cases where the object is being moved and cases where I am the one being moved instead. The distinction between the two cases would likely come down to whether the object has less or more mass than myself.
