Um. . . I'm not sure many are as rational friendly, but most of what I've seen of quality series is in the lol !Foundation genre. The more rational friendly arcs are often embedded without a cannon hub Thaddius Xyank's tales from FortuneFavorstheBold (The guy who wrote the Thamiel reboot all of humanity printer) has a fun time travel exploration [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/iteration-0][Iteration 0]] There's a amazing lone immortal tale of Dr. Bright talking about how he is the foundation that I think predates Watts deep time linelayer series but I don't remember the title.

I'm mostly chiming in here in hopes that someone suggests a hub that I've missed and will appreciate.

I probably didn't give you quite what you want. What type of tale or aggregation of hypothetical cannon are you looking for? If nothing else reading the SCP-1 proposals are usually a good way to find things you might like in the overarching narratives there.
