No, see, there are two kinds of "time travel" in Looper.

The first is when you get in a time machine, go back, and change something. This "rewinds" the universe to the point you went back to, which then runs forward again in real time. There /are/ at least some butterflies here, which can affect the Loopers' job prospects; one such change is responsible for the Rainmaker suddenly laying off the entire workforce. (This is why they try not to kill them - they're worried it might be too large a change, and might affect their bosses in the future. They actually mention this. They can totally kill your past self if they need to.)

The second happens once you /get/ to the past. For, um, reasons (I blame /Back to the Future/) your existence in the past is now tied to the probability of your existence in the future. If that changes, then the universe will adjust you to fit the new most-likely-version of the future. But the /past/ never changes.

This isn't recomputing the entire history of the world to be self-consistent; just altering the time-traveller, personally, at the moment the timeline changes. (It's not clear how memories they formed after arriving in the past work; do they remember having arrived with legs?)

Other changes /can/ affect you; there's a scene around halfway through where future!Joe's memories change, and he remembers having had a kid in the future; and a later one where his memories start switching back and forth between different possible wives, briefly incapacitating him. (Of course, I'd bet you could coma yourself as long as there was a decent chance you'd be woken up and some point.)
