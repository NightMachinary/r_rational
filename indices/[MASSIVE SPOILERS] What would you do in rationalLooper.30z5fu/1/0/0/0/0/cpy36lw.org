I'd be inclined to say that as soon as B goes back, A ceases to exist - they're merely a "possibility" that informs B's motivations and memories.

So yes, B has as much time as they like to kill A "before" A has a chance to travel back and stop him.

(If you think this is horrifying, incidentally, you are of course right. That's why time travel is always declared /massively illegal/ as soon as it's invented.)

I'm pretty sure anything else would be incompatible with the film's plot, actually; Old Joe never has to worry about the Rainmaker or any of those future gangsters coming back to stop him, /Terminator/-style.
