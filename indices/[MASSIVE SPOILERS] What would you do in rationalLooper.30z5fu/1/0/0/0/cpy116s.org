But isn't that still a strange sort of "time bubble" where the Eye Of The Universe is basically centered on whoever happens to be time traveling at that moment? Like, what happens if two people go back in time at once? Does the person who went farther back in time have priority?

Or for example, if Person A and Person B both plan to go into the past and kill each other's past self, and Person B goes back first, does time basically stop for Person A until Person B finishes whatever he was doing? Or can A go into the past himself while B is still mucking around there and, say, fight each other?
