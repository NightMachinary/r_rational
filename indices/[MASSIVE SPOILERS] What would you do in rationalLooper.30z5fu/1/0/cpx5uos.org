I think the main problem the "time travel" rules had was that it was entirely contained within the individual, and selectively at that. Why would you need to capture the future self of someone whose past self you've already captured? Because they might, potentially, get free later, and thus their future self is still running around?

Then why if my future self is running away from you, and you cut my present self's legs off, does my future self suddenly fall down without legs? That's just bananas. How did I GET there without legs? There's no potentiality for respawning legs. Unless the moment you cut my past self's legs off I suddenly have robot legs, spontaneous leg removal isn't an effect of time travel, it's voodoo witchcraft.

I get why the film makers did it, it made for some very compelling in-the-moment suspense and visceral horror, but it's a type of time travel that barely makes sense to be called that. It's not just nonsensical as a mechanic, like you say the characters are constantly holding the idiot ball: there's no explanation as to why they don't just kill the past self, since as we see later, it makes the future self suddenly disappear.

As such, I'm not really sure what I would do in the Looper world, because it's just an inherently nonsensical set of rules. If I just had to accept "that's how reality is," I'm not sure it would change much. What would I do if I could go back in time and have my fate linked to whatever new things happened to my past self? Maybe put them in a coma and hook them up to life support so nothing bad happens to any of their limbs, since apparently nothing short of that or death would actually affect me in any way.
