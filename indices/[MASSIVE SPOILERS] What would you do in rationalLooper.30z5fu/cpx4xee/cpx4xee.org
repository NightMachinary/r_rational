[EDIT: link to the chart is acting weird; you have to click through from Drive if you want to view the text, apparently.]

Since the universal response of the internet to this film, including mine, was to simultaneously love it and yell at the screen "but that makes no /sense/!" So, naturally, I started literally making a diagram to try and figure out what happened and if it was a paradox or the authors just forgot how time travel worked or what.

/But/, on trying to write out a diagram, it actually seems like the rules are perfectly self-consistent ... if you assume a surprisingly large amount of "free will" (or random chance) such that people's actions are inherently unpredictable (and thus never catch up to their future selves with any certainty until it's too late.) It's merely the character's /actions/ that seem to be a tad nonsensical, and even that can be chalked up to regular old irrationality on their part.

So ... what /would/ you do, on finding yourself in the world of Looper at the beginning of the film?
