Hey Max,

First of all, thanks very much for the feedback and reading as much as you did. You make valid points all of which bear considering. I would agree a hook of some kind helps and just hoping readers will hang in there until things get interesting is not going to work out most of the time.

That said, in this story I'm trying a bunch of things. First, it's very short chapters released daily. Seven chapters a week is pretty brutal and the pace of the story is quite slow. I think it takes a while to get used to that. Some readers wait until the end of the week to read, some can't hack it and quit.

I'm also writing another story (The Good Student) which is long chapters (3000-4000 words) released weekly. I'm using this as a way to compare what readers respond best to.

Bitter is also very much a slice of life story. Even in game (and the story is actually predominantly in the VR world, just not at the start) there are a lot of non-action almost mundane scenes. Which may seem counter to what you would want in an adventure-type story, but it is a fairly popular genre that some readers like. It suits a web novel as small chunks of life presented in an interesting/amusing way can be quite addictive. I'm not saying this story has achieved that, but that's another thing I'm experimenting with.

Britta herself is a difficult character to like, but most of my characters have an element of that, and hooking a reader against their better judgement and getting them to relate to a less than perfect MC is far more rewarding for me as a writer than creating a Mary Sue who is a wonderful person being unfairly mistreated for some unknown reason.

Britta is going to change and grow, hopefully becoming someone people want to root for.. The chance of me screwing that up are fairly high, but that's what makes it fun to try. The great thing about writing it as a serial is that I have a lot of room to explore that. Having a fairly large reader base already gives me a little extra wiggle room as fans of my other stuff are willing to give me a chance (although I'm sure their patience won't last forever).
