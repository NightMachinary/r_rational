That synopsis is, well, crap. The initial coverage of "I don't like most MMO stories because they're not written by those who actually play MMOs" is far more engaging.

I'd say to edit down that "list of things that gamers are actually familiar with but never show up in stories." and have that be the synopsis.

"MMOs are about more than the fantasy setting. Exploits, unbalanced classes, and gold farmers breaking the intended economy. Nerfs and patches breaking more than they fix annoying the community. Raging players, tiny inventory space, and tedious grinding for that rare epic loot make one wonder if it's worth playing. And atop all that is a company trying to squeeze as much profit as they can get away with while pretending they're just in the business of having fun. "
