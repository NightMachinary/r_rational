I liked the sound of the description, so I tried to give it a fair shot. But a dozen chapters in, nothing of the description had really showed up. Instead the main character mostly spends extensive amounts of time thinking and saying rude and nasty things to/about everyone, including herself.

At this point even if the story premise does start to play a more prominent role, her head is such an unpleasant place that I don't want to be in it any more. Sorry =/.
