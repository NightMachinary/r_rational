I believe Wildbow rolled dice in Worm, at one point, and had a backup protagonist in mind in case Taylor died. It's the only example I can think of, though.

I'd like to see more authors doing that kind of thing, and I support the idea that if you're going to have a failure rate for protagonist skills, you should roll for it.
