So I've gotten about a dozen chapters in, some feedback.

Your premise interests me, I can dig the idea of a VRMMORPG story that deals with some of the more 'realistic' side of MMORPG reality.

However I think you have got to, got to, got to land some sort of "hook" within your first dozen pages or so. Something that grabs the reader and gives them a reason to keep reading your story. Usually something that engages with the theme of your story. Often I've seen it done in this genre either with a 'flash forward' to the character at a later state in development, or a perspective shift to a different character. This way you can give the reader some idea where you are heading, something to look forward to, while still doing the 'slow build' of your main character.

So I don't really feel you've done that with this. Of the first dozen chapters, only one or two really deal with the setting material. The chapter with the dragon and the tutorial is interesting. And its the first chapter to play up on the premise you laid out in the synopsis. I want to emphasis I found that chapter really enjoyable. But it comes pretty far in, at which point I was already considering putting the book down. And from there we dive back into the real world stuff which I was not finding terribly engaging.

Sadly it is surrounded by all this real world interlude. Now to a degree this would be acceptable, after all the 'real world' is also part of the "MMO world" and could conceivably be in scope. But the problem here is the amount of it. We are basically 10:1 real world drama to VR world drama. It feels like a bit of a bait and switch. Its kind of about managing expectations here.

And lastly the elephant in the room. Britta. She's a bit of a, ahem 'B' isn't she? I mean I suppose that's to be expected in a story called 'Bitter.' She's not a very attractive character's head to run around inside of. She doesn't really build a lot of empathy for me. Nor does the story at this point really show a lot of arc for character growth (yet).

So I guess you might ask yourself, "Why would the reader want to read this book?" Your synopsis tells me I would want to read this book if I was interested in seeing a "realistic" depiction of a VRMMORPG game. But the story itself tells me I should read it if I want to read the story about Britta the bitter 16 year old girl who sometimes plays a VRMMORPG.

And I'm sure that story appeals to someone. But I don't think its me.

But hey, you don't have to write for me. Good luck!
