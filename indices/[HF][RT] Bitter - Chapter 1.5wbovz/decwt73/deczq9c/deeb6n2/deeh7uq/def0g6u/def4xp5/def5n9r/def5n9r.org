kk. Then menu you showed just made me think that everything was going to be way over simplified. You can log out in combat, Honourable Subaru. This makes me laugh a little for a couple reasons, but for not I will just assume that she isnt looking in the right place to log out. it directly says she cant, but that could be poor menu work or something. The eye thing will be explained later Thank god. I cant imagine the lack of questions the MC had when that happened I wouldnt step into a pod like that until I had a good look at what was going to happen to me inside. and your chapters are fine, I just read fast and hate stopping in the middle of the story, there really isnt any way to keep me happy on that kind of thing.

and your characters feel like real characters. But colin kind feels like if you took gregory house and arthur dent, combined them, and kept all the worst qualities, and then took away their happiness. (worst qualities from a personal perspective, not in a writing or quality way)

Rereading she asked about a force exit, there we go.
