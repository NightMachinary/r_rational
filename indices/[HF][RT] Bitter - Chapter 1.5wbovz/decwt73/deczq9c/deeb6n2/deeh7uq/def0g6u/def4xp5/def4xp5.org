The menu is supposed to open up into other screens when you press on it but I didn't want to over-complicate things. Tbh I still haven't settled on a style for that part of it. Not sure how much detail to include.

As for the fewer words/more frequently concept, I haven't really go that right yet either. It should have a cliffhanger every time, but not in a way that's annoying. Really, I want to create something like Tomo-chan na onannoko or Mousou Telepathy (mangas). Short but daily that serve some purpose storywise that feels satisfying. Not sure how to do that in story form though.

1. You can log out in combat, Honourable Subaru.
2. The eye thing will be explained later. But the pace of the story means that could be months from now.
3. No, although I do have an idea for a scene where people discuss 'what if' that scenario since they've all seen SAO.
4. Get kicked out.

Generally speaking, I don't like OP MC types that are Mary Sue right up to the neck. It's a lot easier to make them popular, but too juvenile wish-fulfilment for my tastes. I perhaps go too much the other way.
