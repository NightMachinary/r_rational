You were complaining about a lot more than just my pacing. But even so, if I state up front it will be slow paced, and then you complain about pacing... it's a bit like complaining the local cheese shop doesn't sell ladders.

I do get that you didn't enjoy it, but that isn't enough for me to change it. Nor does it necessarily mean that if I did change it you would enjoy it more.
