This is some very harsh commentary, possibly too harsh to be useful to you. I don't want to make you feel bad. It will, but that's not my goal.

I read the first two chapters, and was bored to death.

It's not that it's slice of life, it's that it's cliché and unpleasant slice of life.

Like here is all the info the first chapter gives: The MC is a teenage girl. She is badly depressed. She thinks her parents don't love each other, and that that is normal for the modern day. This is in the ?future? but feels like the 90s? Her dad got laid off, but given a vrpod. He seems to think this will make money for the family. The mother seems to be the one that actually cares about money. The MC kind of hates them and uses home work to avoid them. She doesn't actually have homework to do, but does it anyway.

Now that last bit actually is pretty "Whoa", but also strains my suspension of disbelief. Why isn't she reading a book, or fmylife.com? Does she like actually care about school, I mean she does say that it keeps her parents off her back. So maybe it's a reasonable thing for her to do at that point.

But that's besides the real problem. The real problem is that she is boring. There's no conflict. The only character traits she seems to have are depressed and conflict adverse.

Being in her head is unpleasant, and uninteresting. Mostly it's just too long.

And then next chapter we learn she is unpopular in school. Surprise.

The good ideas here are buried under too much cliché and filler. I think that if cut down to a fifth or so the currant length, the scenes might work later in the book. Or cut down to a tenth or so, as introduction. You do manage to convey just how misriable she is. Her life is really viscerally boring.

But she doesn't have to be boring. She could be unique and interesting to the reader, while still being misriable.

Or you could skip this entire set up for now, and wait to show the boredom until the reader has connected with her later more interesting self, and the contrast will make the misery captivating, instead of off-putting.

Sorry about the harshness, I really think these could go places, and want you to keep writing.
