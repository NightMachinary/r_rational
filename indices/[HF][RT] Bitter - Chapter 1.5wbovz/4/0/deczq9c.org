If you were bored to death then clearly this isn't the story for you. Slice of life stories don't appeal to everyone, especially if the life in question isn't of interest to you. Finding out in the first couple of chapters is a good thing, I'd say. However, suggesting the story has potential if only I changed everything misses the point. The person who has to find Britta interesting at this point is me, otherwise I couldn't write it.

Writing online for free is different to trying to write a bestseller. I don't write to please an audience, I write to please myself. People who have similar tastes to mine will be drawn to it over time, the ones who hate it will stop reading (after leaving a long comment announcing their departure, for some reason) and find something else.

Which isn't to say I'm dismissive of criticism or think it's all perfect---it certainly isn't---but there's a difference between making it do what I want better, and changing it to something else entirely.

A girl who overhears boys making fun of her looks on a bus is a small, low key scene that might not appeal to people. Meh. Cliche. I can see that. That she then goes into a VR game where she could choose to have her character look as beautiful as she wants, but instead chooses the ugliest possible character because fuck everyone makes me like her. And that's the key to writing a long term story, me liking her. I want to see where she is a year from now. One chapter a day. Quite the challenge I'm setting myself.

Some of those chapters will be terrible, no doubt. Some will make readers rage quit (after the obligatory announcement, of course). But maybe I'll produce something worth reading. And maybe I won't.
