Honestly "So I guess you might ask yourself, "Why would the reader want to read this book?" Your synopsis tells me I would want to read this book if I was interested in seeing a "realistic" depiction of a VRMMORPG game. But the story itself tells me I should read it if I want to read the story about Britta the bitter 16 year old girl who sometimes plays a VRMMORPG." says what I would better. Look you don't have to change your story, and you don't have to change your synopsis, but if you care at all about finding people who will read your work, you need to change one or the other.
