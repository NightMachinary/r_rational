No, I don't think I need to change either. You seem to be assuming people aren't reading it or everyone will react the same way as you. It's doing fine. I know it has a slow pace and an awkward MC. As a writer I enjoy the challenge of both. I have other stories people can read if they don't like this one. Many people had issues with them when they started, they demanded (and I mean really demanded) I change this or that. I have no idea why people feel their opinions give them the right to instruct others in what to do.

Just to be clear, I understand your concerns about the story but I don't agree. Doesn't mean I'm right, but since I'm the writer, turns out only my opinion counts. Read the /actual/ synopsis part of the OP. I think that sums up the story pretty well. The other stuff is me talking about my reasons for writing it. If someone feels cheated because I didn't get to that stuff quick enough for them, that's a pacing issue not a matter of having to redefine anything. It's very short chapters released daily over a very long time, not a novel. It will take time getting to places. If you don't like the format, don't read it.

Bear in mind, you're just reacting to a story you happened to stumbled across and offering your views. As the writer, I'm receiving hundreds of varying opinions on the things I write. A lot of them saying the opposite of each other. The negative ones who just can't let it go are quite common and follow a distinct pattern. 'Hey bro, just wanted to give you some feedback...' into slightly more passive aggressive 'If you want people to read this you have to...' and then into the full bore aggressive 'This could have been something really great but you dropped the ball, man, but, hey, it's your story, do what you want...'

What would have been helpful is if someone had spotted I'd put the wrong genre tags in the post (which i just edited). Instead of VRMMO it said Magic Academy which is my other new serial. Now that's a change I would have totally understood people demanding.
