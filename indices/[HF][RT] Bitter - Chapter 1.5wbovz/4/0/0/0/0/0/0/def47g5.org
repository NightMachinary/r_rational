I honestly didn't notice anything about slow pacing. Just a big list of things VRMMOG stories leave out, and then two chapters that aren't about VRMMOGs.

And the synopsis doesn't tell me which half you are interested in either.

I mean even after reading two chapters, I still assumed that the VR game was what the story was about. Because you posted it here and talked a lot about VR stories, and nothing about wanting to write a story about a girl with a horrible life.

Like I did not see my advice as telling you to change everything, but just to do an editing pass and think about the difference between what you need to write and what the reader needs to see.

But if the parts I was telling you to get rid of really are the core of the story...change your advertising for it please.
