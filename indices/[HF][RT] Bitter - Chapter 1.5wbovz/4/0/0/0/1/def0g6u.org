Since several people here have been giving you shit I wanna give my 2 cents.

Your stories are quite interesting to me. On the one hand I want to complain about it, but I am up to date as of not on how to avoid and bitter. Clearly I keep reading for a reason.

I dislike the characters. Just, all of them. I kinda like Jenny and Maurice. That is actually a point in favor in some ways, as it is hard to write characters that make people feel strongly about in any way. I wouldnt want to now these people, I wouldnt want to be these people. Maybe that is the point?

Your writing style is good, even if the "shorter chapters more frequently" thing annoys me, just means that I wnt read bitter again for a few weeks. Maybe Ill check tomorrow due to the cliffhanger. The world is interesting and I like how the main characters (looking at Colin and Co more here) succeed not by being the best, not by author fiat, not by clever plan. But by choosing low risk maneuvers and hoping for the best. Makes them seem much more real. Colin was smart enough to figure out the troll call. He wasn't smart enough to solve the previous fights or next fights. Make me think of Erfworld "we try things, sometimes they even work"

Now on to actual critique that might help you: The menu is quite small for wanting to do everything it does. Honestly I think it would make me feel better if it had an "advanced" option having it be that size but still listing individual spells and trying to fit all the stats doesnt make much sense from a game design perspective. Maybe this is meant to be a comment on how difficult game menus can be for newbs. who knows. "cannot log out mid fight bothers me"

1. It wouldnt be legal, health concerns and all.

2. There isnt any way to manually disconnect? The pain in the eye thing has been REALLY bothering me. Please have someone talk about it again or just tell me what is going on with that.

3. It worries me in the "we are going to get trapped in VR and now you dance for me" way that Sword art does.

4. what if it loses power?

TL;DR I hate your characters and enjoy your writing style and worlds. Keep it up. Or don't or whatever if that is what you want. But if it is still updating I'll probably still be reading it.
