I don't particularly approach my work with a rationalist mind set, but my other story got some attention here (and that was more realist than rational) so I thought this one might be of interest too.

Having said that, I would be interested to know what people think of it from a rationalist perspective, although it's early days and I'm not sure enough has happened to be able to get a proper view of the story (or maybe there has).
