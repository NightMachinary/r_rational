I can think of very few stories that base all random chance on dice rolls. If a character in another book gets into a fight or has to shoot something, their success or failure is generally based on narrative needs. You shouldn't be able to reasonably predict whole fights. you should be able to say X is a good option, if that works then Y if not I guess I would have to try Z.
