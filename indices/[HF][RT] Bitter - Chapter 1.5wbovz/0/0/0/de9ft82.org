  I don't particularly approach my work with a rationalist mind set, but my other story got some attention here (and that was more realist than rational) so I thought this one might be of interest too.

Slight clarification to be made: "rational" and "rationalist" are slightly different, in that "rationalist" fiction is rational fiction intended to teach readers to act rationally. (You probably already knew this, I'm just making sure.)

As of the first real fight scene (mugger), I'm kind of iffy on whether the story qualifies for [RT] though. You did explain what her spells did beforehand, but even though spells are theoretically balanced by "failure rate" I get the gut feeling that they'll only fail when it's narratively convenient, as opposed to something like rolling dice to see whether they work, then having to adapt your writing on the fly. Thus, the reader can't reasonably predict what your character's available options are, because they're dependent on a hidden variable determined by author fiat.

That being said, while I don't think this is /rational/, as the focus seems to be somewhat social-sci-fi-y then it's probably a rational-adjacent, and therefore deserves to be on this subreddit. Anyways, it looks like I'll be following it, so thanks for posting!
