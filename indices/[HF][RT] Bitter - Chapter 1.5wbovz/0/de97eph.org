I've mentioned this before, but I don't think most gamer stories count as "rational." In theory, they're /perfectly/ rational-- RPGs tend to be fairly perfect-information, and from an in-universe perspective the avenues available to a character could be predicted from just looking at their skill tree. But out-of-universe, authors very rarely outline the in-fiction game mechanics to such a degree so that the reader can't meaningfully predict how the skills the characters use will work, or what new skills the character will get.

So before I even start getting into reading this story, I'm going to lay out the criterion I'll use to judge whether this story fits in this subreddit.

Either

a.) the rules of the game are clearly deliniated well enough that a copy could be fairly well recreated in real life

or, in what I call the "Log Horizon" approach,

b.) The main literary conflict is actually some meta-conflict about the game, and resolved through some non-game action, such as through diplomacy or trickery.

Expect me back in a few +minutes+ hours after I've made my judgement.

Obviously I don't have any actual power over you or your writing, but hopefully my feedback should be interesting and useful.
