I really dislike codes and cyphers in a story being given as a challenge to the reader. Sure, let me go and decipher that, so I can get a (probably) minute hint towards the overarching plot.

Yeah, HPMOR wasn't perfect, far from it, but the riddles (no pun intended) there were at least fun to try and solve. Cyphers just need enough computational power to brute force.

Beyond that, I liked the pace, and the main character, way better than the first. I'm looking forward to the next one
