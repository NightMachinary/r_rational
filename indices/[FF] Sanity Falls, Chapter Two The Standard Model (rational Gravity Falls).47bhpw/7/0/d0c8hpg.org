Absolutely watch Gravity Falls, though the puzzles are more of a background element there, which were solved (consistently very quickly) by the community over the course of its four year run.

The puzzles are more intended as a community effort here, too. If you figure something out, or have a thought towards the solution, absolutely post it here, though spoiler tags would probably be good. I'm not going for a sink-or-swim ethos where everyone has to figure it out on their own.
