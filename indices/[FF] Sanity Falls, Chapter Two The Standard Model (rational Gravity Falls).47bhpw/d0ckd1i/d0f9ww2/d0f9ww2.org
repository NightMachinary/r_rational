  Maybe it's time to look at the clue more in-depth? I'm assuming it refers to Bill Cipher

I dunno. I haven't watched the show, but the depictions I see in a Google image search all seem equilateral, not right isosceles. Also, can we expect that Dipper etc. are going to solve the cipher themselves soon within the story? If so, the solution must depend only on knowledge we can expect them to possess.
