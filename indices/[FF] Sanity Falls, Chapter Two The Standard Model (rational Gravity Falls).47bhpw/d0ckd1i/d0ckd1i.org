*Puzzle-solving General*

On the second puzzle: From the J, T, L'p, /and/ e, and the dread mm, this is not a (simple) substitution cipher. Too much to ask for on the first go? Ah, but that /was/ the first one, rot13 is substitution no matter how mundane. Unless the fourteen and seventeen-letter words are a hint to ignore spacing...

[[http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/][A useful resource.]] My first step is to look at Vigenere 3 through 8, starting with all As as there's no better placeholder. If the spaces are skips in the keytext application, hoboy, but complexity. Anyway, I'm starting with the two one-letter words 'a' and 'I', ignoring 'O,' complexity. Fortunately, capitalization is left intact, so I'm assuming 'T', 'J', and 'L' are 'I' and that the two 'e's are 'a'. If the mods and char positions work out (I'll expand the scope of the keytext if needed), I'll look at the end of those contractions next.

I think it's not Vigenere (with my assumption of meaningful whitespace, punctuation, and capitals). I've worked up to 15 keychars, and the constraints fall into contradiction. Maybe it's time to look at the clue more in-depth? I'm assuming it refers to Bill Cipher, but it could be a hint as to the type of cipher. Pythagorean triples, triangular numbers? It shouldn't be elliptical curve crypto since that's kind of actually secure. Going to look at some of the other options on that page.

It's not obviously anything else on the page. I'm out of ideas for tonight. Random note, we see Grunkle Stan's rules 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 in this chapter (Pythagorean triples might be related but aren't isosceles). The last ciphertext has a very curious structure; the 4-4-5-4-1-4 word could either be a cute hyphenated phrase or a verification key for the puzzle. This twinges my intuition to say the first two words are 'If you', possibly 'If you post the' but I doubt 'post' too much. Just going to say, judging by the frequency analysis, the kappa-plaintext points to neither of the last two ciphertexts being substitution.
