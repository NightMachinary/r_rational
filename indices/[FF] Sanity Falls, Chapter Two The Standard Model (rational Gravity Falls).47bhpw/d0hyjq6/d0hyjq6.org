Confused/excited Dipper is a major improvement over know-it-all jerkass Dipper, so that's good to see.

The other characters too... reading in their voices from the show didn't create any jarring moments where it sounded wrong - well done on that front.

I suspect I'm going to be of no use when it comes to solving puzzles/ciphers but I guess that at least the important ones will see an in-universe resolution, and any that don't will probably have someone figure them out here in the comments eventually.
