/Waits eagerly for third chapter, because clearly this must be on a weekly update schedule, because clearly one sample forms an incontrovertible trend, and because clearly the determined chapter length means this is all pre-written instead of being estimated./

So. I watched the show, and it was awesome. Bill was actually somewhat horrifying (Discord in MLP should have been like Bill except maybe for scarring the target audience, Bill should have been a next step up). Deer teeth. And Neil deGrasse Tyson as a superintelligent pig was glorious. I love all the characters so very very much, they're all my babies.

I reread the first chapter (writing this before I reread the second), and WOW SO MANY REFERENCES. [[#s][]]

Rereading the first chapter, I'm also not sure if these references Dipper's making to Mabel's comparable intelligence were simply missed on my part by an uncharitable reading, or if you retconned those in. Either way, it's a definite improvement on what I read before. Mystery Twins! [[#s][]]
