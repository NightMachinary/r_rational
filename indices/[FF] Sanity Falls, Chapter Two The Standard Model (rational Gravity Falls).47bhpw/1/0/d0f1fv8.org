Applying an additional cipher is a fairly inconvenient way of spoilerizing discussion of cipher-solving. Furthermore, why spoilerize this comment at all? You haven't even said anything other than, "Here's a couple of approaches that didn't work." And the author has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47pdip/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d0euiyc][already expressed regret]] that the readership isn't caring much about the ciphers; having the only discussion of them occur not in plaintext probably doesn't help.
