The last point is why I have a disjunction between it referring to Bill Cipher and it providing a hint for the code. The former is narratively relevant, the latter is ludically relevant with a dearth of obvious alternatives.

The reference to specific shape makes me feel safe in assuming the latter for now. But I still have no clue how it applies. Pythagorean triples are the only remotely code-relevant things I can think of, and those are all non-isosceles.

Vigenere is still a possibility. I only looked at keys up to 15 characters in length. The first actual cipher shouldn't be too hard, even given the first message (unless this is intended to be unsolvable for a while), and Vigenere does seem like a next step. For longer keys, the only plausible means of remaining solvable is by referring to other referenced texts. That's how Significant Digits did it.

I looked at "Bill Cipher" and "HOOPS" for short keytexts, despite their narrative implausibility. For longer keytexts, Grunkle Stan's rules could certainly apply, but again, they're narratively implausible. I'm going to try "TRUST NO ONE IN GRAVITY FALLS," which is specifically noted to be in all caps and near the beginning, whereas the cipher is on the first page.

Nothing. Rot13 doesn't change it either. This is journal 3, Half Life 3 has been in production for 300 years, and right isosceles triangles have 3 sides. Let's try Grunkle Stan's third rule.

Nothing. Not Rot13ed, either. I'm out of ideas again.
