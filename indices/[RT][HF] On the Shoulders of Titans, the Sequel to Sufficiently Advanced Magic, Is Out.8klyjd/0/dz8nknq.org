Saw someone mention my book here earlier and I remembered that some people in the subreddit might be interested.

For those of you who aren't already familiar, [[https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB/][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]] is a novel with a mix between dungeon crawling and time spent learning magic at an academy.

It's set in a world that's heavily inspired by Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy and the Tales series, but where game mechanics are treated like normal elements of the world. For example, there are justifications for respawning monsters, dungeons with rooms that constantly changing, character classes, levels, etc.

There's a heavy emphasis on learning the rules of how magic works. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you might like these books.
