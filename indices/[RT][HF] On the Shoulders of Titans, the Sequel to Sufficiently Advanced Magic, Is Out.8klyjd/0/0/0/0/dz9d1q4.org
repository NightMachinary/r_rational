The first i found it to be ok. In spite a couple of flaws. Biggest i think it to be too infodumpy and with an ending cut 50 pages too soon to be truly satisfing.

This one had all the good bits with much smaller info dumps. Less teenage drama. A few new characters that are really engaging and cute (i love researcher) and an ending that is much better
