How is it better? I read the first and generally found it to be meh. Is it worth trying the 2nd?

Edit: Just to be clear, I don't think this was a bad book and I don't mean any criticism about the work to the author. it was quite well written and it did keep me reading through to the end, it just wasn't quite for me, I think.
