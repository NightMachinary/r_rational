First, I imagine the political system would look very feudal. There would be a head champion (king) who rules the empire, with the rest of the champions acting as lords who check the kings power (constitutional monarchy). A government composed of regular people would have no way to make champions follow them. Arguments for morality and responsibility only go so far. With great power comes great responsibility, however. This ruling class would go to war frequently, and fighting and winning against demons would be the main source of prestige.

Militarily, I imagine that the Champions would focus on mobility. There are very few of them and a large area to cover. To compensate, the champions would travel around in groups launching decisive strikes and then redeploying elsewhere. Spreading the champions too thin drastically increases the risk that they will get caught and killed. By fighting in groups, they will be able to cover each other and retreat if necessary.

Finally, the empire would focus a lot of effort into producing more champions. The way someone becomes a champion is not specified, but however it occurs it would be encouraged. If being a champion is genetic, we would see extensive obligations from the family of champions. Arranged marriages designed to produce champion heirs would be common. If being a champion is decided randomly at birth, we would see a massive empire wide fertility program. More babies would increase the chances of getting a new champion. If champions are made through learning and skill, we would see massive investments in public education, and the formation of battle schools (like Ender's Game).
