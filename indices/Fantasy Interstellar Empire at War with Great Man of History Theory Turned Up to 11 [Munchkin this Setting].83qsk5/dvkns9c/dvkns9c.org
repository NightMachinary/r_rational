The thing about people with that staggering level of personal power is that they pretty much do what they want. If the empire still exists, it means that a fine-tuned propaganda machine is making sure that most Champions are holding the front lines... But if a few decide they'd much rather seize political power, nobody's going to be able to stop them. As a result, you've probably got a Champion aristocracy that desperately pushes the message of how it's incredibly noble and glorious and inspiring to go fight the Demon menace, especially Champions, not them, no, don't you see how it's just as important that they remain back here, organizing the war effort? And they probably believe it, too, even if a regular Joe could do just as well with training.
