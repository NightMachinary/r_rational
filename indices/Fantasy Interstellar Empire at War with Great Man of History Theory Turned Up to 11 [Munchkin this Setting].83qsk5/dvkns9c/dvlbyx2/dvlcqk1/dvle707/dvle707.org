Nothing's ever certain in war - it's often not clear who's actually winning. I think your scenario is depressingly realistic, but on the other hand the pool of Champions is sufficiently small that it's not infeasible none of them are that selfish. Jerk-ness of that level is sufficiently uncommon a trait IRL in a developed polity (which a space-faring civilisation spanning a thousand worlds probably is, though I suppose magic might throw that out of whack) that if you got 26 people in a room, there's not terrible odds that they're all actually pretty reasonable.

Of course, assholes do exist and tend to stand out more, so there's certainly no guarantee. Maybe power would be sufficiently corrupting that one or more reasonable people would be selfish jerks in that position anyway? Does the corrupting influence of power even really apply if you don't have to struggle to maintain it through politics? Even kings gifted power by right of birth have to manage their court - would someone whose power couldn't be taken away from them behave the same way as examples from human history, who have always had to maintain their positions one way or another?
