Not necessarily. There are thousands of planets to govern after all, if a large enough bureaucracy exists it could prevent the Champions from actually accomplishing anything. They can only be in one place at once and need people to delegate to after all. I would imagine that the major political positions would be in the hands of Champions, not necessarily because they want them but because they would have so much power given to them that it would just be a formality to go a step further. But their ability to actually make changes to the empire would be limited by how much paperwork they have to go through. Kind of like how the US is set up: there are so many things you have to do to make a major change one person can't screw up everything (not that certain people aren't making a good effort at it). And if they're too busy fighting they won't have time to do anything with their titles anyway.
