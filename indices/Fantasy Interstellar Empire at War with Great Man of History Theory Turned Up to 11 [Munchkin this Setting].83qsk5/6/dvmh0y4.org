About squeezing your chances... I would try to increase the total amount of Champions.

I guess the easy option of cloning wouldn't work, but I would create a system to track the development of every person in the empire, and try to learn which factors cause more Champions to appear. Experiment with those factors to prove the hypotesis, and implement it on a large scale when proven.
