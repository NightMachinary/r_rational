The thought I had that made me come see what you guys made of this was the idea of Orbital Drop Shock Healers/Medics being deployed en masse into a battlefield to attempt to stabilise/extract a wounded Champion, as their lives are worth so much less than a single top-tier fighter. Or those same healers being deployed into city where a wounded Champion is, and just going straight through buildings and infrastructure on the basis that the tiny chance those seconds saved matter is more valuable than the cost of repairing those buildings.

The absurdity of a setting where this was considered not only possible but obviously a good idea appealed to me, and inspired me to post since you could probably come up with some other fairly wacky concepts based around such extreme scales of value (that's probably not the right description, but I'm struggling to come up with a better one.)
