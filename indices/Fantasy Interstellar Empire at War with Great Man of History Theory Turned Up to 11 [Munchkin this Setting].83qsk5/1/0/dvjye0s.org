Exactly how many champions are we talking about here? Hundreds? Thousands? Less than 50?

  In the latter half of the 25th century, humanity finds itself locked in total war against alien invaders. The Cephalopods attacked without warning and for no discernible reason. Their weapons have a significant technological edge over humans, and the science with which they build their wormhole generators to spread into human space is inconceivable to humanity's most brilliant minds and AIs. The only hope for turning the battle in humanity's favor lies within its aloof allies: the enigmatic Incubators, and the direct consequences of their meddling into human affairs: nigh-invulnerable augmented superhumans able to bend the rules of causality itself. They are known as... magical girls.
