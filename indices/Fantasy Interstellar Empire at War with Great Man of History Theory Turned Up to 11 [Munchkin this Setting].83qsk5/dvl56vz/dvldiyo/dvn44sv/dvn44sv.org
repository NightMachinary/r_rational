So...it's less grimdark 40k but Primarchs occur naturally is what I'm getting. The goal of the military would mostly to fight a conventional war (conventional for space combat anyway). There are so few champions that only a small amount of the military would be based around them, trying to get them to where they are needed as quickly as possible. Depending on how well it works, a viable strategy could be to launch a RKKV at a planet whenever an enemy champion shows up on it, in which case no one brings out their champions. Or, if the enemy seems to have an endless supply, then the strategy would be to have teams of champions gank an enemy one whenever it shows up. The problem is there are so few champions and so many planets that most theaters wouldn't ever see one. They would just move between the largest battles basically putting out fires, most military strategy wouldn't change.

An interesting question is what did the empire look like before the enemy showed up? Did champions exist, in which case they're probably in charge. Otherwise, they're probably too busy fighting to be in charge. Most people are actually pretty decent and would fight against guaranteed extinction if they got superpowers. The ones who wouldn't would be policed by the others, and like I said above they probably wouldn't be able to make any major changes through the bureaucracy that would build up in an interstellar empire.
