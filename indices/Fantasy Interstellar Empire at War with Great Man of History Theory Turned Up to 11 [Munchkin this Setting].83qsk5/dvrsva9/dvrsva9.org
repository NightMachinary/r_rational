Any spacefaring yet planet-focused society is fundamentally anachronistic. "A thousand worlds" sounds like a lot until you realize that they're using about 0.0003% of their available resources, and that's only if you very charitably count the interior of the used planets, even though it's mostly used for nothing but bending space to make down.

The obvious play is to rkv all champions in support of the demons from hell in their anti-imperialist struggle.
