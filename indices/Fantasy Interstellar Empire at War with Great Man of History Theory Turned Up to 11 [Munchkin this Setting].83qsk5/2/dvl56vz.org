Need more detail to this Empire. What method of communication and FTL does it use? How long has it existed? Is the Emperor/Empress also a Champion? How is leadership determined... is it by bloodline, whoever can seize power, whoever the mightiest Champion is? Is the leader actually in control or just a figurehead?

Knowing these details helps set up a baseline by which you can develop their enemies. For instance, if your Empire has some Star Trek/Star Wars style of FTL (where ships have a vastly reduced travel time that can go almost anywhere if they spend time plotting a course), and their 'existential enemies' have another kind (say, rolling with the "Demon" thing, they don't really use FTL so much as open gateways through which their troops move), you can set up the threat that way and give each side different advantages and disadvantages.

How do the Champions "level up" and what is the reasoning behind such limited numbers? Does the power come from an outside source that grants it? Is it based on some simple, yet horrific method--ie: each person you kill grants you a tiny piece of their power, thus encouraging the tabletop murderhobo mentality to slaughter as many things as possible to raise in levels? Is it a Highlander thing where each time a Champion kills another they gain their power, and at some point that power was once spread out over a larger population but is slowly coalescing into one great uber-being?

  What would the structure of such an Empire look like?
#+end_quote

That's why we need details, as above.

#+begin_quote
  Would the Champions be ruling the Empire through an inability to meaningfully oppose them, or would their being absolutely vital to the war effort and inability to leave the front lines prevent this?
#+end_quote

Again, as above. Is a Champion the Emperor/Empress? Or is there some system of controlling them, whether concrete (some magic or tech item or power that enforces obedience) or abstract (a warrior code like /bushido/ that ensures they have no desire or time to bother with ruling).

#+begin_quote
  What would an interstellar army/navy based around supporting a few key individuals look like?
#+end_quote

This one's easy. Basically the "typical" sci-fi nation's interstellar navy. The Empire, assuming it uses ships with FTL, will still need non-military ships like Freighters, Tankers, and Transports to haul all its men and material around, trade allowing worlds to flourish where they normally lack certain materials needed for survival (mining world needs food, industry world needs resources, farming world needs goods--miniature "triangular trade"). Because of this, there will need to be many military and police vessels. The influence of the Champions depends on how well they function in space. Can they grant powers or be a power source for their ships? Can one high-level fighter leap from vessel to vessel across kilometers of void whilst cutting half-mile long starships in twain with a slice of his massive space-katana? Or are they more like Super-Marines whose job is to inject themselves into enemy flagships and neutralize them.

Chances are, they'd have specific ships made just for them, with the vessel itself conforming to their style. Mage Ships would likely be large, complicated things with massive "thaumic sails" that gather standing magical energy like a solar sail but direct it toward the center Sanctum of the craft for the Mage to cast massively oversized spells from all the focused mana. A high-level fighter's "ship" would be either some massively overarmored vessel that can soak up tons of damage so he can deploy into the middle of the enemy fleet and start breaking things--or just have it drop from orbit (perhaps with some adamantium-style 'base plate') and crush an enemy army whilst producing an "instant fortress" on the enemy's world... or it could be more of a giant mecha rather than a 'ship' allowing him to use his skills on a much grander scale.

  How would they prioritise and plan a war where a fully inhabited planet is worth less than a single Champion, unless one of those people also happens to be a nascent Champion themselves?
#+end_quote

Define "fully inhabited". How is that measured? Is it enough for its main industry to reach a certain level? X millions or billions of people dependent on size?

#+begin_quote
  And most importantly, what innovations would you implement to try and squeeze out those extra few fractions of a percent of probability of winning the war and saving the empire/human race?
#+end_quote

The most obvious would be determining the basis of the Enemy's own "Champion" system, if it exists, or a Pacific Rim-style possibility of assembling a team of powerful Champions to raid the Enemy's own home territory and stop them at the source.
