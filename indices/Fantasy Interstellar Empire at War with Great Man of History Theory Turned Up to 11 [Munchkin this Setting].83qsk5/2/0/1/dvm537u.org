  I was imagining the planets as being roughly comparable to Earth's population, but I suppose it might be more reasonable/realistic to say population varies by planet size and tech level.
#+end_quote

Earth *now* or X centuries ago? Or in the future? Having answered that, how many of these Earth-level worlds are in the Empire? Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands?

  a Champion would be someone who possessed an extraordinarily large/pure/positive-adjective source of internal power, randomly occurring throughout the galaxy incredibly rarely
#+end_quote

In that case, you should decide--fairly early on--what the actual /source/ of them is. Take Worm, for instance. Wildbow already had the whole "Passenger"/Worm thing down from the very beginning, though the audience didn't discover enough details until much later. Basically, /why/ are these powers random? Or are they really? Does it being random further your story? Or is it better if there's a reason? You could spoof on the whole "/Hero of light and good/ rises up to challenge the /Dark Lord/" standard fantasy trope, and turn it on its ear. IE: Each world above a certain population will have a Light and Dark Champion, their power determined on some characteristic--how many people they can sway or simply the population of their homeworld. Or perhaps they will have only one, whichever "won" and broke the cycle on their world. In any event, the Empire accepts all kinds, so long as they obey its rules and edicts. This gives incentives for some of the Champions to care about certain people (their own) as well as the greater existential threat, but otherwise have great conflict with each other.

  The foe is ill-defined,
#+end_quote

That's fine from the "perceptions of the audience" standpoint, but you as the writer better well define at least the "skeleton" of who/what they are, what they do, and why they do it. It doesn't have to be in much detail, and you can flesh it out as you go, but its very important so that the Enemy has some level of consistency and isn't just randomly changing methods and motives at the drop of a hat.

  A ship powered by a mage is also an interesting concept though
#+end_quote

Well, *my* initial version was a Mage powered by a ship. But you can do it this way, too. In my previous reply, I posited the existence of ships that had massive "mana collecting solar sails" that could funnel all that power to the Mage at the center. Where on a planet he could annihilate hundreds of people with powerful spells, this grants him exponentially more short-term power, allowing his magic to scale up to the level of being a threat to fleets of enemy vessels.

Of course, you could always have them just be themselves, inside tiny bubbles of magic to keep them alive, darting about and unleashing magical wrath on a fleet. If anything, that might be /scarier/ than the above because it would be almost impossible to target them with ship mounted weaponry or even recognize that they are in the fight until its too late.

Or you could roll with all of that.

  Perhaps the Champions are sufficiently individualistic enough that they have different approaches, with some tanking up in massive dreadnoughts and others preferring to fly around and dodge attacks instead?
#+end_quote

Yep, that's what I was suggesting. The heavy fighter types use a style that suits them, the mages, etc. You've got the more archery or rogue-like hero down with the high-speed evasive type that does strategic attacks. Plenty of room for them all!

  The aim of the setting was to examine how such a people would develop under these conditions and pressures - especially the absurd value/power imbalance between Champions and everyone else
#+end_quote

If there's not even one Champion per planet, then the answer to this is "not very different from how it would be if they didn't exist", at least as far as the common civilians are concerned. A Champion would be a rare being to interact with, unless you happen to be at the target of one of their military attacks. Where it would really affect things would be at the level of the Militaries, whose tactics and such would be in a more 'supporting' role... sure, you might have your space marines attacking and boarding enemy ships, your strike craft captains leading daring raids on enemy logistics and such, but all of them would be mere window dressing and cannon fodder to the Champions.
