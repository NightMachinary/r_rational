Entirely reasonable points. I was envisioning the setting as being made up of planets throughout the galaxy being inhabited by humans of varying tech levels (the highest of which being builders of FTL-capable ships) as though sprinkled there in the very distant past and left to their own devices, and the Empire as being by far the largest united polity of those with space travel. I was imagining the planets as being roughly comparable to Earth's population, but I suppose it might be more reasonable/realistic to say population varies by planet size and tech level.

In a setting where everyone is theoretically capable of magic with knowledge and training (though not every planet is necessarily aware of this), a Champion would be someone who possessed an extraordinarily large/pure/positive-adjective source of internal power, randomly occurring throughout the galaxy incredibly rarely. Perhaps it's possible to steal these sources from corpses and replace your own with them - that would make the loss of a Champion to enemy forces doubly catastrophic, assuming they can make use of them.

The Empire is made up of a significantly more planets than there are Champions, and the latter are sufficiently rare than the former that the successful defence/annexing of a planet would not be worth losing a champion over - not even close. The foe is ill-defined, but presents a serious existential threat to an extremely hard-pressed Empire and the galaxy as a whole, such that having Champions /not/ on the front lines would be a serious blow to the chances of winning the war and thus surviving - though I suppose if one wanted to rule enough to risk the difference meaning the collapse of their civilisation and species, no one would be able to stop them.

I was also envisioning fighting as being Nanoha-esque from the few clips I've seen of the show - flying mages shooting giant lasers and other attack/utility spells at one another, capable of personal space flight but probably not personal FTL. (This may not actually be representative of Nanoha combat, I haven't watched more than a few clips.) A ship powered by a mage is also an interesting concept though, and I'm not designing an entire system of magic, so that could totally be possible - though if it's deriving the vast majority of its' power from a single mage, they might be better off not having a ship so as to dodge more effectively? Perhaps the Champions are sufficiently individualistic enough that they have different approaches, with some tanking up in massive dreadnoughts and others preferring to fly around and dodge attacks instead?

The aim of the setting was to examine how such a people would develop under these conditions and pressures - especially the absurd value/power imbalance between Champions and everyone else - so I deliberately didn't design a system of government. I'd be interested in hearing how other people think they'd set themselves up.
