Ooh, this reminds me of something else, actually - the xianxia-derived world of Cradle, by Will Wight. It's a super hierarchical society based on practicing the paths of the sacred arts. Each level is exponentially stronger than the last one, and exponentially more difficult to reach. As an example, one of the plots has a bunch of fantastically powerful forest sects politically maneuvering around each other, trying to squeeze a motherlode of magical resources dry as quickly as they can. Why? Because they're level n at highest, and there are vague rumors that a level n+1 will appear and take everything. The only society is really kept in check because a level n+2 has seized the position of Emperor and wrangles the otherwise impossibly powerful level n+1 leaders of the local branches of clans into fighting against terrible, terrible threats. The only reason the whole thing is even stable is because of benevolence from those at even higher levels stepping in occasionally, and even at the highest of levels, there's a constant battle against chaos that's constantly on the edge of being lost.
