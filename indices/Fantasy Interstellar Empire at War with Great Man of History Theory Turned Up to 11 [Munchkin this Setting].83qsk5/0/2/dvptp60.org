I think one way to stabilise this would be if the Champions had a weakness, or a need, that can be satisfied only by the rest of the Empire. Think of something like Navigators from Dune, that need a constant flow of Spice. There could be a resource whose extraction depends on the Empire, and without that their magic runs out. In that situation they'd be more compelled to cooperate. In peaceful times they'd probably start their own internal feuds over who gets to rule the others, but a common enemy might just be the thing to unite them.
