Additionally, I think that well-intentioned change of policy through force would cause at least some Champions to begin bumbling into politics. Even though the empire is on a war footing there will likely be divisive policies that could see Champions coming to arms if there's a sufficient amount of polarization. Traditional government methods of population control during wartime wouldn't work as well should a Champion decide to go rogue.

Perhaps a King Arthur-esque code of conduct managed internally between the Champions themselves? Otherwise I can't see the empire being able to hold the Champions accountable for their actions.
