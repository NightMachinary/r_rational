Potaito, potahto; evil, enlightened self-interest. An emperor could convince themselves that there needs to be a political Champion focused on maintaining stability within the Empire, someone or a group of someones that can effortlessly crush dissenting forces - and when a Champion inevitably arises that sympathizes with rebel elements within the Empire, then I will defend humantity from itself! But until then... I'm happy to avoid the front lines.
