Very much so... But if it's a close enough thing that one Champion is the difference between destruction and survival, then I think it more likely that things would reach an equilibrium, with the Empire retreating and ceding volume until the remaining Champions were enough to defend what remained, probably with a volitile oscillating border region where Champions and Demons batter back and forth, mostly just trying to avoid losing any further systems.
