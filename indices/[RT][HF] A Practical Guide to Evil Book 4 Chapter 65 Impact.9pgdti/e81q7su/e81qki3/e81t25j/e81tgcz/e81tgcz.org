The existing Oaths should bind it. But Cat is left with the same problem of not being able to get more years of service out of her Drow including the heavy hitters. The one thing that might change that is that it seems like once you hit a certain level of Night you no longer really gain anything from killing Drow of a certain rank. So she may be able to have the corpses flow down the ranks because her Drow won't have decades or centuries to accumulate Night from low rank Drow. Even then she probably won't be able to extract years of service for them.
