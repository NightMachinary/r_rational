I'm concerned by what Secrets Cat's Drow might pick up if they go off and take Night from the Mighty. What if they learn how to break or subvert the oaths they swore? There seem to be a lot of tricks floating around, just judging by what Urulan brought to bear, and we already know that some of them can beat out Cat's Winter powers.
