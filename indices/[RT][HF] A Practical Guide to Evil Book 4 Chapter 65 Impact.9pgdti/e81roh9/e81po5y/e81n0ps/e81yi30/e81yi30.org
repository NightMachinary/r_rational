Possibilities?

- Now that Cat has killed an actual, important sigil holder, one who's probably been a name in the Drow "political" landscape for millennia, the other mighty might be more willing to deal, rather than insist on fighting to the death every time. Doesn't seem entirely likely, but it's possible.
- Cat might have to start slurping up that Night, if the weakest sigil holder in Great Lotow comes this close to creaming her.
- Cat might find a way to convert Night into Winter. On one hand, that could potentially make her Drow army more effective and strengthen their ties to her. On the other hand, that feels like a "sinking deeply into power" move, and those never go well.
- Another "sinking deeply into power" move, I can see Cat eventually discovering Night is just a ripped fae trick, and she can do it, too.
- When Cat kills Sve Noc, she takes the mantle, or employs her soul Akua-style.
