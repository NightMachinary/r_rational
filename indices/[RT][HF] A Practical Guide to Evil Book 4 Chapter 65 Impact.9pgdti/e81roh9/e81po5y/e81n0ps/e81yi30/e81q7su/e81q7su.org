I'm thinking that since Urulan was killed by her, after a rough fight, she can take the Night for herself. The earlier part where she didn't take the night from the corpses was because there was a "LITERALLY FREE POWER" sign hanging on it which would mean that she would be eventually brought down if she took it.

Here though, she's earned this night. And she will probably get a lot stronger from all the night collection to come.
