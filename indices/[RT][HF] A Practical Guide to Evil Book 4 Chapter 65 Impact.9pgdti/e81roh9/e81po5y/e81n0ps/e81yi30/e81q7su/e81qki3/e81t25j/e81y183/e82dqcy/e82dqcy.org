I think the premis here is that the risk presented was not so much the nature of night itself as the narrative causality risk that taking obvious schmuck-bait posed to somone with a fae mantle. This would be claiming spoils of war not grabbing the mystical equivalent of Wile-E-Cyote grabbing the "free pie".

Though I suspect theres a similar reason why harvisting night now would be a bad move. Cat already promised to auction her kills, deciding not to do so now that a better than expected prize is promised to go to auction would be flirting with oath-breaking.
