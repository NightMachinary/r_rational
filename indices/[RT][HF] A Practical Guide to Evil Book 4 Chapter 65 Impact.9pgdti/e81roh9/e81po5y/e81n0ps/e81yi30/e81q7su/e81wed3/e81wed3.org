I am curious why the Dead King doesn't consider the Queen of Night to be on his level.

He made a big deal about how the Bard, himself and Cat are in this exclusive club. Now we see Night grants possible agelessness and pretty much every power Cat has through Winter to even its weaker members. How is the Queen of Night not also reaching for (or already achieved) godhood? He could have been lying for about a million reasons, but it didnt seem like it.

I also wonder with Cat having Night in her domain, if that will give her an edge with it if she decides to absorb it.

Definitely a lot of fascinating directions this can go.
