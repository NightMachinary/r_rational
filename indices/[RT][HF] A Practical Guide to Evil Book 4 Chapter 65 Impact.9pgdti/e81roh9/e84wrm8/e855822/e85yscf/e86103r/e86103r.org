Oh definitely.

And if it came down to it Cat had options like her domain.

But I still think this is a crazy-good showing for Mighty Urulan. Being able to compete with Cat and make her fear for her life in a straight fight is one hell of a benchmark, and even if she's limiting herself to stupid muscle-wizard Cat (sort of unfair, I know, but you get the gist)... stupid muscle-wizard Cat is still one of the most dangerous people alive and can eat entire parties of Named for breakfast. Even approaching the fight in a casual manner she shut down a lot of what would otherwise been decisive moves by sheer virtue of being herself.

More immediately, Cat needs to get her act together quick and start playing this proverbial RPG seriously. This is the easiest fight she's going to have in this city, and she's planning on heading to more dangerous cities. She needs to take this as a learning experience and rethink a lot of her strategic and tactical decisions as she moves on to more dangerous fights.
