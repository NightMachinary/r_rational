I mean that the way Cat approached this fight played very much into Urulan's (and Mighty Drow in general, from what we've seen) strengths, and not at all toward its weaknesses. Cat herself was a bad matchup for Urulan, because Cat is a bad matchup for practically anyone, few people have as much raw power at their disposal, but she wasn't approaching it as a serious fight so when it turned out to be one, she was caught flatfooted.

An analogy I was thinking of is that this fight was basically like when you're derping around in an RTS, thinking you have God Mode turned on, and then you find out you don't when the AI wipes out half your dudes. It doesn't necessarily mean the AI is anywhere near as good a player as you are, it just that you didn't realize you were actually playing.
