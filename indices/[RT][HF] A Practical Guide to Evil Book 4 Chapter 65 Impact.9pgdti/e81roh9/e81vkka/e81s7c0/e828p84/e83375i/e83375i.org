I'm not sure that changes the threat levels of the powerful Drow though? Cat had the edge in power, but it wasn't an /overwhelming/ difference, meanwhile this random Drow was far superior in terms of skill and had a fairly ridiculously sized bag of tricks to pull from. And it's a nobody among the Drow. We know for a fact that there are stronger individuals in the city, and that there are stronger cities out there.

This Mighty might have beaten Cat if she hadn't fought dirty, Cat who can beat a half dozen junior heroes on her own. A concerning sign when it's the lowest guy on the food chain.

And yes, the hypothetical Cat in ten or twenty or a hundred years would crush this guy - but that's not much help to Cat now.
