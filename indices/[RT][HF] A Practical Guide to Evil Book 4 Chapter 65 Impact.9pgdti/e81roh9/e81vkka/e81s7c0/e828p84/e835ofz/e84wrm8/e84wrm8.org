I think the way Cat approached this fight may have exaggerated Might Urulan's effectiveness. For the most part, the Mighty seem to be glass cannons- Urulan's attacks are insanely powerful, but he's got little in the way of defensive powers, and most of them go down pretty easy when she can land an attack. However, since Cat was under the impression she could pretty much roll any Mighty and they had basically no way to permanently hurt her, she's been charging into every engagement with the Mighty and broken their fists with her face.

If she'd, say had Ivah pretend to lead to bait out the sigil-holders strongest Mighty, and then sneak attacked them with overwhelming force, this might have been a much different fight.
