the only way you could subvert the fay oath in this case is by regenerating faster then the winter can eat you from the inside, and the problem with that is that it will probably not stop trying to consume you until you're dead, just the pain from this is absurd, but then we get to the 2nd problem, if you must keep the power regenerating you constantly forever do you have enough power to do other things with it? and does it even regenerate it's power fast enough to keep you alive.

don't forget winter is endless, night is not, the fact that the oath uses winter without passing through cat first means that oath is about as deadly as one can be.
