  Fay got almost infinite power, but are bound by very strict ways they may use it, just like genies can't fulfill their own wishes.

I think we've seen more than enough about the PGtE fae to know that they don't have anything like "infinite" power, both from Cat and from the actual faeries. And the trope of faeries being bound by strict rules was met, I think, by how entwined their nature was with that of stories (which was why the Winter King wanted out in the first place).
