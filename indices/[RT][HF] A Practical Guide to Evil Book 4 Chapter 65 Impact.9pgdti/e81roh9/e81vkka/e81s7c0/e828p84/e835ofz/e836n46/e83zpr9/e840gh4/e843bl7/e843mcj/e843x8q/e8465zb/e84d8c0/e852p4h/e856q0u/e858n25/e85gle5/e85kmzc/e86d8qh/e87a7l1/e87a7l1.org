  so either the fragments pulls on winter by itself by the power of the oath meaning it have to full power of winter to bear
#+end_quote

Note: winter is still a finite resource, in that there's only so much power that can be drawn upon at any one time.

Personally I find it doubtful that a sliver can channel the full power of Winter anyway. A Lord can't call on as much as a Duke can't call on as much as the Winter Queen

And if it can (again, super unlikely) well, that's power being spent there that might be needed elsewhere. Like for healing Cat's body-construct-thing, or for not dying in fights against Mighty.

#+end_quote

Sure, let's make this our premise. Cat had power over the Drow. I'm concerned that one day soon this may not be the case.

#+begin_quote
  it's just the the fragment acting up no more power then she placed inside, and then she have no reason to just place a sliver since she can place a lot of power inside them
#+end_quote

Maybe, but Winter is still a finite (yes, it's not "finite" in that using it spends it, but that's neither or not there in the context of this discussion).

  and the leave me more inclined to being the 1st alternative"
#+end_quote

Sorry, but I've gone over this a few times and I'm struggling to decipher what it is you were trying to say.

#+begin_quote
  like don't deal with stuff you don't understand (or know the value off) since you'll be ripped off.

  treat others like you'd like to be treated, it's basically about karma, what goes around comes around and is about valuing human connections.

  a bird in the hand is better then two in the bush, don't give up what you have for the chance of something better, be content and don't risk it all on a gamble.
#+end_quote

These aren't stories, they're proverbs. But how about "don't meddle with forces you don't understand", "don't poke sleeping bears", or "A fly that dances carelessly in front of a spider's web, risks the wrath of the spider's teeth"?

And? So what? Cat has power over them. I'm concerned that soon she may not. That's called power reversal.

  and the one chaining people are always abusive

There are plenty of either ways to tell that story. You can run it scorpion-and-the-frog style, just for one example, where being nice to yout chained tiger /doesn't change the fact that it's a tiger./

Also, Cat hasn't been unnecessarily cruel to the Drow in the way that she has been to Akua (yet?) but she's not a gentle master either. Step out of line, even slightly, and you die.

And I've already given you other ways of framing it, even outside of the chained beast. If we sat down, we could both cope up with plenty more. Which story will end up being relevant? No idea! I don't think the serial has been particularly clear on how conflicting narratives are resolved.

But one thing that has been repeated time and time again is that things go badly for the villain, and critical failure points always fail.

  a trope to pull from here, and that would be if Akua free as an act of love(

Uhhh.. what? That's a bit of a non sequitur buddy.

  but it will not be because people can quench winter with night
#+end_quote

At no point have I argued for there being some sort of special Night>Winter effect going on.

What I've argued is that greater strength could overpower lesser strength, or that specific knowledge could undo the magical ritual. This seems very consistent with the world we've seen so far winter oaths are unlikely to be more absolute than any other part of the world. Indeed, we just saw something comparable in the very chapter we're discussing.

I've said that the Night potentially can beat Winter /because we've just seen that happen/.

#+begin_quote
  be because people can quench winter with night, if that's even possible since night is a aspect of winter or she'd never have her current title.
#+end_quote

Winter is most definitely not some greater force that encompasses Night. They're related, certainly, but Cat calls the two powers out as being "both kin and foe" to each other. Cat's title reflects that relationship.

But Winter came from Arcadia, Night came from the Drow.

#+begin_quote
  if there is any greater power cat is dealing with here it's the dwarves
#+end_quote

You might want to reread the OP of this comment chain. The dwarves being the biggest boys on the continent doesn't change that the Drow are apparently incredibly swole.

#+begin_quote
  she's not dealing with the drow as a partner,
#+end_quote

Yes, she's dealing with them as a semi-unwilling slave army being kept in line with the threat of death.

#+begin_quote
  winter being winter have issues filling that role.
#+end_quote

Which suggests to me that a different, more fitting story will be executed.

And once more, we have to look at the practical side of things. This is a "Practical" Guide to Evil, after all.
