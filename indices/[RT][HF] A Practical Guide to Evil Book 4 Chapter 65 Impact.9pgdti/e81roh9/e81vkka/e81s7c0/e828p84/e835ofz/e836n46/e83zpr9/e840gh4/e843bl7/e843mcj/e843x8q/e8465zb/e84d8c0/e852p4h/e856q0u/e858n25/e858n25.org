  but as he says she can spend an infinite amount of power but just a finite amount at any one time, since her mantle is finite but the power it draws upon is not.
#+end_quote

By that measure Name power and the Night both seem to be "infinite" too. The issue I'm concerned with is whether Winter can be overpowered and/or destroyed. We've seen both of these things happen in the past.

  the chained beast would not work, especially since cat does not treat them poorly or harass them.
#+end_quote

We'll have to see how Cat treats them notably she's not treated Akua or the fae (Sher other chained monsters) particularly well in the past.

And again, we've seen Cat and others turn smaller details into full-blown stories in the past.

  winter lose vs summer
#+end_quote

Winter are also the prototype of villains, who lose even when /not/ fighting Summer.

#+begin_quote
  yea drow culture stories were actually a thing i considered and that could be a point in favor of breaking free, since their stories could glorify backstabbing, but for someone to initiate that story but for someone to initiate that story they usually have to be named, not that there are not named drow, i'm sure there are, but they have probably been mighty for a long time now already.
#+end_quote

Cat is the Named in the story here. It's about what she herself has wandered into.

And anyway, there are also, additional, concerns about how she's set herself against Ave, who is Named.

#+begin_quote
  even if one turns named and breaks free from the oaths she'll have anyone that didn't receive a name still bound.
#+end_quote

Rather depends on the circumstances of the breaking, I think. And we've just seen what one Mighty can do.

#+begin_quote
  Akua will probably do something, i guess we'll see what however.
#+end_quote

Yeah, this is cause for concern. Especially when Cat is hearing Akua ask for more control and influence over the Drow, /and then giving it to her/.

#+begin_quote
  fairy oaths are usually easy to break, but as said you have to pay for breaking them,
#+end_quote

Did I say that? Where?

But there's a question on what that price is, and a concern that for a sufficiently powerful being that price might not be meaningful.

There's also the issue with how the narrative gets framed. Is this a case of a slave willingly binding themself and paying a penalty, or a story where someone makes a pact with a dark power and gets their hand bitten? Those exist too, and serve to warn against meddling with forces you don't understand.

And once more, outside of vauge story stuff, there are the practical, logistical concerns surrounding all of this.
