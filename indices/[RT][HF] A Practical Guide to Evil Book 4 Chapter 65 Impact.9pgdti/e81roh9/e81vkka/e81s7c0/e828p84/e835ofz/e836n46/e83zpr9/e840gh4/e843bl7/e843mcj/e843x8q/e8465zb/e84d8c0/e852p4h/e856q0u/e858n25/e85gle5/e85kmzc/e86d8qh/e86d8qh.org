for Cat it's a issue pulling on too much winter at any one time, however if the oath is broken they get frosted without the power needs to go through cat, so either the fragments pulls on winter by itself by the power of the oath meaning it have to full power of winter to bear or it's just the the fragment acting up no more power then she placed inside, and then she have no reason to just place a sliver since she can place a lot of power inside them just to be one the safe side and the leave me more inclined to being the 1st alternative"

the power of stories build on story tropes, the more common the more power they have.

the old and common stories we're usually there to tell moral lessons, or where there to keep children from doing dangerous things, like entering the woods. or explain things they didn't understand.

like don't deal with stuff you don't understand (or know the value off) since you'll be ripped off.

treat others like you'd like to be treated, it's basically about karma, what goes around comes around and is about valuing human connections.

a bird in the hand is better then two in the bush, don't give up what you have for the chance of something better, be content and don't risk it all on a gamble.

all stories about someone being chained is about power reversal, and the one chaining people are always abusive, if it's about a circus owner getting locked in with the tigers or if the sergant falls of the cliffs due to none of his soldiers want to heave him up. Ivah is pretty much the enigma here, since there is actually a trope to pull from here, and that would be if Akua free as an act of love(what kind of love is irrelevant), him he'd have a clear shot on killing her captor or earning Akuas freedom in some other way. but that is a pretty much explicitly good trope, something Diabolist would have real issues working with but could work unless she completed a redemption ark.

Her being nonchalant about the issues she's facing is almost guaranteed to bite her in the ass, but it will not be because people can quench winter with night, if that's even possible since night is a aspect of winter or she'd never have her current title.

if there is any greater power cat is dealing with here it's the dwarves, and that might fuck her over since she know way too little about them, she's not dealing with the drow as a partner, if anything she's a liberator due to the nizi not getting harvested for any slight, however winter being winter have issues filling that role.
