  Winter is always a full tank, even if it's just 20 litre, it never need to refuel since it's never used up.

Functionally there are issues with pulling on too much winter, too fast.

  the chained beast trope builds on 2 things to work, since it's a story about power reversal.

This is something you've just made up, but sure, I'll go through it.

As you've said, we have the first issues been met. I talked about the second issue. And the third issue ties into all the other factors I've brought up.

  and in this case Cat is the darker power, since she's the one dealing out the night
#+end_quote

Cat's the one who journeyed into the Everdark seeking the help of powers best left alone, and has continually shown ignorance in the face of what they are. Now we're seeing how the Drow might be the /greater/ power at play. Cat's Faust here, make no mistake about it.

Maybe everything does go right for Cat. Maybe the villain doesn't get their conmeuppance here. But I doubt things will go that easily for her, and I'm surprised at how nonchalant she's being about it all.
