  let's just agree we disagree on most points and leave it at that.

Seems like a good idea to me.

I'm just going to be pedantic one last time and point out that the cake example has been around since the 14th century, and that most stories revolve around conflicting choices. Also, I don't think the age of a fable /in our world/ is really what matters - it's about the patterns that reoccur within the Guide, and the guide was constructed in response to the modern fantasy genre and the tropes and cliches that we the readers will be familiar with.

But thanks for the discussion! Here's probably a good place to leave it, with a new chapter coming out in a few hours.
