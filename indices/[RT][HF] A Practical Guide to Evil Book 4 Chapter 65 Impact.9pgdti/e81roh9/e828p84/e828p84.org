This is an interesting comparison though I feel like it is mildly unfair, cat is in her 20's Urulan could 1000 for all we know, he/she may not have had this level of strength that whole time but...

Cat is definitely in the top tier of power on the continent, she just has the skills of a toddler in comparison to others in her weight class, like the Sve Noc, who I'm pretty sure is probably equal to Cat when it comes to sheer power, but is rediculously more experienced and skilled at it, to the point that her servants that only have a fraction of her power pose a threat to Cat.
