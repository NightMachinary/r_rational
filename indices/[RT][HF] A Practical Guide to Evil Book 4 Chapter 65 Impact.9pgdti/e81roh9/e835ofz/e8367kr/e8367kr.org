Yep. Urulan gave Cat a run for her money, but now that she's defeated it, she presumably gets her /own Urulan/ to bring to the next fight. I'm not sure whether the Night includes /only/ techniques or whether it also comes with knowledge of how best to apply them, but that's a fuckload of power even in the hands of a less experienced drow.
