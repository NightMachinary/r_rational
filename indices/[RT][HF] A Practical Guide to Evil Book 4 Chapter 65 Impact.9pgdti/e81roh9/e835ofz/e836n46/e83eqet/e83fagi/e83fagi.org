  Drow did not take oaths, or make them, and so a few of the first dzulu to secure a corpse in the auction had treated their word a little too lightly. Three, to be precise. They'd tried to slay other drow under my banner, or hurt them. Their hideously *twisted and frozen corpses* had been hung from the long metal pole at my side, dangling softly back and forth. I'd not had to lift so much as a finger to see them die. The oaths had seen to that, *the sliver of Winter I'd put inside them devouring their bodies* from the inside the moment they acted in a manner breaking their word. The Night they'd taken was still there, stirring as they dangled.

So it's definitely more than just destroying their heart or something similar, but still potentially something a Drow with enough power or the right Secret could walk away from (remember, it's only backed up by a "sliver" of Winter).

And that's without a Drow working out how to escape from the magical contract altogether, which sounds like the sort of knowledge that would be floating around somewhere.
