I'm operating under the assumption that there's an upper limit to the damage a sliver of Winter can do. It doesn't seem reasonable to me to say "it can kill anyone, no matter how strong they are".

There's surely got to come a point where the damage done just isn't meaningful anymore, or where the being in question can just crush the sliver inside them.

Or maybe Faerie oaths are conceptually unbeatable beyond anything else we've seen in the series - time will tell.

And there's still the (bigger?) issue with Drow picking up Night: where they might pick up Secrets for getting out of magical contracts.

Or the Akua issue.

Or the single point of failure issue.
