how dealing with fay goes by normal standard is terrible, it might be beatable simply because Cat set a punishment so if you can overcome the punishment you've effectively "paid" for breaking the oath.

it's having unpaid debts to fay that are super dangerous, since a fay that is owed something can take anything they want from you, or anything of equal value to what they were promised at the very least and what they value and you value are two different things altogether so they can take lots from you since it have low value to them. and this power is pretty hard to dodge if not impossible, and is the main reason you never deal with fay, or if you deal with them you word the deal very carefully.

Fay got almost infinite power, but are bound by very strict ways they may use it, just like genies can't fulfill their own wishes.

however this is just general fay stuff so how much applies to PGtE is up in the air.
