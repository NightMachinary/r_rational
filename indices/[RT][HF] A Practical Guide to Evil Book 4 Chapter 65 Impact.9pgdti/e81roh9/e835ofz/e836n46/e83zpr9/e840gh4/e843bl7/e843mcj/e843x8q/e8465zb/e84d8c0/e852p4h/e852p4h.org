One of the first things Cat's Drow try to do is to break the bindings, so I'm not sure how willing they really are. At the very least, I expect that they could swing the circumstances of events into aiding them narrativlely - Cat's fudged bigger stories with less going for her.

And there are still the other stories that could come into play, Winter losing, Akua traitor-ing, single-family failure points fails, and so on.

Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Cat ran into a /Drow/ story about how trying to instill cooperation ends badly. We just saw what happened to Black when he ran into a different culture.

I don't think there's any indication that Cat's winter powers are endless. If you have evidence to the contrary then, please, share but there's none that I'm seeing

In point of fact, Masgeo explicitly calls out Winter and Cat's mantle as being finite:

  “The Saint of Swords appears to have, for lack of a better term, cut Winter itself,” Hierophant said....

  “Think of your mantle as a cape. Much like your body itself, it is a fixed object in the eyes of Creation.”....

  “The main difference being that your body is a shape, while your mantle is a pattern of power,” he said. “That power is, of course, finite. Not in the sense that using it spends it, but along the lines that the cape remains a cape -- it does not grow or lessen, as a living thing would.”

And the oaths were set in place by the mantle.
