yes but the deal is not forced, hence they are not chained except by their own doing, most stories about breaking deals end badly for the breaker, since most folk stories of that kind tries to teach a lesson about not being too greedy.

or you know "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" trying to shirk a deal is trying to eat your cake and have it too, something very few get away with.

just like the chained beast is a story about power play, since you never know when the scales might reverse "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." have existed for a long time.

just like all stories with wishes have bad endings, or at the very least, return to their humble beginnings.

do keep in mind that Cat is running around in creation rather then arcadia, how much power she can use here is very limited, since even if winter is infinite how much Cat can use at any one time is not.
