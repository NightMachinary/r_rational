let's just agree we disagree on most points and leave it at that.

just one last thing about the proverbs and why i used them, there are tons of fables around said proverbs hence they are stories, not all of course, like "you can't eat your cake and have it too" is pretty new so while I'm sure there is a story somewhere out there that fits to that proverb too, there is none that i know of.

anyhow just google pretty much any proverb you know and story and you can see examples of it in old stories and fables.
