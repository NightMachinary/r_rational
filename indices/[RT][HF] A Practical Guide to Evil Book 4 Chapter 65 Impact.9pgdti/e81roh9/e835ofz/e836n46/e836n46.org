  But thanks to Fey contact magic, Cat can have actual loyalty from those she empowers

I'm pretty sure there are concerns about this though.

For one thing, the loyalty from the Drow revolves, as you say, around the oaths Cat had them swear. There are nineteen of them, three greater and sixteen lesser, and it's a pretty safe assumption that Cat's done her utmost to make the ironclad.

But there are issues.

- First off, if all the loyalty centres around the Winter oaths, well, we know what Black has taught us about plans with a single failure point.

- Then there are concerns that letting Cat's Drow loot too much Night could let them break free. Firstly because Night makes Drow more powerful, and there are obvious concerns about leashing monsters more powerful than yourself both practically and narratively. Then there's the fact that the Night comes with knowledge and skill, and with the number of Secrets seemingly floating around (some that can evidently counter Cat's Winter powers), there are risks that the Drow might stumble into something that lets them break or subvert the oaths

- Then there are issues with Akua's involvement in the process, giving the idea of the auction, helping with the ritual and the wording of the oaths, being given the power ups to her second that she requested to better have a hold over the Drow, and potentially forming death squads. The involvement of Cat's traitorous lieutenant, who is smarter and more manipulate than her, does not instil confidence on a narrative or logistical level.
