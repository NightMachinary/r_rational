Drow are powerful, but that power is lootable. Every victory adds the entirety of the losers' strength to the winners. Meaning if Cat takes out a bunch of drow half her collective strength, she's now at 1.5 Cats, and can repeat against a sigil that's 0.75 Cats strong. Repeat and it's exponential growth.

Now, under normal circumstances this doesn't work out well because drow are prone to backstabbing, and with good reason. But thanks to Fey contact magic, Cat can have actual loyalty from those she empowers. Which makes her snowballing her way to victory just a matter of time, unless the rest of the drow wise up and go on the offensive against her.
