So the Drow are fairly insanely strong. Mighty Urulan was almost a match for Cat. It was almost as strong, more technically skilled, and had a fairly ridiculous number of abilities displayed in this short fight alone (dissolving matter, shooting laser beams, preventing Cat's immortal construct body from healing, physically binding someone made of mist, shattering Winter-made ice with a gesture, transmuting mist into acid, flying, seeing through glamours, and causing matter to explode - all in the space of a few minutes)

But again, Mighty Urulan was almost a match for Cat and this is fairly insane; Cat is one of the most powerful people on Calernia, and Urulan is just some Drow. The reason Cat picked out the Urulan sigil to fight was that they were the softest target In Great Lotow, which itself is just a random city picked because it was the closest one.

What do the /actual/ powerful figures amongst the Drow look like? Cat said she was heading to great Lotow to "declare war on an entire civilization", but that's looking less and less like a viable plan. And then there's the small matter of killing /Sve/, the Priestess of the Night. What does she look like?

Maybe there was something funky going on - Sve bolstering Urulan or some such - but that raises question on its own.
