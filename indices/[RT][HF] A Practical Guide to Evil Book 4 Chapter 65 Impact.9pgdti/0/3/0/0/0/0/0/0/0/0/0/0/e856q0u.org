"The main difference being that your body is a shape, while your mantle is a pattern of power,” he said. “That power is, of course, finite. Not in the sense that using it spends it, but along the lines that the cape remains a cape -- it does not grow or lessen, as a living thing would"

but as he says she can spend an infinite amount of power but just a finite amount at any one time, since her mantle is finite but the power it draws upon is not. since using power while not spending it makes it infinite, it's just that Cats not-infinite blanket can cover at any one time. so as long as the powers of nature work against her she'll never be able to freeze the entire world however long she tries.

ofc the drow try to break the rules, but they willingly bid for it, they bid for power not food, rest or a necessity to live, they were not forced to swear the oaths and that is why the chained beast would not work, especially since cat does not treat them poorly or harass them.

yes winter lose vs summer, unless they triggered another story during the fighting, since as you said fay are story bound, but wielding summer is not something you'll be able to do with night, since it's pretty much as far from that aspect as it can come, and even if they can wield it with night they probably have to get it from somewhere first.

yea drow culture stories were actually a thing i considered and that could be a point in favor of breaking free, since their stories could glorify backstabbing, but for someone to initiate that story they usually have to be named, not that there are not named drow, i'm sure there are, but they have probably been mighty for a long time now already. but it might also be the reverse since they had a sprawling empire and their culture comes from that and and a empire does not grow that big with as much backstabbing as the drow currently do, hence their stories probably glorify their glory days where people did not stab everyone and someone could be just without being harvested for it.

and even if one turns named and breaks free from the oaths she'll have anyone that didn't receive a name still bound.

Akua will probably do something, i guess we'll see what however.

when thinking about it breaking the oath might not be that hard at all, fairy oaths are usually easy to break, but as said you have to pay for breaking them, i can't think of a single story where the breaker goes without repercussions, the closest i've come with that kind of stories are where the payment have been delayed but it have never been completely avoided, and in that story it was because the time to collect the deal was a thing you could influence.

and if it breaks a fay oath then it's not just winter empowers Cat, since she'll have fairy story power on her side, and that is more then just winter, then it's the question if she can use this, being inexperienced as she is but that is another point entirely.

then depending on how it's worded, 160 years in arcadia could be a day here and vice versa, hence they could be free from their debt tomorrow depending on if it's THEIR years or the WORLDS years, that's how you get out of a deal with fay, not by smothering it.
