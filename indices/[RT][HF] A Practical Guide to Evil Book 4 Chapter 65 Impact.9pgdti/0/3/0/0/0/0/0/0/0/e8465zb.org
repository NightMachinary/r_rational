That's a fair point, in that the fae are most certainly are entwined with truth and balance and debt, but strongest still does not equate to infinite and after looking I don't think the stories are that the fae /always/ have their debts paid, but you're welcome to find a quote.

There are other stories worth pointing too as well, like the chained monster breaking free and killing it's owner, or how Winter always loses.

And again we've already seen Drow tricks beat out Winter magic, including but not limited too Cat's "creationally fixed body" powered by her actual mantle and not just a sliver of Winter.
