name power is not infinite since it's actively used up, if we think of it as a car a "named" car can go diffrent amount of lengh depending on how big it's rank it and that is ruled by the aspects, some got 40 litre others only 10, sure you can refuel it but it can still just go "that" far until it needs to be refueled.

Winter is always a full tank, even if it's just 20 litre, it never need to refuel since it's never used up.

Night we don't know yet.

the chained beast trope builds on 2 things to work, since it's a story about power reversal.

the 1st is that one must be the owner or boss over the other/s where they can't leave (is fullfilled)

the 2nd one is that the "owner" must treat the "pet/s" callously or arbitrary, like killing one of them just to make an example or not listening and blaming the "pet" for her own failings, or the third is activity looking for fault in the pet simply so she can abuse them "fairly" (is not fullfilled)

The finale is that the "owner" is placed under the mercy of the "pet" either in such a way that the "pet" can choose to save the "owner" but chooses not to due to earlier abuse, or is temporary disarmed and devoured by the beast s/he can no longer control.

as I said it's a story about how you should treat any and everyone fairly as they deserve, if you misbehave you're still treated fairly even if she punish you in cruel ways.

  There's also the issue with how the narrative gets framed. Is this a case of a slave willingly binding themselves and paying a penalty, or a story where someone makes a pact with a dark power and gets their hand bitten? Those exist too, and serve to warn against meddling with forces you don't understand.

and in this case Cat is the darker power, since she's the one dealing out the night, that is also the very reason she should not participate in the consuming night because then she become the one meddling.
