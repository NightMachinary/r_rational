What do you mean by exaggerating his effectiveness?

If you're doing a general powerscaling, I think Mighty Urulan would have performed much better against anyone who wasn't Cat, with all her crazy healing, cover creating, and battlefield mobility. For most heroes and villains we've seen the fight would have been all but over after the first exchange, and most wouldn't get a half dozen second chances to reset and try again.

If you're talking about against Cat in particular, then yeah I agree that Cat's approach was suboptimal at best. It's been a while since Cat's fights involved her using the creative tactics that marked her earlier fights. That's probably going to have to change soon if Cat wants to get things done.

In terms of the Drow's defensive powers, I want to point out that other than ludicrous levels of skill (which is a better defence than most have available) they've also a fairly good regenerative factor (regrowing fingers in a split second) as well.
