A Rob (random omnipotent being) approaches you and informs you that you will be transferred to an alternate history exactly one year from now. You have one year to prepare and the rules are as follows.

You may bring with you as much as you can carry and may bring with you anything you can get your hands on by whatever methods are at your disposal (the Rob, and however will not assist). You may choose to be transported to any point on the globe of the alternate earth. The Rob informs you that the alternate earth was identical to our own up until 250 years ago when it diverged. It was selected randomly from all possible worlds that diverged from our own. The Rob will transport you to the point you request unless that point would lead to some large inconvenience in which case it will transport you to some convenient location within a mile of the point you selected (so if the point you select happens to be in the middle of a busy road it you transport you to the street side but if it is the open ocean and nothing is floating within a mile of you it will dump you in the seal.

Given that the Rob will not give you any info on the nature of the world selected how should you prepare? Where on earth would you choose to be transported to and what would you bring? How should you spend the year provided for preparation?
