Why do I think I did not hallucinate? Can I use this evidence to convince others?

A year is enough time to build a community around the idea of this happening, to see what they might come up with.

Theoretically, I should be able to gain access to a ridiculous number of ressources by paying my livelihood to someone that believes I am insane and is willing to bet good odds on it by outfitting me for this mission in ways I can return if I do not disappear.

I'll need equipment against nuclear winter, a gun, a laptop and smartphones and a whole bunch of raspberry pis, electric chargers, rare materials, a snapshot of Wikipedia, scanned libraries, translation software, walky-talkies for first contact, an RC drone, a grenade, and some phials of modern viruses in case they're in a dark age and I need to do some quick geopolitical adjustments.
