Is there a range (Death Note, LoS, Touch?), or a cooldown?

Depending on the definition of living ("has not taken its last breath"?), you could literally save the universe: Attempt to petrify a frozen insect and it might turn to stone iff it would ever become resurrected. If you keep a did-not-petrify popsicle around, it would become an artifact whose owner can, in case of disaster, reset the timeline back to the attempt of petrification by reviving it, retroactively turning it into a statue.

To check whether this works: Freeze five insects, attempt to petrify them, thaw the fifth if all failed, smash all remaining popsicles/statues, and conclude that it works iff exactly the fifth turned into a statue.
