Depends on range. If it's infinite range, which I think your wording implies, then I can hold cities hostage by turning all the traffic lights to red and crippling infrastructure by essentially removing green lights. I can blackmail green-eyed celebrities, or if the power is broad enough (i.e. turning green /tones/ into red tones, or altering green balance against red balance) anyone who wants to look remotely normal. All it takes is some hardcore cryptography and covert communications on my end to get paid. I can also effectively destroy vast areas of wilderness and/or cropland. Plants are green for photosynthesis, so turning all of the trees, bushes, and grasses in the United States red at the height of spring would probably result in massive ecological damage. Attacking croplands could cripple a nation. That means a big payday. (Or for a more benevolent use of the power, turning all the invasive species red, which would help even if it didn't kill them because it would clearly mark them for quick removal.)

If it has a lesser range, or I'm just not as much of a bitch towards my fellow man, then I might be able to leverage the power by looking at dye and paint prices. How much does red paint cost compared to green paint? What is my power actually doing at a chemical level? It's probably possible to save large industrial suppliers of green food coloring or green dye or green paint thousands of dollars a year, if only because it allows them to run a single production line, but this would take more research to do than I'd like for a reddit comment.

There's also probably a tidy profit to be made in producing red versions of traditionally green foodstuffs. Maybe I could open a restaurant simply called Red which has red cucumbers, red salads, and all sorts of other novelties. This doesn't seem like a terribly efficient way to make money though, not unless the market for red versions of green foods is larger than I think it is.

If I can change green /light/ into ultrared light I have a lot more options, but by the wording I don't think that's quite a fair interpretation.
