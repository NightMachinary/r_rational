I love how people on this subreddit can offer so much creative ideas for any given scenario. Both your and ulyssessword's answers are very ingenious and contained some ideas I didn't think of.

There is one more very powerful application of this ability, almost as powerful as 'creating a friendly AI'. I hope someone will guess what it is :)

Otherwise, I will post my thoughts on this ridiculously broken ability the day after tomorrow.
