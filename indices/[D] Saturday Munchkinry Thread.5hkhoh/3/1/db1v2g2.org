If you can change green /light/ to red as well, (and also arbitrarily change your frame of reference) then you can block/destroy any type of electromagnetic radiation.

First, choose a reference frame where the +light+ /electromagnetic radiation/ source is blueshifted or redshifted the appropriate amount to make it be "green". Next, shift it to red, which I assume happens on a photon-by-photon basis. Repeat steps one and two with different reference frames as needed for other parts of the spectrum as well as repeating it on the same light to drop it down to arbitrarily low energies/frequencies.

This might also work for objects, but that's a bit /too/ cheesy.

Alternatively, if you can choose /two/ reference frames for a single change (i.e. change green in frame 1 to red in frame 2), then you can go the other way too, and get +free energy+ /absolute control over all electromagnetic radiation/.
