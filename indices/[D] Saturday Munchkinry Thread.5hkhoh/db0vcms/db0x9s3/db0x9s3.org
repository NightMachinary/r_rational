Assuming they want to kill you and they aren't stupid, you can't defend against them unless you do nothing else.

A completely non-magical assassin could potentially kill somebody who is defended by bodyguards and intelligence services, provided they make public appearances.

If you gave your assassin tech that already exists (like drones and nukes), even staying in a fortified compound wouldn't be enough.

And if they had magical powers like the ones you specified they would be virtually impossible to stop.

They wouldn't even have to risk themselves by attempting to kill you, just make a fortune at a casino or on the stock market and pay people to do it.

They can effectively lend their power to whomever they choose by watching a feed of their vitals, visuals, and audio and directing them. Not as high precision, granted, but enough to avoid obvious things like "That doorway is trapped." or "The air is poisonous." (provided their power had a long enough window).

That means that you're effectively up against an unending assault of superpowered assassins unless you block all possible ways of sending those signals (and, of course, you'd have to fake a believable datastream for a while to prevent them realising you've blocked it and aborting the assault to come up with a new strategy).

So my answer is to try to figure out a way to make them not want to kill you. If they want to kill you, the only way you can survive is if they're idiots.
