  They can see, feel hear and taste things before they happen, and choose to act differently, even if that means they never see feel hear or taste those things.

Are they able to will themselves to act precisely as to bring about their vision? If not, just from chaos theory and tiny random variations in their actions, things should come out differently than their visions. To exploit this, I would need various sources of random noise sensitive people's actions. I don't know how long they see, so I will need multiple separate sources that will scale in time and range of sensitivity.
