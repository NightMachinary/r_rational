The first thing I do for defense is enable two factor identification on all available devices and/or services. Biometric two factor, not simply "we'll generate a code for you". If I don't do that, it's too easy to use certain varieties of precognition to simply brute force their way past any other variety of information security, though this is always going to remain a concern.

Taking them out involves slow-acting poisons. If I know that they're going to be coming after me within a specific time frame, then I put on my gas mask and flood the house with a deadly toxin. Their power doesn't make them immune to cameras or surveillance, so that's a point in my favor as well. And assuming that my information security is impenetrable (a big if) then they still need to manually case the joint /or/ depend fully on their powers.

(If I only have my normal resources, then I run instead of taking them out. If they follow and I can't shake them by going undercover, then explosives which are not under my control and cannot be stopped, which take longer than however long their time limit is to escape from once they're in proximity -- probably not workable if "short" is defined as something like a day.)
