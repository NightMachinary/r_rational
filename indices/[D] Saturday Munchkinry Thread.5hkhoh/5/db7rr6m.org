Mediumship (and, attendantly, non-matter-hosted intelligence) is real, but limited by information theory in that communication with spirits becomes unreliable when the spirit or spirits involved would become a physical-world <-> physical-world communication channel at a rate exponential (or worse) with the total number of bits transferred over said channel. Information already possessed by the recipient is not considered to be transferred, and so a common workaround for this limit is to construct a detailed mental model of the channeled spirit via non-mediumship means and allow the spirit to 'operate' this, thus minimizing the matter->spirit->matter bitrate as well as providing a basic authentication heuristic in that the spirit conversant will be unable to effectively operate the mental model coherently if they don't share it.

You've just had your psychic awakening as an average-level medium and have been carefully tuning your mental model of $FAVORITE_DEAD_RATIONALIST_MUNCHKIN to the point that you believe said person has now detected this and bothered to contact you.

How do you +take over+ optimize the world?

Bonus round: what happens now that there is a semi-reliable way of detecting p-zombies, and the hard problem of consciouness is rendered inapplicable?
