Found a startup that pays suicidal people good money for their bodies (googling which country legalizes suicide probably puts me on some list or another.), then sells them to the highest bidder. (Going Black Ops on me is probably more effort than just buying from me?)

I wonder how hard it is to keep a trade secret.

I'd have to keep the price at which I buy bodies low enough that people aren't incentivized to steal the device because they have a "cheaper" source of bodies. And then I might be in trouble once that supply runs out.

All this becomes much easier if I can store minds somehow. What counts as a human body? Popsicles? (Can I recover cryonicist's minds?) I'll guess there's no solution to this problem because "necessitates overwriting, i.e. killing".
