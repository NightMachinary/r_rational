Some country's bound to allow trans-species transfusions in the next 40 years. Meanwhile, human blood should be commonly traded. Try to have a good income.

I don't think this should be disproportionally likely to cause revolution, if there are few people who want blood money will buy enough, and if there are many then legislation will bring up more. It's not like regularly donating blood is tortorous.
