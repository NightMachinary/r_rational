You can take color green hostage , changing everything green in the planet to red would be very apocaliptic since most plants would die and a lot of other things would be affected especially in cities,especially if you define red as absorbing all light except red including non visible frequencies of light. and you can send faster than light signals which it's completely broken .you can make any green object absorb all frequencies of light that aren't red, this is especially useful in spaceships , you can mass produce materials with this properties which can be useful for a lot of things( especially if I can make things reflect 100% of red light which I think would break thermodynamics . I once saw the power of changing the color of things in a list of most useless powers , which was very funny since I thought that power was op even without the obvious implement this values via changes on colours solution.
