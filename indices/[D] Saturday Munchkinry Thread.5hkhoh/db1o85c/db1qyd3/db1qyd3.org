Assuming that everything about the power is as powerful as possible, and it doesn't have any limits, I'd probably make a Friendly AI and solve everything.

First, I'd buy some green paper. Next, the "thing" I would turn red is "the parts of the paper that correspond to the source code (written so that it's readable to the OCR in my scanner and the compiler in my computer) of a Friendly Seed AI." Lastly, I would scan it into my computer.

Unbounded powers with no limit on how they gather information are /broken as hell/.

Alternatively, I would turn environmentally friendly things into supporters of communism.

EDIT: Alternatively, I could just cut out the middle man from the AI scenario. "Change things from green to red in the combination (including both space and time) that best fulfills the values /mumble/^{/mumble/^{/mumble/^{/mumble/}}} .
