You have the power to transmute living material to stone. The process is instant and irreversible, and affects the totality of the living material (as well as any organic substances bound to it---if used on a human, for instance, the hair will also be affected). You have a limit of transmuting up to 200 cubic feet at a time---attempting to petrify an organism larger than this will have no effect.

The stone generated is structurally similar to concrete, being a uniform colour and lacking any precious metals, stones, or substances inside.

How do you use this power ethically?
