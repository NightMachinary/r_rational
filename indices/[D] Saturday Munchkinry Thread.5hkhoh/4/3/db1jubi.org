How is the living material selected? Does it require some spatial description "The entity at (x,y,z)." or is it a semantic description "The entity with the following characteristics."? If it is a semantic description, then it could be used to purge bacterial infections. "All cells within 5 meters of me that are part of the species Staphylococcus aureus."

What counts as the boundary of living material? Could I select a tumor as the entity to be transformed, and leave the human patient alive? If so, it would provide a way to prevent tumors from growing any bigger, and allow for them to be surgically removed.

Can it be used along many small organisms at once? If so, cheap housing could be constructed by using pheromones to attract ants to a location, then petrifying them into place.
