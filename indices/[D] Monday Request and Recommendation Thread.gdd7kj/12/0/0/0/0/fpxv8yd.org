The gambler was angry because he consecutively won and that he was running out of prizes.

He cut off most relationships because they weren't useful for him as they would take too much time to develop and he needed to leave the village soon due to the wolf tide. He wanted to leave as quickly as possible to capitalize on his advantages from reincarnating before there were too many changes due to the butterfly effect.

I understand your hesitation to continue with the story but I would really recommend sticking with it. Maybe you can look at the manhua, if that easier to read(up till its updated at least). But trust me on this, it is some of the most rational fiction I've seen. It does state that mobs become dumber as they increase in number which is true to quite an extent.

More importantly, the philosophy of the series really shines through after a few chapters. The mc is a perfect mc for this type of world, where an individual can go against a community's decision, and the philosphy and world-building built around that is amazing. I love how it explores how sects interact with demonic cultivators and its take on philosophy is really amazing, sometimes more subtle.

Edit: Please do respond

10/10 maybe a bit slow to start. Everything becomes 10 times better after he leaves the village so please read at least up till there
