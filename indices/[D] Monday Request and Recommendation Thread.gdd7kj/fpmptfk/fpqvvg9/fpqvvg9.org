I found the Engineer trilogy by KJ Parker to be really good and despite having no fantasy elements to be really quite inventive. Also the main character is pretty rational at going about his goals, which makes it a fit for this subreddit.

To quote its amazon page:

When an engineer is sentenced to death for a petty transgression of guild law, he flees the city, leaving behind his wife and daughter. Forced into exile, he seeks a terrible vengeance - one that will leave a trail of death and destruction in its wake.
