One thing I've read recently that's relatively rational is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw/][Dave Scum]], a story about a guy with save-scumming powers saving the world. It's also a bit difficult to google for, since it's on a google doc.

Any other rational time travel stuff to recommend?
