[having read up to ~ch40]

It's clear that the author doesn't have that level of knowledge himself, which means that the things he says are flawed in many ways. Let me point out some of the mistakes he makes

- He describes entire crowds as the same person

  - This is common in chinese webnovels, where the crowd acts as a single character. This emphasizes that only people with a personality stand out, and the only people given personalities are main characters, or the people they interact with. This is reasonable in real life in china, because of their culture of not standing out when they are not in positions of power, but it's stretched thin in the scenarios of the story.

- He doesn't understand other professions

  - The MC 'gambled' and won a Gu. The host of the shop was angry that somebody won. Absolutely wrong. Gambling shops run off the payments people make - the shopkeeper already made 60 spirit stones off the MC and he can use this as publicity to attract more customers, to give him more money. The Gu was inside a stone, and the shopkeeper didn't know if it contained the Gu. He never really 'owned' the Gu, since he already decided to sell the stone. If anything, he should be overjoyed.

- He consistently makes suboptimal decisions because he refuses to be kind

  - This can be excused away by his callous past, but this does not make him a competent character, nor make his decisions correct.
  - E.g. He had a relationship with his brother which he could've used to gain resources, but he cut it off for no benefits. The MC began in a position of relative power over his brother, and if he had extended kindness to him then, he would've benefitted for a long time.
  - I haven't read far enough to see how it ends up, but where I stopped the MC had antagonized or made an enemy of almost everyone who knew him, except the barkeeper. Some were necessary as part of his plan, but he needlessly antagonized the people in power (the people protecting him from being instantly turned to mincemeat by aforementioned everyone). Emphasis on 'needlessly'. If his '500 years' makes him capable of perfectly predicting people, then he should know how to wrap everyone around his pinky. But either he doesn't (bad decision making) or he can't (he isn't that smart and instead it was just plot armour all along).

It doesn't matter how 'smart' the MC is, if the author isn't as knowledgeable. Writing a character smarter than yourself is /hard/ and if you do it wrong, then it won't be rational.

Let me give you a counter example, The King's avatar suffers on point 1, but succeeds on points 2 and 3. The author genuinely understands the stuff he's talking about. He still tries writing a character smarter than himself, and there are artefacts from that, but they're tiny in comparison to reverend insanity. To put into context, TKA has an academic character, and even though none of the other characters are academically inclined (which means the author likely isn't either), the actions and words of the academic seemed perfectly consistent with how I'd expect a real academic to think.

Or take Way of Choices for example. I haven't read it in a long time, but it presented a smart character without overstepping his capabilities.

Reverend Insanity is solidly better than average, but a rational fiction it is not.
