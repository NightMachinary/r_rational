Super Powereds and Forging Hephasteus by Drew Hayes.

Quite a bit lighter than Worm and Ward, with Super Powereds focused on a college cohort going through superhero training and Forging Hephasteus being focused on a guild of villains and the Code that allows them to survive in a world with superheros. Both are set in different universes.
