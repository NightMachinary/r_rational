The therapy. Apparently, going by the retrospective post, Wildbow wasn't originally planning on having Jessica yeeted out of the plot by the portal bombs, but rather settled on it as a solution to audience griping about the therapy premise. In retrospect, that makes a lot of sense of the weird arc anticlimaxes, which essentially started there - if you look at the first arc, you can see that Ward's original intended arc structure followed up battles with therapy sessions, and once the therapy sessions were removed, it had a lot of battles that just end on weird hanging notes. When conceiving of Jessica's inclusion in Ward, Wildbow also wasn't planning on the plot reflecting nearly so badly on her as it did, which is responsible for a lot of thematic self-contradiction.
