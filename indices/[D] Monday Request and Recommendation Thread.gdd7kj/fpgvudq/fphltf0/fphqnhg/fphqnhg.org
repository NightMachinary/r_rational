There's a chance I'll catch flak for this, but Amy in Ward is not the same character as Amy at the end of Worm. Spoilers for both ahead.

I don't know if it's Wildbow not realising what he'd written Amy /as/, or if it's a counter-reaction on his part because of how much she's been woobified in the fandom, but her character in Ward literally, entirely revolves around wanting to rape Victoria. It's disturbing, uncomfortable to read about, and just makes me scratch my head.

I'm not trying to excuse what Amy did to Victoria in Worm -- rape or no rape, it was still /horrific/, and her running away instead of fixing what she did just makes it worse. But, compare:

Amy by the end of Worm:

  “Think back to the time in your life when you were strongest,” Panacea said.

  I did.

  Not a time when I had the Dragonfly or the flight pack. It was when I was fighting the Slaughterhouse Nine, Alexandria, Defiant and Dragon.

  “Times when you were most scared,” she said.

  The same times.

  “I think those are the times when you're most like you. And it sucks, I know. It's horrible to think about it like that, because at least for me, it wasn't a time when I liked myself. Just the opposite.”

  “But you came to terms with it.”

  “I owned that part of me,” she said. “And I can barely look Carol and Neil in the eyes, because of it. But I'm secure in who I am, and I can do this. Healing people, being a medic for the people fighting on our side.”

  I nodded.

Amy in her first Ward interlude:

#+begin_quote
  Amy tensed, fists balling up, tattoos tight around her bones. “I wasn't me. I was fresh off of having my fingers eaten, my home destroyed, my life overturned. Bonesaw tried to break me. She tried to break Mark. I wasn't me. Victoria wasn't Victoria.”

  Jessica didn't interject.

  “What we did together doesn't count,” Amy's words were more a plea than a statement. “Not when we weren't ourselves.”

By the end of Worm, after two years in the Birdcage, she's accepted what she's done, and she claims her actions were completely her own, a result of who she was. She's still bad, she's still a monster, but she's a /human/ monster, not the caricature we see in Ward; who thinks to herself she's never done anything wrong or selfish and literally spends 90% of her on-screen time trying to rape Victoria. Just.. what.

Weirdly enough, Wildbow kind of does a 180° on Amy by the end of Ward? Not completely, or even that much, but when we see her in the final arcs, she's (for some reason, not at all built upon or expanded) accepted that what she was doing was horrible, destroyed the patch of Victoria's skin she's been keeping in her bra (what the fuck?) and vowed to never use her power again, all after thirty minutes of forced therapy. During her epilogue, she's convinced by Crystal to move to Earth Gimel's Europe, so her and Victoria don't run a chance of seeing each-other again. That's a better ending than Taylor got.
