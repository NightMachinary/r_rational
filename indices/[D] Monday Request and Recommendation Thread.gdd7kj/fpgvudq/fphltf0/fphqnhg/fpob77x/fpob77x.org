  There's a chance I'll catch flak for this, but Amy in Ward is not the same character as Amy at the end of Worm.

I pretty much felt the same, but Amy gave a rather convincing explanation when Victoria asked for her help with the dreaming death virus.

Basically, after she fucked up Victoria and couldn't put her back the way she used to be, that was the /first time/ Amy discovered a limit to her power. Up until then, /whatever she wanted/, she could achieve with merely a thought. Make her adoptive mother treat her like her actual child? That can be done with brain rewriting! Make her sister reciproke her incestuous crush? Just a touch away!

When Dean talks to her after the Undersiders rob the bank, she says she /hated/ that she didn't let a kid die because if she made just /one/ mistake, people might /finally/ give her a break (the fact that that expectation is largely self-imposed shall be left aside for now).

And now? She finally has that limit, something she /just can't fix/. It lets her realize that yes, she /has/ done something monstrous and the consequences are inevitable.

Except, two years later, Khepri takes her and places her next to Victoria's mangled form, and she fixes her.

And Amy immediately goes back to how she was before. Her power could do anything, she could to whatever she wanted, if she let herself. That's literally what she tells Jessica Yamada.

The turning point only comes when Hunter titans, removing any chance of Amy fixing her ever again.

--------------

I think these are all character traits that are consistent between Worm and Ward. Her constant struggle with having almost absolute power, her unwillingness to own up to things she did, and an ability to warp the facts to paint herself as the victim.
