All your unnervingly accurate predictions in We've Got Worm clearly influenced the course of the story in Worm too. How else could you have known what would happen?

The only explanation is that Wildbow is a time-traveller and listened to WGW while writing Worm, therefore all the bad stuff in Worm is your fault. /s
