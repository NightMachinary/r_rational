It's deeply uncharitable and a mischaracterization of both what I believe and what I've actually publicly said on the topic of world-building in the past. This post paints me as some sort of monster who looks down upon anyone who doesn't like the same things I do. It's just not true. LHC clearly doesn't like me. That's a bummer and I don't really understand why, but there doesn't seem to be much I can do about it.

Do I emphasize character moments over world building in my analysis? Yes, because I find one thing more interesting to talk about than the other. Do I think it's bad to have different priorities in your approach to fiction? Of course not! Everyone has a lens through which they observe a story. I can only talk about it through mine.

But more importantly, I think this idea is also incredibly unfair to the author. Wildbow knows and understands more about storytelling than I ever will. Regardless of what anyone thinks of the successes or failures of this most recent story, I think he's proven that he's a truly brilliant writer.

It's ok to not like the book, but to assume that my show (which I can assure you is not nearly as big as people seem to think it is) and me specifically somehow singlehandedly caused the author to abandon all his understanding of storytelling, world-building, character and plot to chase after what *I* most enjoy about narrative is giving me way too much credit and not giving him nearly enough.
