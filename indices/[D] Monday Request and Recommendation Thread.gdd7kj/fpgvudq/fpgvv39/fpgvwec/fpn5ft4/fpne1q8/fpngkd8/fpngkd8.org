Maybe I'm reading too much into it, maybe I'm jaded but my take is not that he cannot improve but that he give up on improving.

Post-apocalyptic setting doesn't feel post-apocalyptic? "It's ok, I didn't wanted tell this kind of story." City doesn't make sense? "It's ok, don't look too much into it." Numbers don't make sense? "I'm bad at numbers so it's ok." Story drags and it's boring? "I need lay groundwork so it can be boring. It's ok!" And so on.

From Worm through Pact and Twig to Ward, Wildbows writing got better and worse at the same time. He is better writer but he indulgences his vices more.
