LiteralHeadCannon stated that Worm was a "strong argument" for "garden-style" writing. I don't see it that way specifically because of this.

Allow me to paraphrase Grothendieck (/the/ mathematician of the 20th century):

  I can illustrate [my approach] with the same image of a nut to be opened. The first analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better, and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months---when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado!

I wish wdbw wasn't so die-hard on always churning out content. He's going to burn himself out. I don't even mean the "not enjoying work" type of burnout, he's simply going to start committing more and more literary sins as a necessary consequence.

It's simply impossible to create something like Worm at the pace that he /appeared/ to have created Worm.

Double that if he keeps giving a shit what people think of his work. I don't want to harp on him, but its been obvious from reading his reddit posts that he takes some things *way* too personally. Examples: Sleeper, Browbeat, Parian's true power, "how far are we into the story" questions, [[https://www.deviantart.com/lonsheep/art/Parian-s-True-Power-735083730][the "low effort" art debacle]], etc.

Its human, but its clear that his relationship with the fandom is ultimately not good for him or for his fans.
