  Worm was a second draft of years of work.

I think this is a thing people are probably underestimating. Web fiction is, in general, gets much less editing that traditional published stuff. Look at, for example, the absolutely rampant spelling errors in /A Practical Guide to Evil/. Your first draft is never your best draft, so it is entirely unsurprising that going from your pet project you work-shopped over years to something you're putting out in close to real time results in a drop in quality.
