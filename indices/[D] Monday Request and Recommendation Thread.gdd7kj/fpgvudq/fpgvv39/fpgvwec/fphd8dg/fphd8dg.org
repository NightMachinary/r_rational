I didn't really like Pact, but it was still better than Twig, which in turn seems to be better than Ward? The fact that the author appears to be getting worse with each story would not suggest that he has hit a dip, but rather that he struck gold at first and has not been able to replicate it.

In fact it's a little strange to see you contrast the sensible world building of Worm and suggest Ward was in some ways a reaction to that, when Pact felt like wildbow was deliberately trying to do an anti-Worm. Pact is a world where nothing makes sense, its impossible to predict how things will play out based on facts you have and there is constant arbitrary bullshit to explain how the plot proceeds. I should mention that the story was always presented with this upfront, so my comments might read harsher than they intend; wildbow is ultimately able to weave his story around this restriction in Pact. Still, a frustrating read.

Twig was just fucking interminable
