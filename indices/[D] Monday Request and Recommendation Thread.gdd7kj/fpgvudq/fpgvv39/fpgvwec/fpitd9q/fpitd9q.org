Worm also had bad worldbuilding. It's described as excellent for these reasons:

• All-time great power system with endless interesting supers

• Genuinely threatening kaiju

• Taylor, which the entire quality of the story swings on. Taylor made the story great, I don't think anybody should be surprised that a story about a lesser character wouldn't be as good. She's brilliantly written and still holds up.

• Continuous escalation of stakes

It wrote check after check that I knew would come due in any subsequent work set in the canon. Sounds like that's exactly what happened.
