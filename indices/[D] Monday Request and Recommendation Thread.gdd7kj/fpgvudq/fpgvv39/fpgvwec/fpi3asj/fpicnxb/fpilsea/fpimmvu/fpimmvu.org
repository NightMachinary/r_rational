You do you. In the end, I liked Ward more than I liked Worm. I don't feel like the ending felt cheap or dues-ex or that it recons Worm's ending in any way. But I'm not going to sit here and try to convince someone I don't know to do something they have no interest in doing. If you get around to it, I hope you enjoy it, if not, well, I guess it doesn't matter.
