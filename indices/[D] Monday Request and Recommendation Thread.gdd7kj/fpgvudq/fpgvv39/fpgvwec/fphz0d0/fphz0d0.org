  It's as though a long time ago, the author internalized someone's advice that he shouldn't write about rape, but it somehow got contorted into being a mere taboo on the word, or of getting too direct about it, and not on things like /writing a protagonist whose character revolves around the time she was raped./

He's actually been like this since worm. "No, the Merchants were after Charlotte's clothes" e.t.c, e.t.c.

It's this idea that writing about it is the sign of being a bad or tacky writer because usually, it's done terribly. This is the first time he's not couched it in metaphor in any of his works and he still doesn't use the word.

Spoilers for Pact: Pact is 100 times worse about this issue. He'll hate how much of a backing away from a heavy subject it feels like, especially when it's so central to the MC.
