Ward is the kind of story where its final boss is Super-Saiyan Contessa trying to blow up the Earth, and that final boss is defeated by the always-right protagonist having a clever plan that's only clever by author fiat and looks suspiciously like exactly what Super-Saiyan Contessa would want her to do. Thinker powers only exist as tools of author fiat, even when they're in Super-Saiyan form.

Ward is the kind of story that spends its last arc trying as hard as possible to convince the audience that the protagonist's final stroke of brilliance is pulling a fucking Jonestown and persuading or "persuading" hundreds of people to simultaneously cease existing. It accomplishes this by spending tens of thousands of words having the protagonist say things like "it sure sucks that my plan to beat Giga-Contessa is to kill myself and make hundreds of other people kill themselves too, but it's just gotta be done" and "say, you there, have you agreed to my Offing Yourself Plan yet? it's vitally important that you give up on life and die immediately, even if I have to force you!" and "whelp, what I'm doing is like a cross between the way Hitler committed genocide and the way Hitler killed himself, hmm, oh well, still gotta do it", while having other people say things like "aw, geez, Victoria, I don't want to die, also, I'm a big mean uglyface" and "okay, I guess I'm really depressed lately, so it's probably okay if you throw me on the suicide pile" and "I'm trans and really dissatisfied with my body so totally, go for it, it is okay for me to die". The author was then absolutely dumbfounded that people straightforwardly interpreted the text as written, and didn't telepathically pick up on the moon logic he'd actually intended wherein all of the words meant different and unrelated things and just what the fuck am I even reading why did we do this

So, uh, anyway, he quickly ran some damage control where he immediately clarified what the plan actually was in the very next chapter, and, surprise, it was yet another in Ward's long line of tremendous anticlimaxes. Whoopee. The final anticlimax, actually, which was what finally broke me and turned me over to Team Ward Bad.

Ward is the kind of story where I only gave it so much credit and read it through all the way to the end because I had so much deep respect for Worm, and Ward is the kind of story that retroactively makes me respect Worm less, like it was some kind of fluke, or maybe I was even delusional to think it was so good. I still love Worm, I'd still argue its merits, and it's still reshaped me in many ways that are arguably for the better, but Ward is the kind of story that makes me regret that I ever read Worm, because it led me to spend two and a half years of my life hanging on every word of Ward, which, in retrospect, as a complete picture, is shit. If you read it now, you would be bingeing it, not incorporating it into your regular routine, so it wouldn't be quite as heavy of a blow to you, but still:

Ward is the kind of story that makes me feel a moral obligation to warn others about it, to dissuade others from making the same mistake I did by wasting my life and mind reading it.

Although he didn't frame it as negatively as I am here - he discusses a mix of positives and negatives, which I think is fair - in [[https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2020/05/03/ward-off-a-retrospective-on-a-sequel/][Wildbow's retrospective post on Ward]], he seems to acknowledge it as primarily a failure; he accurately recounts many reasons that the story turned out as badly as it did. I think that that's a very good thing. It gives hope that /Ward/ is the fluke - that Wildbow /is/ still a great writer, coming out of a horrible period, and that he will write great works again. That the dream of Worm isn't dead, that the bad habits that made Ward Ward aren't permanent atrophy of Wildbow's writing skill, and may even be cast off immediately.

If you're a Worm fan with time on your hands and you're sad that you have nothing to read, I present this recommendation to you: if you haven't yet, read [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/][Pact]]. I'm less than halfway through it, but I started a little while back, and it's wonderful. It's scratching an itch for me, a Worm-like itch, that Ward never did. It doesn't seem to me that its poor reputation is at all merited; any criticism you've heard about it is either wrong ("it doesn't care about its characters") or a good thing ("for some reason it keeps being exciting"). The end of Ward was enough of a mess that it derailed my readthrough of Pact, draining me of the mental/emotional energy required to read another story simultaneously. But now that Ward's over, I'll resume Pact in the next couple of days. I'm quite excited for it. Given what Wildbow has said about his enthusiasm for writing in the world of Pact, I'm excited that his next project is set there, too - although I think I won't read it until it's finished, and given that it'll apparently be a shorter work than usual for Wildbow, that shouldn't be too difficult.

TL;DR: read Pact, not Ward
