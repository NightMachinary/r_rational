What about the criticism of Pact that it is relentlessly, inescapably depressing to the point that the most the character achieves is dying while /only/ the town he lives in is destroyed? And yes, I realize the in-story reasons why this would happen - but to me this just means that the setup for Pact is chosen in a way that its eventual conclusion is inescapable, and predictably, it is not escaped. The story is literally saved by the barest of margins by throwing in a character that is too relentlessly happy to be ground down into depression by the time the story ends, then turning him into a bird before he can break completely. At some point the main character gains a new trauma that /invalidates a previous trauma/ because their life story is so full of traumas that you literally can't add trauma without colliding with the trauma that's already there. (I think this is where it crossed into farce, for me - Wildbow literally had to put the MC into a superposition of traumas to fit more trauma in!) I don't get how this is supposed to be fun, and I regret finishing it.
