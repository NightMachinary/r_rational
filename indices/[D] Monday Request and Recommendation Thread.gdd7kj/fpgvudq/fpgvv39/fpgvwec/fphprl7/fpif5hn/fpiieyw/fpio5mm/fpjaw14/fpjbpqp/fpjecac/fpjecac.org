I mean, yeah, that was exaggerated and you're right. But he does, in a way, grow through the experience. More importantly, his narrative progress is coupled to his physical progress. If Frodo stayed in roughly the same location all books, like if he kept making emotional sacrifices to defend the Shire and then in the end had to destroy the Shire to stop one of Sauron's lieutenants, the series would have a very different tone. Maybe a more realistic one, but certainly a less adventurous one.
