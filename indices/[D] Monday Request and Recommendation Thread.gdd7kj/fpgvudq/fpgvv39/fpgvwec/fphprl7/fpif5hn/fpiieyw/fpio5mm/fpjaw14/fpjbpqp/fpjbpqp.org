That's not really a fair assessment of LotR. Frodo goes through enormous personal struggle. He may not have been literally bodily maimed and mutilated, but he risks and gives up everything to try to get the ring to Mordor. Every step of the way he has to fight against the temptation of the ring whispering in his mind. And remember, he /fails/ in the end. He /is/ consumed by the ring, and the world is only saved because Gollum had been following along.
