  I'm less than halfway through it, but I started a little while back, and it's wonderful

I absolutely loved the first half of pact, but I felt like it sort of fell apart in the last half. Combat was designed to be very hand-wavey in Pact, and it really hurt the tension when things came down to the wire. It's all explained in canon, but it's about as satisfying as 'The force guided you' imo. Especially egregious when high tension plot items revolve around it (Which is not always, but often).
