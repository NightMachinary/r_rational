Oh, don't get me wrong, in no way is it the fans' fault even if it is true. Wildbow does a good job of taking on the responsibility of being a writer in his retrospective. The only thing I would call influential enough to have had an impact and be responsible for it is We've Got Ward, because they shaped the discourse around the work. Wildbow is entirely responsible for his writing decisions.
