> If Wildbow thought that every potential meaning of the word accurately conveyed the idea of his story, then he would not have changed the name.

He changed it after /a single chapter/ despite having worked on the story for six months before publishing. On this point, I think we can be pretty sure that Poof was his first choice for Reasons. It is hard for me - actually, impossible for me to believe that he spent that much time developing the story but came up with a more appropriate title within a two-day period after posting the first chapter. That would be extraordinary.

> Those kinds of false impressions can easily put people off of reading a story - even people who would otherwise turn out to be avid fans, many of whom might even have turned out to be good fans by your standards, i.e. not the kind with opinions that you judgmentally disparage as "low quality low involvement."

​

You can say I'm harsh, but is there anything false about what I said? You're talking about readers who aren't familiar with his work and probably haven't read the story (low involvement) making judgments based on a passing glance at the title (low quality). As a long-time fan of his, I of course prefer that he sticks to the artistic vision he had from the onset. I understand what you mean that he may alienate new viewers. Many, many decisions could alienate new viewers though, and it's up to a confident author to be alright with that. You won't grab every new reader. And you shouldn't, because you can't please everyone, and we wouldn't want the product to be diluted.

I looked a bit deeper into his reasoning, and WB said that as a heterosexual man he does not feel comfortable making a stand here. I respect that.

​

All that being said, feels like I'm writing a lot of words over something I recognize is pretty insignificant. Just wanted to point out to the OP of this line of thread that there was an ironic supporting point to one of his major criticisms after he was finished with his review.
