Since Poof was his first choice we can be rather confident that it was the best title to represent the story.

False impression? Do you think anyone who reads Wildbow's work will think his title is intended to be a slur? That the work is titled as such because it features a gay character? If so, this is the exact type of low quality low involvement fan “criticism” that WB shouldn't let affect his work.
