Notice I said "potential readers." That includes random people who might see Wildbow's stories listed at TopWebFiction, or have the story recommended to them by existing fans. "Fan criticism" probably doesn't even come into play: what's important for drawing in new readers is whether the initial uninformed impression catches and holds their interest.

Some might wonder if it's intended as a slur. Some might wonder if the author is intentionally playing with double meanings, writing an urban fantasy story as a thinly veiled allegory about the experience of being a homosexual. Those kinds of false impressions can easily put people off of reading a story - even people who would otherwise have turned out to be avid fans, many of whom might even have turned out to be /good/ fans by your standards, i.e. not the kind with opinions that you judgmentally disparage as "low quality low involvement."

At this point Wildbow is an experienced author. He understands the importance of choosing words that accurately convey what he /intends/ to convey.

Which brings us back to your first sentence:

  Since Poof was his first choice we can be rather confident that it was the best title to represent the story.

If Wildbow thought that every potential meaning of the word accurately conveyed the idea of his story, then he would not have changed the name.
