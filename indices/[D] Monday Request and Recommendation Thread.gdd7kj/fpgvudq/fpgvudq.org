This is an upsetting post to write; I've been procrastinating starting it for a couple of hours. For a couple of years of my life, it would have horrified me to learn that I would wind up writing this post. I intend this post as a public service, not as an act of spite. This is a strong disrecommendation of a work by an author I greatly admire.

Ward, the long-awaited sequel to the classic web serial Worm, finally ended early on Sunday morning. *I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone read Ward.* Spoilers abound for both Worm and Ward.

The most positive thing I can say about Ward, in the context of a recommendation, is that if you're a Worm superfan with lots of time on your hands and you're desperate for more canonical source material to draw off of, well, okay, it makes sense to read Ward the same way it makes sense to read Weaverdice sourcebooks. You'll probably want to pick and choose which aspects you take from it, though, because Ward isn't a good story. It's awful, in the sense that it inspires awe how badly it fails as a story. It has many good little snippets of ideas, but it has no idea how to put them together into a functioning, coherent whole.

It's baffling coming from an author whose breakout work, Worm, left me under the impression that he's among the greatest storytellers of our time. People have various complaints about Worm, and some are legitimate criticism that would ideally be fixed in a future draft. But these problems are all small, petty, easy to work past to appreciate a well-told epic. They're /nothing/ in comparison to the problems that define and pervade Ward. Ward's problems aren't subjective quibbles with how clearly some scene was written. They're basic errors in the writing process, problems that create other problems everywhere, problems that touch everything else in the story, problems that have metastasized to the story's outline and style. The story is fundamentally and fractally half-baked.

Because I had so much faith in the author, thanks to Worm, I was not one of the many people who left early on. Although there are strange and unwise choices made even in Ward's introductory pitch, I don't think the people who left early on were right to do so, at least not for the most part. Early conversations on Ward were dominated by misguided and flatly wrong complaints. For example, there are problems with Ward's choice of protagonist, but her specific identity isn't one of them - she's a finely-sketched character, and the hatred certain sectors of the fandom had for her from the start was ridiculous and frankly pathological. So I stuck with the story, all the way through. I gave the author credit. I enjoyed the good parts, and I gave the bad parts the benefit of the doubt. But by the last quarter of the story, it became obvious that, as a whole, it wasn't going to come together quite right, and in the last few weeks I realized that it was actually going to be capital-B Bad, not just substantially suboptimal.

The real glaring problem with Ward's choice of protagonist, incidentally, /is that she's a returning character from Worm at all/. That sets a tone. Of course a Worm sequel would feature some returning characters, but Ward doesn't just feature some returning characters. It features /mostly/ returning characters. Any arbitrary character who appears in an important role is likely to be a returning Worm character. There are brilliant new characters and ideas all over the place - but they're subservient to the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfJRm0WssOE][nostalgic fan service]]. It may sound strange to make this complaint about a sequel, but Ward isn't the kind of sequel that follows the same protagonist and concerns itself primarily with continuing the same character arcs. It's another epic written in the same setting, a sequel for the /world/. But Ward doesn't have a serious interest in that world; it has a serious interest in throwing things we know at us.

The world /ended/ in the last act of Worm. Ward is a post-apocalyptic story. But Ward doesn't /want/ to be a post-apocalyptic story. It wants to be reheated Worm leftovers, and it doesn't particularly care that Worm's setting was already torn down and replaced by something entirely new; it has no interest in developing or exploring the world in which it's set. Its story beats are exactly the same kind of story beats that Worm had, likely because many of them are literally unused notes from Worm. It reuses them all the same, drawing no meaningful distinction between before and after /the fucking apocalypse/, as an event in characters' lives. We hear it said explicitly that the apocalypse killed something like 90% of humans and something like 99% of parahumans. But the actual story certainly doesn't act like it; /the fucking apocalypse/ never stands in the way of bringing a character back from Worm. Even among those characters that Ward newly introduces, almost all of them are primarily defined by trauma they underwent /before the fucking apocalypse/. It's unusual and noteworthy for characters to have dead loved ones, in a setting that, even /before/ the fucking apocalypse, had Endbringers and similar threats that were introduced as routinely killing large fractions of the superheroes (stakes that, in retrospect, seem essentially arbitrary and made of cardboard).

In the first few arcs of Ward, it set up numerous conflicts, threads, and questions that made good use of the setting it inherited from Worm. But somewhere early on, Ward got into its head that worldbuilding is masturbatory nonsense for rationalist nerds (which is a shame, because Wildbow excels at it when he's trying, which he usually is), so it dropped all of these threads; nothing was honestly examined or went anywhere. Instead, Ward concerns itself first and foremost with characterization. That's the defense that Ward's proponents generally give, that the issues with every aspect of the actual story are immaterial, because it's such a good character piece and that's what it was trying to be. But I'm going to say something that I think would surprise a lot of people: /Ward's characterization is not any better than Worm's./ (In fact, it's meaningfully worse.) It spends more time doing it, and that's not the same thing. An addict's house may be full of syringes, but that doesn't mean she's better at using them than a nurse. Ward spends much of its nearly two-million word (!) duration on highly introspective internal monologues and inane navel-contemplating small-talk between characters; after a point, it's just polishing something it's already completely worn away. The excess time spent on characterization directly takes time and thought away from worldbuilding, which in turn directly undermines that same characterization - any person exists in a world, and Ward effectively doesn't have a setting at all, instead operating on vague context-free feelings, moon logic, and authorial fiat.

This is an aside, but I blame a large part of Ward's disdain for worldbuilding (also known as "being set in a world that attempts to make sense") on Doof! Media. In the months running up to the start of Ward, a popular liveblog-type podcast called "We've Got Worm" sprung up and became extremely influential in the parts of the fandom closest to Wildbow; he even became a frequent listener and participant in the post-podcast discussions. It was well-produced and well-done all around, and in a very difficult-to-replicate way, it brought a fresh perspective and fascinating analysis to Worm. But the host responsible for much of this, Scott Daly, was very much of the mindset "well, I don't care about worldbuilding, because I'm not some fucking nerd, I'm here for all that other good stuff in writing, like character arcs". That's a valid lens for an individual reader to take in a project like that, but Wildbow wound up hearing a /lot/ of Scott. I mean, the guys make a long professional podcast devoted entirely to relentlessly praising a particular artist; it's not a surprise that the artist would wind up hearing a lot of it. And then, when Ward started, the We've Got Worm guys moved onto Ward, and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect, I love this unconditionally, you're so good at characters, your shit is golden, but we don't care about worldbuilding, Wildbow, I love this, we don't care about worldbuilding at all, we're not fucking nerds, Wildbow, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all..."

I don't think it was ever quite fair to label Worm "rational fiction", because that's not a label the author selected, but in contrast to Worm, Ward is as far from the virtues of rational fiction as a story can possibly get. Characters' motivations exist only in isolation; characters can't have interesting plans to achieve their goals because there's no real framework in which such plans could exist or make sense. Effectively every important antagonist is a strawman, not a real person, and when they have a point, the story sees that as a mistake and corrects it as soon as possible by adding complications to make them unlikable and obviously wrong.
