Perhaps BB only felt so tied to the world because I've never been to the US, but it is /internally/ consistent. It makes sense that people would build a city like that. Wildbow even has a map of the city on worm's website.

But I agree about the other places, I loved Earth Shin's setting with the weird architecture and the strange fashion, as well as the foreign modes of discussion. Wish Wildbow would tell us more about the story he wanted to write that would follow a Parahuman in Goddess' employ.
