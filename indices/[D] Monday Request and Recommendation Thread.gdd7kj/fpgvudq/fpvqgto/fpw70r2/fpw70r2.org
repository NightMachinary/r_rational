Sorry for dumping this wall of text on you, I kinda started writing and then it ran away from me.\\
tl;dr: I definitely felt more grounded in Brockton Bay than I ever felt in the Megacity. But I think that was a deliberate choice by the author.

--------------

In Worm, we spent a lot of time in the city of Brockton Bay. Taylor was connected to it, via her father, who was deeply invested in its docks and the workers there. Later, she came to run her own territory. We know stuff about the city's infrastructure, the trainyards, the docks, and an airport are mentioned. Through all this, we learned a lot about the layout, the geography, the history of the place. Wildbow even told us about the demographics, the shifting landscape of gang influence, and the effect the economic downturn had.

And, crucially, since Earth Bet is "basically the same" as our world, where we don't get any explicit word from the author, we can assume the world is the same as ours. Brockton Bay will have a collection of smaller towns and villages surrounding it, where people grow food, which is processed somewhere and shipped to the town. Steel is probably produced in Detroid(?), computers come from Silicon Valley. It all /makes sense/.

--------------

In Ward, I couldn't tell you /anything/ about the layout of the Megacity. Granted, it's spread over multiple dimensions with portals making normal traversal dangerous to impossible, but still. It's 50 million people, somehow spread along the East Coast of the United States, somehow spanning the distance from north of Boston (where Brockton Bay is /probably/ located) down to New York City, in a single stretch of urban sprawl.\\
I couldn't tell you anything about its infrastructure. The place fundamentally doesn't make sense (more on this later), how did people build skyscrapers in a post-apocalyptic universe? There is no heavy industry to produce steel and concrete in the amounts needed for construction on that scale; there aren't even any mines mentioned. The city doesn't feed itself either, we get explicit mentions of that multiple times. They tried to set up farming communities, but these are currently in open revolt, refusing to sell their wares to the city.

All this has two possible explanations. What LHC seems to believe, is that Wildbow suddenly forgot or stopped to care about how a civilization works. He wanted to write a superhero story, and superheroes need a city to save, and thus he sat down a city onto the green fields, without caring about how it could've gotten there.

There is another explanation, and even though it's more complicated and somewhat handwavy, and which I nonetheless prefer, is that it was a deliberate choice by Wildbow. What I think it comes down to is this: Wildbow wanted to protray a society where everyone had gone through heavy trauma. Out of 500 million people in Northern America, only 50 million are left. On average, every person in there has lost 90% of their social circle. Sure, in practise it's probably unevenly distributed because people were evacuated together while some places were just annihilated alltogether, but still. Noone made it through Gold Morning without losing /someone/.

In the aftermath of that trauma, people wanted nothing so much as to go back to how things were before. That is a common reaction to trauma, people trying to pretend it didn't happen, or that it happened but it's over now. And that's why they built a facade of a 21st century American city, with fast food and skyscrapers. Corners were cut, infrastructure was neglected, and hundreds of thousands had to live in tent cities during winter, but they had a City to look forward to.

Of course, just as trying to forget your trauma instead of dealing with it is unhealthy, the city was never viable. Food shortages even with regular aid from neighboring worlds, riots over labour rights, no clear law system, rising tensions between capes and normal people... The city could never have worked out, even if all the transdimensional threats hadn't been there.

--------------

There are also parallels with our main character: Victoria is projecting a calm, collected facade, even though she's such a mess that just /thinking/ about certain topics will lead to her spacing out for minutes, to such a degree that other people notice.

Just like the main characters, just like society itself, the city had to go through a long, arduous, and painful process of acceptance and recovery. Humans made their peace with capes, collectively forgiving them for their failings We end the story with people mostly abandoning the idea of the Megacity, and moving into smaller settlements, which might eventually become self-sufficient.

The aforementioned sense of disconnection, of floating in the void, which this description of the city created in the reader, is something Victoria experiences a lot. She often comments on the fact that, as a flier, she is mostly isolated from many of the problems that plague common people, like traffic and portals cutting off regions and the armed bands of looters. Victoria's connection to the "normies" faces a lot of challenges through the story, it's why we have [[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormMemes/comments/e36h1s/i_did_not_feel_much_bad_about_that_guy/f91w5pf/][this hilarious list]] of "Victoria, Cape Dictator" jokes.

That's why the end of Ward is so perfect, suicide implications aside.: It puts a capstone on not just our main character's story arc, but it also ties off the /other/ half of this world.

In short, the city being an illogical, impossible potemkin village was a deliberate choice to mirror our main character's
