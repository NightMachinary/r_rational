It's not dead but it is stalled. The bits that are out are thoroughly satisfying and have excellent characters and worldbuilding. The central mystery is a little frustrating to have unsolved and the conflict (between the Steerswomen and the Wizards) which begins to come to a head as a result of the story is a little frustrating to have unresolved. But the books can each stand alone; it's a series, but like the Vorkosigan series, not like Kingkiller or A Song of Ice and Fire.
