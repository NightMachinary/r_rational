[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45309582-shorefall][Shorefall]], the second book of the Founders trilogy (sequel to [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside][Foundryside]]), came out a bit over a week ago. I recommend it fairly strongly. It's kind of a fantasy/cyberpunk hybrid that touches on some interesting ideas, with a very interesting magic system.

One thing I did dislike somewhat was Sancia's powers. While overall the magic system is strong, I felt they sometimes seemed like "here is this problem I made up, see how she is clever for finding the solution I made up". Kind of a Sanderson's Law violation, I guess?. But that wasn't enough to impede my enjoyment, and by the climax of the story I wasn't noticing it anymore.
