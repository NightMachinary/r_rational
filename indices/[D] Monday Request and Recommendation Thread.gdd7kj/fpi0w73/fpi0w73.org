It might be a bit of an unusual recommendation here, but I think that the [[https://imgur.com/a/ySBGPST][Bowsette Saga]] is a pretty good read. Before the story starts, Bowser from the Mario games has been turned into Bowsette where she experienced love thanks to Mario. This story is about her emotional/philosophical struggle to accept that she can deserve love and while I wouldn't call this rational, it's a great story about her journey to find self-acceptance. Of course, the original gender warping magic is still out of control....

If anyone else has similar recommendations that mix philosophical concerns with romance, I would love to hear about them! I already know about /Worth the Candle/ and /Erogamer/ though.
