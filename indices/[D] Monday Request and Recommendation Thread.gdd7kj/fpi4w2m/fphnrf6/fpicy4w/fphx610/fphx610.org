I stumbled across a fun cultivation / system Isekai fic: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31837/everybody-here-is-a-cultivation-idiot][Everybody here is a cultivation idiot]]

It's more fun and enthusiastic than rational, though it does kinda deconstruct and semi-justify the common trope of "why was the Isekai protag the first person to think of doing something obvious" - because, well, in this case it's something of a cultivation MMO, and these "obvious" things are built-in methods for PC equivalents to quickly gain power. Also, it hasn't been explicitly stated, but I'm pretty sure the system makes the NPCs slightly stupid (and hence the title).

One downside: everyone (and I mean everyone) seems to talk like a texting zoomer. The narration is lackadaisical but ok (the author needs to learn that not everything you worked out for the system needs to be put to paper), but the dialogue reminds me of what happens when people start speaking in Twitter memes.
