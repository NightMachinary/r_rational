[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][/The Traitor Baru Cormorant/]] by Seth Dickinson.

It's hard fantasy about an administrator from The Empire, sent to pacify a messy country of rebellious dukes, but secretly trying to unite them against the empire.

Deals a lot with the coordination problems inherent in a rebellion, the "traitor's qualm" (everybody wants the rebellion to succeed but nobody will join unless it's a sure thing, and it can't be a sure thing if nobody joins).
