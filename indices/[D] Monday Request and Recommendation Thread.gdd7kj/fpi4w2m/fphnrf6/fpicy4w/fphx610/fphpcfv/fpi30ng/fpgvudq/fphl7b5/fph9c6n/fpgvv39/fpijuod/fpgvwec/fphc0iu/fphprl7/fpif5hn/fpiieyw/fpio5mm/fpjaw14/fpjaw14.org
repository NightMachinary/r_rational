Sure, but adventure books about relentless and continuous self-sacrifice I feel are pretty rare. Like, take Lord of the Rings. You'd assume that's a story of sacrifice, and it is. Its tiny protagonists full of heart and poor in skill and strength go up against the biggest military power on the continent, and they get ... a painful scar out of it. In exchange they destroy an ancient evil. That's my calibration for the normal level of sacrifice. Pact is a story where the lead sacrifices and keeps sacrificing and then sacrifices some more and in exchange the outcome is barely kept from being massively worse than the status quo. The place we end up is the place we started except a few steps back. It's an anti-adventure; or rather, it's adventure in such massive headwind that you leave your house on page 1 and barely manage to reenter your garden fence (so you can blow up your house) by page 1000.
