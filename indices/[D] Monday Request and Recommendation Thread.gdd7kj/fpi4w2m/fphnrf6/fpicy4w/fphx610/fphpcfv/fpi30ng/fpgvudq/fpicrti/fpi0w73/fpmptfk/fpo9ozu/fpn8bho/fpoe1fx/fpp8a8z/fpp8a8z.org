I've read a couple GGK books, (Under Heaven, River of Stars, Tigana, Lions of Al-Rassan), but I haven't read those two.

I'll be sure to check out Sarantine Mosaic then. Surprisingly enough I've actually never heard Sarantine Mosiac or its sequel. I'll check it out for sure since you rate it so highly.
