The Wild Cards series is better-worldbuilt than Worm by a mile and better-written by an astronomical unit. AKA "the series GRRM really wants to get back to rather than finish ASoIaF". It's also unusual for being almost entirely mosaic novels; more integrated than short story collections but with various authors (GRRM and his old RPG group; he was the GM and is the editor) writing different pieces. The early books are a series of trilogies; the first two books of each trilogy are primarily setting pieces, consisting of vignettes about various characters which also set up the conflict and circumstances in the background, and the third brings the conflict to a head and has almost all the chapters pointed toward the climax and resolution. The series has always taken place in real time, so the lengthy pause (1990-2008, IIRC) and rebooted series changed a lot about the world (and the writers); it's not quite as good.
