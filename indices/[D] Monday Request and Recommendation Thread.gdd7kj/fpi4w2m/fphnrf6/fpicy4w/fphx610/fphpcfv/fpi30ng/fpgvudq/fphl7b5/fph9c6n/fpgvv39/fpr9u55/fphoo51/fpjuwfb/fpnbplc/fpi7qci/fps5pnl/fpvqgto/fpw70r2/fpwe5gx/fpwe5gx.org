Brockton Bay never felt grounded to me. It always felt like this weird otherspace pegged onto the US. Its location is uncertain, the layout of its titular bay relative to the ocean confusing, and its origins infeasible given its absence in Bet and the lack of need for an additional city that size in that area.

I think BB is well built as a scene in itself rather than a part of a well-built world, but Ward had lots of well-built scenes like Hollow Point, the Fallen settlement, Earth Nun.

But even if you call BB good worldbuilding it's only the focus in the first half of Worm, and once you're out of it it's like it's not even there anymore.

Whenever we left the City in Ward, it always felt like it was still there connected because a lot of effort went to talking about how it was physically and diplomatically tied to the other Earths and different parts of Gimel.
