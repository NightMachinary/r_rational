  Is the bar to recommending a work that you were completely satisfied by it and it could not have been better

Bit of an unfair take to make out of everything he said isn't it?

You don't have to be completely satisfied with something for it to be worth recommending, but usually just having 'cool ideas' doesn't cut it. You're recommending a book, so the /story/ itself has to be good or at least decent for you, even more so here where the work being discussed is /over twice as long as the entirety of the Harry Potter series./
