[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-countess-worm-the-count-of-monte-cristo-fusion-1815-au.813386/][The Countess]] is a fusion of Worm and The Count of Monte Cristo. Basically, it's using people and organizations from Worm (and at least one from Ward) to play out a slightly different version of The Count of Monte Cristo.

The politics, which talk about post-Napoleonic France, are a not-unimportant side plot.
