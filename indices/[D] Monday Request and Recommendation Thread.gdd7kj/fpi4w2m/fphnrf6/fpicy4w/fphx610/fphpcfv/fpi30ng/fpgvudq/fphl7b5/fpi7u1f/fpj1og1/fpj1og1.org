Yes, but the /specifics/ of those changes is what I'm talking about and what the OP is jumping on. The only concrete admission he makes of something being changed is the therapy and some worldbuilding being neglected in response to criticisms about pacing. I'm not saying that's the only thing that got changed, I'm saying that's the only thing you can /point to/ and say "That there? That only happened because he was listening to fans."

The OP makes bold, sweeping claims about things being all the fault of how fans reacted and him listening to them too much (such as the one fake-out death), but there is /no evidence/ for those claims aside from an admission by Wildbow that he thinks he listened too much and did make SOME adjustments as a result. You can't blame anything you didn't like on the fans, nor can you say how much or what specifically got changed, excepting that therapy and worldbuilding fell by the wayside due to pacing concerns. Anything more than that is pure speculation.

If anybody has criticisms with the story they should feel welcome to make those known, but to wrap those criticisms in some bullshit narrative about how "the fans made him do it" is both deceptive and insulting. He wrote the damn story, if you don't like what he wrote then say that, but don't say the reason you don't like it is because he can't make decisions for himself when that's just not true.
