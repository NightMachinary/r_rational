It's common knowledge to people who are familiar with British colloquialisms, which would include many people who happen to have read books that feature British characters or watched shows/movies about Brits.

It makes sense for an author to choose a name that best represents his story, rather than end up with one that has a high chance of giving a false impression to many potential readers.
