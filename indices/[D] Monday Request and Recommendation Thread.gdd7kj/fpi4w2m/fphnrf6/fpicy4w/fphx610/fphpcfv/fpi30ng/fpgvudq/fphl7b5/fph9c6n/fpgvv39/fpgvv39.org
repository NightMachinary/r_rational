That's not to say that there's no talent on display in Ward. Wildbow is still Wildbow, as depressing as it is to see that he's capable of failing so catastrophically at the thing he's known for, telling a story. There are many fascinating and/or entertaining elements in Ward, both fresh ones and recycled ones from Worm drafts; I usually enjoyed reading it. The main cast is memorable and compelling in the same way that the main cast of Worm was. There are chapters and even whole arcs that could easily be highlights in a much, much better story. But as a story, as a piece of art, it falls flat on its face, continually noncommittally jerking between one stupid and contrived soap-opera-ish and/or shonen-ish plot point and another. In many, many ways, it's the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy of Worm.

There are many lessons to learn from Ward's many failures. Chief among them, though, I think is this: /the writer of a serial must keep the audience at arm's length/. Ward's key problems are all rooted in this: Wildbow either overreacting in one way or another to audience feedback (bending to bad audience feedback, for example, or retaliating against audience feedback), or else being bizarrely oblivious to how something would be read because he'd grown overly reliant on constant audience feedback and his ability to project himself into the head of a reader in advance had apparently atrophied. (Indeed, Ward is /generally/ less concerned with projecting itself into people's heads than Worm - interludes aren't used in the same way, and as was mentioned earlier, antagonists are strangely hollow caricatures.)

There's a dichotomy in writing between "architects", who plan out stories in considerable detail before actually writing them, and "gardeners", who only have a few general ideas for future direction and, for the most part, just see where writing takes them. I've long favored architect-writing over gardener-writing, but Wildbow is, by his own admission, a gardener. I think Worm is an argument in favor of that style of writing; he really makes it work there, building a single strong narrative thread with many strong interwoven threads over the course of an epic despite constant improvisation. Ward, on the other hand, is a strong argument against. The story doesn't know what it's doing. The story doesn't know when it introduces things what it plans to do with them, and because of this, it isn't committed to doing /anything/ with them. And because it's not committed to any plan, it's /particularly/ vulnerable to the gusts of whims of audience feedback.

Ward is the kind of story that mentions its predecessor's protagonist about a dozen times in two million words, even though she dramatically ended her story /as the very public savior of humanity/, because it's afraid that readers will take it the wrong way and assume the old protagonist is coming back and taking over the plot again.

Ward is the kind of story that spends much of its first few arcs setting up a thematically-juicy antagonist faction in a political intrigue story, except that the antagonist is substantially /correct/, and it doesn't like the implications of that, so it gradually demotes them all the way to joke antagonist status, including them in the story's finale only so that they can be publicly defeated via one stupid child losing a public debate with another stupid child, at which point everybody claps, like we're actually reading a straight-up STDH.txt post made to dunk on the opposition or something. Lazy, lazy, lazy. (Incidentally, if you've been suffering through the end of Ward, as I have - can I offer you [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/618861167640576021/704019068188885042/Inspirational_Gimel_Meme.png][a nice meme]] in these trying times?)

Ward is the kind of story that devotes a lot of thematically-central setup early on to the idea that the cute child Tinker teammate is extremely dangerous and deeply unstable, and overworking her is really really bad, both for her and for everyone else. Then, the protagonist spends the entire story overworking the cute child Tinker teammate to solve every single problem in ridiculous deus-ex-machina-y ways, nothing bad ever comes of it, and the protagonist isn't even particularly framed as in the wrong. It's like if the Ghostbusters crossed the streams /all the time/ with no repercussions, except that crossing the streams is horrific child endangerment.

Ward is the kind of story that abandons a central component about a quarter of the way through the story in an attempt to satisfy ambivalent fans, accidentally thematically inverting the entire story, and then proceeds to flounder for the entire rest of the story because it jettisoned a key piece of the story without actually becoming a different story. (I didn't actually find out about this one until the story ended, when Wildbow released his retrospective on it, but it fits well with the pattern I'd already noticed, and more importantly it explains a lot.)

Ward is the kind of story where, in order to fight the popular idea that she's stupid, the protagonist is always right, to the point that she might as well have Tattletale's power in addition to her own, because she's continually coming up with absolutely bullshit transparently unsupported hypotheses that we're supposed to immediately trust as author fiat because they never turn out to be wrong.

Ward is the kind of story that, over and over, like clockwork, gives large-scale story arcs /extremely/ anticlimactic endings, because whiny fans treated tension and stakes as writing flaws and the writer was desperate to win their approval back just for a moment with a cheap quick rush of "yay we finally solved the long-running problem".

Ward is the kind of story that gives a secondary character a dramatic, wonderfully-executed death at the hands of a fresh, fascinating, brilliant antagonist, but then the fans throw a collective bitchfit that pierces the heavens, because the character who died was a fan-favorite from Worm, so he brings the character back a few chapters later, literally doing what a facetious meme had suggested, reasoning that we hadn't seen the body, even though /her death was from the perspective of an alien with local omniscience in charge of blowing her up/. The bullshit-soap-opera-retcon-resurrected fan favorite then proceeds to kill the interesting new antagonist who had originally killed her, in order to secure cheap cathartic revenge on the fandom's behalf.

Ward is the kind of story that brings the supporting cast from the original back a few arcs in, in an attempt to stir up fandom interest, except that it brings them back as antagonists, which contextually makes perfect sense, except that the fandom apparently is really uncomfortable with it, because they always liked sweeping the old supporting cast's severe moral flaws under the rug, so, in a /further/ attempt to suck up to the fandom, the old supporting cast stop being antagonists and completely inexplicably insinuate themselves into the new supporting cast, in a way that is not at all a natural story or character movement but entirely comes down to fanficcy "I want them to be happy and fake-date each other" audience appeal.

Ward is the kind of story that thematically hinges on its protagonist having been raped by a (different) fan favorite character from its predecessor, except that the author is sufficiently squeamish about writing rape that he doesn't realize until about halfway through (a nearly two-million word long story!) that a significant contingent of readers /don't even understand that this or anything like this happened/, to say nothing of the readers who've bought into some excuse for it. By the end of the story, the word "rape" still hasn't been used in-text to describe it, only in out-of-text discussions, even though the story visibly became much heavier-handed about conveying the point. It's as though a long time ago, the author internalized someone's advice that he shouldn't write about rape, but it somehow got contorted into being a mere taboo on the word, or of getting too direct about it, and not on things like /writing a protagonist whose character revolves around the time she was raped/.

Ward is the kind of story where the world is literally physically falling apart, and it seems strangely apropos because the story's narrative coherence is also falling apart. Ward is also the kind of story where the world literally physically falling apart does not matter at all.
