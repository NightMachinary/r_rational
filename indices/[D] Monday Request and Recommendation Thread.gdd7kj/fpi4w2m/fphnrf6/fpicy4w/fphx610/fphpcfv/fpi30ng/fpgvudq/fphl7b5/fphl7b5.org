I think it's really unfair to say that Ward being a more heavily character-driven piece was just because Wildbow was blindly following a flattering podcast. Twig was /entirely/ character driven and was written with the explicit goal of helping him improve at that style of writing, so it seems clear to me that he always intended to write something else that placed a much stronger focus on character relationships and growth.

You're also attributing a great many things to him trying to please the audience when there's no real evidence that's the case for most of them. For example, the specific character death fakeout you cite looks to me like something planned rather than a hasty retcon, especially considering he /does/ talk about how the audience influenced him in his retrospective and he never mentions that incident, nor does he mention doing anything as drastic as a straight up retcon. Not to say the audience didn't influence him, as he very clearly states it did, but my impression was that the audience reaction changed what elements got focus and what fell by the wayside, not that he was rewriting whole plots and characters due to feedback.

You've written... a lot, so I can't really give each of your points the attention they deserve, but I will say that your overall review comes across as hyperbolic, to the point of straying towards personal attacks on both the author and the segments of the fandom you don't like. I understand if Ward wasn't your thing, you're clearly not alone in your view, but there's a difference between something not being to your taste and something being objectively flawed. I feel like you're ascribing a lot of the latter to the story in places and ways where it's very much a stretch (such as your reading of the antagonists, of plot or character inconsistencies, of the protagonists capabilities etc.) merely because the story as a whole turned out not to be to your tastes. I hesitate to say that you're manufacturing flaws, but there are definitely cases (such as the fact that you don't think anything bad ever comes from how Kenzie is handled) where you have to take a VERY warped view of things to make the claims you're making.

And regarding the negative tone of Wildbow's retrospective, I suggest you take a look at his other retrospectives. He tends to be very highly critically of every one of his stories as soon as they're finished, only warming up to them much later on. The tone he strikes here is frankly pretty in line with how he viewed Pact and Twig immediately after finishing them, something that he himself notes. It's really not indicative of the quality of the story at all, it's just the sort of relationship he tends to have with his work.
