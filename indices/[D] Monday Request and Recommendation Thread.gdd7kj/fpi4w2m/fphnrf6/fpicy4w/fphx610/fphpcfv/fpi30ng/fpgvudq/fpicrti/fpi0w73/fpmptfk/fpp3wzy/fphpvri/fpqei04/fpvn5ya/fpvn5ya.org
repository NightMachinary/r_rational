For a xianhuan, it's quite appealing, but I wouldn't go so far as to say "really rational". Eg. in chapter 37, The MC is able to accurately predict the reaction of an elder who he hasn't talked with, which stretches credibility greatly. It implies that the elder is a very 2d character, who contains as much depth as the two pages that are used to describe him.
