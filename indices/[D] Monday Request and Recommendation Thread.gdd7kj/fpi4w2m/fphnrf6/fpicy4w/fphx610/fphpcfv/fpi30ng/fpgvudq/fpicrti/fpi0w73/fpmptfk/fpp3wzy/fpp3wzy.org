Just a reminder to people to try Wandering Inn.

Its stupeondesly (how tf do I spell this word lol) long, updates twice a week with long chapters.

Not very rational or munchkinry or scientific but a good read, treats magic as both cheap cast spells and has moments of True Capital M fullblown Magic.

It's half lit rpg with only levels and skills, no number fudging or grinding thou so its in the sweetspot between boring and unpredictable, skills are awarded on slow progression of class actual expirience, a bit on plot luck, stronger skills come from merit and novel situations.

Cast grows steadily over time and has lots of viewpoints but mostly stays focused on the titular inn and MC Erin. Fun stuff
