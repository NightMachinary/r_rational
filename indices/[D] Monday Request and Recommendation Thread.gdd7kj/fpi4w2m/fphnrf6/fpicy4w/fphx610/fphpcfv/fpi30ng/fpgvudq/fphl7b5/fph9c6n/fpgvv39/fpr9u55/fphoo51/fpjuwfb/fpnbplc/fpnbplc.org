So what you're saying is that Wildbow made the [[https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1131271111373611008][mistake of trying to write a people-centered story]]. That is sad to hear. The original Worm had some of the best plot-driven storytelling I've ever read.

Characterization is a happy byproduct of plot.)
