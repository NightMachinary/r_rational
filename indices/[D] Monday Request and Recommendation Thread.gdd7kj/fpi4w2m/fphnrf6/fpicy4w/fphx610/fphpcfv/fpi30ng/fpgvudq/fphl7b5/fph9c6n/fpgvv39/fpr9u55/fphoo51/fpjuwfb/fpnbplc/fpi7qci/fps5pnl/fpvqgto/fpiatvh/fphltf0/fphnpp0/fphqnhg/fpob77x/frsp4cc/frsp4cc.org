The problem with that is that Worm never hinted that Victoria being dropped next to Amy after Gold Morning would reverse her character arc. It was left as a hopeful ending to Amy and Victoria's story, where after accepting that she is a bad person and what happened is her fault, Amy is given a chance to undo her greatest crime.

Now, if Ward had actually explored the effects of this on her psyche and what it did to her development, then that would be interesting and explain her actions to the readers. Instead, Ward spends about 1,500,000 words pretending that she's the same character as in Worm before revealing how different she really is, and it isn't even until ~95% of the way through the story that we actually get this explanation at all. By this point, it's too late. Not only is it too late, but it actively undermines the ending of Worm (as do many other parts of Ward).

And considering that the second main theme of Ward (after 'recovery/overcoming trauma') is 'taking responsibility and becoming a better person', taking a character who had done exactly that by the end of the first serial and have them throw away all of their character progress so they can serve as an antagonist undermines one of the most significant parts of Ward as well. How are we supposed to laud the main characters for striving to overcome their flaws when we know that they could suddenly throw away everything they've achieved for no viable reason because the plot demands it? How are we supposed to celebrate the victories of the main characters when we know that the main characters of the first serial achieving those same victories just a couple of years earlier were immediately undone so Ward can have some conflict?
