Reading the retrospective, it sounds like a lot of the points that get the most criticism were things Wildbow thought would land one way and, for whatever reason, weren't received as he expected them to be. I don't think that any specific changes were made, other than the ones he explicitly stated in his retrospective, but rather that he wrote the story based on assumptions that didn't pan out. e.g., the "fake-out death" wasn't a retcon, the set-up just didn't come across like he thought it would so the execution fell kind of flat, but it wasn't some hasty reactive change.
