She's part of that community. As I linked above, lintamande has written a shit-ton of glowfic (largely using her cast of FÃ«anorians), including [[https://glowfic.com/boards/18][a big interconnected continuity]] with Alicorn and her Bella.

/At The End of All Things/ and /For the Taking/ are non-glowfic in format but are +both+ inspired by popular glowfic settings.

(e: apparently lintamande wrote At The End before joining Glowfic, so the inspiration goes the other direction on this one.)
