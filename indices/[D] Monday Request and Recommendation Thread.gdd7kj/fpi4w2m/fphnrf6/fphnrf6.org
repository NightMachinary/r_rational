Here's a recommendation: The *Steerswoman* series of books by Rosemary Kirstein.

It starts out starts out looking like a relatively normal fantasy adventure with the first twist being that the main characters are two women, one being from a quasi-rationalist order that are have a spiritual duty to finding and spreading the truth (which includes that they have to answer any question asked of them truthfully, as long as every question they are asked is answered in turn) and a sort of barbarian nomad woman. The second twist is one that most people should pick up after fourty pages and is fairly simple but I won't spoil it because it's still fun and the story only gets better after an interesting perspective shift on the whole setting.
