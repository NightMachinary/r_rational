The very first page has a paragraph-long CORDYCEPS reference, and now I'm not sure if I want to read it. I mean, I love CORDYCEPS and would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat, but the sheer audacity of just, like, copying a paragraph from another story is baffling.

...Or is the author the same?

OH SHIT, THE AUTHOR /IS/ THE SAME. I can see Benedict in the list of people with the doc opened! I have been /craving/ for something from them for the past few weeks, and this subreddit delivered even before I could ask.

THANK YOU!
