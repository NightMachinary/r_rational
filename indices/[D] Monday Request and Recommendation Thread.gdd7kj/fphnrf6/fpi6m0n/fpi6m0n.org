I have not read this book (yet), and cannot personally recommend it (yet), but I want to point out that this book has been recommended on this subreddit at least /four other times/, each by a different person, so it's probably pretty good.

EDIT: Oh, and I /have/ read the Wikipedia plot summary, which sounded pretty good, but that doesn't mean I can say anything re the execution.
