Have you read the /Sarantine Mosaic/ series by Guy Gavriel Kay yet? It's about a grieving artist who is summoned to the imperial city (thinly veiled expy of Constantinople) to work on the newly constructed cathedral. Along the way he becomes embroiled in layers of political and religious drama.

Absolutely beautiful series. My personal favorite from an author who is exceptional in almost everything he has released.
