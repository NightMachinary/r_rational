Continuing my weekly read-along review of Luminosity: up to about Chapter 14. Spoilers below.

--------------

I think between chapters 6 and 14 is when all the Bella-as-human romance stuff happens, and it's pretty bleh, to be honest. That isn't to say it's not realistic and rational: it definitely is, it's just... well, if you were confronted with an attractive person who you know is magically bound to love you forever and can make you immortal, at which point you will be magically bound to love them forever, and you genuinely like them, it's like.... okay, of course you'd go with that.

Not to say I didn't enjoy it, I loved how when she was pretending to be Edward's girlfriend at school she was describing all the things she did and then the line was something like "and then all of a sudden I realised I wasn't pretending anymore". It was really sweet and beautiful.

But I'm still going to whine that there's very little in the way of romantic conflict, and I'm not sure I see them growing and changing. Bella avoids conflict with Edward by being Logical and Rational at the problem ("oh, well, if we can't bone until we're married, I'll put up with it and let's get married ASAP"), which is great, but idk, I don't see growth yet.

There's the whole scene where she was kidnapped by James that I really enjoyed, how she got out of it so cleverly.

But yeah, still loving the book (it's one of my favourites after all), but it's more urban fantasy than romance. I think we're still looking for a good rational romance (though I can and will and continually recommend the TV series /Jane the Virgin/).
