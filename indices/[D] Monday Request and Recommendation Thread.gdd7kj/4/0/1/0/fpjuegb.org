It is that thing and others in the same format. Alicorn wrote more glowfics with other people, and other people started writing glowfic with each other, so now it has its own website and community.

I remain ambivalent about glowfic in that I can't stop mentioning it but don't want to actually /recommend/ it, because much of it is mediocre and the good parts are an acquired taste requiring a big time investment.
