A while ago I found here a fanfiction of the Silmarillion. Set in the modern day Earth, it turns out some of the sons of FÃ«anor are still alive. One of them (Celegorm, I think?) lives in the Canadian wilderness. Then everything changed when the prospect of finding the Silmarils arrived...

Does anyone remember the title of this?
