Stupendously. Wandering Inn starts a bit weak, but gets progressively better. For a marker of quality, this chapter (and the following chapter) don't require knowledge of the rest of the story and are frankly, brilliant: [[https://wanderinginn.com/2017/07/14/1-00-d/]]

My only qualm is it's a bit too long for it's own good. There's a lot of different character viewpoints, and for every amazing one, there's one I couldn't care less about.
