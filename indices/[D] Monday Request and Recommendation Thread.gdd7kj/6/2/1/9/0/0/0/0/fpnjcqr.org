As I said, maybe I'm jaded. Ward was deeply unpleasant experience for me. I dropped this story 5 or 6 times, returning with hopes that it will become better and it never did. I don't think I will read anything written by Wildbow. Maybe after ten or twenty years, too check if and how much he improved.
