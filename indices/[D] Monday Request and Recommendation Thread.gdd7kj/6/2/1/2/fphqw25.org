I stopped keeping up with Ward about two arcs before the end, I will get around to reading it sooner or later. From what I've already read, a complaint I agreed with was that it felt like the Wardens get stupid and incompetent whenever Victoria is present but somehow fight off numerous threats off screen. I don't actually fully agree with your complaint about the death fakeout (which you think is a retcon) there was hints as to what was happening in the scene with the fakeout but I think it could use more.

As for Pact, Twice as it was originally being written I thought Pact was too much of a depressing slog, and I set it down to later binge read and catch back up. Back in terms of rereading... for Worm/Ward I've mostly reread interludes and not the main story whereas with Pact I find both interludes and main story worth rereading.

I think the world building in Worm works because wildbow rewrote the precursor story multiple times, whereas with Ward he didn't want to work through the implications of the post apocalyptic setting. Pact has a setting much closer to the regular world and it benefits from having a highly subjective magic system.
