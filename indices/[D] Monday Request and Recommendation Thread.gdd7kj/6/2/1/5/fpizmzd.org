I am pretty confused by these posts.

  I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone read Ward.

  I usually enjoyed reading it.

I would think that the whole point of recommending a work to someone is that you think they would enjoy it.

I enjoyed Ward. It wasn't as amazing as Worm was, but it was definitely worth the read. Partly that's just because Worm managed to pull off truly epic stakes and a satisfactory resolution in a way that very few stories manage. But all of the low-level detail - interesting superpowers, detailed characters with their own motivations and backstories, and combat scenes that were more detailed than I personally cared for - were pretty similar.

I think I could honestly recommend Ward to people as "If you liked Worm, you'll like Ward. Maybe it's not quite so amazing".
