  I am pretty confused by these posts.

I can see why it'd be confusing, but - take it as a rejection of the Cool Stuff Theory Of Literature. There was plenty of stuff I enjoyed in the moment. But looking back on the entire journey, I don't think it adds up to a good story, a worthwhile use of nearly two million words, or even something coherent. I think it had lots of pieces that could have been put to better use in a better story, and watching those pieces was often fun - but I kind of figured they were going somewhere, and they weren't.
