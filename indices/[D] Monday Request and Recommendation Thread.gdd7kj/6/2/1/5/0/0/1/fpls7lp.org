I think there's a difference between enjoying something and valuing having consumed it. Usually they're in sync, but not always; the rule is we judge experiences in memory by peak and end, ie. how much we liked it at its best and how much we enjoyed the conclusion. An experience that has an amazing start and mediocre middle and end will not be remembered favourably even if it was a good use of time.
