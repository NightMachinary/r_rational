I doubt I will. And not just because of the hopelessness. Although, at the point I left off, any ending that /doesn't/ feel hopeless is probably going to feel cheap. Ward's last arc doesn't start off with a Helm's Deep kind of hopelessness, where /if they just make it to the dawn of the fifth day/, as hard as that may be, there's rescue coming for them. It's a "Wow, it's going to take a serious /deus ex machina/ to rescue them from this," kind of hopeless.

But, even if I were to take your assurance that it ends on a hopeful note, without pulling something completely unforeshadowed out of its ass to accomplish it...

There's a problem with sequels that retread the ground of the original. That is, if your protagonists deal with a problem once, and succeed, you can leave the audience with a sense that the problem is dealt with. If they have to deal with the same problem again, you can never be quite sure.

This, I think, is the problem with having the MCU movies deal with the end of the world every week or two. Or having the Star Wars sequels deal with a resurgent Empire (by a different name). It all just leads up to a kind of fatigue: Okay, they've dealt with it /this time/, but we know something just as bad is going to happen again.

I think Worm did this very well: Every time a new threat came to Brockton Bay, it threatened the town in a /different way/, with a "save the world," extinction-level attack only really appearing at the end.

Ward started out so /well,/ in this respect. It dealt with the aftermath of the extinction-level attack, on personal, interpersonal, and societal levels, and found a lot of interesting stories to tell.

...But then it went full apocalypse again, only even more hopeless, this time, and I just don't see the point in finishing it anymore. Because averting one apocalypse feels like your heroes have saved the world, but having to avert a second means that you only feel like they've saved the world /for now/.

Having to play a second game, to win the the same stakes all over again because you'd only thought you'd won them in the first game, cheapens the first game, and gives you no reason to believe your win will be real this time either.

And that's not really the sequel I want to read, just like I'm about done with the MCU, and just like I'm probably never going to watch the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Because why ruin the ending of the (much better) original, by retconning the victory at the end of that story out of existence?
