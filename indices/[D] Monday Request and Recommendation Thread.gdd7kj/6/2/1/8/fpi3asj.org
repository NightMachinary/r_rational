Thanks for the review.

I made it to Last (the final arc) before giving up on it.

Ward just has this grim hopelessness that Worm didn't. I mean, yes, Worm had moments at which all looked to be lost, but Ward (especially the second half of it) /is/ those moments, with very little between.

And judging by the ending you describe, the last arc is even grimmer than the rest of it. As much as I don't like quitting a story this close to its end, I think I might just give this ending a pass.
