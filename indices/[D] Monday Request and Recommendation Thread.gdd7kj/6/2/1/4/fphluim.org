i read pact and i think i suffered of Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy in tvtropes talk.

it felt too dark for me to really care or hope for the future of the only character who is mildly relatable of the whole story, im talking of course about the bird. though i must say that it has scenes that made me go "this is what im talking about." followed by large swathes of content i couldn't bring myself to care
