I enjoyed Ward, and I would have read it anyway as I'm a diehard Worm fan, but I agree with most of your points. :/ The interludes of Ward were its best parts. From memory, the interlude with Rain, Kenzie, Dot, Dauntless, Simurgh, Fortuna, Valkerie were /really really good/. And the epilogue chapters with Riley and Five were excellent as well. But Victoria herself, and the main story (which is really hard to summarise) was not interesting.

This is a stark contrast from when I read Worm when I had to force myself to be patient during the interludes cause of how much I was burning to read Taylor chapters again.

I felt the biggest weakness was how the whole story (IMO) was setup to be different from Worm. Taylor was a victim of bullying, she was odd looking, she had a weird and gross power but she used her intelligence and diverse powers to take down traditionally OP Brutes by just constantly escalating. Taylor was a Chaotic Good villian.

Whereas Victoria was a popular, beautiful blonde, a traditional-ish flying brick power, she mostly fought Masters and Thinkers and was constantly trying to deescalate a situation in a mature way. Victoria is a Lawful Good hero.

She only became slightly more interesting when she visited Shardspace and came back slightly unstable. An emotionally mature grownup did not make for an interesting story about superheros. The fight sequences were also pretty hard to follow, too. Seeing flying bricks beat up bad guys works well in comics and movies, but not so much as a POV story. The opposite is true for Taylor's powers.. I imagine it would be almost impossible to describe her powers in a movie format well, but in written text it was just /incredible/.
