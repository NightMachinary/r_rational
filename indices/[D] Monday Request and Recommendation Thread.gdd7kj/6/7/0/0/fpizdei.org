I don't think that's quite what is being said. The point is that WGW has a STRONG influence on both the community's discourse and (potentially) Wildbow's thoughts on writing. It is well documented that Wildbow actively adjusts the story based off of audience feedback (for better or for worse). It's not a strong leap to assume that WGW, one of the biggest (and most positive) forms of content/analysis would have an impact. Drawing a link between Scott's preference toward character building to the Ward's arguably over prioritization of characters at the expense of world-building might be a stretch, but it's not completely unfounded.
