  LHC clearly doesn't like me.

I certainly wouldn't say that. I've been listening to WGW since around the time it started. I only fell out of WGWa in arc nineteen (as much because of other priorities coming up as anything else) and I plan on catching up at some point. I'd say I click better with Matt's personality and tastes, but you're still the main draw, as an entertainer and an analyst. I love your approach of tentatively assuming everything in a story is deliberate and brilliant until all the evidence is in. I went on a partial Vow To View binge a while back, and you and Elyse are pretty great there too.

Unfortunately, despite consciously attempting not to, I fell into the classic internet blunder of having insufficient empathy, particularly for public figures. I was so focused on explaining why Wildbow might have written something I consider not up to his standards that I didn't give enough thought to the fact that I was publishing an unflattering caricature of you. As Bowbreaker said, I was not trying to ascribe any malice to you - but I did not make that nearly clear enough.

I do think you're underselling yourself here, though. You're a big fish in this pond. Of course Wildbow is the only person responsible for the quality of Wildbow's writing. Anyone can give him advice, good or bad, but he's the one who chooses whether or not to take it. Someone else's good review or my bad review doesn't actually make Ward good or bad. But it's still clear that the fandom /influences/ Wildbow, and I think it's pretty clear that, over the course of Ward, you were by a /significant/ margin the loudest, most devoted, biggest-name fan. You have a whole show about how the story's going. Lots of people listen to it, and lots of people with money pay you for it. I think it's silly and more than a little misguided, but lots of people recommending Worm and/or Ward recommend your podcast alongside it with similar fervor - some people even recommend Worm and/or Ward /with the specific clarification that they're only recommending it as context for your podcast/. I think it's well worth mentioning you as an important and influential figure in a long review of Ward - particularly as I think the areas where Ward is most consistently lacking correspond to the areas you pay less attention to.

I'm quite excited to hear this - I started listening to Deep In Pact recently, and it's very good. :)
