I disagree with LHC overall, but I don't think they actually blame you in a way that ascribes maliciousness or even regrettable intent.

I interpreted what they said more as acknowledging that tour podcast was so well made it sweeped up much of the fandom and curved all discussions and opinions towards yours. Couple that with the fact that you are more interested in and draw more conclusions from characterization than world-building, plus Wildbow both enjoying your work and being influenced by his fanbase (that has been strongly affected by you) and you get Wildbow writing a story where he focuses so much on trying to write excellent characterization that he has less mental energy or care left over to polish the world-building.

Or at least that seems to be the thesis.

I personally don't think that any such effect is strong enough to warrant talking about, and I also never saw you causing even anyone else to disparage amor care less about Worm's world-building.

That said, I had issues with Ward's world-building ever since Prancer, Moose and Velvet were still having to /illegally/ smuggle /weed/ after the apocalypse. But those issues were overshadowed by the good stuff, and I still immensely enjoyed both Ward and We've Got Ward.
