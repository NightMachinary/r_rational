As a counter review, Ward for me had more highs than Worm did in total (by number of story beats I found absolutely engrossing), but was more of a slog overall. Worm was more consistently captivating whereas there is quite a percentage of Ward where my eyes started skimming.

My overall verdict however is that Ward is still an excellent story worth reading if you enjoyed Worm - the story has the same pseudo-rational characteristics and doesn't really have too many idiot balls
