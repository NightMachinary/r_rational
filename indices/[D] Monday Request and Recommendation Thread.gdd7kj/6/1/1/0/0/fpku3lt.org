And plenty of people dislike good things, so that reasoning doesn't go anywhere.

Plenty of people hate /HP:MoR/, /The Metropolitan Man/, /Worm/, /Worth the Candle/, /Animorphs The Reckoning/, /Pokemon OoS/ and every other popular fic on subreddit.

If "nobody hates this story" were a criteria people seriously applied, nobody would read rational fiction. If I'm being uncharitable, your own reasoning is a lot closer to "I didn't like it, therefore it's objectively bad and nobody should read it".

The fact is that Ward has a large fanbase that /strongly/ likes that story more than everything else Wildbow has written. You can dismiss that as "they have bad taste" if you want, but it remains that the story has /something/ that appeals to a lot of people and that you can't find anywhere else, despite its flaws.

And really, that's what I come on this subreddit for, not for bullshit popularity contests.
