  On the other hand, there's a lot of people who liked Ward, so maybe if you read it you'd be one of them?

Bad argument, plenty of people like objectively bad things. It's a non sequitur, and meaningless.

​

Actual good advice would be, Ward has a divisive ending and the fanbase is conflicted on it's overhaul quality. You can read if you want but there's a significant chance you'll not enjoy it, like a large percentage of it's readers.

​

Maybe read something less divisive, better reviewed, and more generally liked by it's readers instead. There's a lower chance of you reading something you'll not like if you do.
