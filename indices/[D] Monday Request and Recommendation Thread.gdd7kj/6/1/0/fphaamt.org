Ward is very, very long. Plot summaries are generally going to be some mix of low-detail and relatively long themselves. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lKr-ha-j2TLzTGhl3aXvkBWaqTflaSaQwTWoJMfELT8/edit][The best plot summary I could find]] is a couple of arcs out-of-date, and I think is generally better-oriented to jogging the memory of people who dropped the story at some point. Sorry if I was unclear about anything in the review!
