I never really saw it as a spin. People apparently tend to skim over Carol's interlude in Worm and conclude that Amy just made a single mistake under stress. She did that, but then she did a bunch of other truly heinous stuff that isn't as easy to forgive.

Even with all of that she still gets something of a 'good' ending, coming to understand and accept that things will never go back to the way they were before the events of Worm, but that she still has a positive path forwards.
