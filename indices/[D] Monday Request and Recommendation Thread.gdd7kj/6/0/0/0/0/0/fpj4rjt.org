I agree with you about where the responsibility lies, but it goes beyond that. The above review sort of presupposes that there are several specific things that are definitively different than they would have been if the fans hadn't said anything. Even if you say "but the fans aren't responsible for those changes, Wildbow is because he's still the author," you're still assuming that /those specific changes were made at all/.

No one's denying that the audience had some influence, but the review seems to be implying that Wildbow straight up resurrected dead characters because the audience didn't like it when he killed them off. With claims like that, the statement "Wildbow is entirely responsible for his writing decisions" comes out sort of damning, because it comes with the implication that he was making those decisions in a bizarre and irresponsible way. That's why I take issue with those claims when they're made with no real evidence.
