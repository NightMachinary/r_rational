I found the associated link to "writing the perfect scene" alternating between 'Scene' and 'Sequel' with 'Motivation-Reaction units' to be quite compelling and illustrative. Scenes are story structures comprised of Goal-Conflict-Disaster. Sequels are story structures comprised of Reaction-Dilemma-Decision. The author suggests that writers alternate between these structures link two different links in a chain, scene, sequel, scene, sequel, etc.

For example, Wildbow uses this technique very nicely in Worm.

Take Taylor's first fight, for example. (I'm going to strip it of its context so it remains recognizable but overall, spoiler-free.)

1.3 Gestation is the Scene. Her Goal is to become a Cape by fighting some baddies so she ventures out into the Docks. The Conflict is the ABB gang -- she stumbles into a meeting between the kooks and their boss. The Disaster is that she overhears someone snarl “...the children, just shoot. Doesn't matter your aim, just shoot. You see one lying on the ground? Shoot the little bitch twice more to be sure. We give them no chances to be clever or lucky, understand?”

Gestation 1.4 is the Sequel. The reaction is that Taylor thinks the gang is going to murder children. Her dilemma -- "do I call for help, retreat or attack?" Her decision is prompted by the advancement of the gang. And she becomes Skitter.

The motivation-reaction units is basically alternating between external-objective-description and internal-subjective-reaction... with each sentence or paragraph. This draws the reader directly into the mind of the player character. This dynamic seems to mirror the role playing game structure of a Dungeon Master/Storyteller describing what happens and the PC reacting (not reacting only with actions, but emotions and instincts as well.)

I was going to use Skitter's fight with Lung as an example, but it became too laden with early spoilers. Just read the article, it's given me a lot to think about, structure-wise!
