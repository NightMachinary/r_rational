I think there's something to be said for ditching a large portion of your audience right off the bat because they aren't like you.

  Our reader is, in many ways, unknowable, because we have no idea of who will end up picking up our work. We do know some things, though: Their background probably won't match ours. Their tastes will be different. Their age group and education will be different to an unknown degree. And, there's a 50-50 chance that their gender will be different, too. In fact, it's unlikely that we and a given reader have all that much in common.

This isn't true. If I write a story and post it to somewhere like [[/r/rational]], then I know a great deal about my average reader; I know that the average age will tend to be a bit younger, that they'll tend to be a bit better educated, and that they've been exposed to certain concepts before. I can generally assume that they're not religious. They'll be male /far/ more than 50% of the time. (Assumptions like this generalize to all publishing, which is intrinsically tied to marketing and word-of-mouth.)

So why would I want to write for the ideally anonymous reader, especially when this is almost certainly going to make things worse for the people who already have the appropriate background? If I want to write a book that's steeped in videogame tropes, I'm going to make the book /worse/ for people who don't share that cultural knowledge. I mean, I'm not going to go out of my way to alienate readers, but if I'm writing what amounts to a commentary on effective altruism, then I don't think that I'm well-served by explaining effective altruism first, because the commentary is going to be largely lost on someone who has only been introduced to the concept a few pages back. (I feel like this idea is really central to fanfic, where writers are often offering their own variation/commentary on canon.)

We already know that there exists a set of "people who will read the book", and we know that there are differences between that set and the set of "people who will not read the book", so why constrain ourselves to imagining that those sets are both evenly distributed throughout the population?

The larger point of the article is just "show, don't tell", which is fairly old (and good) advice.
