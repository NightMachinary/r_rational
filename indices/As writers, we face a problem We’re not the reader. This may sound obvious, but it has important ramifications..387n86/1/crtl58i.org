This article is really weak.

  The trick isn't to make our work universally accepted no matter the reader's background. It's to make all readers the same.

This is simpleminded. You can't write something for an audience of literally everyone on the planet. You'll end up with a watery sludge of excuses and explanations that few will enjoy and that vastly underrepresents the original ideas simply to make them accessible to anyone living in a cave with a 4th-grade reading level.

  What we need to do is to make our reader become our protagonist.

This is so wrong I can't even really get a good grasp on it. It ignores things like missing context for tension, hidden character knowledge, and gradual reveals. It ignores anti-heroes and characters who grow and change in ways some reader, somewhere might disagree with, and thus fail to identify with.

  Do that and you avoid the impossibility of making the writing universal. Instead you'll make your readers universal. And with that as our goal, let's see how we can accomplish that.
#+end_quote

And what follows is /English Comp. 101/ advice, with no special secret to making all readers fall in line with your magical, universal, single protagonist fictional narrative. Because an author can't accomplish this.

It is rather a set of instructions on how to make an unpresuming, freshman-level, Mickey Mouse every-person protagonist that the reader puts on like a pair of pants and wears as they are lead down the path of your plot. Not something usually considered the height of literary skill. And also, impossible. Not even a pants-character can fit every reader.

If two readers can hold different opinions on what a character should do with a set of knowledge in a specific situation, it definitionally /isn't possible/. This is trivial to prove as the reality of readers as a group.

Showing someone who isn't /exactly/ like everyone might expect, someone with a different take on situations who makes unlikely choices (that are then explained and examined) can result in a far richer character than one that tries (and inevitably fails) to please everyone. Sometimes, challenging readers with an unlikely, unrelatable, unreliable character leads to a much better /story/. Ah yes, that. What a novel is supposed to be about.

This article reads like a burnt-out, ground-down author trying to say what they wish was true, not what is actually possible. It over promises and states a very poor set of goals initially, then fails entirely to deliver.

An author should have a good grasp of the usual audience of the genre they're writing for, otherwise...they aren't doing a good job as a writer. And they need to be able to accept that they can't please all of the readers, all of the time.

This would have read much better as a POV-focused tutorial, not some cure-all for reader engagement.
