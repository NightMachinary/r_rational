To be fair, as you are an actual human being, albeit one with Superman's powerset, your YEAD is a bit more understandable to a Lexpy ( I made a word!) than Metropolitan man's Supes.

Lex's issues there were both that Superman was too strong to stop if he caught you plotting, and that it was impossible to know if he was truly good or if he had ulterior motives - partially because he was not human.
