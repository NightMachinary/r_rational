What functions would need to exist within the Golden Throne in Warhammer 40K? Which ones are likely failing first? How might some of these functions operate?

Some that come to mind:

- Un-Life Support

  - Consciousness preservation
  - Psychic Sustenance

- Psychic collectors (to receive power funneled from the legion of psykers supporting the Emperor)
- Psychic Interface to control the apparatus of the Throne
- Localized psychic projector to provide stabilizing and sealing force to the Warp rift leftovers of what was to be Terra's webway portal
- Psychic broadcast array to allow the Emperor to shape and broadcast the Astronomican efficiently

I'm sure there are more functions inside that thing, and that they're stupidly complex (enough to be a serious challenge, even with a Reverse Engineering Tinker power).
