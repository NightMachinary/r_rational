That did seem to me to be one of the coolest applications of this power. /Finally a situation where having a character dual wield uzi's is plausible!/ They could calculate their firing such that each shot's recoil would shift the gun into position for the next shot, and to make themselves harder to hit they may want to be constantly diving through the air. So yeah basically your typical action hero stuff, /except rational/!
