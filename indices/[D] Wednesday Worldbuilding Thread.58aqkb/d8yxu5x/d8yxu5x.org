I'm curious what applications you can think of for certain kinds of intelligence powers. Basically I'm trying to imagine all the advantages a superhuman might have if they were basically at peak human level with weak regen the standard minor hero package, and they effectively had a brain that was effectively a supercomputer, and a nervous system that operated perfectly precisely basically being replaced with fiber optics; plus some somewhat improved senses.

/How powerful would someone be if they were basically a electronic mind that happened to be stuck in a human body but still had the speed and other advantages of being in a supercomputer?/

I'm writing something where I'm giving the protagonist basically every intelligence ability I can other than being qualitatively smarter (because that's nearly impossible to writer). The obvious things that come to mind are being able to view things in slow motion, and being able to control one's emotions to remain totally calm in danger.

*BONUS:* The character also has extremely weak telekinesis (able to apply force on the scale of a dozen grams) that can only be applied on surfaces he can see, with the precision being limited only by his ability to see the effect being done. This power obeys manton effects, however dead skin and hair isn't protected.\\
How much use can you have for this if you can already see the world in super slow-mo and thus see bullets travelling (even if that's way too fast to do anything with stuff other than your TK)? How much could you affect bullets by applying extremely small amounts of force very precisely?
