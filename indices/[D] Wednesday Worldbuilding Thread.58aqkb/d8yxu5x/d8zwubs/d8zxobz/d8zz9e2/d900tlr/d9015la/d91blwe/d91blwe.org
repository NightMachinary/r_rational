Yeah I can see why it would make sense to extend manton effects out a bit, however on the other hand dead cells have no better justification to be protected than say clothing. Plus except for body hair, hair extends way too far from the skin to be protected. Still the examples you gave are by no means game breaking and the ability to blind normal opponents by forcing their eyes closed actually sounds pretty cool.

As for the lack of feedback it would cause errors, however given the amount of subjective time he has his enhanced senses and all the intelligence powers he would be able to correct for a great deal of them with math. Mainly I decided to give the character a weak secondary power so he could still do certain actions unhindered by physical speed, plus I was thinking about how combined with his intelligence powers this could allow him to defeat vastly larger amounts of enemies in gunfights.

Having read a few chapters into the second book of that series you linked, I can say the protagonist is still vastly overlooking some of his powers applications. Having no limit to the size you can affect, and being able to sense inside of objects you could do quite a lot. In a modern setting the power would be far more powerful because you could disable any electronic device in range by cutting some wires, which is why I'm not allowing my character to have that.\\
Even at the powers max range you ought to be able to instantly cut anything in any desired way, the power could act as a sort of infinitely fine blade unless there are limitations on size effects; however given what he can do with heat and sound this doesn't really seem to be the case.\\
There's also quite a lot you can do with lots of sound, but the author alluded to this in the epilogue of the first book so I suspect he will use this. Though I wonder if he tries some of the many effects you could cause using infra/ultrasound on somebodies body.\\
There's also the fact you could heat an incredibly small area a great deal to create light, or other forms of radiation.\\
I'll just have to see what the author does, people underestimate the sheer power weak TK would have without many restrictions.
