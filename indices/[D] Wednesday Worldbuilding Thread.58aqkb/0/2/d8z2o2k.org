A setting I drafted had mechas with human/AI pilots, in the setting AI were second class citizens, humans were there for accountability reasons (e.g. if somebody was killed the human was responsible).

It featured shape-shifting mechas, rather than plain humanoid ones, they were used to missions other than combat (e.g. reconnaissance, search & rescue), alternate shapes were useful for moving through unusual environments.

Protocol favored long range engagement, in space it meant using simpler geometric shapes (e.g. cylinder, sphere), to minimize surface area, but in short range combat the mechas armor was too strong for short ranged blast weapons and long ranged weapons would destroy both the enemy and yourself, so melee combat was most useful (e.g. hold the enemy while you focus a short range blaster in more vulnerable locations).

Mechas were preferred to other types of vehicles because they had great versatility (e.g. could reshape as some kind of jets) and could carry a decent amount of firepower.
