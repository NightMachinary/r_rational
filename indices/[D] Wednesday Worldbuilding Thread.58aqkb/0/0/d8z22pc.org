I think Evangelion justifies it pretty well. It's a bio-mechanical being that requires a human ego to operate it. Conventional weapons didn't work against the angels, so they needed something that could generate its own AT field. Considering the evas were modeled after Adam's biology (or Lilith's, I've always been confused by that), it makes sense that they were the only weapons capable of defeating the angels.

The dummy plug system is pretty much an AI developed to pilot the evas. The only reason they didn't use them before was because they needed to collect battle data before they could implement it. The crazy feats and flexibility of the mechs were because they were basically organic bodies held together by a metal frame. They weren't really robots, more like monsters with electronic controls attached.
