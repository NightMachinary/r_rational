So, a couple of days ago, my best buddy called the Kadarshev Scale "the Kardashian Scale". Now I'm sitting here regretting my life choices.

On a more serious note, I've been binging on some mecha Anime like Gundam, Code Geass, Evangelion etc.

Now the most glaring thing that is common in them (other than the giant mecha) is that these mechas are the strongest weapons in the arsenal of whatever military the show is focused on. But most shows never explain the why; they show the mecha in question doing feats no conventional weapons could but never why it could do them. Some handwave it away as Lost Tech of the Precursors while other completely ignore it.

Another issue that these mechas are always piloted from within, instead of say, remotely piloted. This can be rationalized as the enemy being in possession of a device to hijack or block the signals. But both of these issues can be solved by a nested AI.

And it makes me wonder; in what circumstances would a giant pilotable humanoid mecha be more viable in combat than literally any other type of weapon?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
