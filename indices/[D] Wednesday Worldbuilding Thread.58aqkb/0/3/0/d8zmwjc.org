So the PLOT DEVICE particle makes mecha militarily viable - but how? How do they make the jump from "needs pilots" to "giant fucking space robot"? I mean, all of these things could be solved by conventional spacecraft - just put the dude in an armored capsule with thrusters, and, I don't know, fire missiles at short range. Or use laser stuff. Or, if you really need a physical payload, arm it with a railgun.

I mean, at least half of it isn't contrived, but the giant robot part (frankly, the most important part) is still kind of stupid.
