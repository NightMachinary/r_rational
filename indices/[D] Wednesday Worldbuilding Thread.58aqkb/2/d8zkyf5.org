What would Celtic people look like after 500 years living in the desert? I have whole tribes that migrated far far South and had to settle in a desertic land (the hot sand desert-type). They almost didnt breed with the locals so would the environnement affect their appearance a lot? They were tall hairy Gauls with light-coloured hair before migrating.
