4 Tribes immigrated. 3 of them managed to carve themselves little territory on coastal land and a 4th one wasn't able to do that. They were obliged to live in the desert. The desert is a real desert, but it's not that huge and is quite survivable. And since they were used to being nomads, it wasn't impossible. Furthermore, after a few hundred years, they became traders and had almost full control of one of the most lucrative trade routes of the continent.
