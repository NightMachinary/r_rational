  disable any electronic device in range by cutting some wires, which is why I'm not allowing my character to have that.

That part makes sense to me as a function of tensile strength rather than a size limitation. I agree with your power limitations, but with a different reasoning. Even if you can concentrate it to a vanishingly small point/line, there still has to be a limit to what materials he still can cut through because otherwise he would be able to get infinite strength. I might be wrong about the physics though so take my reasoning with a grain of salt.

Good luck with the writing.
