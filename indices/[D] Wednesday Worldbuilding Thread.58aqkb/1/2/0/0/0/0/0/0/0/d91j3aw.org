The internals of electronic devices are pretty delicate so I really don't think you need that much force or precision to screw things up.

  Even if you can concentrate it to a vanishingly small point/line, there still has to be a limit to what materials he still can cut through because otherwise he would be able to get infinite strength.

I don't really see how that follows. Just because you could use that power to cut through anything you still couldn't say lift things above a certain weight. I just don't think there's any way to escape the conclusion that precise enough telekinesis would allow you to replicate the effects of a infinitely thin frictionless sword; you ought to be able to cut anything in any way you desire without exerting more than maybe a microscopic amount of force.
