Okay I get the Manton effect, but it's still a little odd in my opinion to be able to affect skin and hair since that's an unusual dividing line versus a few millimeters from the skin. He could pull hair strands out and stick it into opponents' eyes or pull eyelids closed for distractions. I mean, it's really disturbing in a fight to be constantly feeling little pinches and tugs on your skin and clothes.

If there's no feedback, then while it's harder to be precise without inhuman precision, it also prevents the ability to learn how durable a particular material is without extensive prior testing. Also how can you learn what a material is on sight? For example how much force can cotton take versus styrofoam? Also am I seeing cotton or styrofoam from a distance? There'll be errors if one can't learn the best amount of force to use, even if you could be perfectly exact.
