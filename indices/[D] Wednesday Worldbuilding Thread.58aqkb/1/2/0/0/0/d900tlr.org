Well the obvious point of having a manton effect is to keep him from just being able to apply force extremely precisely to basically cut into blood vessels close to the skin. If you can be precise enough to living tissue you could just slit peoples throats on sight, rendering guns pointless. I'm thinking there aren't any limits on range and it can work on any live feed, it might even work if he had good enough sonar information to work off or something.\\
Basically I think given his intelligence powers allowing him to not have manton limitations would allow easy instakills to anyone within sensing range. Plus if he could sense feedback from the TK then he could have some impressive control over lots of delicate electronics; he could snip wires inside of any electronics at range.

I think it would still work just fine without any feedback because he /always/ applies exactly as much force as he tries to the power operates like a very precise machine. He /could/ easily use the power on bacteria if he could see them in real time through a microscope but I don't actually see that being that useful.

The manton effects are the result of the fact that everybody (but not entities below a certain level of intelligence) has at least some very small connection to the superpower granting force, and that force is much better at affecting things within one's own body than on other things. So even people without powers can still automatically negate a power as weak as his affecting their body. They can't however counter that same amount of force from a hypothetical natural cause, it's way easier to negate other powers affects on your body than natural effects.

If you are interested here's a google doc with some rough world building stuff. A great deal won't make sense because the bits explaining /the actual powers/ aren't covered in my docs writing, sufice to say their are only like a dozen powers: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWbs_7Yl-oQWX2lxMOqTpOO6WyZs-7r5RPvlDJ_fOUc/edit?usp=sharing]]
