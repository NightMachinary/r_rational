Can he sense how well he's pushing? If there's no feedback, then it's virtually useless.

If he can only move air he can 'see', then fog or some colored gas will work.

The main use of telekinesis in the novel is to direct the path of thrown knives or arrows. The author cheated a little by allowing an instinctive sense of trajectories and the ability to know where the arrow will land to allow the main character to know how to best 'adjust' the path. But considering that virtually the very first thing computers were used for when invented in WWI (or was it WWII?) was ballistics, then your character should be capable of calculating trajectories.

Can he move things through a window, mirror, or a camera? Can he affect bacteria through a microscope?

Also can you explain /why/ there's a Manton effect? It just doesn't make sense as a natural law unless it's an artificial limitation. Also if he can only affect surfaces of what he can see and if dead skin cells aren't covered in the Manton effect, then the Manton effect will only ever come into play if he needs to move the insides of a body during surgery for some reason.
