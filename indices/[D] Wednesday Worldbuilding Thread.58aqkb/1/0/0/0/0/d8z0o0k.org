It's also in some senses a misnomer, because /the gun itself is pretty damn skilled/. In some senses the ability to use a gun without a great deal of skill was among its big advantages early on, until the gap in skill between the general populace and soldiers grew larger. The difference here is that extremely precise marksmanship has historically been thought of as being associated with skill, plus the fact the human is pretty much superfluous here, just stick the gun on a drone and you have something way more effective than a human sniper.
