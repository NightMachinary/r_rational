I have a reason for mecha to not be piloted remotely: lag. Modern drones are essentially flying artillery pieces that usually target stationary targets, but mechs are usually designed to function as infantry so they need quick reaction time. If the pilot was on the battlefield then the remote might still work, but they'd be vulnerable to interference unless the pilot was in an easily visible position, in which case they're a prime target that needs additional protection.
