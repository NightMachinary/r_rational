Which answered the question How do they make the jump from "needs pilots" to "giant fucking space robot". From the creator's perspective (original 1979 Gundam), having an universe where Giant Robots are natural outcome of technical evolution was an absolute must. All the fake science and social-economic conditions are tailored towards that goal. Given the impracticality of giant mechas in real world, it's very easy to admit this is an impossible goal - however Yoshiyuki Tomino took on the challenge and thus birthed the "real robot" subgenere; what he had done in the original Gundam and some other high quality works in the franchise is not unlike UNSONG, taking an absurd idea and went with it with dead seriousness and mulit-layerd world building.
