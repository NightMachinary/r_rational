I think that "strongly connotes" may be in your own usage - I can't find any reference to the word /actively implying/ the reverse meaning in any actual definitions, including the wiktionary link you used.

IMO the strongest connotation is of "weak evidence" or "non-certainty" (but not quite /un/certainty), i.e. "This /seems/ so, but /may well/ not be." For me, "seeming to" doesn't cover the same shade of meaning. "risking" would be closer, but doesn't feel as Dumbledore-flavoured.
