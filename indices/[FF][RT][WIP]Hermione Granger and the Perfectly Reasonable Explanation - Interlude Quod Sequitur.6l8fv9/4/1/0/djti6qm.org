My intended use there is "on the surface", which is to say that a casual analysis /suggests/ it is likely, as opposed to actually obtaining "future evidence" like Prophecy or Divination, which is a contrast powerful Wizards /actually have to make/ when discussing this sort of thing.

Dumbledore tends to use great precision of speech, which is a good habit for a spellcaster in general, but also lets him deceive without lying outright (though I'm not suggesting that he's doing the latter here).
