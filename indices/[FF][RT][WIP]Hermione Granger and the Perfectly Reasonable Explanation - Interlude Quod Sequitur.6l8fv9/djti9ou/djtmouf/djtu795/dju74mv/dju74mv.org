For continuity checking against canon, I have a single text doc with all the novels in it, and I searched on prophecy and prophecies - if there's a more explicit example of Dumbledore debunking divination than the one I provided, I didn't find it, but I'd be interested in seeing it?

Canon-Dumbledore splits hairs basically, saying it's not the prophecy that "magically" makes these things happen, it's who Harry is and who Voldemort is, since Voldemort is obsessed with the prophecy and won't leave Harry alone, and Harry is a Gryffindor and won't leave him alone in turn. But none of that makes the prophecy any less than 100% accurate.

As far as the suggestion that prophecies go unfulfilled all the time being an easily-checkable deception, I guess the presumption would be is that it isn't? True prophecies do have specific privacy protections, after all. He could be counting on Hermione's anti-divination opinions and Harry's poor record of independent research as well. It's not fool-proof, but it's good enough in the moment for it to feel reasonable, given the constraints he's under. He's /easing a boy's pain/ and putting him in a better place to face his challenges at the same time, who could fault him?

Dumbledore isn't a saint, he's doing the best he can with what he's got. It may be revisionist canon (because we have to make sense of all the books as a whole, whereas it's evident JK was building a layer cake without a detailed blueprint), but I still consider it canon. YMMV. :)
