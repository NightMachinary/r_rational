I kept meaning to reply to this, and then the next chapter came out, so it's probably a moot point, but I think that this reading of canon makes Dumbledore more mendacious and manipulative than he has to be. In some sense, it multiplies entities unnecessarily.

It also clashes with the canon's themes of choices, that are advanced not just by Dumbledore but by the Sorting Hat as well.
