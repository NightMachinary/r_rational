Nott is a different case, that's noted in the next chapter. :)

For the rest - you always have a way of bringing up involved topics. :) I think I've mentioned before that I'm not portraying Dumbledore as a sinister puppet-master who is a jerkface for no good reason. But similarly, saying he's /never/ manipulative is just silly. Despite what canon Dumbledore /says/, the way he /acts/ rather suggests he does actually put great weight in what the Prophecy says - that Harry is key, that things explicitly stated /will/ come to pass. The fact that the Prophecy was self-fulfilling (and mutable where not otherwise specified - in that it /could/ have been Neville, and that Voldemort might have won the final duel) doesn't make the rest of it meaningless in a strategic sense.

Take a quote from Albus: “If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been ful­filled?” Read that, while thinking about /precision of speech/. What does he actually /say/? The first can be read as suggesting it was possible for Voldemort to not have heard of the Prophecy, but it can also simply be read as a counterfactual assertion - if not X then not Y. It's logically valid, but irrelevant (since X is pre-defined as True). The question at the end is highly leading, but does not explicitly /assert/ anything. It's irrelevant what Harry thinks, if the true answer is, yes, every prophecy (whose Time horizon has passed) /has/ been fulfilled. Obviously there are also plenty that haven't, but only because their horizons are still in the relative future.

Anyway, why would being deceptive in that quote make sense? Dumbledore at that point is suffering from considerable guilt over what he's had to do to Harry to give him the best chance of living long enough to beat Voldemort, and Harry is despairing because he feels the Prophecy has trapped him. So emphasizing the wiggle room in prophecy while skirting around the sticky parts helps convince him that he is still the author of his own destiny (even while, weirdly, arguing that he's just as trapped by genetics and upbringing instead). In turn, that both relieves some of Albus' guilt (since Harry is less despairing) /and/ makes Harry (slightly) more emotionally stable, which is bound to help him in the impending conflict, the outcome of which /is/ still uncertain.

Take Sybill's second prophecy, too, about Pettigrew - it doesn't appear to have been self-fulfilling (because Harry presumably would've met up with Ron and Hermione after his exam regardless, and he doesn't do anything else in reaction to it)...but it still went down exactly as stated.

I'm comfortable with the interpretation of canon here that once a Prophecy is uttered, those things it fixes are considered pivot points in Time - from the point of the prophecy forward - but only to the extent that the language supports. A Prophecy is a translation of a brief measurement of the evolution of a chaotic multi-dimensional quantum system into, usually, English, so it's not surprising that they frequently involve symbolism and metaphor and are almost always fuzzy at the edges. But that measurement happened, and whatever previously-potential states needed to collapse to make it self-consistent /did/ collapse. Albus knows all that, and is doing his best to work with the advantages and disadvantages alike.
