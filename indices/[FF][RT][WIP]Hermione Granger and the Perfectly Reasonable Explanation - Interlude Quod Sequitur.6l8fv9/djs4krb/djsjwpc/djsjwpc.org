That's kinda what I thought. And given the canon symbolism of Dementors as clinical depression, frankly, a "happy memory" just shouldn't always cut it - firm conviction seems like a legitimate substitute, if not indeed a superior one.

Most of my depression has been exogenous, but even when you can't /see/ a path out of darkness, sometimes just stubbornly putting one foot in front of the other anyway can get you there.
