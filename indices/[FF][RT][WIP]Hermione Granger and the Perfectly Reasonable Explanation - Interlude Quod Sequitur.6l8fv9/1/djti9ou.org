More generally, I thoroughly enjoyed the chapter. I wonder if Hermione will mention to Dumbledore that Nott is blackmailing her. That might short-circuit that subplot as well.

On characterization, there was this passage from Dumbledore's point of view:

#+begin_quote
  ... moved to trap him in the castle with the eleven-year-old boy who was apparently the sole being with any hope of destroying him. Even while knowing that the Prophecy constrained Time but did not choose which of them would fall to the other.

I don't know how much you care about canonicity, but canon Dumbledore (as he amply explains in OotP and HBP) believed that prophecies only came true if their subjects believed them and acted on them. So, he would do his best to avoid the mindset that Harry was the only hope against Voldemort, because that would make the prophecy binding on himself. (It would be partly self-fulfilling: focusing on Harry to the exclusion of other avenues of attack could cause him to miss opportunities to defeat Voldemort sooner and more easily.)
