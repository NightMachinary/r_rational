I like the quantum interpretation of prophecy very, very much, but

1. Dumbledore spoke about prophecies at other times as well, and he was far less ambiguous, so if he deceived Harry about inevitability of prophecies, he would have had to lie directly. (Of course, there's no fundamental moral difference between misleading through subtle wording and outright lying in any case.)
2. It doesn't make sense for him to mislead or lie about something that's verifiable. For example, suppose that a few days later, Harry recounts their conversation to Hermione, who says that all her reading on prophecies suggests that, in fact, prophecies are always fulfilled in some form, even if it's an unexpected form. Anybody even aware of the prophecy can potentially expose the lie. Then where would Dumbledore's manipulations be?

So, this theory seems to be postulating not just a Dumbledore who is manipulative but a Manipulative!Dumbledore.
