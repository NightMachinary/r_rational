Varies from author to author. TGaB is earning even less. When you say 8k per month I assume you're talking about the Wandering Inn, which I think is exceptional and not to be considered the norm. Wildblow gets 5k a month and for a few years he was pretty much the only person earning enough to be a web novelist full time. I can only speculate, I haven't closely been following any web fiction for a while, but possible reasons are:

Different types of stories attract whales, two stories can each have 10k readers, but if one only has $1 donations but the others has 95% $1 donations and 5% $100 donations, that's a massive difference.

Maybe PGTE gets more money from other donation sources, e.g lots of one-time pay pal payments.

Maybe PGTE has poor marketing/incentives to donations.
