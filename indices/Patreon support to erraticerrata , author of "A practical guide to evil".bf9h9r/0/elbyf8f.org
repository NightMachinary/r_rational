I think the reason it gets less is because Erratic doesn't do the read one chapter early if you become a patron thing. I think a lot of people would cave in to read that next chapter just a bit sooner.

In general, I think early patreon chapters while profitable are awkward because they split up the community of readers from patrons and non-patrons. That said I totally understand why authors do it, and I'm never gonna begrudge an author for trying to make a reasonable amount of money from their work.
