I'm mostly upset by the /lazy/ brainstorming/question threads. If you want to /actually/ brainstorm, I think there's some onus on you to do the legwork first and give something for people to bouncing ideas off of. If it's just "Rational _____?", I tend to downvote those threads for their laziness. But if it's something like ... I don't know, getting someone to double-check your logic, point out something obvious you might have missed, get advice on storytelling, then I tend to think that's a lot better.

(Obviously I would prefer for the story to be fully written and the advice to be given after the fact, but getting advice after the fact increases the total workload because it involves both writing and editing instead of just writing correctly the first time.)
