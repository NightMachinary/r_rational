Well, I chose my mech eng course for Uni before I became a formal rationalist (though the stirrings were there). I think mostly it's just a very pragmatic choice to make, so it selects for pragmatic people more likely to go to rationalism.

Remember when you were choosing a course? Everyone seemed to be picking things based on what sounded cool and you were just sitting there thinking 'you're going to work at tescos scanning baked beans, none of these courses lead to actual jobs'. Everyone else was deciding based on thing that didn't feel like logic, but you couldn't tell them otherwise because it felt like you were insulting their free spirit or whatever.
