  Uhhh well generally I would say you poison any idea at all by worshiping it.

How so? Rituals reinforce community and social bonds. The idea behind the ritual doesn't matter, but I don't see reductionist materialism replacing traditional organised religions in this role, cringeworthy attempts at introducing "rational rituals" to the contrary.

  A society based on non-realist morals can't really get that far anyway, in my opinion.

I don't know, we got pretty far and I don't see any obvious signs of stopping. What would "realist morals" look like, anyway? Strict mean-value utilitarianism? Don't you also ridicule EA, which is predicated on such a value system?
