As mentioned i wasn't so much into the argument for\against religion as a whole.

I just felt that while you said that religions don't so much deal with issues which could be falsified doesn't quite work when a few sentences later you give an example of an actual and significant way in which religions affect daily life. which could be positive or negative.
