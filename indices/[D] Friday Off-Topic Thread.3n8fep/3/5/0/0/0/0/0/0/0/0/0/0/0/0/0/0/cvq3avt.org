Of course, in that sense most religions obviously have adjusted. and the things they say that should\shouldn't be done are based on their own internal systems.

If your argument separates between the things that religions advocate are scientifically correct(i.e. the existence of dinosaurs), vs correct\good in general(should we kill people that disagree with our religion) then everything is clear and you guys can get back to your main discussion..
