I don't see what's rational about subverting the tradition of your state and the moral basis of your society. You appear to be conflating instrumental and epistemic rationality. I'm not opposed to heterodox beliefs when they have predictive power and obviously present a more likely hypothesis than any presented by Christianity, but I don't think they should be signalled about in the same manner as organised religion, especially when we're talking about ontological beliefs with little if any predictive power or importance to the world other than signalling edgy hatefacts.
