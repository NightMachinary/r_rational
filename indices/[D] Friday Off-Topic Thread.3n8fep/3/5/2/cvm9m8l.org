I have had a few thoughts about this lately, actually. I think the reason so many good scientists are Jewish is because of the way Judaism works, specifically due to the fact that Talmudic interpretation is a process that nearly everyone is at least a little involved in and requires one to read a source, coherently understand it, and extrapolate from that. Essentially, for hundreds of years, being a "good jew" required being able to think about rules and figuring out ways to accomplish what you want without breaking them, which is exactly what science does.
