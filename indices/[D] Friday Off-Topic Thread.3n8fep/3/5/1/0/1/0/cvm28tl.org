Look, if people want to criticize the abusive use of frequentist statistics, /that's fine/, but then I expect a talk from someone who /knows statistics/ and has perhaps even done statistics professionally (or at least taken a class). This shouldn't be that hard, since "data scientist", aka "professional rationalist", is an actual profession these days: in a major metro-area with lots of scientists, engineers, and technologists, we should be able to find /one/ friend-of-a-friend or something who has worked with real datasets in their real life. Like, for instance, my girlfriend, who does data analysis as a lab scientist at work.

What I don't expect is, "NHST sucks, and Bayesianism best -ism, and that's why I didn't read those 30 science papers on that subject."

Stateside LWers seem to be dangerously close to philosophy students in some aspects.
