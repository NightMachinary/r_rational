On the other hand, I might have just gotten spoiled by the LW-TA community, which does tend to do things like attend "Science on the Bar" lectures and "Secular spirituality" events, hold lectures on scientific and mathematical material (Anatoly did "History of Modern Mathematics", Ziv Hellman is doing, "Sex with No Regrets: Sexual Reproduction as a Form of Machine Learning"), and have board-games meetings every two weeks.

I really, /really/ liked those guys.
