Ashkenazi Jewish male, currently working on embedded firmware and volunteering for an AI/cog-sci lab (sorta), originally from the United States, Israeli by preference, but currently stuck living in the USA for spousal reasons. Oh, and a red-diaper socialist, on the political spectrum (meaning: far-left and raised by similar).

Weirdly enough, from a sample size of two, I've found that I like the Israeli rationalist community better. They seem to have a lot of domain expertise and to /really value/ scientific and mathematical domain expertise, whereas the Stateside "rationality community" I've visited a few times seems to more prefer to have a kind of "rationality" that allows for ignoring or criticizing domain experts rather than citing them.
