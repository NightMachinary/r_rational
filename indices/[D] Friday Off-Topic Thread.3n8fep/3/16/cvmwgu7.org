I'm a mixed Asian-American (Chinese-Japanese-Okinawan) male, age 32, born and raised in Hawaii. I consider myself to be Kama'aina (that's 'local Hawaiian,' but lacking Native Hawaiian ancestry) primarily, since Asian has a connotation that you're fresh-off-the-boat in Hawaii. I grew up in a household without religion and I continue to be an atheist (although I tend approach people as a confused agnostic when I ask about their religions.) I went to college and med school in Hawaii and moved across the country to Cambridge, Massachusetts for Family Medicine Residency. I'm happily engaged to my female fiancee and we're interested in starting a family soon.

I stumbled across a shout-out to HPMOR in a youtube comment on MrBtongue's Tasteful-Understated-Nerdlove on Magic! The youtuber had a surprisingly constructive comment on how to make something magical while removing the mysticism. I burned through HPMOR, then Ra, then Worm, as a result. After concluding these rationalist stories, I needed more. So... now I'm here!
