I'm a Canadian First Nations, male, 21, I live in British Columbia and work as a driller-swamper (it's a very dirty job). Studied for a year in Uni but couldn't keep my head in the game. My family is upper-middle class, mostly working in the logging industry, and primarily atheist.

I was introduced to rationality by HPMOR, and it hooked me. Having new and better ways to communicate and debate are absolutely some of the most useful things I've ever learned. However, I live in a rural community, so I haven't ever actually had another person to discuss things rationally with. It's rather lonely having no one to talk to as an equal, so I frequent reddit quite a bit.
