I was introduced to the "rationalist community" by Overcoming Bias after being a Kurzweil singularitarian for a year or so. To this day, I find far more sense and rationality in Hanson's works than EY - the "less wrong" brand of rationalism seems to me to consist mostly of signalling how rational you are until your audience is impressed enough to accept your edgy contrarian opinions.
