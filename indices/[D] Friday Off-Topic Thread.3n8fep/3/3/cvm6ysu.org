White. Bi-curious. Male. 20 years old with a double major in CogSci and CompSci. Ethnicity's Ashkenazi Jewish, but I am atheist. Live in New York State. Really want to move to a modest sized community which is not too crowded. Political beliefs are leaned towards socialist, but have concluded the time to invest in keeping up with politics beyond news headlines is not worth it. I have never managed to go more than a few hours without reading something since I entered high school.

I pride myself on always learning /something/ in my free time without needing a teacher and grades to motive me. Disappointed that it's all in stuff like computers or neurology. There's other important things I really should get around to learning sooner or later.
