Early 20's white heterosexual male (unless a really perfect guy came along I guess). Breakdancer, rock climber, archer, out of work Mechanical Engineering graduate. Born and raised in the UK. I consider it a wonderful country but I wonder if that is merely the result of me having been raised here and thus considering its idiosyncrasies to be normal. I think practically speaking the chances of me being born in the country that is most suited to me by chance are low, but as I age I think I internalise more of the things about the country as 'just the way I like it'. I want to get chartered as an Engineer while scouting other countries, then move to one if it seems better. As time passes though I seem to be growing into the country I am in now, so by the time I am in a position to put my plan into place I may no longer want to. This worries me.

I met some very fun, sexually liberated people last night and plan to meet them again tonight. We'll see how that goes.
