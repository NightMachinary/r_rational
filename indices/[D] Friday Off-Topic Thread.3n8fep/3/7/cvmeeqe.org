White female American, age 20. I grew up in a very Mormon family, but life happened and my whole immediate family left the church. I started questioning my religion when I was in high school. I read the Old Testament in it's entirety and was appalled by the cruelty and darkness that was never addressed in Sunday School. There were lots of other things that caused me to doubt my faith, too. During that time I came across HPMoR and the attached communities. I already loved science, so I immediately got hooked. I was drawn to the moral system that wasn't handed down by God, but built up by logic.

I'm currently in college pursuing a computer engineering degree. I want an art minor, but my college doesn't offer one. :(
