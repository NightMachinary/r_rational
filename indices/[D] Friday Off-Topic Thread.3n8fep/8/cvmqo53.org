Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson -- who did a better Joker?

(Definition of "better" deliberately left vague.)

I'll start:

Jack, all the way. First, his makeup was more true to the character. Second, he had the whole "psychotic clown" thing down, whereas Heath did "psychotic" but not "clown." Look at the art museum scene with Jack, his mooks, and Kim as an example of why I think Jack was better at "psychotic clown."
