You're talking about a hypothetical religious society/person that completely closes its thought process to the idea of updating based on evidence, or somehow implying that such a society has ever existed. In other words, you've constructed an elaborate strawman and proceeded to pummel it mercilessly at length to signal your allegiance to non-religious thought and societies.

But the fact is, that's not the kind of society I'm advocating in favour of, at all, nor is this generally how religious societies work. In case you haven't noticed, religious beliefs and rituals mostly deal in assertions with little or no predictive power, in fact, they mostly tend to avoid situations that would expose them to falsifiability. In general, religious institutions (of the kind I'm advocating for) don't tend to magistrate on areas that are both

- Easily falsifiable by rational inference from available evidence

and

- Have significant predictive power in an area that affects people's daily lives

So, for example, organised religions tend to magistrate on what amounts to sin and what kind of penance is required for its absolution, which reinforces societal norms and a sense of community, but they don't tend to magistrate on the required wing areas of aeroplanes, which would probably cause several deaths before they got it right, for no measurable benefit over just trusting engineers.

  This is at least one good book on the subject.

I disagree with the assertion that there is such a thing as a "moral territory". My own ethical leanings are somewhere between consequentialism and eigenvalue utilitarianism.

  Most especially, Peter Singer's writings about ethics and utilitarianism, in which he openly states that he does not necessarily think moral realism can be defended, but that he feels an ethical duty to brush this anti-realist stance under the rug in favor of getting more people to do good. This isn't just intellectual dishonesty, it's a basic intellectual self-contradiction: "Morals aren't real, but don't tell people that or they'll stop donating to charity!"

That's pretty much the exact same justification I used in favour of organised religion. For its rebuttal, see your own earlier post. I hope your strawman is sufficiently permeable when it comes to your own beliefs.
