  How so?
#+end_quote

Gah, you're making me invent new vocabulary on the fly. I can't promise to be clear, sorry.

Normally, we reason openly and inductively rather than closedly and deductively. That is, we experience things, and /then/ we generalize from the experiences. In fact, according to all the scientific and mathematical knowledge we have about cognition, /this is the only correct way/: you /can't/ build a map of the real world, effective in navigating the real world, from "first principles". You need information, and you need a process of inductive reasoning that transforms the information into increasingly accurate maps.

"Open" and "closed" here are just expressing whether or not our maps of the world can be updated to accommodate new information, or necessarily "break" and contradict themselves when trying to do so. Statistical, inductive, "cognitive" reasoning does the former; deterministic, deductive, "logical" reasoning does the latter.

Now, the problem with the psychology of religious worship, is that it takes ideas which were originally just important spots on very useful maps, and it turns them into the axioms of closed, deductive systems of reasoning. In doing so, it divests them of their original semantic content - the way they once mapped some territory - and instead replaces the semantic content with steadily increasing amounts of moralized browbeating. Over time, statements of the syntactic form, "It is the will of X!" or "It is for the honor of Y!" come to replace what were originally (understood to be -- many people thought their gods were real) justifications based on ordinary, bounded-consequentialist reasoning, of the form, "Do it so A will happen" or "Do it so B /won't/ happen".

To quote Terry Pratchett on what this looks like:

#+begin_quote
  “Around the Godde there forms a Shelle of prayers and Ceremonies and Buildings and Priestes and Authority, until at Last the Godde Dies. Ande this maye notte be noticed.”
#+end_quote

Thus my belief that if you really, actually /like/ your ideas/gods/whatever, you should avoid /worshipping/ them under any circumstances. This is not some Popperian belief about how "everything should be criticized", especially because I tend to believe that a /sufficiently motivated/ critic can find something to criticize even in entirely true statements and entirely real phenomena, simply by inventing "foundational" or "philosophical" problems where none had previously existed. It's from the belief that if I like an idea, the best loyalty to that idea is to understand it (including any flaws it might genuinely have), understand its context among ideas, and understand its domain of applicability. Loyalty to a map /means/ keeping it accurate, which entails never drawing sparkles on one spot on the map and scribbling out everything else on grounds of "holy holy hallelujah!".

  Rituals reinforce community and social bonds.
#+end_quote

You can also have rituals that are /about/ community and social bonds, in which case they won't spoil any poor ideas.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know, we got pretty far and I don't see any obvious signs of stopping.
#+end_quote

I don't think that's true. I think that civilization got far precisely by using the data of real-world experience to reason inductively and adjust our maps of the world (including the counterfactual structure of the world, the coulda-beens and woulda-beens). If people /really/ used /totally/ non-realist, anti-naturalist meta-ethical reasoning, the phrase, "Well that's just a bad idea" /would not exist/. People would just doggedly push on with absurd, stupid things of no value whatsoever /because holy-holy-hallelujah/. Sufficiently advanced non-realist moral codes of the kind you're describing become indistinguishable from compulsive disorders /precisely because/, to everyone else around the person with the sense of moral compulsion, they appear to be trading things off in ways that don't correspond to world-states that they care about minus the compulsion. The compulsion is a desire or sense of duty that is far out of accord with the rest of the person's desires and senses of duty.

(Notably, compulsive disorders are fairly good evidence that normativity is a kind of emotion or sense-of-thought that can be tuned up or tuned down and, like all other such human emotions and senses, has to be carefully calibrated before it can be used as an instrument for measuring something about world-states.)

  What would "realist morals" look like, anyway?

  Strict mean-value utilitarianism?
#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote
  Don't you also ridicule EA, which is predicated on such a value system?
#+end_quote

I tend to make fun of Effective Altruism for these reasons:

- Hedonic utilitarianism, which I think is wrong because it leads to wireheading and thus /fails to map the moral territory/.

- Most especially, /Peter Singer's/ writings about ethics and utilitarianism, in which he /openly states/ that he does not necessarily think moral realism can be defended, but that he feels an ethical duty to brush this anti-realist stance under the rug in favor of getting more people to do good. This isn't just intellectual dishonesty, it's a basic intellectual self-contradiction: [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/rq/what_would_you_do_without_morality/]["Morals aren't real, but don't tell people that or they'll stop donating to charity!"]]

- Unconsidered, unreflective support of the present form of neoliberal global capitalism, and its modes of doing philanthropy and development.

As [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] once stated when expressing his relationship to neoreaction, "The wheel of progress only turns one way." I am not making fun of Effective Altruism because they think morals are real. To the contrary, I am making fun because they think morals are a silly game of appeasing their single emotion of duty!
