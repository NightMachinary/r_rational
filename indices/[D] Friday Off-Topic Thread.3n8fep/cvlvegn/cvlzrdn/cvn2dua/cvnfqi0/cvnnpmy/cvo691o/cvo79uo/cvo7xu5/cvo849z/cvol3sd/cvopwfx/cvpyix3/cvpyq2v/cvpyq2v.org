Unless a foreign religion was inposed onto it, at some level the religion of a society reflects its values and desires. Think of it as an attempt at CEV with 5th century BC social technology. At any rate, it's just an example - the point is, it's an institution that enforces a society's actual values, preventing it from dragging itself into blind change as fast as its morally apathetic legal system will allow and giving it time to consider the fact that actions have consequences.
