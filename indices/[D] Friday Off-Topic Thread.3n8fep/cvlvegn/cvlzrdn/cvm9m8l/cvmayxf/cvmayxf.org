It's probably also a historical coincidence that Jews were feeling a scrappy need to move up in the world at just about the time when being a scientist was a good way to do so. Now that American Jews are more assimilated (which, admittedly, would affect both cultural hypotheses and material-conditions hypotheses), they're going into science less often. Secular Israeli society still produces disproportionately many scientists, though.
