Basically, ARM microcontrollers /everywhere/. Working with interrupts, hardware bugs, performance measurements, memory-mapped buffers, and manual memory management is my day job.

If you really think "ohmygod this is so cool" (I know I did at that age!), I have the following advice:

- /Also/ learn some web development, because while systems programming will get and keep you some very good jobs, those jobs are hard to find. Everyone wants fucking web-dev-ihateitsomuch.

- /Also/ take one course on databases. Nowadays, basically everyone needs to know at least the basics about databases to work in industry. Well, not everyone, but like the web-dev, it helps you appeal to the least common denominator of employers.

- Do projects with embedded controllers in a toy robot or something while you're still in college. Build something cool with an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBoard, anything labelled a "dev board".

- Learn anti-electrostatic discipline and love it.

- Put programming projects you do on github.

But hey, I think it's a pretty all right field to work in!
