I'm a 25 year old male software engineer living in Silicon Valley. Except for my ethnicity (Korean / Iranian) I'm pretty close to the typical rationalist demographically speaking. I grew up in an upper-middle-class household in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. I'm college-educated.

My parents are electrical engineers and one is a tech entrepreneur. They are atheists from religious backgrounds. I was raised without any particular religious tradition. Though we celebrated the usual Christian things-- Christmas, Easter, etc-- I was never told God was real. It wasn't until I was 10 that I realized my peers and extended family thought of God as a thing that actually exists. My parents vote for Democrats for a variety of pragmatic reasons. My religious and political beliefs are suspiciously similar to my parents', though I think these beliefs are correct anyways.

I was introduced to rationality many years ago while reading the blog at [[http://marginalrevolution.com/][Marginal Revolution]]. Tyler Cowen would occasionally link to or debate with another blogger, his coworker Robin Hanson at [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/][Overcoming Bias]]. I read a few other blogs and found the movement generally interesting, though outside of a few places (like here, at [[/r/rational][r/rational]]) I haven't felt any desire to engage with people at length. I'd rather discuss on the internet than argue on the internet.
