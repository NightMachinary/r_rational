/Genetic background:/ African (Caribbean--but no accent for /me,/ thank Kira!)

/Religious background:/ I vaguely recall that my parents dragged me to some Protestant Christian churches and summer camps, but it all seemed rather halfhearted, and gradually petered out somewhere around age ten, without any real pushback on my part. I don't think I myself was religious at any point in the process, but I could be misremembering. (/VeggieTales/ was pretty fun to watch, though.)

/Sexual orientation:/ Heterosexual cisgender male

/Political orientation:/ [[http://i.imgur.com/vdKYlE7.png][Meh]] ([[https://www.politicalcompass.org/][source]]); also, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction][Gamergate]]

/Personality:/ Grumpy and intolerant (see flair) (but [[http://i.imgur.com/Sxjgmd0.png][has been described as "honest and transparent" by a charitable person]]); also, whiny and materialistic

/Occupation:/ Student of civil engineering

/Location:/ Northeastern United States

/Discovered fanfiction through:/ I have no idea (I feel as if maybe TV Tropes had something to do with it), but the first stories I read were NaruHina fluff in the /Naruto/ fandom. /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ is what really cemented fanfiction as a core part of my life, though--I discovered FanFiction.net just a few weeks before that story's completion.

/Discovered/ HPMoR /through:/ I can't remember at this point. (Remember, this was before FanFiction.net allowed users to sort stories by number of favorites or reviews.) I think it may have had something to do with TV Tropes or /Fallout: Equestria/, but I'm probably completely wrong.

/Discovered Reddit through:/ The TV Tropes article on Polandball.
