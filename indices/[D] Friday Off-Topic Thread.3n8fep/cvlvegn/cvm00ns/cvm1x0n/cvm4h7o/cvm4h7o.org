Eaturbrainz is correct. I think if you're able to be an engineer of any sort, that's often a safe, solid choice for a career and does not require an expensive graduate degree. Being a software engineer has lower entry requirements than other forms of engineering, like electrical engineering.

I wonder if it's something where being a rationalist helps one make this sort of decision, or if being the sort of person who makes this kind of decision makes one likely to seek out rationalism. I imagine it's more of the latter and less of the former.
