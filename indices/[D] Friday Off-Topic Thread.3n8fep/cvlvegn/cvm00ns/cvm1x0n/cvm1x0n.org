  You see a lot of rationalist software engineers, and part of me thinks that's because it's the correct choice when you're got the kind of skills that lead you towards the rationalist movement.

It's easily one of the most advantageous career choices to go for, if you don't happen to have career goals beyond, "It's indoor work with no heavy lifting, they'll pay nicely for it, and people will consider me a Respectable Member of Society." It also fits /very/ nicely with certain incentives people deal with these days, such as more traditional Respectable Professions like law or medicine carrying heavy burdens of student debt; finance, consulting, and management being founded around elite cliques; and Generic White Collar Employees slowly ceasing to exist.

If you have an analytical turn of mind, don't want to spend more than 3-4 years in school, don't want to take on slave-labor or heavy debts at the beginning of your career (or want to be able to pay them off reasonably), and want to make a living with your analytical turn of mind, software engineering is a good choice.
