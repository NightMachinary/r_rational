White heterosexual male. 28, Small town in Southern Indiana. Extended family is Christian while I'm agnostic in theology and Secular Humanism in a more practical sense.

I've got about 6 years of college in my past though no degree. Did three years of random courses to no actual degree before a bunch of life stuff came up.

Did another 3 years towards Sociology with a focus on the statistics side of things before a bunch of real life stuff came up.

From working odd and end jobs over the years and having little in the way of actual wants I've got a low five figure amount of money saved up and live in a family members antique.

I have a brain state that I find odd in that I have little in the way of wants or desires. I believe, despite having a reasonably large spending pool and very little in the way of life expenses due to my situation, that I've spent less than $300 on anything that wasn't a need in the past year. Similarly, I have no need for external human contact and spend most of my time reading fiction, non-fiction, or learning whatever random subject interests me.

I wager my life expectancy is dependent on how long I have a family member willing / able to shelter me from the requirement to pay to live.
