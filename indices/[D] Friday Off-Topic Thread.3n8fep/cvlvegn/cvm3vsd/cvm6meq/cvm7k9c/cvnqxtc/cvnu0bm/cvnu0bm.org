I'm taking a look at mindfulness meditation to start training myself to notice things and promote good habits of thought. I think that's part of cognitive/dialectical behavior therapy, so I think that might be a pretty good path to test.

I will admit, even taking into account this minor breakdown, my PHQ-9 score is definitely lower than it was earlier in my life.

I wish you luck in fixing yourself.
