  I am nearly twenty, and I feel old. Time is speeding up,

I feel you, they say the chains of habit are too light to notice until they become too heavy to break. I worry I built the wrong habits while they were light and now I am failing at changing them.

I can't help with the rest but this bit here at least is something you can mostly solve with [[http://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/best-social-skills-books][properly applied learning.]] Social skills are called skills because they can be learned and practised. In fact, I would call it a rather important thing to do because social skills improve ones life in multiple non-obvious ways.
