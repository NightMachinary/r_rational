Actually, I want as little restriction on my creativity as possible when it comes to the world-building so all I'm going to be using is the characters of Shaggy, Scooby, Velma, Daphne, and Fred. Otherwise, I'll be coming up with the setting all by myself.

I'm veering towards having the supernatural be a real thing, but where the Mystery gang are dealing mostly with normal people in a monster get-up. It would partially explain why there's never any actual authorities to investigate. They're too scared or incapable of handling the supernatural and whenever there's a possibility of the supernatural, everyone steers clear. The Masquerade is partially maintained through willful ignorance and it's more common than not for people to have had a supernatural encounter or to know someone who has 'disappeared'. Therefore, the Mystery gang are often the only ones actually willing investigate and stop people using the possibility of the supernatural as a threat. Of course, it helps that they are better prepared than the average individual if it turns out to be a genuine supernatural event...

Scooby-Doo talks because....well....I'm actually spoiled for choice on what to go with. Telepathy with only the group, failed possession by ghost granting speech, a friend cursed into the form of a dog, spiritual connection granting the ability to communicate with any living creature, or even a dog-shaped eldritch abomination who was the first supernatural encounter/monster who they beat and bound into servitude. The last one is really tempting and I think I might have him only speak in words starting with the letter R as part of the *Rules* he follows as part of his unnatural nature.

Also, cursed monster costumes would explain why so many weekly-villains will be such perfect actors. Seriously, they will act so much like an actual animal/beast/monster that one would swear that they were really monsters.

Don't talk to me about Scrappy. He doesn't exist.
