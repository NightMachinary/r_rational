.....I probably should have mentioned this earlier, but I'm planning on there being a fairly severe economic depression and a technological slowdown (or minor crash?) to explain why there are so [[http://www.cracked.com/article_19496_6-classic-kids-shows-secretly-set-in-nightmarish-universes.html][many haunted and abandoned buildings]] in the Scoody-Dooverse. So technology is at the level of simple computers with no real working Internet. I need to make it hard for the gang to contact with the rest of the world without forcing them into extremely isolated places. So I'm nerfing communication technologies with the cause being either a techno-crash, or the supernatural actively cutting communications to keep their 'prey' from ganging up on them like a herd of cows stampeding. So probably 1990s level of technology like in the show, but with a few more advanced pieces from the 2020s.

In addition, the supernatural isn't just a strange breed of creatures or exotic physics-bending energy. They're meant to be more like the creatures from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales where they were atrocious, horrifying monsters who you could only run away from and not fight. These are not your Tinker-Bell style fairies. Before you even suggest humans working together and using technology against them, I'll point out that they are /smart/ monsters who have learned to adapted to using technology. These monsters are careful to never overprey on any one city to terrify everyone into fighting instead of fleeing, and they are cautious to remain as the scary /unknown/ threat instead of the scary /known/ threat. Also they understand the out-of-sight, out-of-mind rule very well.

I mean, if I'm going to be writing a rational story, then I better make the monsters rational as well.

The story's going to an even balance of dark and light-hearted moments, but it's set in a fairly dark world.

PS Thanks for talking things out with me! I'm coming up with lots of more details to add to the story as we go on.
