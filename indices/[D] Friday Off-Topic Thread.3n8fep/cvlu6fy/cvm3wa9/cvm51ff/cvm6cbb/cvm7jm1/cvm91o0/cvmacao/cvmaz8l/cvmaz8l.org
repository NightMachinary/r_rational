  Hey, I needed an actual problem that most W.E.I.R.D. folks could sympathize with. Not the traditional wasteland where everyone needs to forage for food, I want my characters to suffer!

The characters are basically being forced to forage for information. They know there exists a ritual to banish the ghost or stop the witch or whatever the monster of the week is... but the only book they know of that has instructions on this is in a University hundreds of miles away... So instead they are left with the option of searching through the spooky abandoned library in the mansion for some applicable knowledge.

  I need to spend some time studying just how one could shut down the Internet and what point in its history and development would the monsters have done it (they definitively wouldn't have allowed it to get to the current day's level of connectivity).

Here is a good example to consider:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Thailand_floods#Damages_to_industrial_estates_and_global_supply_shortages]]

Floods in Thailand knocked out 25% of the world's hard drive production, causing prices to double for some time. If the monsters have access to magic that can cause natural disasters, then carefully targeted natural disasters to various key locations could gradually slow technological progress. Moore's law is a self fulfilling prophecy... and people have been expecting to end or slow for some time. It takes a lot of investment to keep improving. If the right companies had gotten hit at the right times maybe the monsters could break the cycle of technological improvement.

Also, in general you might consider what technologies depend on computers to improve, what technologies could continue to advance without computers improving. Also, what technologies require large centralized infrastructure development and investment to be possible. I imagine SpaceX wouldn't exist in this run-down world.
