  So technology is at the level of simple computers with no real working Internet.

... And you just made this setting super dark and depressing... Is it messed up that I find no working internet worse than monsters that actively prey upon humanity?

To brainstorm more on the internet angle... it seems like high tech, high information areas like universities or such should at least be able to set up a good local network. So even if there is no internet, there should be at least the occasional intranet used by research communities or such. Also, are phone lines down also? It seems like a very low bandwidth internet might be possible, with text only discussion groups.

Also, commenting on your other reply to consolidate threads.

Just imagine it, you survived an encounter with a vampire or other monster, you go online to search out more information about it, you find a group that meets to discuss issues like your experience. They are meeting in a public place, like a restaurant or something, so you think you are safe going to the meetup. At the meetup, someone locks the door and half the people there change into horrible monsters who slaughter everyone.

If buildings are getting abandoned so frequently, that might mess with the common plot of the villain faking the haunting the buy the property cheap. Why try to scare people out when their is an abandoned building that no one is using nearby that they could buy for cheap?
