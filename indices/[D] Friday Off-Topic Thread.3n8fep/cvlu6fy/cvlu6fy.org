Let's say you meet a real-life Scooby-Doo (not the character, but a talking Great Dane) and the dog then leads you into witnessing a nasty real-life supernatural event such as watching a ghost-like figure made of ectoplasm possessing a man and attempting to kill the man through suicide as revenge. How would you react?

Assume you were convinced of the supernatural, what would you do?

EDIT: For anyone who's curious why I'm doing this, I'm thinking of writing some rationalist Scooby-Doo fanfiction for RaNaNoRiMo and I wanted the instinctive reactions of bystanders when they meet Scooby-Doo and see the (seemingly) supernatural events all of a sudden.

So no, you should not have any prior knowledge of Scooby-Doo.
