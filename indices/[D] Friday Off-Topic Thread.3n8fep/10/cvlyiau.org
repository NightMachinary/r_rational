Though I am by no means creative enough to write a story, I have managed to come up with a few (quite unoriginal) premises for (fanfiction) stories, if anyone's interested in using them:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4098737/][One incomplete summary, one complete summary, and five premises]]

- [[http://pastebin.com/D3b75E7T][Two incomplete beginning excerpts]]

Also, I had some fun attempting a vaguely-rational branch of an erotic-mind-control story [[http://chyoa.com/story/absolute-power-corrupts/thread/be-cautious-c1cfadf8][here]] (it's an "addventure" site like /Dungeon Keeper Ami/).
