For what it's worth, I just read this book on your recommendation, and found it to be a way downgraded version of Gaiman's "American Gods" (first chapter [[http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/American+Gods/in/181/][available here]], it's quite self contained, don't bother with the rest of the novel because it's much worse).
