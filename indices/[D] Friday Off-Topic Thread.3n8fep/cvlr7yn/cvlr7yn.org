I recently read Scott Hawkins' first novel, the Library At Mount Char. It's the best SF&F first novel I can remember since Clarke's Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Thanks to Nostalgebraist on tumblr for the rec.

The story is about a library that contains all the secrets and knowledge of the world, and a power struggle over it. The head of the library is ancient and seems immortal, but has now disappeared. This immortal raised a dozen orphan children and trained them all in the various arts the library contains such as medicine that allows true resurrection and languages of all of mankind as well as things like animals; and these characters, now in their thirties, are having to cope with leaving the library.

The novel is really exceptionally written and paced, and contains a lot of great humor. Also, very well written character interactions. Not for the faint of heart, though - it gets quite dark and disturbing a number of times.

Just a really wonderfully written novel, a strong recommendation. Not really rationalist in any way, so I waited to this off-topic thread to recommend it here.

Hawkins' description of the evolution of the title is amazing:

  I've found that a good way to get myself moving is to take the most ridiculous phrase I can come up with and try to write a book around that. For comparison, the working title of The Library at Mount Char was The Library at Mt. Sammich. In case you're wondering, the 'Library' part of the story came easily enough, but I had to really work to get the 'Mt. Sammich' part to fit. Ultimately the good folks at Crown decided "Sammich" had a misleading ring, so it got changed. For the record, I'm amazed that title made it as far as it did.
