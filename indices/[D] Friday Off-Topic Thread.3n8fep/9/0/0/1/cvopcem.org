I think, as a more general principle, length is virtue. /Why/ is a complex question, but I think there are a few parts to it:

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect][Mere-exposure effect.]] We tend to like things that we're familiar with. A book that's two hundred pages gives you less of a chance for familiarity than a book that's a thousand pages, or a series of books that are each five hundred pages. By the time you're a million words in, you're very exposed to the material, which means that you'll look on that thing favorably.
2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization][Post-purchase rationalization.]] A longer book (or long series of books) requires more from the reader, both in terms of money spent on the books and time spent reading the books. We want to think that we've made the right choice in how we spend our time/money, so we convince ourselves that we made the right choice.
3. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_perception][Selective perception]]. We get used to minor annoyances. After maybe twenty pages, you get used to any quirks in the prose or other issues with the writing. You have to go through this again with each new session of reading, but you get better at acclimating every time. Eventually it's just automatic and your brain is censoring out all the problems unless you're particularly good and/or diligent at being a mindful reader.

And I should note that this applies even if the books in question are /fantastic/.
