As another reader of WoT, half of it is buy-in - the other half is it's just fun to read (for me, at least - as shown, YMMV). On the other hand, I really love tropey stuff, so I'm not the best one to judge. I get really into the worldbuilding and plot, notice some of the plotholes, and just keep on reading. I may just be used to stuff like that by now.
