In my opinion, never. I live in India where speaking superior English gets me called a 'Britisher'(angrezi) and a betrayer of our glorious culture.

Simultaneously there's an entire industry which thrives on this insecurity that most people here feel towards their inferior English. I can walk across the street and see at least two English coaching centers, these are the places that source your typical Indian call center support.

There's a few fringe elements that exploit people's pride in their local languages [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h5KzWac0_E][like this]]. To say that these people reject English would be an understatement. But, and this is my personal observation, unless you know English in India, your career is fucked.

Personally, I wish I knew no other language than English. Because knowing local languages (I know 3 others) has messed up my accent and changes the way [[http://www-psych.stanford.edu/%7Elera/papers/mandarin.pdf][I think]]. Indian languages are usually a mish-mash of the actual language and English itself and most have maybe 400-500 words in their spoken form.
