New languages will result like speciation in evolution, very slowly, and as a continuous process of mutation from our existing languages. I'm not sure what an Internet-based language even is, unless you're talking about conlangs, but conlangs, neither the personal sort that are created by hobbyists nor those created by institutions, will never take hold as primary languages. People speak what their parents spoke. As for brand loyalty, that's simply ludicrous. People partake in multiple major brands, and major brands do not separate geographically.

As for equilibrium, we already have it. Languages remain stable in population over years unless there are mass deaths of one or another. Languages that large populations speak are not made, they only ever arise out of old ones.
