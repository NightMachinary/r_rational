I sincerely doubt that we'll ever have a single language. The reason is because languages are kinda like animal species in the sense that it's subject to evolution. Languages are constantly changing, growing, and shrinking all the time. The massive die-out of languages today is due to how globalization has forced the multiple languages to "compete" for speakers (think of languages as competing memes where there's not enough space for them all). Just like how when humans first traveled to new places on the globe and caused massive extinctions, so did English kill off foreign languages when it first spread to new places.

I predict that we'll reach some equilibrium in the number of languages present, and then new languages will start appearing again (probably some Internet-based languages or people will start emphasizing corporate loyalty and everyone will be speaking Pepsinese, Coca-colian, or McDonaldian).
