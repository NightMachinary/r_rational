  What does anyone think of the likelihood of there one day being a global language?
#+end_quote

Roughly equal to the likelihood of the internet staying intact. I think the internet and other global communications being destroyed would be the only thing that could really stop the possibility of a global language. I guess one other scenario that could happen would be if permanent space colonies were developed prior to the full emergence of a global language. Then the lightspeed delay might create enough separation in communication to allow new dialects and words to develop faster than they can spread.
