I put the likelihood as "high", assuming that society continues to function more or less the same.

Colonization killed a lot of languages. Globalization is killing a lot more. The reason we had so many languages in the past is that people were spread far apart and couldn't communicate with each other, which meant that language drift happened. Now, with the internet in play and increased connectivity, it seems like the pressures are all in place for languages to compete with each other until only one is left.

Language seems to me to be a sort of natural monopoly; it's more efficient if everyone is speaking the same one. Languages can only really specialize with regards to /culture/ now that geography is largely not an issue, because languages are too mutable to be missing vital features for long. There will still be /dialects/, /shifts/, and /jargon/ but a single common standard is so beneficial that we're naturally going to shift to a single one, even without government intervention.
