Has anyone else here read the comic book series "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(comics)][Alias]]"? It', getting a live-action Netflix adaptation "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)][Jessica Jones]]" which comes out on November 20th ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywZE-NEJ2Ik][Teaser 1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3s178GW0Q][Teaser 2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw7lAFlCSlY][Teaser 3]])...

...and I am reaching CRITICAL levels of hype!!!

It's somewhat hard for me to explain what this comic book means to me, but it has definitely helped shape who I am as a person. I first read it in middle school and it's been my favorite comic book ever since. It deals with the idea of "picking yourself up from rock bottom" better than any story I've ever experienced. The idea that come November 20th I'll be able to share this personally influential story with so many people...I'm ecstatic just thinking about it.
