So. [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/][Undertale]]. It's pretty much my favorite game ever, beyond any shadow of a doubt.

It's a deconstruction of traditional RPGs and video games in general. While you're given the option to fight monsters, the game tacitly encourages you to use MERCY -- talking things out with monsters in order to avoid killing them. Whether you choose MERCY or to FIGHT everything you come across vastly affects whether the game is a lighthearted, heartwarming (and heartbreaking) adventure or whether the game will treat you like the genocidal scum you play at being.

It is entirely possible to get through the entire game without killing a single monster.

The humor, to me at least, was top notch -- though YMMV on that -- if you enjoy either Earthbound or Homestuck humor, you'll probably enjoy this. And on the topic of Homestuck, the creator, Toby Fox, is one of the musicians for it, and it shows in this game; the music is exceptional, and so is the story. Most of the soundtrack is available at his [[https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/][bandcamp]], excepting a few more spoilery songs.

I really enjoyed Undertale and it's left me a tearful mess the last few weeks.
