The game is compatible with gamepads and joysticks. I played through it on an xbox gamepad with no difficulities.

In terms of my review: This game is easily on par with Tales of Game's Studios Presents Chef Boyardee's Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden, Chapter 1 of the Hoopz Barkley SaGa. It's fun to play, interesting, and comments on JRPGs / RPGs in an interesting way.
