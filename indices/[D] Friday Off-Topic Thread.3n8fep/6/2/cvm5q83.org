  I wanted the instinctive reactions of bystanders when they meet Scooby-Doo and see the (seemingly) supernatural events all of a sudden.

So first just addressing meeting a talking dog, before I run into any supernatural stuff. Hmm... is this set in the modern day? I would google for talking dog if I didn't already know about talking dogs... actually how would the existence of talking dogs play out?

Possibility 1) In this universe, maybe talking dogs are actually a rare, but scientifically known thing? I mean Scooby has relatives that can talk, right? Maybe in-universe a breed of dogs was breed to be sapient. In this counter-factual universe, I would be a vegetarian if there wasn't know to be massive neuro-anatomical or neuro-biological differences between this talking dog breed and other dogs (I would interpret it as evidence that dogs, and animals in general are much closer to human level of sapience). I would excited to meet a talking dog in person, but I would try not to be too awkward or weird about it. My googling (or maybe asking reddit for advice if I have time) would let me know how to interact in a polite way with a non-human sapient.

Possibility 2) Talking dogs aren't known in universe. I would be expecting it to be a prank or surrealist art or something weird like that. If I can rule out these possibilities, then I get suspicious of some weird possibilities. I would google search for Scooby... if I found evidence that Scooby and his talking relatives were scientifically known, I would be highly puzzled why they aren't famous... I might expect some kind of conspiracy or mass mind manipulation. If Scooby is entirely unknown to the internet and society, then I really expect some form of mind-manipulation. Once I see other supernatural stuff, I am going to be almost sure of some kind of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade][masquerade]]. I would be expecting the Scooby gang or government agents to try to wipe my memory when this was done. They are probably used to people trying to resist, so I will only put up a believable token resistance, and then leave myself hidden messages according to plans I have worked out ahead of time.

If I can make it through everything without getting my mind wiped or any other thing to make me ignore it, either Randi (assuming he is not in on the conspiracy/masquerade also), or I am probably going to heavily pursue occult knowledge/power. Depending on what type of time commitment and skill set developing magical knowledge/skill requires. I might give up working on my PhD and try to find a job that will pay enough to get by and have flexible enough hours so I can work on studying magic more.
