Thanks! In the Scooby-Dooverse I'm imagining, strange things are extremely common and the people in the know attempt to disguise it by manufacturing entirely different, yet also weird events to minimize accurate knowledge spreading.

So many people would be aware that something weird is happening but it's dangerous to get involved, and they all live in a culture where it's normal to ignore it (like how Japanese society will ignore people not acting appropriately (not sure how accurate this is, but something similar is what I'm going for)).

So your reaction from possibility #1 is very helpful.
