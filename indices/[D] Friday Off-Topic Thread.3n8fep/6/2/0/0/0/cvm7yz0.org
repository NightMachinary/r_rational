  I think that will be a really clever and original take on the whole masquerade thing.

Thanks I'm really proud of it. I just asked myself, "If in that movie, it's really obvious that magic exists with the wizards flinging spells in broad daylight and yet people are still ignorant, what could explain this effect without using any magic?"

From there I came up with either fear/caution of getting involved with high dangerous activities, knowledge it exists but there's no reliable information, or some souped-up Bystander Effect ingrained into the culture itself. Of course, why use only one method to maintain the masquerade when you can use them all!

  I would imagine there would be subreddit or two devoted to talking dogs.

There's a lot of causes/subreddits for the more benign and minor supernatural stuff, but they rarely get anywhere since a lot of people are just running some sort of financial scams, deliberate misleading groups by those in the know, and monsters deliberately tend to prey on groups like that. Of course when the Internet went down permanently, such groups dissolved.

However, while they lasted there was a large number of groups where one could learn the right things quickly enough (and caused the monsters to focus attacks on the communications systems) and that's how I imagine Velma getting a lot of her encyclopedic knowledge from and giving the gang a nice initial boost in experience to survive the initial unlucky occurrences.
