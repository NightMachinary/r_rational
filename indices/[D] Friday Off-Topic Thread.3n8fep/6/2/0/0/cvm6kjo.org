More brainstorming on the talking dog thing: I would imagine there would be subreddit or two devoted to talking dogs. Maybe some tumblr hashtags for talking dog rights? It would be kind of a fringe social issue. Religious nuts would deny talking dogs' rights, while more liberal religions would treat them as a target for evangelism.

  So many people would be aware that something weird is happening but it's dangerous to get involved, and they all live in a culture where it's normal to ignore it

I can imagine getting excited about witnessing the supernatural, then going on reddit and finding a subreddit where people are discussing similar things, only to find that there experiences are ignored by most people around them and that I am now statistically at risk for dying in a supernatural event.

  strange things are extremely common and the people in the know attempt to disguise it by manufacturing entirely different, yet also weird events to minimize accurate knowledge spreading.

I think that will be a really clever and original take on the whole masquerade thing.
