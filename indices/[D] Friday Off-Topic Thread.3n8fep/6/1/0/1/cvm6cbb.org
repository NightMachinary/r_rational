I should have read this post before writing out my first reply...

  They're too scared or incapable of handling the supernatural and whenever there's a possibility of the supernatural, everyone steers clear.

If the supernatural is known to exist in-universe, then I think in this counterfactual universe, I would have been drawn to whatever scientific field is doing the most to study it. I mean, right now I am interesting in AI and computational neuroscience because AI has the most potential to alter/influence the world, and neuroscience has so much left to learn and develop. In a world were the supernatural existed, often enough for it to be recognized to exist, but still rare, exotic and dark enough that science hasn't really studied it, I would definitely be interested in it, and I think most rationalists would (even if the acknowledged danger made it not worth the trouble to actually study).

In terms of meeting the Scooby gang, I would definitely want to talk to them once I realized they regularly encountered supernatural phenomena. Maybe try to get some phone numbers and offer to do analysis or experimentation on any previous mysteries that have leftover persisting supernatural phenomena? (They may have banished that ghost a few months ago, but they saved samples of ectoplasm that a solid analysis on could be the basis of some good dissertation work)

  Scooby-Doo talks because....well....I'm actually spoiled for choice on what to go with.
