  And you just made this setting super dark and depressing... Is it messed up that I find no working internet worse than monsters that actively prey upon humanity?

No. Absence of Internet is far more harmful to humanity than a moderate amount of supernatural predation. Supernatural predation can even end up being positive, but things are strictly better with internet than without.
