  ... And you just made this setting super dark and depressing...

Hey, I needed an actual problem that most W.E.I.R.D. folks could sympathize with. Not the traditional wasteland where everyone needs to forage for food, I want my characters to /suffer!/

I was planning on allowing localized networks to continue working, since humanity didn't lose the ability to make the tech, they just lost the ability to implement it on a national to global scale.

Phone lines are a bit of a tricky choice. I need to think about it, but there definitely should still be some allowance for localized telephone lines. The monsters just want to make it easy to isolate smaller towns, but they'd also like the ability to make a phone call. So significantly more infrastructure for phones should remain versus the infrastructure for the Internet. I need to spend some time studying just how one could shut down the Internet and what point in its history and development would the monsters have done it (they definitively wouldn't have allowed it to get to the current day's level of connectivity).

I'm thinking about how long range radio and sending low band-width texts might work.

  If buildings are getting abandoned so frequently, that might mess with the common plot

Who says I'm going for the *common* plot?
