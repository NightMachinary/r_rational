Reaction 1: ask to borrow the dog and go figure this shit out with some scientists (MRI and stuff).

Reaction 2: Leave the area for a week or two. Other people can deal with supernatural shit, I don't want to be murdered by a ghost. By the time I get back it'll either be sorted or obvious that I need to leave permanently.
