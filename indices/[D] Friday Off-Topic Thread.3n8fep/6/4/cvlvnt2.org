If a talking great dane led me to an apparent supernatural event, I would assume that either someone was pranking me with a Scooby Doo set-up, or Scooby-Doo was not fiction after all. Since the only /genuinely/ supernatural thing in Scooby Doo is the fact that Scooby can talk, I'd still assume the supernatural event was faked.
