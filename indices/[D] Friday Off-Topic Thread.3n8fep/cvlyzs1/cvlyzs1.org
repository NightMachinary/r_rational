Man, I know it's totally within the scope of this subreddit, but I've been feeling a bit grumpy about the uptick of brainstorming threads or question threads. We have tons of space since this is a small subreddit so I don't really mind, BUT STILL. Don't expect downvotes from me for this kind of thread, but don't expect upvotes either. As a general rule, I upvote almost all fiction linked/posted here in order to encourage authors.
