  Granted there are amazing things happening in the field as we get better and better at handling large amounts of data and working with neural networks, but there's a reason why some people (nowadays? or used to?) think machine translation is equivalent to true AI.

The question is not whether "true" machine translation is AI-complete. /Perfect/ machine translation is probably superintelligence-complete, because /translations are innately imperfect/, so you'd need something with extremely thorough knowledge of multiple languages and cultures to do perfect, professional-quality translation that lets consumers of the translated product really experience all the depth and nuance that went into the original piece.

The question is /how good/ you can make your machine translation /without/ superhumanly well-cultured AI. It's entirely possible that we can get "90% effective" machine translation with 30% the statistical/cognitive machinery of a real brain.
