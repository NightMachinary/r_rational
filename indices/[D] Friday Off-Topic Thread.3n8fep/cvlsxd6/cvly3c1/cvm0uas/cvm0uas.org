/gasp!....breathes/

I'm not laughing at you but rather how I used to think the same thing.

So far machine translation is at the stage where computers are really good at translating words and phrases, but they can't really do a very good job with longer sentences or idioms. The best I have seen in machine translation so far is in Google who has so much data to throw at the problem that it works but it's not feasible for translating between two languages that aren't already extensively recorded online.

Granted there are amazing things happening in the field as we get better and better at handling large amounts of data and working with neural networks, but there's a reason why some people (nowadays? or used to?) think machine translation is equivalent to true AI.
