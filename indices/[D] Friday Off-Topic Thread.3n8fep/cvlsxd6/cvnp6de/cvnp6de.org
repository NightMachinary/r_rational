Well it depends. One thing I could see happening would be two or three major languages spreading out as people pick the most common languages to learn, because those are obviously most useful. Eventually you would end up learning two main languages, much like most of Europe knows their native language and also English. So the Chinese would know English and the English would learn Chinese.

I'm not so sure it's going to happen though. English has the advantage of being the language of science. If you want knowledge, the majority of it is written in English and not translated when it comes to scientific papers and such. I'm not sure if Chinese has anything of similar pull. Whatever does happen, it will be slow. Most people don't learn new languages after they become adults.
