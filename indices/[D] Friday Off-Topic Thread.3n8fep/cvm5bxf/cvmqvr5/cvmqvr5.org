/This is advice from a real female/

People are varied and there is a wide spread of personalities across both genders. Treat all your characters as if they are supposed to be people, not stereotypes. Write your female characters the same as you would your male characters.

Speaking as a women pursuing a degree in computer engineering, I don't really feel the gender disparity. I /notice/ stereotypes and social conventions but then I choose to do my own thing. I notice that there are five other girls in a class of thirty (the only reason I notice is because everyone makes a big stink over women in STEM), and then I move on. I don't behave differently in classes with different gender ratios. Most of the differences I see between me and my classmates I chalk up to personality differences, not gender differences. People are People.
