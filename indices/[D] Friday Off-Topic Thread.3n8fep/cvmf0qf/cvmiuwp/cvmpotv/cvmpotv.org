I think that's mostly from already knowing the story. I already knew which things would work and which wouldn't, so things like the first emergency rations shipment blowing up didn't surprise me at all.

I went in to the movie hoping that it would be faithful to at least the tone of the book, and fearing that it would turn out like the movies for Eragon, Percy Jackson, The Hobbit, etc. Compared to my expectations it was awesome. It was everything I want in a movie adaptation of a book I loved. Yes, they got rid of most of the clever science Apollo-13 parts, but I can forgive them for that because they kept the plot and the tone.
