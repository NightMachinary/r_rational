This only really works if you're writing in a setting where society has achieved perfect gender equality, or you're writing a character whose gender has never had any explicit /or implicit/ impact on them (alternately, a character who you backfill the details on, but then I'd argue you're not tacking that stuff on /last/).

Like, if my character doesn't have a gender, I can't really think about how they react to their gender norms. They can't possibly be shaped by a mother who wanted a daughter instead of a son. Hell, if they have children, their experience with that child is probably a quite different depending on their gender. And the further back in time you go, the more differences you're going to run into; if your character is a reporter in the 1930s, you can't flip a coin at the /end/, because a female reporter in the 1930s is necessarily going to look totally different from a male reporter in the 1930s, just because of the way that they were shaped by society (whether that's conforming or reacting against).

So I tend to flip a coin on gender early on and think about what effect gender would have had, which causes changes even if I assume that men and women are internally identical.
