So in last week's edition of "Learning About Ourselves"...

I always thought I would like travelling, and would enjoy how my job gives me opportunities to travel, but it turns out I actually really dislike travelling. What I really like is being able to fend for myself like an adult when it comes to basic needs and tasks like food, laundry, and furnishings, and so if you ship me off to stay in a four-star hotel for a week during a conference, I feel infantilized and unhappy about it.

The fact that you're charging me $50 for three days' worth of laundry and surrounding me with falsely servile staff who feel the need to ask me for a room number to charge for breakfast doesn't help. I don't want to be /served/, I want to feasibly, conveniently take care of myself!
