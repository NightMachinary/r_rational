While /Wheel of Time/ doesn't really do anything new, it generally does things well. Particularly strong are the worldbuilding, magic system, 3rd person perspective, and endings. It was magic system drew me in as a teen. I'm hard pressed to think of other fantasy series around in the 90s that had as strongly developed systematic magic. And I stuck with them because they had good strong endings. There were satisfying payoffs to plot threads that'd had 15 years of waiting/anticipation, which is something to savour. As far as improvement, as the series goes on it gets more intricate and or sprawling - more characters, more plotlines, more details. I'd probably say books 4-6 are the high point - there's half a dozen separate plot threads in each, but they still reinforce each other through structure and theme, and come together for a big climax.
