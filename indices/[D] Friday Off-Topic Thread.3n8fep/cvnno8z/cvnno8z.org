People always hype the Wheel of Time series, so I thought I'd give it a try. Got 3/4 into the first book and just gave up. It's just so... stereotypical? Obvious? Tropey? Was all this stuff fresh and new when it first came out?

The characters annoy me. Small Town McDestiny is incapable of following basic instructions (What's that? You're in a ruined haunted city and the wizard lady has told you not to go wander? Better go wandering!). Wizard Lady is incapable of giving proper instructions and basic pattern recognition (What's that? You want McDestiny to stay close? Better give some vague and cryptic warning instead of actually telling him any actionable facts. Like, said, you could mention that you've warded the room and smoke demons will try to eat him if he leaves it. Seems like the kind of thing you'd want to know.). Missy Manhater I assume is supposed to be a strong female character, but her defining traits seem to be bigotry with a side of sexism rounded off with a dollop of stubbornness.

Now, I wouldn't care about this. I'd just brush it off as and move on. I read worse things often enough and they don't bug me at all, but everyone keeps talking like this book is some fantastic classic on the level of aSoIaF and such and I just don't get it. What am I missing here. Does it suddenly improve?
