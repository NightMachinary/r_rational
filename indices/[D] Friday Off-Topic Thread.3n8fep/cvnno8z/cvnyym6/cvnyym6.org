I had more or less the same experience with /Wheel of Time/ and was similarly puzzled. The books came out in 1990, so it can't really be that they were doing anything /new/, since so many series predate it.

Here are my twin explanations:

1. While it wasn't doing anything too terribly new, it caught a generation of fantasy readers at just the right time. Let's say that you're born in 1975. The first book comes out when you're 15. It's entirely possible that this is among the first fantasy books that you read. So you don't really know the cliches, you don't really care about the places where it's uneven, it fires your imagination.
2. The series is long, so people have buy-in. I have long had the theory that even if quality is low (something I'm not really ready to say about /Wheel of Time/, even if the first book didn't do it for me) you can make up for it with length. There's some sort of literary Stockholm Syndrome thing that goes on if someone is a million words in. So /Wheel of Time/ is long and builds up credit by being long.
