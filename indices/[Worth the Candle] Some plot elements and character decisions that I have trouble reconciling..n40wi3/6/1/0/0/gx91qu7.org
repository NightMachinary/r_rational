  It's very strange to use escalation to the strongest threats on Aerb as evidence that there's no escalation. Joon went from fighting a single zombie to being repeatedly attacked by the strongest entities in Aerb over the course of a year, and your position is that this isn't evidence of narrative escalation?

I'm talking about the escalation at that particular point. Gold Magic June beat dragons, but after that there was no imminent visible threat. Sure, if you're thinking narratively, then you can expect escalation. But then -

  The characters did create strategies around failure. It's implied they had plans to retreat in the Fel Seed Planning Document.

-if they take the narrative as gospel, then the party would have understood that Fel Seed was never going to be something they could "avoid" or "retreat" from, and death was a very real possibility. With Valencia in the picture and with the Schloss being a known entity, I just can't understand why they didn't prepare the hell-escape before attempting Fel Seed.

  I think in the end it'll be shown that Joon consented to all this (including railroading via Fel Seed) because it'll be a growth experience for him.

That does seem to be where we're heading huh... that this was all just a "dream" or a simulated "experience" for Juniper to undergo some character development. Maybe it was real, as far as he was concerned, but from an objective view, probably one of the two.

And if that is the case, more than anything, the identity of the DM becomes central to the story, as he is the one who has set the whole thing up and selected Juniper and Arthur as "players" of this "game".

Just from what I've read of the story so far and the comments interpreting it, there are a few ways this can go -

- DM is the Author himself.

If yes, this will have been just one elaborate DnD session that the Author has set up for the "players". "Who is Juniper then?", and other questions would be opened up, but that level of surrealism is difficult to imagine from this side of the screen. Has an equal chance of explaining the whole thing neatly or crashing and burning under it's own meta-weight.

- DM is future Juniper.

Time travel shenanigans abound here, and without a satisfactory explanation, would probably be a crash and burn timeline.

- DM is Arthur?

Would be very weird. Maybe he became DM after going through Long Stairs and inherited the previous DM's memories? Very low possibility of this timeline.

- DM is someone Juniper knows (Craig, or Colin, or anyone of their party members).

This is probably the most likely outcome I can think of at this point. This would explain why the DM "hates" him and wants him to change. Would open up questions about how some random dude in Bumblefuck, Kansas became a God, but I guess that wouldn't really need to be explained in too much detail (an adventure for another time I suppose). And this would also tie in the plot to the characters of the story rather than some omniscient entity doing it all for fun and games.
