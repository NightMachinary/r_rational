  The following dialogue is the only one I found that even contemplates the hurry they are in -

  “'I know,' I said. 'But that's where Uther is, and if we're going to bring this thing to a close, we have to go there sooner or later. If we don't, I'm worried about the kinds of threats we'll see.'” (ch.227)

This is why they're in a hurry. "The DM will destroy the world if we don't do X" is a very powerful reason to do X.

In-game this comment is actually the culmination of a many conversations where they discuss how applicable narrative theory is to Aerb, and it's the one where they decide the narrative is the driving force and that they need to play along. It's not, "we decide on a whim," it's "we argue about it for a million words and finally come to a conclusion."

Out-of-game, the author has posted elsewhere about the difficulty in balancing the narrative tension between the joys of wrapping-up and the risks of getting bogged in boring grindy power leveling. (Some of this conversation happens in-story as well.)

  Now, I find this decision to be weird because of two aspects of the story -

  Juniper considers the DM to be an asshole but still somewhat competent. And competent DMs would not hesitate to slap down an underprepared party, especially if they took on the final boss when there was content left uncovered, and if the party was not at endgame level.

The characters explicitly state that they're (1) at the point of diminishing returns on quest completion, (2) reaching the limits of potential increase in power, both personal and entad, and (3) already the most powerful entities on the planet other than Fel Seed.

They grind out half a dozen world bosses in one chapter. They are 95% as prepared as they can be: they've literally maxxed-out Joon's character sheet, there are no more new magics to get. Getting the last 5% would be boring to the DM, and more importantly boring to us readers, so the author needs to generate an excuse to rush things. (The player/Joon/DM vs reader/author parallels are an intentional part of the story.) Personally I think Alexander is right -- I don't want more completionist wrap-up, I want to see where the story is going.

The rush is also to generate a feeling of time pressure, to make things feel dangerous and important.

  1. The group were trying to go past the supposed last boss of the entire world. Narratively there was no way they would be allowed to just "bypass" the final boss that the DM set up for them, so it's weird to me that "going past the last boss" was even a core part of the plan.

Except that's what happened. The whole point of the Fel Seed fight is that Fel Seed can't be beaten by any in-game actions of the characters. Fel Seed can only be beaten at the meta-level by changing the relationship of the characters with the DM, and the DM's relationship with himself. The Aerb!FS fight is the parallel for the Earth!FS fight; it makes explicit that the game is only a reflection of the relationships between the people.

There's no in-game power that would let the Earth!Players beat Earth!FS, or Aerb!Characters beat Aerb!FS. The only thing that causes either Fel Seed to be beaten is Joon's development as a person.
