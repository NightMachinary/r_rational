Because Juniper didn't know the DM was railroading him towards death (if that is in fact what happened). In fact, during the walk up to Fel Seed's palace we see Juniper thinking and hoping that they'd pull a win somehow, that the DM's lesson was going to be “hey, here's what that session should have been like!” or that if they didn't try to fight Fel Seed, they somehow could avoid it entirely (this was mostly wishful thinking). Now, until the DM reveal exactly his designs, we can only speculate, but I don't think it removes player agency if there's one particular plot beat that the DM absolutely wants to happen, no matter what, how the player will react to it still matters.
