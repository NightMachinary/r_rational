IIRC the justification was just that they had already prepared for it so losing gold magic at that point was bad but, because they were already invested they decided to go anyway. Something was said along the lines of 'if we don't go now we'll keep finding reasons to postpone indefinitely' or until the DM forces their hand.

Kind of lame if you ask me but it is what it is. It feels like AW is kind of done with WtC and wants to end it, which is perfectly acceptable. I'm a bit disappointed though, I expected more from entads, when they were introduced I expected HxH fights, but what we got was just very sharp swords, and very hard armor. Sure Bethel is interesting, but I expected more things like that, rather than this sword can cut through X, or this armor is inviolable, both are clearly powerful but somewhat lame.
