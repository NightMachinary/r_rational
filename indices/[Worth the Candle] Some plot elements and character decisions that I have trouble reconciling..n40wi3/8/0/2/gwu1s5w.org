I can name several, Worm, HxH, jojo, wake of the ravager, one piece, naruto, apocalypse generic system etc.

No they aren't exactly 'items' but the magic is in general as creative as wtc if not more.

Criticizing creativity is not what I'm doing though, have you seen HxH? Do you know what it's combat is like after characters learn nen? If you do, you know it's on a completely different level..
