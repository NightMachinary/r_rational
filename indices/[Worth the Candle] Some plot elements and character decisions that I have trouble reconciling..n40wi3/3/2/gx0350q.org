  This is why, IMO, he hates Juniper.

It sounds to me like the DM has a history with both Arthur and Juniper, and hates Joon for related reasons. That's at least the vibe I'm getting from him.

I don't think he'd /hate/ Joon just because he doesn't dance to the tune all the time, he'd simply have to do something like he did to Arthur, nudge him back on track.
