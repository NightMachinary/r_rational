I forget the exact conversation, but is it possible the DM stopped caring about Aerb after Joon died and just fucked off for a nap or something? I mean there's the implied crew of underlings to keep Aerb running (the Layman, the Architect, etc), and the point of Aerb was for Arthur and Joon's adventures. Capacity for omniscience is different to permanent omniscience.
