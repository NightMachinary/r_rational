For the record, AW has written that he now basically sees Joon as an entirely distinct character, not a self-insert, or in the author's own words:

  [[https://alexanderwales.com/substantial-differences/][I've been writing the story long enough now that I don't really think of Juniper as being myself any more. Part of that is because through the course of the story, he's changed, but it's also because all of the various changes add up to someone that has substantial enough differences that it's easier not to think of him as a clone. I don't really dip into old letters, notes, e-mails, docs, or anything like that anymore, though I did quite a bit at the beginning so that I could get him as accurate as I could. I will probably never write another self-insert, unless he's much older than I am, more reflective of who I am now. But I'm glad that I'm writing this one.]]
