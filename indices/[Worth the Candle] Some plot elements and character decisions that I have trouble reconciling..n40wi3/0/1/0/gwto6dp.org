Not the previous poster, but no, Juniper requesting a fair fight would not have worked. The DM almost explicitly said as much in hell. Recall the DM asked Juniper if, in the Earth!FelSeed encounter Juniper would have shown mercy to his players, and Juniper answered that Juniper wouldn't have shown mercy due to his emotional state at the time.

The only way to beat Fel Seed on Earth would be for Juniper-as-DM to resolve his emotional issues; there was nothing in-game that could beat Earth!FelSeed. Earth!FelSeed could only be beaten on the meta-level by Juniper himself fixing his own emotional trauma. (More on this later.)

In my opinion, that's why the DM "revealed" that he hates Juniper, in order to draw a parallel between Juniper's relationship with his players and the DM's relationship with Juniper. We're past the point at which in-game combat matters, and into the part where the characters' relationships with themselves and each other matter. The transition is shown by them beating the Final Combat, the combat so difficult it cannot be beaten by combat. It's then reinforced by the fact that they have (two!) Vorpal Blade(s), a sword so powerful it trivializes all combat encounters.

In my opinion Aerb is [[http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html][The Egg]], a place created with Juniper's consent for him to resolve his emotional trauma.
