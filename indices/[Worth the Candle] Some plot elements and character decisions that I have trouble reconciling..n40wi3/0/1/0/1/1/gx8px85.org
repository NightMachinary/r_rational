The story explicitly states that Fel Seed cut Joon's head off, killing him, at the end of the first Fel Seed fight. Joon could have bottled at that point, but not tortured.

Not torturing Joon is out of character for Fel Seed. Not having Joon be tortured is in-character for Alexander though, so I appreciate we were spared chapter of Joon being tortured into insanity.
