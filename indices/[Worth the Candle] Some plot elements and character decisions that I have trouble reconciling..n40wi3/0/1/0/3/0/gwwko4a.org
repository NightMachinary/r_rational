  It firmly casts in stone that the DM is controlling whatever happens to Juniper to get him to this (his preferred) ending. No agency.

Yes. That's how the Fel Seed incident went in the real world too. The DM's behavior is a manifestation of Juniper's time as a DM. Every quirk, belief, and idea he had got thrown in, plus a few more. Played as he would have played them. Fel Seed was the conclusion of Juniper's DM career, and what destroyed his group back on Earth. It's only fitting it destroys him as well. The removal of the game interface symbolizes that this isn't a game anymore. Punches won't be pulled, or artificially enhanced anymore. Full verisimilitude.

  Juniper obviously hasn't changed much from Hellfall until his escape

It's stated that the Hells alter your psychology to make suffering less destructive to your psyche. Though I think Juniper's reconciliation with his party could have been a bit more emotional and breakdown-y, it's at least explained

  DM is the Author then? Also, if this theory is true, can of worms again. Why bring Arthur and have him go through the bullshit that he did? Why target and bring Juniper alone? Is he like "the best GM in the world" or something? What makes him so special that the God of both Worlds brought him here just to heal his emotional scars and offer him Godhood? What makes his emotional trauma stand out from those of millions of others in both worlds?

Maybe! We don't know, and it hasn't been answered in the text yet. Don't mistake unanswered questions with plotholes.

  Are dream skewered folks other people brought in to cure them of trauma? But if so why is the world built off of Juniper's ideas?

There are no other dream-skewered. That was a plant by Uther and Masters to lure Juniper.
