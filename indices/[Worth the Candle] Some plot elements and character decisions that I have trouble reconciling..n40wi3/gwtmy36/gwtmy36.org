Something I haven't seen brought up is that if I was a DM and my players' characters got obsessed with narrative when I hadn't intended that, I'd be pretty annoyed. It's immersion breaking, after all.

Now, it's hard to say whether or not it was intended by the DM - I believe the two things that set the party down that path was Juniper recognizing tropes and the discovery that Uther also believed in narrative. They might have been allowed to find out about Uther's belief in narrative, or railroaded into it. I don't think the DM would railroad Juniper's thoughts. But what I wonder is, did the party make the narrative elements stronger by obsessing about them? As in, the DM sees that they've figured out they're in a narrative and won't let it go, so now he has to create a whole narrative about narrative, except he makes it brutal because he doesn't like that he had to do this. I guess this could apply to both Uther and Juniper.

I don't know if this makes sense, I'd have to reread most of the story to get a better idea. Along these lines, I think the Dice Guy and the actual DM/entity controlling the world might be different.
