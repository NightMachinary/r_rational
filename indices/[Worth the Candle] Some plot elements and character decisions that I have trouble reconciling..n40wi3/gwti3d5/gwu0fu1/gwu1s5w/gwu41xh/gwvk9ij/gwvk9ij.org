I would reeeeallly have loved to get a few chapters focused on the in-depth exploration of ink magic. The possibilities just seem endless, more than just a glorified stat stick of a particular i-Level.

But I guess it's quite hard to write a story with the mc as a worm-esque tinker rather than a 5e artificer because said tinker can always prep time their way out of any puzzle.
