It's also partially because the outcome of the first fight seems to be DM railroaded. Like no matter what the party did before then, June or the party would've still died. It's even lampshaded in ch. 238, and I feel the party (being intelligent characters) knew this on some level.

If that was the case, I just can't seem to understand why they didn't plan for failure or death. The p-space analysis could've been done while June was still alive, and they could've set up the Hell-escape before going for the fight. Mary seems to have had 3 years to plan without too much trouble, so the hurry seems to have been a waste in hindsight.
