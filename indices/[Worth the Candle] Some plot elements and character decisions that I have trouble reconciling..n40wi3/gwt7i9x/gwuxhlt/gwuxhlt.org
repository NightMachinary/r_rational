It's the style of the original group that they argue about the morality, then jump to the end of the campaign because it seems to make sense. A different group would have a different endgame. My own group would have insisted on a full clear ("Wait the entire hex?" "I. SAID. FULL. CLEAR."), because the DM clearly put a lot of effort into everything and it's only sporting to give him a chance to show it off.
