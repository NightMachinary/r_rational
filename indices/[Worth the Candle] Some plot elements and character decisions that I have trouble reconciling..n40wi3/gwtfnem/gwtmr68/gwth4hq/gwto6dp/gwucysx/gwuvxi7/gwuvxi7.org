I think we got some foreshadowing of what's going on here from "Interval":

  “No,” I said. “Or ... maybe. Between things with Fel Seed, the Dungeon Master, the hells, and before that, Invriezen, and the locus, I've been thinking about gods a lot. About how I would do things in an ethical way. I'm thinking of opt-in danger, like there is in video games, some amount of risk and pain for people who want it that way. So maybe, if we both opted into that, then I, as a benevolent god, would have contrived circumstances so that both of us would have been stuck together in such a way that we both had a chance to learn and grow.”

If the DM really hated Joon, he wouldn't have purged his memory of whatever Fel Seed did to him. It kind of points towards this whole story being one of those opt-in situations. Thus, the conversation at the beginning of the story ("Rule Zero") is that consent.
