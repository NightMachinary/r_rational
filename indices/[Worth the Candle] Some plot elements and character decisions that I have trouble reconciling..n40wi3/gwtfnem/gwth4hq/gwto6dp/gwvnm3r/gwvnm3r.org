  Juniper requesting a fair fight would not have worked

If that was the case, then would that not be railroading by the DM at that point? Either towards Juniper's own death, or a TPK. Which implies that this was always going to be the intended end for Juniper, and that any character actions, entads, preparations, levelups etc. until that point did not matter in-story. It firmly casts in stone that the DM is controlling whatever happens to Juniper to get him to this (his preferred) ending. No agency.

Also, the hell arc was a very short time, and Juniper obviously hasn't changed much from Hellfall until his escape. If the FS encounter is supposed to be the DM showing a mirror to Juniper, nothing really changed between the first and second encounters.

  The transition is shown by them beating the Final Combat, the combat so difficult it cannot be beaten by combat.

But from the text alone, the combat /was/ how they beat it. Just a better strategy and having Mome Rath bone compared to last time.

  In my opinion Aerb is The Egg, a place created with Juniper's consent for him to resolve his emotional trauma.
#+end_quote

DM is the Author then? Also, if this theory is true, can of worms again. Why bring Arthur and have him go through the bullshit that he did? Why target and bring Juniper alone? Is he like "the best GM in the world" or something? What makes him so special that the God of both Worlds brought him here just to heal his emotional scars and offer him Godhood? What makes his emotional trauma stand out from those of millions of others in both worlds?

Or is he not alone? Are dream skewered folks other people brought in to cure them of trauma? But if so why is the world built off of Juniper's ideas?

And it goes on and on and on...
