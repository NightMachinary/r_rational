IIRC the reasoning behind the rush to the end was based on two things. First, they were hitting diminishing returns on power ups. Juniper had all the magics available to him capped, level ups weren't going to get his caps high enough to get to any boons, and they had entads coming out their ears. Yeah, there's always more sidequests to do, but the party wasn't going to win or lose based on a few points in STR.

Second and more importantly, another year or two spent on grinding would have consequences. Exclusions and entad losses which could leave them at a net power loss, but also a year or two of crises thrown at them. Things were going to be bad for the world at large. People would die. Probably not party members, but civilians. Cities.

At the end of the day, they knew they would either win or lose by the whim of the DM. The DM said lose. Can't out-grind a dick DM, so might as well lose quick and try to pick up the pieces afterwards.

As an aside, my personal read is that the plan they used wouldn't have worked the first time. The bit that some people are reading as toad assistance where Fel Seed can't dodge like he thinks he should isn't weird locus magic, it's Fel trying to activate his cheaty powers and them not working because the DM has turned them off.
