I'm not saying the party necessarily knew this; I'm saying hindsight and the Dice guy convo makes it clear that this was the win condition. We've seen several instances where Aerb exactly mirrored June's life and instances where it departed heavily. The party did seem to suspect it was unlikely they'd be able to just breeze by but they tried to as it was the best solution they could find and, when that failed, they used every trick they had basically in an attempt to win and it was only luck (read: author fiat) that kept it from being a team kill because actually ending the story wasn't the point of Fel Seed, in addition to the locus acting as the crucial element that led to the party being able to escape.

Whether it removes player agency is a matter of some debate. Personally, I don't think it does. Narrative is a clear and present force; some challenges the system will just not let you win. Arthur most certainly failed in his attempt to live a quiet theatre boy life due to the DM railroading him. But that doesn't mean he didn't have his own will and actions, which was the whole reason his theatre boy plot line ever even started. Sometimes life will change something completely beyond your grasp; I don't think this inherently means your agency is gone though I suppose it can be argued that it is diminished
