I don't think they expected Joon to die. And I don't think that Mary, going in, expected to be able to bring Joon back. As somebody else said in the main thread, that Mary retained her companion quest unlock and other non-Symbiosis powers was an act of unexpected grace on the DM's part. I don't think you can plan around that.

Important, also, is to remember it didn't take 3 years to come up with and enact the plan for death - they waited 3 years looking for Joon before taking actions that would get Rune excluded.

As far as planning for failure goes, they would have gained nothing from doing so, not that we even know Mary didn't have one of her clones working on it in the background.

From the storytelling side, it wouldn't have made it a better read for us to get the bullet points ahead of time.
