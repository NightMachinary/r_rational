Separately, I do feel some dissatisfaction with Joon's rush to Fel Seed, and feel that it would be less of an issue if there weren't remaining quests/level-up opportunities left hanging. Maybe Joon being in that state of just being done playing the Aerb campaign is really important and this couldn't be removed. But unless so, perhaps with the Void Beast lurching toward Aerb and seemingly nothing below FS in difficulty left in front of them, the decision to go there instead of allowing their hesitancy to be punished would make more sense. We /did/ get Joon clearing out a bunch of low hanging fruit with Gold, and part of that, I guess, lead to the discovery that Long Stairs connects to Earth, which interrupted clearing out quests with gold and, I suppose, you could argue was the DM hinting for them to take the path they did.
