It's not that WtC lacks magical creativity as a whole. More that it hasn't indulged in that element much in the last arc or two.

It's all "Gosh, Amaryllis sure does have a lot of enteads now, so many that it's rarely worth mentioning which ones she has with her in Sable or they've fed to Bethel. We'll do all the quests in montage-mode because Juniper is too OP, so it's not worth talking about the strategies or mechanics, and we'll have a lot of scenes with characters moping over /Narrative/ and obsessing over FS."

We also got in to the FS arc as the external world went through the trauma of 2020, and I think I recall reading that there /was/ an element of "fuck, WtC /can't/ skip Fel Seed, it's too integral to the overall story, but this isn't what I want to spend my time thinking about these days." Which would mean there is some basis for the feeling like AW and Juniper are kind of done with this whole thing.
