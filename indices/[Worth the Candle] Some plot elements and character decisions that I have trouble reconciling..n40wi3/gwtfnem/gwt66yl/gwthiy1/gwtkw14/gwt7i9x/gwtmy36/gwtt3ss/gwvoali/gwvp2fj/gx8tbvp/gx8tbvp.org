  >This is why they're in a hurry. "The DM will destroy the world if we don't do X" is a very powerful reason to do X.

  That only "tells" the viewer though.

No, the characters have had in-character conversations about the importance of narrative dozens of times, including explicit conversations about how fast they have to progress through fights due to narrative concerns.

  After Juniper acquired Gold Magic there haven't been any proportional threats other than the Dragon Fights, and after that there hasn't been further escalation (other than the call of the Gold).
#+end_quote

It's very strange to use escalation to the strongest threats on Aerb as evidence that there's no escalation. Joon went from fighting a single zombie to being repeatedly attacked by the strongest entities in Aerb over the course of a year, and your position is that this isn't evidence of narrative escalation?

  Do you feel that no matter what they did the first time around, they would have failed? Do you think the characters at least on some level understood this? If yes, then I can't understand why they didn't create a strategy around their failure.
#+end_quote

Yes. The DM explicitly stated that they were guaranteed to fail the first time around. While the DM isn't 100% reliable as a narrator, I think this is true because the point of Aerb!FS is it mirrors Earth!FS, and Earth!FS was not beatable in-game.

I do think the characters understood that Fel Seed was unbeatable. It's shown in how Joon talks about Fel Seed breaking the rules due to "bullshit" and similar.

The characters did create strategies around failure. It's implied they had plans to retreat in the Fel Seed Planning Document.

  >it makes explicit that the game is only a reflection of the relationships between the people.

  If that's the case, what's the point of the world and the story then?
#+end_quote

That is an open question. Note that "what is the point of Aerb" is one of the central questions of the whole story.

  If everything is resolved as per DM fiat, it opens a whole can of worms that I've detailed in other comments as to the nature of the world and the aforementioned question.
#+end_quote

/Everything/ isn't resolved through DM fiat. You're viewing this as too black and white. In normal D&D, the DM /can/ resolve everything by fiat, but usually they /don't/. There's dice, and collaboration, and interplay.

You might as well ask "what's the point of D&D when the DM can resolve everything by DM fiat?" It's the same question, but more clearly confused. The answer is, of course, people play D&D because the players and DM enjoy the experience, even though the DM /could/ resolve everything by fiat.

That issue of consent is central to D&D, and it's central to Aerb. Joon has already been shown to have consented to play in Aerb. I think in the end it'll be shown that Joon consented to all this (including railroading via Fel Seed) because it'll be a growth experience for him.
