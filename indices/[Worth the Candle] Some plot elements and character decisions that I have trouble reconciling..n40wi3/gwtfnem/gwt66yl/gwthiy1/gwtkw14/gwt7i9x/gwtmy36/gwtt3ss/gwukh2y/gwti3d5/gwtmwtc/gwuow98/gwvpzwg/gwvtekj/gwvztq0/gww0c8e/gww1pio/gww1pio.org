As the text shows, most of the dangers were due to the party themselves. Specifically the infernal issue is due to Valencia and the Runic exclusion is due to Amaryllis. Void beast moving a little bit was probably the only thing that the DM nudged, and even after 3 years, it hasn't affected the world yet.

And in that time they were able to set up Onion's sword and Mome Rath's bones. Both of which they could've set up in the first run itself after a few months/years, if they had prepared.
