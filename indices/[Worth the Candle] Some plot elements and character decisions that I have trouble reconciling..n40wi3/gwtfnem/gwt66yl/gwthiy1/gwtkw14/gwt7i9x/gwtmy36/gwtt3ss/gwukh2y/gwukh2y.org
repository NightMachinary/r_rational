I think that though joon would have died in the FSEZ basically no matter what, they could have prepped for that contingency better. Though the rest of the party did get out, it was a very close thing, they should have been prepared (though maybe only the locus could trump fel seed in getting them out). At the very least, they should have already thought of a way to ensure joon goes to hell instead of oblivion, already had a basic list of avenues to pursue to rescue him, and maybe even try to go for more levels so that, if not to help against fel seed, help the party via twinned souls + symbiosis (most likely avenue is using joon + grak to finish the 13 horrors quest (though I don't remember if fel seed is included on that. if it is, then that's kinda moot, though clearing EZ'S still gets XP).
