  Sure, if you're thinking narratively, then you can expect escalation.

You understand that Narrative Theory has essentially been proven at this point? The DM appeared, said, "you couldn't win because I hate you," then sent Joon to hell. That's proof positive that Narrative Theory is correct.

Saying "if you're thinking narratively, then you can expect escalation" in Aerb is like saying, "if you believe in gravity, then you can expect things to fall when you drop them." Thinking narratively is the only valid method of interpreting the facts at hand. If you fail to think narratively, you will be confused because you're missing a major driver of how the story unfolds.

  I'm talking about the escalation at that particular point. Gold Magic June beat dragons, but after that there was no imminent visible threat.

There are a handful of named world-level threats waiting in the wings: The Void Beast, the Other Side, infernal unification, and more. It's pretty trivial for the party to receive notice that the Other Side is banging on the wall holding them out. To say nothing of arbitrary problems like "random mad scientist causes rune magic exclusion."

But again, you're looking at this backwards, even if they were running out of threats, which they aren't. In a world without a DM, running out of threats means time to relax. In a world with a DM and a Narrative, running out of threats means it's time to face the world boss. Most important of all, running out of threats in a story means its time to face the world boss, because reading about characters getting another +1 skill up is boring. Facing Fel Seed is the only thing the characters could do from any analysis that takes into account that there are two ongoing narratives driving the plot.

  I just can't understand why they didn't prepare the hell-escape before attempting Fel Seed.
#+end_quote

"We have a plan to rescue someone from hell ahead of time" trivializes the hell arc even more than it was, so I don't think that's valid from a storytelling standpoint. There are in-character reasons as well, but I think good storytelling is the driver here.

  And if that is the case, more than anything, the identity of the DM becomes central to the story, as he is the one who has set the whole thing up and selected Juniper and Arthur as "players" of this "game".

I don't envy Alexander trying to prevent a "this was all a dream" let down. But since this question is core to the story, I'm assuming he's had a compelling answer ready from the first day. No idea what it'll be though.
