  This is why they're in a hurry. "The DM will destroy the world if we don't do X" is a very powerful reason to do X.

That only "tells" the viewer though. After Juniper acquired Gold Magic there haven't been any proportional threats other than the Dragon Fights, and after that there hasn't been further escalation (other than the call of the Gold). Raven also implies that the Dragons won't get involved further after Perisev's death. And after the Gold Magic loss, there hasn't been any immediate threat in front of them.

Remember that in-story it took 3 years for things to get worse and even then, the worst parts were due to Valencia's open approach to hell and Amaryllis detonating a rune-bomb and excluding rune magic (both due to the party's direct action).

Heavily implies that the pacing of the adventure was for the most part within the party's control.

  The characters explicitly state that they're (1) at the point of diminishing returns on quest completion, (2) reaching the limits of potential increase in power, both personal and entad, and (3) already the most powerful entities on the planet other than Fel Seed.

Mome Rath's bone and Onion's sword were the key aspects of defeating Fel Seed during this run, both of which they didn't have in the previous fight, which somewhat undercuts this.

If the world is set up to be at least somewhat consistent, we have to assume the same strategy would've worked previously, but DM dialogue indicates that it might have not.

Do you feel that no matter what they did the first time around, they would have failed? Do you think the characters at least on some level understood this? If yes, then I can't understand why they didn't create a strategy around their failure.

  it makes explicit that the game is only a reflection of the relationships between the people.

If that's the case, what's the point of the world and the story then? If everything is resolved as per DM fiat, it opens a whole can of worms that I've detailed in other comments as to the nature of the world and the aforementioned question.
