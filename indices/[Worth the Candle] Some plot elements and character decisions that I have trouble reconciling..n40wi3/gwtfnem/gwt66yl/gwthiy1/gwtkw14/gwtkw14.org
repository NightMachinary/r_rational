I think this is undercut by the fact that the DM isn't competent in the sense that he's built the world as a place for the players/characters to have fun, learn, grow, etc. He's built it for his own amusement/edification, and Arthur and Joon were basically NPCs from his point of view. It's why he was so upset and frustrated when Arthur wasn't taking up the Call to Adventure that the DM was offering. If he had wanted Aerb to be just a fun campaign for Arthur, he would have simply rolled with Arthur wanting to play a bard/theater troupe story and gone with it. Forcing him to become an action hero was because that's what the /DM/ wanted, and he gets some gratification from the fact that his MC is a real, thinking person dancing in the palm of his hand.

This is why, IMO, he hates Juniper. Juniper flatly refuses to play the game and follow the Narrative as if he were a character in the story at any level. From basically the start, Joon has been playing Aerb as a pseudo-DM/game designer rather than a player, dissecting the systems thinking about why the DM set up the world and how he would do it differently. The DM hates this because he wants people to play /his/ game, and Joon just keeps saying, "Yeah, but your game is stupid".

They decided to rush at Fel Seed since by that point they realized they weren't playing the game against Aerb, they were playing against the DM, with Joon increasingly annoyed at being forced into playing by the DM's rules and Mary increasingly worried that this would lead to a direct confrontation with the DM that they'd inevitably lose.

The confrontation with Fel Seed essentially became that confrontation, with Joon trying to see if he could just force his way past the DM's systems and the DM asserting that he has absolute power, but that he no longer has any interest in playing with Joon or trying to force him into Narrative like he did with Arthur since Joon would just bitch and complain about it the whole time. So, the DM smacks Joon down, declares the campaign over, and walks away, hence Joon losing the UI layer and becoming essentially no longer being the main character of the story - just a super-powered dude bumbling around Aerb at his leisure.
