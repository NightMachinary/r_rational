Yeah, I think there are two possibilities regarding the DM now:

1. He's genuinely over-and-done with Joon and is essentially just letting him play in sandbox mode, without setting explicit quests or targets, and is just gonna sit back and let Joon do whatever with Aerb before rolling up his next world or whatever

2. He's double-faking Joon, pretending he's no longer involved/interested just so Joon stops trying to play "against" him and does something interesting with Aerb rather than trying to constantly circumvent the Narrative.

If I understood the timelines correctly, the DM and Joon's conversation takes place after the 3-year timeskip, when the DM can be reasonably sure that Mary will rescue him from Hell, so his attitude in that conversation of "this is the end of the line and I'm not gonna be paying attention to you anymore" doesn't make much sense unless he's either deceiving Joon or just so genuinely frustrated at the way Joon approaches Aerb that he's walking away, not buffing Fel Seed cause he doesn't care to try and teach Joon anything, and just gonna let the chips fall where they may.
