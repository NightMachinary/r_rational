After 3 years of watching Joon be tortured and Aerb without Joon his hatred has chilled but not left. The 3 years reveal makes that conversation even weirder. The DM showed up to insult Joon, criticize his Fel Seed/narrative thinking and tell him he's being "abandoned" out of DM hatred. Even if the DM kind of timeskipped to that time that raises a ton of questions, like why he came back etc.
