Eh, I think he says "I hate you more than I care about you" or something to that effect, which to me implies that he views Joon as having a negative effect on other things he cares about more than Joon. If he is in some way a projection of Joon-as-DM, then Joon's need to exercise control and influence over campaigns and maintain DnD sessions as his essential safe-space in a life he didn't much enjoy otherwise could be manifesting in the DM as a value system totally wrapped up in Aerb or other created worlds.

Joon is an existential threat to that norm, or like a bobcat that's stuck in your garage. You probably don't care about the bobcat itself in any meaningful way, but you might hate it because of the damage you think it's likely to do to the things that you do care about in your garage.
