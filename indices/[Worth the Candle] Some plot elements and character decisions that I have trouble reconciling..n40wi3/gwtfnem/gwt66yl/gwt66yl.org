Re: your conclusion about Narrative:

One thing to keep in mind is that while Fel Seed cheats, that's /his/ gimmick. Others don't cheat means other encounters weren't at the DM's whim. We always knew the DM had the /power/ to railroad everything, the application of that power in the case of Fel Seed isn't necessarily evidence of a will to use it in other contexts.

I don't fully understand the implications of Joon's loss of the interface, but one thing it signals, I think, is that the campaign is over. If the willing suspension of disbelief per Aerb's simulationism is over too, well, that may be entirely the point.

Not that if I had absolute editorial powers right now, I wouldn't want to use them to request changes (a longer Hells arc, leaving Juniper in a fix while we shoot back up to Amaryllis, more detail and coolness factor out of Joon's new magics pre-Fel Seed attempt#1, overall more time spent inside Joon's head wondering at things), but the story hasn't ended yet, we have no idea how the elements that we have in front of us will combine together to create payoffs or achieve the thing which AW has almost certainly had in mind since he started writing this.
