Fel Seed cheating is a gimmick only as long as the DM allows it, which means that fight hung entirely on whether the DM would let them win or not. Prior fights almost always relied on the party's level of preparedness and cooperative ability.

Do you think a "prayer to the DM" for the fight to be fair from Juniper before the first attempt would've led to the same result?
