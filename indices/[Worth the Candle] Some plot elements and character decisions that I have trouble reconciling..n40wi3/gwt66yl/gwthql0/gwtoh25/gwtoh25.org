    Do you think a "prayer to the DM" for the fight to be fair from Juniper before the first attempt would've led to the same result?

Personally, I don't think so. The entire point of Fel Seed was to mimic Earth!Juniper's Fel Seed, which was designed as unbeatable within context of the session, because June felt like being an asshole. And then the point is, if June had gotten a chance to do things differently, he would've given the party the ability to win. This would somewhat involve retconning Fel Seed' OP-ness but it's not really a typical ret con in context of story; it's just June "redeeming" himself and being nicer to the players because June's growth as a person is kind of the point of a lot of this, from my perspective.

Fel Seed's defeat condition was, and always has been, "die to me first and earn your victory on the second run". I don't think the second run could've just had the party walk up and hit him with a pool noodle because then that would also ruin the point of the session. But I do think the scales were heavily tipped in the party's favor narratively on Try #2 and that they probably could've chosen 1 out of any 10,000 solutions that required them trying hard honestly and they would've gotten the dub.
