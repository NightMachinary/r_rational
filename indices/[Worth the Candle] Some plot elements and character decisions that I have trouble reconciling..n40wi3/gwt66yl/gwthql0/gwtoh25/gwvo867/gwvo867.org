So in the context of the story, the DM was railroading Juniper towards dying or having a TPK when fighting against Fel Seed?

On a story level that completely removes player agency though. That implies that whatever they did previously, no matter what level they got, no matter what entads they got, they were still going to get beaten the first time around.

And if this was obvious in text (chapter 228 does heavily imply it), then why did the party hurry to Long Stairs in Round 1 without any solid plan other than "let's wing it and hope DM is in a good mood" (a huge departure compared to previous fights)? Why not create a strategy around dying, why not attempt to Schloss a way out of the hells beforehand, why not base your entire strategy around dying to Fel Seed after a "fair fight" and coming back for a second round?
