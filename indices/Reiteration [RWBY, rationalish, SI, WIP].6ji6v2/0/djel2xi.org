/tl;dr - In this post I entertain myself with extremely silly rules-lawyering./

So I was reading chapter 4 and I realized that the initiation rules--which are the same here as in canon--are written poorly.

The first person you make eye contact with is your partner, so what happens if Alice and Bob make eye contact followed by Bob and Charlie locking eyes? Using a hyper-literal reading of the rules, Alice would be Bob's partner, Bob would be Alice's partner, Bob would /also/ be Charlie's partner, and yet Charlie would /not/ be Bob's partner. This, of course, violates the symmetry property that the "is a partner to" relation is presumed to have, as well as what you might call the "exclusivity" property, i.e. each person can only be a partner to one other person (formally: for all x, y, and z such that x is a partner to y, x is a partner to z if and only if z = y). The rules should've said, "the first person you make eye contact with /who has not already made eye contact with anyone/."

And while I was writing this, it occurred to me that the rules as written would also allow you to look in a mirror and partner with /yourself/. It doesn't say, "the first /other/ person." XD
