When both are satisfied. I'd like it to be long enough that I get a good feel for the story and its pacing. I'd also like to see how it handles canon events. RWBY season 1 is pretty short as far as most seasons of things go so it shouldn't take very long to go through it. Of course, this is fanfic, so things like length and pacing are subject to change.

So I'll be waiting until you're almost done arc 2 then, which is fine. :)
