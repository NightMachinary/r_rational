This was submitted a year ago, but it's had semiregular updates since then and I felt it might be worthwhile to get it back in the public eye. Expect a PTSD-filled SI with the attendant paranoia and shortsighted coldness, but s lot of intricate plotting and smart action. Does a good job of making the world of RWBY feel actually complete. Think of this as a slightly worse Shinobi: Team 7, but for RWBY and with an SI.
