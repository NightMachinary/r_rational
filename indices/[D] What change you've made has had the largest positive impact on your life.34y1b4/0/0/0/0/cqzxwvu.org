It might be more on-point to say that isolation is bad for mental health.

In my observation, one pattern that seems to work for introverts to stave off isolation, is arranging many regular meetings with a few well-known people. Not being an introvert myself, I can't comment on whether this is actually less draining than 'accept social events by default' , but it sounds like it should be. In any case, since I see this actually happening, I guess it must seem to work out positively to the introvert in question.
