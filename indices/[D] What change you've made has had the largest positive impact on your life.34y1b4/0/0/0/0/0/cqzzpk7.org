For me, I work by a criteria of whether or not people I know will be there. I'm perfectly fine if my friends are at the event or if it's something that really interests me. If the event is not interesting and there will not be anyone I know there, then I won't go. I rather meet new people through my friends, classes, or the social events I like to go to.

For comparison, I'm a mild introvert. I prefer my own company most of the time, but I take the time to interact with others and I do find it enjoyable meeting strangers if it involves something related to my interests.
