This is kinda weird, and almost the opposite of the thread's implicit purpose, but...when someone gives me advice, I attach a high probability to it just not working. People love to give advice, and it's frequently well-intentioned advice, but a great deal of the time it's just cliched nonsense or patterns inferred from insufficient data. Giving useful advice that generalizes across differences in individual circumstances is /hard/, and to a first approximation, no one can do it.

I've found it much more useful to sit down, analyze the situation explicitly, write down my assumptions if I'm uncertain and imagine each one being false (this is like the #1 most awesome thinking/debugging tool I've found), and then build my own solution. Use advice and the experience of other people as /information/ you can use to build your own solution, not a solution in and of itself.

There's a lot of literature written by highly successful people, saying things like "I used these 3 principles, and went from rags to riches". People often jump on these like maniacs, ignoring the fact that random factors are always a major component. A few principles do seem to work, but they're hard to find and rarely guarantee success. It's easy to fall into the trap of using the ones that feel good or profound or something like that.

My position on advice developed once I read a Quora thread on intellectual giftedness that was full of fairly obvious things about being gifted. The one post that got my attention was that advice that works for normal folks will fail for gifted people, because giftedness has some correlation to cognitive unconventionality. So attempting to force yourself into standard patterns is likely to fail.

Following /that/ principle has paid off well, and I don't think it's limited to gifted people at all. Individual variation is way too great to let yourself be fully defined by your culture, or religion, or society, or what have you. Much better to become a "nation of one" and use the intellectual flexibility that comes with that.

And...er, bear in mind that this post may not generalize well to other people either. ;)
