No, I don't have citations, beyond the hypothesis that if there were that significant of a variation between two organisms, they would be less likely to be the same species.

As for your article, it indicates that a transplant of gut bacteria from an obese person to a non-obese person can cause the non-obese person to gain weight. This does not implicate genetics (it was a mother-daughter pair, so the genetics are already similar) it implicates gut bacteria.

It is more likely that the obese daughter had gut bacteria that processed food in a different way from the gut bacteria the mother had, and the mother did not update her diet properly to the new gut bacteria.

It is, in my opinion, more likely that the gut bacteria of the daughter were made sub-optimal by the daughters unhealthy eating habits, than that the daughter had genetics sufficiently different from the mother that she wound up with a different set of gut bacteria and resulting obesity.

When the sub-optimal gut bacteria were transplanted to the mother, they contributed to the mother's obesity by performing as if they were in the daughter, perhaps extracting nutrients in a more efficient manner, perhaps extracting the wrong nutrients, and the mother did not adapt her diet correctly in a timeframe to avoid obesity. In no case whatsoever did the mother gain weight due without consuming calories in excess of what was actually expended in activity.
