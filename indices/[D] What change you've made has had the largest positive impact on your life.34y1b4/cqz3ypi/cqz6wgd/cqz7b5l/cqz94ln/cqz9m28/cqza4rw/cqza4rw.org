    You observe food choices and portion sizes and physical activity levels.

  These are the things that make up a calorie deficit. These are the habits you will absorb.
#+end_quote

Assuming your body functions sufficiently similarly to theirs that you can do roughly the same activities and eat roughly the same amount of the same types of food and end up at roughly their weight. Choosing a social group that has lost weight doesn't guarantee that, but it's better than chance.

#+begin_quote
  If your social group meets over 430 calorie frappuccinos and has 2 of them while socializing, it's not going to be people who are thin, unless they are also extraordinarily active.
#+end_quote

Which brings up another point: you're going to do the things appropriate to the venues and activities you meet for rather than strictly aping your peers. If your social group meets over coffee, you're not necessarily going to notice that you're choosing the 400 calorie drink while everyone else is choosing 50 calorie drinks. By choosing a social group that has lost weight, they're more likely to notice it, mention it, and choose venues and activities that make those habits less available.
