i dont think the point was genetics so much as significant variations(i.e. more then "a few percents") between different people.

the article was supposed to show that, not genetics specifically.

About you guess regarding the cause, as far as i remember the point was that the women gained all of this weight by eating medically mandated food rations as before the surgery.
