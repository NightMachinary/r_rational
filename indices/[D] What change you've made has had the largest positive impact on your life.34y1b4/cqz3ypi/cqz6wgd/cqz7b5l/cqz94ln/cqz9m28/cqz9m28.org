  You observe food choices and portion sizes and physical activity levels.

These are the things that make up a calorie deficit. These are the habits you will absorb.

  If you surround yourself with people who are healthy and thin and manage it without appreciable exercise or paying attention to their food habits, you won't much benefit.

People who are thin without paying attention to their food habits, already have food habits that make them thin. They don't need to pay attention to them.

If your social group meets over 430 calorie frappuccinos and has 2 of them while socializing, it's not going to be people who are thin, unless they are also extraordinarily active.

If your social group meets for a participatory athletic event, it's generally not going to be people who are overweight unless they're consuming said frappuccinos afterward.

Hanging with the right group is not sufficient, but it is helpful. If weight is an issue, the right group can help deal with the issue. The wrong group can sabotage the efforts.
