Well, the best change in my life was my Free State Project move, back in 2009.

I suppose extrapolating that into general life advice would be "Surround yourself with people who have similar goals and ideals as the person you want to become".

This can be done without even the extreme effort of moving cross-country.

Want to stop smoking? Surround yourself with non-smokers

Want to lose weight? Surround yourself with healthy people.

And, of course, the reverse is true as well.

Want to be productive? Stop hanging out with lazy people.

Want to be rich? Stop hanging out with people who spend money carelessly (be they rich or poor)

You will unconsciously emulate the habits of the people you spend the most time with. Or at least I do, and I don't believe I'm that much of a mutant.
