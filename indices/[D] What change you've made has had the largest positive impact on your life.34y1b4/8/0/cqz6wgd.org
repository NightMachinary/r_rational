  Want to lose weight? Surround yourself with healthy people.

You mean /thin/ people, not healthy people. Overweight people can be healthy. You're also ignoring genetic components and diseases that can cause weight loss and weight gain.

If you want to lose weight, talk to a doctor to determine why you are at your present weight. Then, assuming that any relevant diseases are taken care of, surround yourself with and emulate people who have lost weight and kept it off.
