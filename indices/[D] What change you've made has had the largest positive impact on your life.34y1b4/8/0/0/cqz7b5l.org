No, I mean healthy people.

Overweight people are at a significantly increased risk for multiple diseases and conditions due to their weight. This is not healthy.

Yes, there are genetic factors. If your genetics are bad (cause you to be overweight, and thus at increased risk for other diseases), then you are not healthy.

If you have a disease that causes weight gain, you're not healthy, you have a disease.

If you're overweight, you are consuming more calories in food than you expend through activity. Reduce consumption, increase activity. If you have a disease or genetic condition that makes you prone to weight gain, you will have to reduce consumption and increase activity more than a person without those issues. But no matter what condition you have, it does not defy thermodynamics.

After you lose the weight, there may be underlying conditions that still require treatment, so consulting with a physician may be a good idea, if some ill health remains.

"Healthy" overweight people will tend to still have the kind of bad habits that cause being overweight. If you associate with them, especially in social settings that involve food, you will continue to have those habits reinforced by your social group.
