Just taking your hypothesis as fact and living by it without any actual data seems hardly rational.

Here's some anecdotal evidence for you: When I compare myself to some of my slightly to moderately overweight friends I eat roughly double the daily amount of food as them and of roughly the same type (lazy student food). I, however, am /underweight/. I also eat more than anyone in the family, including sweets. Yet I weigh less than any of them even though only my father reaches me in height. My sister isn't even an adult and weighs more than me (slightly overweight). Again, I know for a fact that her food intake is less than mine and also that she is more bodily active than me (not difficult when taking into account that I don't do /any/ sport and frequently spend a day or two mostly in bed.

Of course I could be some kind of mutant but I've noticed more people whose food intake didn't seem to be on par to their body weight so it can't be /that/ rare.
