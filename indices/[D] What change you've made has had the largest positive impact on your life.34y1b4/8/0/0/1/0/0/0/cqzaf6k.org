  Assuming your body functions sufficiently similarly to theirs that you can do roughly the same activities and eat roughly the same amount of the same types of food and end up at roughly their weight.

Yes, I'm assuming you're a human, meeting with other humans. Human biology is not that diverse. Genetic variation in metabolism isn't going to account for more than a few percentage points of difference in calories in vs calories out.

  If your social group meets over coffee, you're not necessarily going to notice that you're choosing the 400 calorie drink while everyone else is choosing 50 calorie drinks.

I'm also assuming that the change in your social group is part of an intentional effort to lose weight, where you are inclined to pay attention to your own choices.

Like I said, it's not sufficient, but it helps.

Pulling numbers out of thin air, if you're 50% likely to lose weight without altering your social group to include more healthy people while committing to reducing your weight, you're 60% likely to do so with altering your social group. Yes, these numbers are made up. No, I don't have a study to back them. They are a guess based on personal experience.
