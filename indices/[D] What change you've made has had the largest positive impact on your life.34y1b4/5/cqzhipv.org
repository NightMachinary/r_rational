- In college, after 6 years of being a writer, becoming a computer programmer instead, because it made me happier.
- A few months ago, after 20 years of programming, becoming a writer instead of a computer programmer, because it made me happier.
- Getting married.
- Getting divorced.
- Founding 3 different startups and making different mistakes each time.
- Getting out of startups to a job where (YMMV) the majority of people are not sociopaths.
- Quitting that job because the clients clearly wanted to get rid of us.

Life is where you find it, and the choices you make right now that will have the biggest impact -- for better as well as worse -- will not be right later on. Make a habit of re-evaluating periodically and seeing if you've outgrown any of your prior choices. That's the real lesson I can offer.

Also, a useful but less important lesson: choose your career path, don't let it choose you. If you're a programmer, learn a new technology every month and a new language every six; if you're something else, do the equivalent. No matter what you are, always be thinking what you want your next job to be and actively set yourself up for it through study and networking.
