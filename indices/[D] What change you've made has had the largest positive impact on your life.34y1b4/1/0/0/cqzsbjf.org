  Are there any other factors that might account for the change in productivity, or is it very clearly sleep that's the culprit?
#+end_quote

It could simply be being up early, and not the actual sleep. I certainly did sleep in before, though my sleep was very inconsistent. So it might be the consistent wake time, the wake time being early, or just consistently getting a similar amount of sleep rather than the raw amount of sleep itself.

  What field do you work in? Would you say it's a field with obvious floors and ceilings to productivity, or is it a field where it's realistically possible to be 10x, or even 50x as productive as the average worker?

I'm an actuarial student. Still looking for my first entry level job. But I notice a HUGE increase in my ability to retain information as a study for my next exam (actuaries take a lot of exams) as well as a significant increase in my practice test scores. I'd say that an estimate of three times as many brain-fart type mistakes while on less than a full nights sleep would be reasonable and probably conservative. I can go from getting 10 questions (out of 35) wrong purely out of stupid mistakes to making only a few mistakes. It is /very/ noticeable. Honestly, I think back on all the tests I got very little sleep for in high school and college, and all the stupid mistakes (on said tests) I couldn't believe I made... ugh. Not fun to think about.

  How important is creativity in the work you do (asking because things that you wouldn't expect to impact creativity often do, eg caffeine, alcohol)?
#+end_quote

At the moment not very. I just study, apply for jobs, and tutor on the side. Its really the information retention that I see such a difference in, as well as the elimination of "brain farts." Brain farts being mistakes that I clearly shouldn't be making given my comprehension of the material.

  Are you measuring productivity, and if so, how?
#+end_quote

The three times thing is based on my ability to do practice problems combined with the lack of dumb mistakes. Its just an estimate.
