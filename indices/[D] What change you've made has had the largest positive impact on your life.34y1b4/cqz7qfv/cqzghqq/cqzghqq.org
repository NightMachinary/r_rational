I have some of the worst habits of anyone I know when it comes to sleep, so hearing that it made you 3 times as productive is eye-opening.

So some questions, if your willing to answer them.

- Are there any other factors that might account for the change in productivity, or is it very clearly sleep that's the culprit?

- What field do you work in? Would you say it's a field with obvious floors and ceilings to productivity, or is it a field where it's realistically possible to be 10x, or even 50x as productive as the average worker?

- How important is creativity in the work you do (asking because things that you wouldn't expect to impact creativity often do, eg caffeine, alcohol)?

- Are you measuring productivity, and if so, how?

Thanks
