Sleep 9 full hours a night.

Seriously. Sleep is severely underrated from a health and productivity stand point.

Go to bed early, get up early. Get your Benny Franklin on.

I have trouble sleeping. I used to stay up really late and occasionally sleep really late. I'm at least 3 times as productive now that I go to bed before midnight and wake up before 930.
