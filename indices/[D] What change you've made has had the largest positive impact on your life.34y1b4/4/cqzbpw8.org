Getting into social dancing (swing, blues, and contra are all good choices). This can to some extent also be read as a recommendation for social physical activities in general (e.g. casual sports, rock climbing, canoeing).

For the long term, though, it might be some more blue-sky activity like "reading some math textbooks."
