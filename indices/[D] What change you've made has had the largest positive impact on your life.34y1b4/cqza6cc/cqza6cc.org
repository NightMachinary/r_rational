Give up drinking any sugary drinks = low-hanging fruit to eat more healthy. Ironically I'm often underweight due to my quick metabolism, but that's been slowing down since I entered college. So I also have friends to go to the gym with. Quick way to go cold turkey is to drink nothing but water for a few days. Soda will taste overly sweet afterwards.

...

Double-major = Not the best choice for everyone, but it's been pretty good for me to know that I will have a lot of flexibility in my future career when I graduate with a BA in Cognitive Science and Computer Science. Just the increased confidence in my future has been pretty helpful. Therefore I recommend having a solid plan for the next few years to get a sense of security.

...

Finding a good role model in my older cousin = He introduced me to HPMOR and I respected him so much that I wanted to be like him. Since we were pretty similar in personalities and how we lived our lives, I had a sneak-peek into how my future might look like and could anticipate certain choices I would be making. If you can find someone who acts like you and can from similar circumstances or lifestyle but is living a good life, then ask them how they got to that point and copy them. Multiple role models would be good in this case.

...

Join a social group = I joined a group with a common interest in computers and as a result I'm invited to a lot more social events and my introversion doesn't 'trick' me into staying in my room all the time. Find a club or social activity you can go to weekly or more often.

...

Learn a second language = I'm learning ASL now and it's so invigorating to be able to 'talk' in multiple languages and to understand another culture. The problem most people (in the US anyway) have with learning another language is that they try to learn in a school setting and when they fail assume it's because they are inherently bad at it. But if there is one subject that the public school system is bad at teaching above all others is foreign languages. Taking the time to join a club which meets weekly to have conversations in the foreign language will teach you more in days than months of classroom learning. I recommend buying or renting a textbook to learn a few phrases and the culture behind the language for a start. Then find a class/club to join. The public school system is bad because of the focus on grades, but a class/club available for anyone of any age to join tends to be more focused on actual proficiency and is more of a casual environment to learn in. A quick way to tell if a class/club is very good is if the teachers require you to only speak in the foreign language while in the classroom (it's okay if they allow speaking in English for the first half or something similar).
