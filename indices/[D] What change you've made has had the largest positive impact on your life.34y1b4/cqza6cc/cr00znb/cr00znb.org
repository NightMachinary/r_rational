Oh man, I can totally second the thing about sugary drinks.

And, if I may say so, there are times when it kind of sucks. Because I had gotten into a habit of having soda with pizza or with certain kinds of pretzels, or with cheez-its, and now it feels weird to not have soda with those things, but the soda is absolutely disgusting.

But I've been months without soda now. Almost a year, if you don't count my two or three abortive attempts to have soda with one of the aforementioned foods, only to dump my glass down the sink.

(Also white bread and non-Greek yogurt: I can't stand those either)
