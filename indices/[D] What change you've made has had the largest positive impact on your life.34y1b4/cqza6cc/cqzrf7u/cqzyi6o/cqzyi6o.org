Thanks for the compliment! I'm curious, what stood out to you as being a particularly good choice on my part?

I'm planning on taking a look at potential graduate schools over the summer (I'm a sophomore going onto junior) and the biggest concern I have is deciding whether or not I can handle the stress of the course work and thesis/projects. Can you give me a good idea of how difficult it was for you to go through grad school as compared to college? Bonus points if you were part of a research group as an undergrad and can compare it with research as a grad.

  What's your near-term (five to ten years) goal?

Mostly just spending time learning and enjoying my life as a college student. After all, these /are/ likely to be some of the best years of my life. ;)

However after I graduate, I know that I would love to go into research in cognitive science or work in the field of AI research. I seem to be leaning towards cognitive science because it's just so much easier for me to do better than the majority of the students in my classes and I'm working on a research project in building a language corpus from the words children (six months to four years old) are exposed to as well as another research project I've been accepted into for junior year. My dream goal would be to get famous and rich off of developing some sort of intelligence enhancement drug/therapy. I promise to give the people here a discount. ;>
