  I'm curious, what stood out to you as being a particularly good choice on my part?
#+end_quote

Most people don't have the self-direction necessary to front-load their learning in life. While you're young and in school, you can spend waaaay more time on study, and subsequently research, than when you get to be a "real adult" and have to keep money coming in all the time. This applies whether you choose a "career in" industry (where you have to write and ship productive code for your boss all day) or academia (where, as a full professor, you would have to keep grant funding coming in for your grad-students).

Most people [[http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/][half-ass their youth with everything they've got]], or just /entirely/ half-ass it. I did the former, and now wish I hadn't.

You can do much more interesting stuff as an adult if you've front-loaded your learning, and you can also do much more interesting stuff as an adult if you /keep/ learning, rather than if you do like some of my friends and let yourself forget everything you learned in school once you've got a job.

  Can you give me a good idea of how difficult it was for you to go through grad school as compared to college? Bonus points if you were part of a research group as an undergrad and can compare it with research as a grad.
#+end_quote

Undergrad research is designed for undergrads. You can have a good time being someone's "trained monkey". (I have heard undergrad researchers /actually referred to this way/, being a grad-student.) However, once you're in grad-school, you need a /much/ more solid mathematical background in your subject than you needed to get through undergrad.

I did not know real analysis, optimization, abstract algebra, category theory, or statistics when I entered grad-school. At the very least, I managed to leave knowing some bits-and-pieces of optimization, and a solid grasp on statistics and machine learning, and a fair grasp on the Coq proof assistant and type theory. My actual thesis was in empirical software engineering, partly because that was what my advisor did, and partly because without a lot more background, I couldn't do anything more mathematical.

(Which is why I'm studying a bunch of maths in my spare time right now! Think we should do a textbook recommendation thread?)

Also, grad-level research is more stressful, because it is your career riding on doing rigorous research /and getting positive results to publish even though rigorous research sometimes doesn't yield those./

  I'm planning on taking a look at potential graduate schools over the summer (I'm a sophomore going onto junior) and the biggest concern I have is deciding whether or not I can handle the stress of the course work and thesis/projects.
#+end_quote

That depends how you define "can handle". If you are well-organized and can take care of yourself well, you can complete a PhD without acquiring any new mental illnesses. But it will be stressful, no matter what.

But then again, industry work is usually /also/ stressful, but often far less in-depth and interesting.

  Mostly just spending time learning and enjoying my life as a college student. After all, these are likely to be some of the best years of my life. ;)
#+end_quote

Undergrad can be. But it seems to me most people who say that are like the people who said similar about high school: they're spending more time not-working than working, and so will be screwed when the next thing happens and society didn't allocate them a Designated Job to step right into.

  However after I graduate, I know that I would love to go into research in cognitive science or work in the field of AI research. I seem to be leaning towards cognitive science because it's just so much easier for me to do better than the majority of the students in my classes and I'm working on a research project in building a language corpus from the words children (six months to four years old) are exposed to as well as another research project I've been accepted into for junior year.
#+end_quote

I also recommend cog-sci, on grounds that it's actually a rigorous science. Far be it from me to claim human cognition is the only possible kind, but imagine trying to design an aeroplane if you can't explain how and why a bird flies! No, what you need is not a theory of flappy-flap, but you /do/ need one of /aerodynamics/, and both cognitive science and theoretical neuroscience are much more closely investigating the information dynamics of cognition than AI, which [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/m5c/debunking_fallacies_in_the_theory_of_ai_motivation/cc0v][seems to focus on taking a bunch of philosophical theories and thinking very hard about their philosophical implications]], rather than on figuring out how an actual embodied mind has to work to do its job.

  My dream goal would be to get famous and rich off of developing some sort of intelligence enhancement drug/therapy. I promise to give the people here a discount. ;>
#+end_quote

Well, that /does/ sound +paranoid+ ambitious enough. And thank you for the discount; I in turn solemnly swear not to destroy the world under any circumstances.
