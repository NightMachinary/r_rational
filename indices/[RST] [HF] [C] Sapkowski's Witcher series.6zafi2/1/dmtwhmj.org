As much as I love the Witcher series, I'd have to say no.

The core plot of the 1t arc revolves around at least 2 instances of incredible improbability (Geralt stumbling upon Ciri in Brokilon and then stumbling upon her in the aftermath of the slaughter of Cintra). Which should be of no surprise, since Fate/Destiny is the motif of the /entire/ series. If I were to name a more rational and even rationalist take on a similar theme I'd say "Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn" is a must read.

You do have a point that there are no Big Evil characters, only a bunch of selfish psychopaths with too much power.

There are gods, one of them even interacts directly with then-atheist Yennefer.

The worldbuilding started quite inconsistent with Yennefer and other mages being able of more or less traditional fairy tale magics, i.e. turning people into frogs. There was an apparent rework and systematization effort once Ciri's apprenticeship arc starts, so you'd have a point, but only if you discard first two books.

Not much to comment on the writing style, it /is/ good, but style is irrelevant for RT/RST. It just makes the read pleasant.

In no way Geralt is a rationalist. He doesn't use any semblance of the scientific method (because there is none invented) and relies on chance again and again i.e. the conclusion of Toussaint arc, again is /pure/ luck, or fate if you will. The most rational character is probably Vysogota (a scientist, duh) and perhaps Dijkstra.

There was a rational core to the world building, where Sapkowski does subvert a very common trope of a simpleton defeating a monster. Instead he says that if there are widespread monsters, killing them would be totally commercialized (and this is the rational seed). The trope is mocked directly in the story about the golden dragon (forgot the name though, the one that poisoned the 1st dragon)

Yes, the theme of mythologization of the actual events is explored in detail, but that doesn't mean the actual events deserve RT tag. It is used masterfully as a way to have an outside PoV to recap global events without focusing on the boring stuff.
