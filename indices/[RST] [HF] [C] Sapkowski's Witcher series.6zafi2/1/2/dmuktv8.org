  The trope is mocked directly in the story about the golden dragon (forgot the name though, the one that poisoned the 1st dragon)

It's playing with old Polish fable about the Dratewka cobbler, almost all of his short stories are "what could be the real history behind fables in fantasy world". Also I don't think amateur having a good (and rational) solution once in a while makes the story irrational. It actually makes it more believable. Among all of the books Geralt killed dozens of monsters, and the amateurs have solved a problem once? That's Sapkowski's trademark - showing the general rules and exceptions. I think it's more believable than rules that work 100% of the time.
