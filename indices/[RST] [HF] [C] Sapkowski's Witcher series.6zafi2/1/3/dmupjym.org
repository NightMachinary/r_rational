  The worldbuilding started quite inconsistent with Yennefer and other mages being able of more or less traditional fairy tale magics, i.e. turning people into frogs. There was an apparent rework and systematization effort once Ciri's apprenticeship arc starts, so you'd have a point, but only if you discard first two books

I don't think that's inconsistent. Yennifer is an archmage with tens/hundreds of years of experience; Ciri is a novice. It makes sense that Ciri is only capable of more restricted, more structured forms of expression, whereas Yennifer can do whatever she well pleases.
