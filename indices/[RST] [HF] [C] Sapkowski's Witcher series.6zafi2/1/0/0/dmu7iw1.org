Well, the terms rational and rationalist fiction are defined in the sidebar of the sub, and I think there isn't much ambiguity there. So yes, this is science porn in a way. Internal consistency porn would be probably a better term.

The story being rational does not guarantee its quality. But it's not as easy as you think, otherwise rational fiction wouldn't be so scarce. It's definitely not easy writing a /good story/ that is rational at the same time.

I'm not frustrated with inconsistent power levels, I'm just noting that it makes it harder to call the novel rational as defined in this subreddit. The biggest issue though is that /a lot/ happens solely because 'the plot requires it' and for no other reason.

  You severely underestimate the probability of incredible imporbability.

My survivorship bias sense is tingling. If I were to make a guess, your grandparents and perhaps the colleague were not Asian, and your grangran was crying in a crowded place (a trasportation hub perhaps?). This alone would bump the probability of the event considerably. Yes, finding a person in a populated area is easier than in the wilderness, because you can /ask/, provided your target doesn't hide intentionally.

By the way, my parents met by pure chance too, so what? Had they not, they'd find someone else, which is okay because neither of us are prophesied heir of the elven bloodline yadda yadda. Our conversation, while being improbable is also unimportant. Ciri was inherently important in the story.

Another crucial piece you're missing here is the notorious repetition of the improbable events in the Witcher. Yes, Geralt finds Ciri /once/, which is improbable, but acceptable. What is less acceptable (in rational fiction, not in fiction in general, mind you) is that he finds her /again/ and then /again/ by pure chance. That is another key difference between your story and Geralt's.

Heck the writing is on the wall, the book is called Sword of Destiny, there is no other way around it.

  That is a slightly outdated approach. At least, since Levy Strauss's la Pensee sauvage.

I was using that rather broadly. To put it another way, Geralt isn't really good at rationalist techniques or having /any/ system whatsoever. As I recall, there is actually a direct opposition between his approach and that of Yennefer and the Lodge, who try to solve their problem methodically. And fail, by the way. If memory serves, Geralt is even called out at some point for basically having a death wish (by Regis, I think?) instead of actually having a working plan, /any plan,/ to find Ciri.

Yennefer got a jewel for her comm device after a divine revelation.

tl;dr. Great fantasy series, but not fully rational, definitely not rationalist, therefore not mentioned here.

Also, yes, HPMOR is the gateway drug to fanfics.
