  if I switch now my lawyer's mode and rewrite the OP in a casuistic way to match every single keyword on the side bar, will that be satisfactory?
#+end_quote

Since you opened your OP with discussing why the Witcher series is not mentioned in this subreddit, I'm going to ignore sarcasm and answer: yes. This is a simple basis for the existence of the subreddit. We recommend and discuss fiction that fulfills certain criteria. [[/r/EarthPorn][r/EarthPorn]] doesn't allow images with any man made objects. Does this mean that that man-made landscape can't be beautiful? No, it just means that [[/r/EarthPorn][r/EarthPorn]] wants your submission somewhere else. Likewise, [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is a place to discuss fiction that is such and such. There is no secret knowledge here and you can discuss whatever you want outside of the sub, no one cares.

  because modern science hadn't existed before that time, therefore, people could hardly rational and

What? No. The reverse is closer to the truth, all the scientific advances have done very little to make people behave more rationally.

  of course, couldn't be rationalist in that time.

If we are talking about delving into cognitive sciences in detail like HPMOR does, then perhaps. But that doesn't mean you can't use logic to demystify a phenomena, or that you can't construct your story with enough foreshadowings and clues so that /the reader/ can figure stuff out.

Besides, in fantasy genre you can stretch the boundaries of the age of reason quite a bit. It's fantasy for a reason.

  therefore, the writer has to add Mary Sue there in order to match criteria of rationalism. and Mary Sue is what makes bad prose.
#+end_quote

What? This is nonsense. Rationalism is just one aspect of the character, balance it out and you're fine. Your protagonist may be rationalist but that doesn't mean they can't make mistakes or can't face insurmountable difficulties.

Case in point: HPJEV. Yes, if you are writing a RST fanfic, merely upgrading your protagonist would make them a Sue indeedy, because rationalism/munchkinism is a powerful tool. But that's exactly why Yudkowsky upgraded not only HJPEV, but Quirrelmort as well. EY even said something along the lines if you give Frodo a light saber, then you have to give Sauron a death star.

  and this method, about finding a missing person in China by sitting in a random public place in random time in random town - well, did you try that by yourself to recommend that as having a chance of great probability?
#+end_quote

You're missing my point here. It obviously has a greater probability than wandering in the wilderness, since you meet more people that way and each meeting increases the chances of success. I specifically said /provided your target doesn't HIDE intentionally/ so your police example is irrelevant. A normal person is easier to find in a city because he freely gives away information about his identity to anyone he meets. These people then can spread this information further. A person in the wilderness gives information to /no one/, and it doesn't spread.

And it obviously has a better probability because it happened /just once/ to your grangran as opposed happening at least thrice.

  we are talking about fantasy world full of jinnies, intelligent monsters and ancient spirits. that would be a bit naive to call anyone in that world a believer on the ground that they interact with an element of their normal environement.

You said that there are no gods and if something happens it's never a deus ex machina. I'm just showing the apparent contradiction. Whether or not Yennefer became a believer doesn't matter. The jewel moved the plot, that is all.
