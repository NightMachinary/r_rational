  The core plot of the 1t arc revolves around at least 2 instances of incredible improbability (Geralt stumbling upon Ciri in Brokilon and then stumbling upon her in the aftermath of the slaughter of Cintra). Which should be of no surprise, since Fate/Destiny is the motif of the entire series.

Not sure what I think about witcher overall (it's been too long and my memories of the books are hazy), but fate being involved doesn't automatically disqualify it. Sure it does provide some leeway for the otherwise improbable events, but it's not like they happen solely "because plot requires them". Things are happening because destiny is influencing events, with effects observable to and exploited by the people inside the fictional universe.
