Towns of 25 000 would be bigger than any city in Witcher universe except Novigrad and maybe capital of Nilfgaard. And don't forget that nowadays <5% of people live from farming, and then it was >90%. They had to live near their fields. That makes for a very different population distribution.

Also USA is the odd one, when it comes to density, I wouldn't use it as representation of a typical modern country.
