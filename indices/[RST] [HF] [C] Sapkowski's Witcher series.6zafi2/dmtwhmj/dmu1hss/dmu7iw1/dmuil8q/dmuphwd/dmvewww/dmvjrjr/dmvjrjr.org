Yeah, you did. If you call a meditation, trance, and a divine revelation which made the sorceress relive Odin's discovery of the runes (an adapted version) a "negotiation", yeah, I call that quite a misinterpretation. It's literally a negation of "if something good happens, it's never a deus ex machina or triumph of justice", full stop. It's an instance of a higher, supernatural, and previously largely unknown to the reader force gracing the protagonist only because she passed a moral purity test. Comparing this to human negotiations is either stupid or dishonest because no human counter-agent would be able to conduct such a test.

Yes, the public library in Imaverysmartown has a sizable collection. Plus, it's a nice town, good community, you'd fit right in. They do have a problem with their plumbing and sewage systems, though. They just keep leaking all the time. Tut-tut.

  I'm going to say no.

Then don't ask a question if you're not ready to accept the answer.

Why don't you guys recommend the excellent Witcher books? -- Because they don't fulfill our requirements, even if they're great. -- Bu.. bu.. but muh excellence!
