I'd personally argue that for something to be a real idiot ball, the character has to act more stupid than he's normally been shown to be.

I don't think that's the case with Harry in that scene - by the point he got to releasing Bellatrix, he had a long and well documented history of repeatedly trusting Quirrel blindly even though doing so was obviously quite retarded.
