I'm not sure it fits the definition (I agree about The Destiny being a convenient plot device too often), but it certainly has some rational elements that are done very well. I'd say better than anything than I've read.

The characters and politics is done very well, even better than in HPMoR I'd say. Characters aren't as rational in general, but they act accordingly to their intelligence, consistently, and have sensible (if wrong) beliefs and use what they can to get their way. Their emotions are portrayed very realistically and the connection between emotions, rationality, and actions are where I think a lot of rational fiction fails flat.

I don't know if Geralt's relationship with Yennefer is "mature", but it certainly is both interesting and believable. And yeah, female characters in Witcher world rulez. There's a big cast of interesting women, so they can have flaws and quirks, and be different from each other. They don't feel like the typical token female protagonist, in fact they feel like just another character. And still the world in which they have to live is sexist and it makes sense.

Politics is dirty, and is done by almost everyone, at various levels. Some of the agents are competent and some very incompetent, and still the results doesn't only depend on the rationality of the given side (but it increases the probability the plan will work). The dirty political tricks used in the story are very realistic (minority scapegoating, exploiting rebellions of opressed, economical warfare, using prejudice and stereotypes), and feel very modern (muslim refuges in EU / Isis -> nonhumans in Northern Kingdoms / Scoiatael), despite being written in 80s-90s.

In general Sapkowski portrays the probabilistic nature of the universe very well. There is no "conservation of importance", and no "100% rules". Grand strategy of a brilliant general can fail because one scout was too afraid to check for enemy presence and lied in his report. Whole country can fall because a messenger with important information died in unrelated incident. Character that is amazing at swordplay can be killed by a peasant with a fork if he gets too cocky and fights in a crowd.

It's like Sauron wins because Frodo died of food poisoning while in Mordor.

I think many rational fiction too often end up as competence porn, where the character always wins using science and superiority in one aspect or another. It stretches the pretense of rationality, and Sapkowski avoids that, he goes out of his way to present the general rule and an occasional exception.

Also I think the rational core in the worldbuilding is not only the existence of Witchers, the whole universe is build a little like sci-fi story, with a few assumptions (magic exists, many worlds exist and sometimes temporarily join). The world builds on that, and is quite consistent (for the mess of mythologies glued together that it is :) ).
