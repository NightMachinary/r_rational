Well, cities in the desert are actually fairly easy to justify. Rivers can erode through a layer of rock and change their course, or even fail to flood at all. Goats can eat through all the vegetation, and there are other forms of artificial desertification as well. Human beings could have fought so many wars over that city that they salted the land around it, killing off the vegetation and desertifying the area.

All of these rationalizations are taken from the actual history of the Middle East, unfortunately. "Fertile Crescent", and all that.
