Right, but then you still need the support structure to keep that city alive (assuming it's not a ruin, in which case you don't have problems). The city needs to get its food and water from /somewhere/.

Heck, you can even have a city deliberately built in the desert, like Las Vegas, so long as you have some thought put into how to explain it.
