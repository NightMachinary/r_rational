And even if you've got clerics casting "Create Water", you still have a lot of questions. Sure, the clerics are providing food and water for everyone ... but does that mean that every city in the world is only where it is out of inertia? If cities are totally disconnected from the supply of water and food, why do they really exist? Does creating food and water have no opportunity costs associated with it? And if it /does/, then what justifies the expense of a city in the desert? What kind of trade routes are there that go to this city? Does no one have the ability or desire to turn their desolate surroundings into not desolate surroundings?

The point isn't really to have answers to these questions in the text itself, it's that you can find /cool stuff/ by not doing the handwave of "oh, magic". You think about why people have chosen to live in this desert city instead of somewhere else. And then you get answers like, "There's a mineral deposit far beneath the city, and the city exists primary to support that mine" or "It's the holy city where Optija began his pilgrimage" or "The city /does/ exist mostly through inertia, from a time when it wasn't desert, and the cost of keeping it in food and water is a constant stress for the caliphate". And that takes you from "there's a desert city because I thought the story needed one and it would be a good change of pace" to "this is the desert city, which exists on its own, for the following reasons and in the following ways".
