No, they're talking about these enormous cosmopolitan cities that you sometimes find in fantasy settings. Like ... there's no river running through it, so where is the water coming from? There are no fields surrounding it, so where are they getting food? A shimmering city in the middle of desolate sands is a cool visual, but it's got to have some kind of underpinning to it (usually magic). At least, if you want to write something grounded.
