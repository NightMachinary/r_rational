Writing Excuses in general is pretty great. Someone should grab all the episodes that specifically apply to [[/r/rational]]; there are ten full seasons now, all online. Every episode also has a writing prompt, which are usually pretty good, like the one for this episode:

#+begin_quote
  You have a city in the desert. There's nothing around it but sand. Figure out why that city is there, how they survive and how they support all the people.
#+end_quote

Top-down worldbuilding is something that's quite important for this sub in particular. If you want cool laser swords and hoverboards, you need some way to justify them; some technology that explains them away, or some quirk of magic that makes this practical, economical, etc.
