Not to mention that the supposedly rational character treats the entire series of events stemming from acceptance of seeing a movie together as probability 1 events unpredicated on information obtained during those events. Eric is far more rational in this case considering events in the causal chain as probabilities, not certainties.

Of course I could be mistaken and she could have already evaluated all possible information she could obtain and has come to the conclusion that Eric is either someone she wants to sleep with or an inevitable rapist (Those are the only outcomes I could come up with that fit the p=1 causal chain, let me know if there are others) regardless of any additional information. Since she effectively declined, I can only assume Eric is a rapist.
