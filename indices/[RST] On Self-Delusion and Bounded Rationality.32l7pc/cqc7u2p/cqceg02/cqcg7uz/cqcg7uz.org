Fiction or not, it is ridiculous and doesn't seem to be satire. None of the characters are rational. The closest it comes is a self-proclaimed hyper-rationalist that is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan][pointy-eared and packed with straw]] who is barely outside the event horizon of their own ego. With the invocation of such a /caricature/ of rationality represented by the of the protagonist in the beginning combined with the continuing theme of inevitable conflict between this "rationality" and happiness, this piece strikes me as if it were an irrationality apologetics piece (if such things can exist).
