Excuse me while I break down laughing. Oh, the social problems of having more speed in your thoughts than almost everyone around you, and too little sense of uncertainty!

  I became a brat about it. I demanded that my mom buy separate meat and dairy dishes, went on a hunger strike until she did. On Shabbat I threw a tantrum whenever she or Shoshana toggled a light switch, or carried something outside without first tying it around their wrists so that it would count as clothing. A religion, I reasoned, couldn't be half-true. If you believed it, if you took it seriously, then how could you wear leather shoes on Yom Kippur or let a siddur fall to the ground without kissing it?

OH MY GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO DID THAT!

  What form could the evidence take? Ditziness, perhaps, or mad, head-over-heels, 'irrational' romantic love. I'm such a fool, I couldn't bring myself to cheat on you even if a man with more resources or better genes came along. Can we not see how genes for ditziness could spread through a population? Of course, the ideal strategy for a woman would be to fake ditziness while she's wooing men, yet call on a hidden stash of rationality for other purposes.

Uhhhh... you don't think love is a real thing? Who are you, Robin Hanson?

  Intelligence, rationality, clear understanding---the points I'm making could apply to any of them, insofar as any of them could make one's promises or threats less credible. But my dad developed a more detailed model. He defined Type-0 thinking to be that concerned directly with the truth about the world. To find out whether astrology works, a Type-0 thinker might test its predictions against those made by rolling a die---and would inevitably conclude that it doesn't work. By contrast, Type-1 thinking is concerned with the truth about which beliefs are most advantageous to hold. A Type-1 thinker investigating astrology might first go to nightclubs acting as though he believes it---"Hey baby, what's your sign?"---and then go acting as though he doesn't believe it, so that he can calculate which belief is the more often smiled upon by Venus. We can also define Type-2 thinking---concerned with the truth about which beliefs about the truth about which beliefs are most advantageous to hold are most advantageous to hold---as well as Type-3, Type-4, and so on. My dad pictured the mind as an uneasy cohabitation of all these types, with one dominant one minute, another the next. The types quickly diminish in importance, though, the further removed they are from the world: Type-728 thinking is unlikely to have much survival value.

That's nice, but in fact, it's completely divorced from how hierarchical inference works. In real hierarchical models, correct inferences require more data as you move further and further up to the hierarchy.

  What if a hugely successful religion were founded, which taught that burning fossil fuel is a sin against Petrola, the oil-god?
#+end_quote

Story waiting to happen.

#+begin_quote
  Such a religion, if it saved civilization, would also save its libraries and universities and particle accelerators. Hence, even if your sole concern were the advancement of knowledge, you'd still have to concede that it's better---more moral---for people to believe in Petrola than to know the truth of His nonexistence.

Not quite. A delusion beneficial in one situation has knock-on negative effects in almost all other situations.

  But what of those such as I, to whom clear understanding has brought only misery? Am I to hope that, in the hereafter, a rationalist God will reward me for having the intellectual integrity not to believe in Him?

Oh? You think you'll keep existing after you die?

Actually, that's only true for teenagers. Get over yourself and ditch your virginity: life gets a lot better afterwards when hormones and curiosity stop emphasizing the wrong bits of all your perceptions.

  Those who presume to answer such questions use what's called anthropic reasoning.

  Reaching for the flashlight under my pillow, I found On Self-Delusion and Bounded Rationality and opened it to page 34. And there it was, in the first paragraph: "so straightforwardly that the derivation could be done, I think, even in an extremely weak system of inference."
