So the premise of this story is that rational agents cannot precommit, and rational thought is inherently opposed to social skills and happiness. /sigh/ lovely.

If this wasn't obviously written by someone who self-identifies as intelligent, it would be an especially offensive batch of sour grapes. As it is, it's merely heartbreakingly sad :( The poor author.

Why does this story think that /mentioning sex/ is the same as rather insultingly turning someone down? Maybe social mores have changed over time ...
