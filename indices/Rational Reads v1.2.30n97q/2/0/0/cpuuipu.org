In this kind of situation I'm always tempted to supplement absolute ratings with quantiles. Even if 98% of works have ratings between 4.5 and 5, the statement "x% of works have ratings lower than this work" still conveys useful information. The difference between 95% and 80% is a lot more vivid than the one between 4.8 and 4.5 stars.

Every time a see a rating system in which all the action is in the upper end of the scale, I just itch to improve it somehow.
