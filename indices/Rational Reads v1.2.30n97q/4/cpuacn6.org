One of the features I would like is something similar to reddit's hot comments/topics thing. When searching for fanfics on fanfiction.net, I often find myself sorting by updates, because sorting by reviews means I'll be seeing the same fics for the first fifteen pages.

Basically, what I'm asking is a sorting method that's a combination of update (and/or publish) date, number of reviews, and rating.
