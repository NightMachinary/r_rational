Sorry, I didn't realize until I started coding that the app is largely a backbone application. If you didn't mind having a server-generated user profile page I'll still get that built, but it wouldn't match the rest of the application's approach.

I've had too many bad experiences trying to untangle backbone apps - no two people seem to use it the same way :-\
