Requested features:

*Rating analysis tool*\\
A feature that lets you see the average rating you give works, other users average ratings and the *meta cough* average average rating. Maybe even a bayesian estimate of your average rating based on the average average rating.\\
Purpose: This feature would allow users to see if they actually use the whole scale from 1 to 5 when you rate, or if you give just about everything a 5, which seams to be the case right now.

*Consistency of design*\\
Have a horizontal line between each of the works in the "Highest Rating" list. This is the case with all the other lists.\\
Purpose: It's a nice touch

*Completion*\\
Instead of being a set of tags, this attribute should be chosen with a drop down menu when added.\\
Purpose: The states Complete, Dead, Updates Slowly and Updates Quickly are all exclusive to one another. Plus this feature would be easier to use as the current system is sort of boged down due to all the other tags.

*Editable works*\\
What happens if a work dies? Or if you have a better description of it? Or if some one disagrees with the tags the work has? Well, I recon some sort of voting system should be in order for the first two. Regarding the tags it makes sense to let anyone add their own tags and then pick out the top N tags a la last.fm.\\
Purpose: Cause it'll get messy otherwise, given time.

*Advanced search options*\\
By author. By date (started and last updated). By length. By rating (average and bayesian). All this should really be integrated with the Browse option. Look at Anime News Network for a good example.\\
Purpose: Well maybe the data base isn't that big right now but in three years time we'll have twice the amount of works written just by people in this sub. Advanced search is the browsers delight.

*User added tags*\\
Pros: Because you undoubtedly missed something important about rat!fic. Cons: There would be tons of different ways to describe the same thing. Text normalizing could help here.

*Adjectives to go with the ratings* Like "Virtually perfect", "Mediocre", "Decent" and "Lousy".\\
Purpose: Anything to make people stop rating everything a 5 or 4. Srs, this way I'll get very bad info about what's good. Right now it's probably better to just look at the number of ratings than the average or the bayesian estimate.

*Maybe a "Home" button?*\\
On the top bar, with the same function as the logo.\\
Purpose: Seams like a rather common redundancy, but maybe not really necessary.
