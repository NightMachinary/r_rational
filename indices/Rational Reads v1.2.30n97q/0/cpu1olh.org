The feature I would /most/ like to have is the ability to see the top-rated stories by either (a) any specific user or (b) all users that gave 5 stars to a particular story.

The purpose is content discovery - right now, we can look through an overall list by rating or by comment-count, and those are the only ways we have to find content we haven't read yet. With either of these features, I can start with a story I really like and produce a list of other stories that are at least worth looking into.

(a) is easier to implement, but (b) preserves more privacy. If you think you'd like feature (a), I'd be happy to pull-request it, I'm a rails dev too. Just don't want to waste the effort if it doesn't fit your plan for the site :-)
