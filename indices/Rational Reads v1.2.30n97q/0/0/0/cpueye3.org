Oh, the recommendations engine is definitely better than nothing! The problem with that type of approach is that it collapses all of preference-space into a single dimension, which means that exploring subspaces of your own preferences (well-written naruto fanfiction for example) is not greatly aided. There are several such stories in the first few pages of my recommendations (and possibly that's all there are at the moment), but a system like this one allows one to continue exploring the preference graph in arbitrary directions, instead of getting a single list necessarily weighted heavily towards the types of fiction I've already found /good/ examples of :-)

I'll get you a pr tonight, hopefully.
