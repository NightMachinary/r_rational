I think the story is not just about exploring how she could create a utopia, but how she could create a utopia ethically. The conflict is less about whether she /can/ use violence/coercion to change things--she absolutely can, it's emphasized that there isn't much anyone could do to stop her--and more about whether or not she /should./ It's not exploring the question of how real people could improve the world, so much as it's asking what moral limits and obligations a person should have if they had that much power to inflict violence. The meta-explanation you've given for her not punching dictators into paste is interesting, but I don't think the story requires it to make internal sense.
