If someone knew how to change the world, they wouldn't be doing it all by themselves because the world is big and they are small. Instead they'd be starting easily understood, easily scalable and easily replicatable social domino effects.

And writing an easy to read, entertaining narrative showing people how someone would go about building an instance of such a beneficial cultural-economic memetic virus that can spread through humans themselves, would be an excellent way of actually creating that cultural-economic memetic virus.

When a rationalist says: "ideas good enough to change the world can't spread memetically because they're too complex and nuanced for the average idiot to grasp" that says more about their own maps of other people's minds than the actual territory of those minds.
