  Lisa spread out her arms. “Alison, being super strong is a great way to change the world. You know why? Because super strength doesn't exist. If there was an easy way to change the world, someone would have done it by now. Or rather, the world is already changed by the superpowers we're all born with. The Greeks understood this: the fire from the gods that represents human intelligence is a superpower. Not only can it change the world, it has changed the world. We can lift cars over our heads, it's called an airplane. We can shoot lasers into people's eyes to fix their vision. And thanks to working from home, we can wear underwear on the outside of our pants and no one can say anything about it. No one built any of that alone.”

I am very confused by what this paragraph is supposed to mean. Taken together with the subsequent paragraph about living in a fictional world....none of that means that her superpowers don't exist. They still do within the confines/strictures of the world they inhabit. And it starts out by saying that "super strength would be a great way to change the world, but it can't because it doesn't exist, but also, if it could, it already would have because we can already do those things with technology", which, in addition to being contradictory, I just don't agree with. There is value and power in being able to combine abilities into a single package. To make a trivial example, a modern smartphone is /so much more useful/powerful/ than carrying around a separate phone, calculator, camera, audio recorder, compass, etc. etc. etc. /because it's all in a single package/.

And more broadly, I'm not sure I get what the overall message of this short story is. It's clearly meant to communicate /something/, I'm just not sure if it's supposed to be some kind of critique of SFP, or of superhero stories more broadly, or how to change the world, or what.
