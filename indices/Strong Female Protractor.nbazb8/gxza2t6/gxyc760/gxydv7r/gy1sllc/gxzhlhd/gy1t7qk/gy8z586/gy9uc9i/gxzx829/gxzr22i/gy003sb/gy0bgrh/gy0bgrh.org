This "story" is kind of a hodgepodge---in the original draft, it more explicitly explored the idea that Alison-the-character is looking for ways to save the world without using super strength because super strength literally doesn't exist in our world, and Alison is meant to represent real people, not superheroes. So given the story's rules, [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2305][Alison should be able to create a utopia]], but the story isn't about super people, it's about real people.
