Worm seems like the worst crossover for SFP. yes, they both fall within the broad umbrella of 'realistic Cape story', but they go opposite directions with it. Worm realizes that in order for superheroes to make any kind of sense, the world has to be much, much more violent than it is. So you get nazis and conflict drives. SFP decides to investigate what happens to all these super powerful individuals when violence doesn't make sense but the world still has problems.

Allison loses everything interesting about her character if punching harder is what's needed to resolve the problems in the story.

Similarly, Worm loses most of what makes it interesting if someone is able to punch hard enough to solve its problems without moral compromise.

With this crossover, you can't tell a SFP story until all the problems from the Worm setting are resolved, and you can't tell a proper Worm story until Allison starts getting outclassed, which won't happen until at least Leviathan.
