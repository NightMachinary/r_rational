I want to write literary essays about /Strong Female Protagonist/ but I don't know where to post them so I have to disguise them as rationalist fanfiction :(

Is this the first SFP fanfiction? Is there an award that comes with that? /Is this the first and only time in history that rationalist fiction has preceded smut in a fandom?/
