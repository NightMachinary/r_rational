  Or rather, if we accept the hypothesis offered by several philosophers that super powers exist in our world because our world is a fictional one created to tell a compelling story...
#+end_quote

I took a few philosophy courses, and this wouldn't be even close to the weirdest causal chain and hypothesis I've heard a philosopher propose, but how does anyone arrive at

"Super powers exist"\\
"Super powers create compelling stories"\\
∴ "We live in a fictional world"

as a reasonable argument? If "Creates compelling stories" is a reason to be in a fictional world, then:

"All kinds of fictional settings can be imagined by authors in our world"\\
"Authors use those fictional settings to write compelling stories"\\
∴ "We live in a meta-fictional world"

Now we just need to wait for Mega Girl to realize this and decide to take up writing inspirational rationalist super-duper-powered fanfiction as a means of changing the world at all possible levels above her fictional world.

Also, I couldn't help but imagine this as the face of Strong Female Protractor:
