  “Lots of people are being ruled by dictators right now, and you could just go in and punch the dictators into paste, and everyone would know you would do that so no one would want to be a dictator anymore, and while that wouldn't solve all the world's problems, it would be a big improvement.”

Huuum... that's extremely debatable?

Leaving aside any parallels to existing US foreign policy, it's not like individual dictators are the source of all government problems.

General corruption, and a general absence of security and public goods that leads to a prevalence of protection rackets, gang violence and police brutality are /extremely/ common problems, that absolutely cannot be solved by targeted assassinations.
