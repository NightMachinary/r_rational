To explain that one paragraph, at least, it's saying something slightly different. Super strength is a great superpower for Alison, because she's one of very few people who have it. It's like you say - she's got a lot of power in a single package - but the part of that which can change the world is that other people don't have it. In a societal sense, it "doesn't exist": Alison surprised a lot of people by being born with a strength that seems like it's out of a fictional story.

Someone with a phone in Ancient Greece could completely change the world: they'd find ways to become spies with the camera capabilities nobody expected, or innovate engineering with precise calculations. Someone in the modern day can use a phone for a lot of things, but lots of people have phones, so it's hard to wake up one day and do something with it that's world changing.

The following part about human intelligence isn't contradictory to the first part: it explains why intelligence should be considered 'super', as a parallel to how strength would be hard to innovate with if everyone had it for thousands of years.
