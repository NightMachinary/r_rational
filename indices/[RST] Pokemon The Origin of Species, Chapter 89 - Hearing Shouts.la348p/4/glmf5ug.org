Huh, so ghost marowak is capable of at least seeming to distort space around it with surreality? Combined with the unknown last chapter this only reaffirms my suspicions that somehow Giratina is involved or partially responsible. Could be completely off the mark, but it's my best bet. Though it doesn't really answer some of the things Ghost Marowak can do, namely vanishing its victims.
