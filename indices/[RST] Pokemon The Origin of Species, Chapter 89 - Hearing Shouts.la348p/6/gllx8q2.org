Awesome! Always a great way to start the month. Spooky ending. They've won/survived but its unclear in what way. The implication is that the psychic pulse caused the creature to stutter, but then was it destroyed by all the attacks? Did it leave? If it left where did it go? Very interesting. I'm also curious if it did have pressure and this is just what pressure looks like when manifested by a ghost.
