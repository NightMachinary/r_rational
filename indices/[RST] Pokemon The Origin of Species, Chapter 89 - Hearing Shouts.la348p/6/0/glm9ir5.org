My reading was completely different. It says that everything looks normal and that all the bodies disappeared. I'm not sure which bodies, but I'm guessing of the Pokemon that died during the battle, and maybe Gale's?

Basically I thought Blue had been removed from the plane of existence where everyone else is, just like what happened to the two first trainers that disappeared. I.e., that from everyone else's point of view, Blue just stopped being there.

Maybe there is not really any evidence to believe this and actually it makes much more sense that they just defeated the ghost marowak, but then what's the deal with the line about the bodies?

EDIT: Ok, if Blue was alone I think he would notice and the text would reflect this. I still don't understand what the bodies being missing means. Actually, I don't understand which bodies are being talked about.
