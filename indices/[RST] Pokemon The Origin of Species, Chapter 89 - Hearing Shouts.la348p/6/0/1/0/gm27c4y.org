My reading was that the pokemon died under the onslaught of attacks, and the bodies disappeared with it. I didn't even question the dead bodies having [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia][no ontological inertia]] until now. Now I just don't know why they disappeared.

Edit: It might be connected to the pokemon possessing their surroundings, so the dead bodies were "inside" it, being destroyed somehow too, but why hasn't anybody else?

Edit2: Or the pokemon just kept dissolving bodies continuously, and was killed after no dead bodies remained. It would explain those two dead bodies that went away before it died.
