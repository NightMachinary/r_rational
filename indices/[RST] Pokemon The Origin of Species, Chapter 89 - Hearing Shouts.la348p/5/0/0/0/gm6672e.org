Seems like anything you use would be vulnerable to some kind of pokemon. Steel blocks won't stop a charmeleon and become an additional hazard in the presence of magnetron. Concrete blocks might block those but have similar issues with fighting and ground/rock types, respectively. Even trying to combine these concepts risks creating more hazards the moment something strong enough comes along.

I'm sure there's a wagon you can buy that'll keep you prepared but a box full of pokeballs does the job 80% as well while only taking up 20% of the space you can now fill with other solutions.

I bet there's a market for pokeball-zookas
