  Steel blocks won't stop a charmeleon
#+end_quote

That's probably arguable, based on whether charmeleon can put out temperatures higher than the melting point of steel or not. And even if it does put out high enough temperatures, if it's not /substantually/ higher it can at least act as a delaying action. (I know we have precedent of Red's charmeleon melting the hide off of a magneton, but it's hard to say if its hide is chemically identical (or superior) to steel when it's part of a biological body, much like how onix aren't composed of actual rocks.)

Besides which, as you said, if the opposing pokemon is strong enough, /anything/ that's not at least as strong or has type resistance isn't going to be able to do more than slow it down (e.g. Viridian Forest shiftry vs. Blue's caterpie which got cut in half). My half-joking half-serious evaluation was more that a solid block of steel/concrete adds another layer of flexibility at a trainer's disposal that's probably worth as much as some individual pokemon on a trainer's belt (...and assuming that the storage of one block big enough to be of use takes about the same amount of resources than the average pokemon).
