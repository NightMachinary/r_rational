I am well aware of what you have mentioned [[/u/burnerpower][u/burnerpower]]. It's why I want the story to go a bit differently. Since the story is going in the same overall direction of the games it is more possible to predict when something might happen or what might happen like when rocket casino takes place or that the ghost pokemon is indeed the ghost marowak from the games. Since [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] is great at making up situations(like the team rocket stuff, vermilion city zapdos encounter and the other things u have mentioned), I am saying that maybe switching things like the order of the gyms might benefit the story more. But pls keep in mind that I have played make fire red run and rom hacks of fire red that I am somewhat sick of the story so it might just be my biases. Despite this I am very impressed and satisfied with the story so I will keep reading this.
