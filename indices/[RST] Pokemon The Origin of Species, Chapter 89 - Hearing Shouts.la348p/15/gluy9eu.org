Leaf and Red killing the ghost with kindness. That's kinda cute. Though I note that it's likely that the Ghost Marrowak is not dead. Leaf projected: "Live. That's all that matters. Live, live, live..." at it, after all. Seems like it would have teleported away, then?

Though it probably wasn't suicidal in the first place, given that it acted anything if not homicidal. More like a predator using his own psychic projection to send out a message of despair. A cry for help (concealing the true intention of "help itself to a buffet", behind a partition).

Leaf's psychic backtalk probably did confuse it, the same way a hunting lion would if you appeared out of nowhere and confidently gave it a hug.

->” That wasn't supposed to happen....”

Classic counter-surreality play. You show so much CONFIDENCE, that any lion or poor little ghost Marrowak would back the hell off, cause it no longer feels SAFE and IN CONTROL.

Though really, Red and Jason's interpretation that it was sad/depressed/suicidal was absolutely harebrained. They trust their psychic senses too much when those were an attack vector!

My boy Blue wouldn't have made that mistake. Blue knows Pokémon are out to get him. Even the trees are out to get him!

Anyway, really stupid idea. Consider that Zapdos itself is not feeling Pressured either.

It was just having one hell of an electric birdo legendary fun time when it hit Vermillion.

It didn't feel pressured to do so, it probably just felt like doing it. Probably was a Thursday. [pun only works in German, though]

Maybe our ghost is back to some lab in Giovanni's org or whichever shady actor was behind its creation. Giovanni would make sense, looking to test another weapon against the Stormbringers perhaps? Could explain why the A-Team didn't show up if Giovanni delayed them or told them not to go. That's more of a Resident Evil plot though...

-> “No, Agatha. You can't help, you remember my latest bio-organic weapon system, that I have been developing?

“Uhm.... you mean that creepy telekinetic kangaroo thing in a glass bottle?”

->”No.....that....... didn't work out too well. This is Project Ghosty-Wak.”

“Ah that one. Yes, would be interesting to know, if the Rangers can handle it. Very promising, indeed. I'll be having a three hour delay..... because of...... hmmm....... Abra logistics issues on the Indigo Plateau.”

Or maybe it's the sociopathic Pokéball hacker, that Giovanni pawned off to a stricter organization, that is the mad scientist behind it. Explains the delayed occurrence of it, after the shady people were gone? The inability to catch it?

And/Or it's the advertised "new species" casino Pokémon.

The sorta-kinda grotesque shape might suggest a Ditto transforming into an Alolan Marrowak. Ditto are failed attempts at creating Mewto siblings (“the others”), after all. Not sure if it was canon, or just implied by OoS or both.

You can probably do all kinds of weird nonsense with Ditto. I know I can, at least in Gen 1. Creating a fake new Pokémon species? Sure, why not.

Imagine promising your little daughter that you give it the main prize if you win, buying one casino ticket. And then you do actually win and you were really hoping it would be a cute little Pikachu-kinda deal, but now she's disappointed, because it's a homicidal fucking ghost Marrowak with an aura of despair and sadness, instead. Probably could find someone to trade it for a Pichu though?

Ah, what the hell.... make her train it. Builds character. She gonna be Champion one day!

Why would there just be one Ditto, though?

Maybe it's a renegade Pokémon and that could explain why the Pokéball didn't ping? Though that wasn't a problem in the Rocket Casion, IIRC.

->“Daddy, the ghosty-wak is just staring at me! How am I supposed to play with it? It's boring and creepy!”

“Ah, don't be like that. It has a club, doesn't it? Take it away and play fetch!”

->”Fine, fine, I'll try that. But I still want a Pichu!”

“That's my girl!”
