  some might be disappointed that it's a pokemon that "doesn't exist." It's the only time so far I've made up a pokemon, and will probably remain so..

Like a lot of others I thought it was going to be a Spiritomb, and as Alolan Marowak has made a brief appearance already that ruled it out for new species. I thought it still worked really well though.

This fic as a whole has done a lot of good for my mental-health by the way. A sincere thanks for that.
