- Given that the ghost marowak first attacked those two disappeared Rangers pretty soon after Blue Shadow Balled a wall, I think that's mildly corroborating evidence for the marowak posessing the floor after all, even if it wasn't actually "one-and-same" as the floor.
- Just noting, this is the second time Leaf had to deal with dead babies, it's starting to be a thing with her.
- Thought about this before, but now that it's relevant, how is the ability Truant interpreted here? The literal interpretation, that the pokemon only listen to every other command, is pretty much a death wish in this world. I was thinking that maybe the pokemon's stay inside the virtual mindscape of the pokeball would count as "loafing around", and once it comes out, it's only active for a certain while before starting get lazy? That'd make slakings a whole lot more useful in competitive battles with emphasis put on lots of swapping - though wild slakings would be somewhat vulnerable, for all its power, if it just can't be arsed to move when ambushed at a bad moment.
- Nice thinking by Leaf to use the pokedolls creatively. I was wondering if using the containers themselves to block the way would've been better - but I guess they'd be more like obstacles to be broken, as opposed to hazards to trip over, and would break more easily under concentrated bashing.

  - By that line of thought though I'm kinda surprised no one carries around blocks of metal in container balls - surely someone, at some time, needed to block a passage where numerous pokemon were escaping through (e.g. here, and the Paras infestation on Mt. Moon), or drop/throw it as a distraction on a tough pokemon, or provide stable footing (e.g. Digglet cave), or double as a ladder in a pinch... It's looking to me like this hypothetical "pokeblock" is at least as useful as the average caterpie, and much more ethically expendable. Someone, give me an argument for why this can't be a potential business opportunity.

- I kinda feel sorry for the denizens in this world - as if ancient super-pokemon waking up and wrecking the world in their fight against each other wasn't enough, there is now at least one kind of pokemon that can be pinged but not captured by pokeballs. This is probably reminiscent of what the sitation was like for their ancestors who hadn't even invented pokeballs yet.
