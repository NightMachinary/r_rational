Another great chapter; I had to pause reading a few times from my itch to overanalyze things:

The first big thing to jump out to me immediately was that Leaf & Red's plan to scare away the wilds with venasaur roars was a terrible mistake- If cubone/marowak have no predators which use sound, then they are likely going to be /attracted/ to investigate the noise. If the venasaur roars weren't playing, the might not have even found their way to the stairs, or atleast they would've taken more time to come en mass.

​

As for the ghost!marowak, I had an idea that wasn't really the ghost's true form: As another commenter noted, it only appeared to attack anyone after Blue attacked a wall, and, most notably to me, after tonnes of marowak were dying in droves just below. Perhaps the ghost!marowak was a sort of projection based on the pokemon dying nearby? That would help to explain why it couldn't be caught, despite pokeballs working on other semi-intangible ghosts. (Admittedly, this doesn't explain why the surreality stopped after the ghost!marowak was defeated, but...)

​

WMG: Given the mention of suspicious people visiting the tower, it's possible that this ghost/phenomenon was artificially created/arranged/triggered. I can imagine that possibly happening if those people were going around hiding shards of the red (or blue) orb throughout the tower, which I assume will be what mega-evolution keystones will be made from in this universe (given how the red orb reacted to Steven's aggronite and metagrossite). That sort of origin could also explain the surreality disappearing after the ghost!marowak was defeated, assuming it was only a projection, as the end of combat would cause a mega-evolution (or equivalent phenomena) to reverse.
