  I was thinking that maybe the pokemon's stay inside the virtual mindscape of the pokeball would count as "loafing around", and once it comes out, it's only active for a certain while before starting get lazy?

I was thinking something like that, yeah, where it basically can only be commanded for a limited time before it starts to disregard commands.

  It's looking to me like this hypothetical "pokeblock" is at least as useful as the average caterpie, and much more ethically expendable. Someone, give me an argument for why this can't be a potential business opportunity.

The Rangers regularly carry this stuff, it's what was deployed around the hospital that Blue helped defend in Vermilion. Trainers in the field don't often bring it because most of the benefits can be gained from just using container boxes, and denser blocks would start to take up a lot of containers to get a large amount of them, each of which could be filled with other really useful stuff like more survival equipment or hell even other pokemon that don't fit on your belt. I can imagine that some people carry a few around at least, though, or maybe some groups designate one person in particular to carry a bunch.
