Pretty sure, our Ghosty-wak is a Ditto/failed Mewto-experiment.\\
Would explain why the Rocket Casino needed to steal the Silph-Scope in the first place.

They needed to analyze/experiment on it, without experiencing the massive surreality.\\
"sculpted, grotesque-looking, stretched out limbs, rictus grin, only vague idea what a Marowak even looks like" seem to fit really well.\\
And that Ditto probably did transform with an Alolan Marowak as a provided pattern, not a normal one.
