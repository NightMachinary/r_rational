I very much enjoy that they used Pokedolls in an unorthodox way to deal with at least one Marowak in Lavender tower, like in the speedrun though :)

Besides, cycling road is optional content and they already did that. Gen 1 runs have loads of freedom. I have no idea what the official order is even supposed to be.
