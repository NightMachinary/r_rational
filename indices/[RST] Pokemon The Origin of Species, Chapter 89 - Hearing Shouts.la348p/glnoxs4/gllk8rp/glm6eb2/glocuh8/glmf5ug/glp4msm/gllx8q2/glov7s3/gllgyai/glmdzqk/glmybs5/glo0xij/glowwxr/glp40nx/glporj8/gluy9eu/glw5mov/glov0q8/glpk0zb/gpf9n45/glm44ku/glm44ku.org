I just wanted to say that it was a great chapter once again. I just have one minor problem with the story so far - it follows the games too closely. I have seen what you have been able to accomplish with the modifications to the games(battles, TMS, rocket casino, Mewtwo) and I think that the story would benefit more with a bit more breakaway from the games. Ik that [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] probably has the story fully planned out, but incase some changes can be made, it might improve the story a bit more. This is just a suggestion and I would like to know everyone's thoughts on it. Other than that, the story is the best it could be in my opinion.
