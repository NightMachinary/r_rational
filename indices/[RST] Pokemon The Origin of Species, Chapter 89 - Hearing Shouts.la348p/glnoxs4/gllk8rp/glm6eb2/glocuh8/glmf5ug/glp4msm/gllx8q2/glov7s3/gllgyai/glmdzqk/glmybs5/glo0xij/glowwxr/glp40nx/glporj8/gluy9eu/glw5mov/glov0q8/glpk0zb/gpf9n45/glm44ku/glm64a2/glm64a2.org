I don't know about that at all. It certainly takes inspiration from the games but I'd never accuse it of following them too closely. Take this arc for example. The only commonalities are the ghost Marowak and that Team Rocket is probably involved. The way things play out are very different, and this is one of the arcs that follows the games pretty closely. If you go back a bit Red apprenticing under Sabrina is completely divorced from the plot of the games. If you go back even further the Stormbringer arc is nothing like the games. Part of the fun of the story is how DaystarEld takes some absurd pokemon concept and turns it into something that fits in a rational world. I don't think thats a problem, I think thats playing into the story's strength as a fan fiction.
