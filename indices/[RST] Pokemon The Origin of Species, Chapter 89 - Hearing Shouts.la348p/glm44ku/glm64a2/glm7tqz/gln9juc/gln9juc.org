Sure the Casino happened, but in a way that was completely unpredictable. No secret poster, instead we are interrupted by Hoenn legendaries.

We have some idea of what elememt comes into play, but how it interacts is completely shifted and new. That dissonance is pretty great.

Especially since there are several original subplots intersecting.

Going to a different town first wont really make the events of that town less predictable. Especially since at this point there isny much to shift the order.

The canon order is Koga 5th and Sabrina 6th right? That is what I did at least. I didnt even realize you could do them out of order.
