  If cubone/marowak have no predators which use sound, then they are likely going to be attracted to investigate the noise. If the venasaur roars weren't playing, the might not have even found their way to the stairs, or atleast they would've taken more time to come en mass.

That...may be so? Wild animals in general are more likely scared off to loud noises than attracted - I don't know any animals that'll come running /to/ you if you fire off a gunshot, for example - but we don't have the exposition on cubone/marowak psychology promised by Leaf yet, and though the Rangers' commander condoned the action, I think there is a slight chance he didn't happen to have that particular knowledge either, and made the wrong call.

  Perhaps the ghost!marowak was a sort of projection based on the pokemon dying nearby? That would help to explain why it couldn't be caught, despite pokeballs working on other semi-intangible ghosts. (Admittedly, this doesn't explain why the surreality stopped after the ghost!marowak was defeated, but...)

I don't know about that - it was the ghost marowak's "despair beacon" that drew those ordinary marwaks to the tower /en masse/ in the first place. Whatever the ghost marowak was, it's most likely one and same as the Ghost presence Jason had been trying to communicate with before the ordinary marowak even came.

(That said, I do agree after you brought it up that marowaks dying in droves might also have been a contributing factor to why the ghost marowak popped out of wherever it had been.)

  I can imagine that possibly happening if those people were going around hiding shards of the red (or blue) orb throughout the tower
#+end_quote

I really don't know about this one. I'm thinking shards of the red/blue orbs would be /extremely/ valuable research material right now, because of their link to Mega Evolution (and to the ancient super-pokemon). Why would anyone try to put them in a place they might not be able to easily access later?

Those aforementioned suspicious-in-retrospect people probably are involved, but given the out-of-context feel the ghost marowak has (and also in part, how savage and destructive it ended up being), I doubt they /intended/ to make it, at least. Let's see if any more light gets shed on it in future chapters.
