So it was a pokemon but pokeballs didnt work on it? Was it dome special technique or quality? Cause it deems like they are able to capture gaseous pokemon.

I find the Ghosts in general kind of vague. They just spawn in places without observable procreation and possess surrealism? And dome can posess objects as a sort of energy being?
