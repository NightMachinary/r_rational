I can see how it might be grammatically confusing, I'll try to come up with a name for the motes themselves, but I really dislike using 'mana' because of the cultural weight already attached to the word. People have specific ideas relating to mana, and I don't want how they view Aeria's magic system to be handicapped by use of terms that occur in other works of fiction. At the same time, I don't want to use something completely out there, I could make up any word that I wanted for it, but doing this too often clouds reading clarity once you go past a certain threshold, wherein the characters just start talking in what sounds like technobabble gibberish. I dunno, any suggestions?
