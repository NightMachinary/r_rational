Small edits and notes are up.

Broader notes: Overall, I think you should use more descriptions. Try to convey the experience of the things and events rather than just their occurrence. Example: "A messenger from the ISL outpost slid down next to Morey." What did this messenger look like? How did they land - smoothly, awkwardly, etc? You don't need much, just a few words, but they'd go a long way I think.

Otherwise, it's good to see more the ancient world fleshed out, and the resolution of existing plot (Morey's rebellion) and the introduction / re-uptake of new ones (the Gate at Landing, and getting home).
