I'm usually pretty swamped with work until my night. But I'll see if I can squeeze this in. I probably won't be able to, but will try nonetheless. Fyi, I just finished catching up to 110 today and its getting a whole lotta fun. Can't wait for the reasons for zombies, who's left up north and that metal thing on selna!!
