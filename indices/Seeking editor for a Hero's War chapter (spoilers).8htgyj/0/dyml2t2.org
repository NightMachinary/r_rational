Hey, to preserve spoilers, what you could do is offer to PM people who ask for it the google drive link, instead of just having it out in the open. It's a bit more work, but I personally prefer doing that because it minimizes the people who just try to read an incomplete or even incorrect work just because they wanted to see the newest version soon, rather than to productively edit for you.

Ultimately it's up to you, of course.
