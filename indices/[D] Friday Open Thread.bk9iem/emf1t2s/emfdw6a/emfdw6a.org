Glad to hear that you're doing better! I hope you have a smooth recovery.

I injured my foot last week while running with a weight vest. The doc said it was a stress reaction, the precursor to a fracture, and that my foot should be fine in around 4 weeks. They gave me a boot and crutches and sent me on my way.

I've never significantly injured my lower body before. The decrease in mobility /sucks/. Nothing is walking distance anymore!

While we're on the topic of injuries, allow me to rant about how much the US healthcare system sucks. *The US healthcare system sucks.* It's appalling that the only superpower in the world has such a shit healthcare system to care for its citizens.

I spent several years living in a different first-world country with my partner. My partner would often tell me, "Ratthrow, I went to hospital today" and my US-raised ears would perk up because I thought something terrible had happened. But no, it was just a minor health-related issue and going to the hospital was no different than taking your car to the mechanic when it's making a weird noise. Which is how it should be!

I am diligent, intelligent, have an extremely flexible schedule, and two of my closest friends are doctors. I do not skimp on health insurance and my doctor friends helped me pick my plan. I recognize myself as privileged.

It still took me 2 weeks to get a routine physical and it cost me $500 because I accidentally went to a doctor that was out of my network. What the fuck?? In every other first world country it's just rolled into your taxes and you can go see whatever fucking doctor you want when there's something wrong with you.

I can't even imagine what the burden is like for for people in the US with more difficult circumstances. This is a fucking travesty.
