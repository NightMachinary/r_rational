I hope the physicians talked to you about running with a vest, if they did skip this paragraph: There's really no reason to do cardio with extra weight if you don't have to, it's extremely hard on the wrong structures. It's like adding 5x-10x the weights impact to your fascia and bones for (weight added/your weight) more muscle work. You can just run faster/further without weight instead, and lift seperately for far better outcomes.

If it won't cost you an arm and a leg I'd recommend going to a physical therapist. You're their dream patient since you're already active, they can help fix what led to the stress fracture there, deal with post-boot muscle weaknesses, and head off other weak points that might fail as you push yourself in the future. But as a fellow US citizen I know it sucks that this kind of prevention and rehab can be so expensive.

Good luck with recovery, and keep in mind how absurd our medical system is even for those not disadvantaged!
