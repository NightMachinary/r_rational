I'm doing relatively fine right now, but a bit over a year-and-a-half ago, I either impinged or tore my right rotator cuff by being too aggressive on the last day of tiling and grouting my kitchen (at least that's what I said at the time on this subreddit; it may have been more to do with the fact that I got drunk on the last night of the job and tried making a right-hand turn out of my doorway without fully exiting the door, and slammed my shoulder into the doorframe at full force after several days of cutting and laying tile and within less than two hours of the end of the second day in a row of grouting).

I couldn't lift my arm from my side for two full weeks. I had to use my left hand to physically lift my right arm up and set it on the armrest so I could use the mouse and keyboard, which several times was painful enough to induce crying and every time was exceptionally uncomfortable. I couldn't lift my arm all the way up over my head for, I don't remember exactly but it was probably like at least like a month. The pain still hadn't fully gone away when I finally started lifting weights again 5 months ago.

Shoulder injuries can stick with you for a hot minute. My shoulder was still noticeably in pain for like 10 months, and it ached for several months following that. Even now, 19 or 20 months later, if I think about it and focus on it, my right shoulder /feels/ "different" from my left.

I hope your having access to physical therapy can speed up your recovery. I also hope your physical therapist saying "the pain will subside eventually" has been realistic with you about the length of time you're likely to be in pain.
