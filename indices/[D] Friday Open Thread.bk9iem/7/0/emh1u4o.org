[[https://www.conrad.de/de/p/renkforce-rf2000-3d-drucker-1395717.html][This printer]] has an expansion kit that can [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoTuJVILzjM][turn it into a CnC machine!]]

I use the printer at work, it's really sturdy and I don't doubt you can machine wood and plastics with it. Not quite sold on the use of adhesive tape as a printing surface, it's a bit finicky to get to work with anything but standard filaments, and when you really want to crank the heating bed temperature up it leaves nasty sticky residue.

The main question you should ask yourself is: "Why do I want a 3D Printer?"\\
If you're just curious about the fad, I don't recommend it unless you've got too much money and free time. Better find a local makerspace and see if you can try it out there.\\
If there's a single, specific part you want to manufacture, it's probably still easier to have it done on someone else's printer, either in a makerspace or with an online shop.\\
Really the only reason to get one is if you anticipate making a lot of different, complicated plastic parts. Small gifts to friends and family, little repairs and replacement parts, perhaps mockups of parts you want to build out of metal...
