Hey people here might be interested in a website I just discovered on [[/r/nootropics][r/nootropics]].

It's called [[https://nootropicscity.com/][Nootropics City]] and it's meant to be an easy way to buy the pills determined by the subreddit for the best and safest improvements.

Obviously, study the wiki on the subreddit, spend some time doing research, and possibly consult a doctor if needed before making a decision to start taking nootropics. But if you choose to, then the website makes the whole process of obtaining the needed pills so much easier.

EDIT: I should supplement this comment with the standard warning that "No nootropic is a substitute for a good nights sleep, a healthy and active lifestyle and learning to motivate yourself." So if you have to decide between spending money on pills or on eating, sleeping, and exercising well, go with the latter.
