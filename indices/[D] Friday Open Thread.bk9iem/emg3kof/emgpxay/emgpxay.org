One trick I used to use a lot was to go somewhere (e.g., coffeeshop, a park) with just a notebook and a few pencils. This let me write distraction-free. It kind of sucked, because I had to type my writing into the computer later, but it was worth it because it actually got words written.

Now that I've built up the habit, it's not really necessary anymore. (Although, you know, here I am on reddit, instead of writing, whoops.)
