Oh hey thanks for posting this, I forgot the name of that novel and lost its details with the issues with my old computer.

For anyone unfamiliar with it, I think it does a great job building up the main character's place in the world in his own mind and contrasting with the perspectives of other characters in the first novel. The second and third are just solid adventure novels that don't really compare to the scene setting of the first though, and the fourth I'm about to read on my phone now I found this novel again.

If anyone else likes light novels that flirt with rationality, I'd recommend Overlord for the depth it explores character motivations and the main character's caution in all his actions, but the amount of "flying by the seat of his pants"-esque luck may be a downer to some folks.
