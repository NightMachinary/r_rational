Anyone who's thought about job hunting via triplebyte but has been putting it off for whatever reason: there's a promotion at the moment where if you are referred, and end up getting (and accepting) a job via them, the referrer gets a $5000 bonus. If you're interested anyway, and feel like helping a random fellow subreddit user out, DM me and I can refer you.

The referral process is a bit odd but basically there's a form on their website that I'd submit your email address to, and then you'd receive an email from triplebyte for account creation.

I'm at a point in my life where $5000 would be very useful but not life-altering; if someone else can also refer people but has more need for the money then drop a reply (and don't be bashful; I'm not super well-off currently but I'm about to graduate and already have a job lined up, plus I live in the UK so I don't need to worry about healthcare).

(triplebyte is/was in the SSC sidebar; they find you a coding job by giving you coding tests to do, rather than looking at a resume. They're US-only as far as I know)
