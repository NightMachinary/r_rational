Definitely mention the sleeping issues to your PTs, they can recommend pillow and lying modifications to hopefully help. Put in the work and take notes for when the therapy ends so you can do some on your own or treat flareups/tightness, it will help in the long run!

Good to hear you're working on recovery and making progress at work! Good luck!
