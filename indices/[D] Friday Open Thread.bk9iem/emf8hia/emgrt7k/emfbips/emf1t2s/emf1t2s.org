An update on my spine and shoulder injuries: I started physical therapy last week and am in more pain because I've been using my shoulders for stretching and exercises they gave me. It is disheartening to be in constant pain but my PT says that will subside. The only issue is that I have trouble sleeping for more than a few hours.

On a more positive note, I have started doing more than training at work and that helps me feel more fulfilled existentially and has brought up my self confidence. Ive been dressing better and my new healthcare kicked in on the first and now I can go see an orthopedic as well as switch back to my old PCP. I feel more like a proper adult and have been able to finance going to several events I couldnt previously afford since college.

How is everyone else doing?
