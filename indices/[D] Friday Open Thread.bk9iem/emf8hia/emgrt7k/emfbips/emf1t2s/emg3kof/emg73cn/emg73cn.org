- Write at the same time every day, to help train "it's writing time"
- Write in the same place every time, see above
- Don't push yourself too hard, because that leads to burnout
- If you find yourself distracted by other things, try introducing trivial inconveniences to those behaviors. Things like removing Steam or Discord from the taskbar, or more intensively, installing a Chrome extension that will make you jump through a lot of hoops to get on reddit during writing time. The specifics here really depend on what it is you wind up doing when you've said to yourself that you should be writing. Maybe put your cellphone in a Mason jar that's screwed tight? The point isn't to hamstring yourself and force yourself into writing, it's to break the muscle memory of your distraction habits.
- Streak as much as possible, though tracking streaks is a bit of a double-edged sword, because for some people, breaking a streak of "X days writing" would cause them to just fall off the wagon entirely, or they would feel like any smudge on an otherwise perfect record makes the whole thing meaningless.
