I'm getting close to posting the last of my backlog for [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/donjon-worm-oc-seattle.734914/][Donjon]], and I'm worried about being able to maintain my update schedule. I know I'm capable of writing the necessary 750 words a day, but I keep finding myself getting distracted or caught up in other things and it ends up not getting done.

Do any of the more experienced writers on here have advice on creating and maintaining a writing habit? I know there isn't any silver bullet or way to avoid hard work, but I'd really appreciate a starting point or some principles to keep in mind.
