Audacity for audio editing.

As for tablets.. You really can't go wrong with a wacom. I'd say get a cheap or second hand one just initially to get the hang of it.. And then invest in a really good one with more pressure sensitivity. It is frustrating beyond belief dealing with the hang ups that come with the cheap tablets.. i.e. Pen not detected, stuck point, slow brushes.. (I completely dropped digital art at one point rather than trying to coax my tablet to work)

Also you should have a decent amount of RAM to prevent slow brushes and crashes.
