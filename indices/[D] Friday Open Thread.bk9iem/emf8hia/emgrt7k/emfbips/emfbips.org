I have been trying to get into the arts recently. More specifically drawing and voice acting. Does anyone with experience in either of these fields have recommendations on tablets (for drawing) and microphones/recording software? I would prefer cheap/free recording/editing software for audio.

Additionally does anyone have suggestions for online part time work? I'm not against freelance writing but would prefer a steady income over piecemeal gains. I'm not comfortable enough with my art to try and take commissions.
