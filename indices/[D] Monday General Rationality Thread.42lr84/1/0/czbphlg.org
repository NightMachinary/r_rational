Self-confident autodidacts tend to trust their own judgement. They have a lot of experience doing so, and considerably less experience trusting so-called experts. An inventor, especially, is going to be well-versed in looking outside the box for ideas that have not been fully researched and explored. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether][Luminiferous Aether]] is actually a great example.

Physicists of the 19th century didn't believe it because they were blinded or stupid. They believed it because it was a widely-accepted, coherent model which had withstood significant experimentation. Give the Wikipedia article a look or, if you want old school, I recommend Max Born's chapters on the subject in his 1922 book on Relativity... which is out of copyright and available [[https://archive.org/details/einsteinstheoryo00born][here]]. You might even recommend that book to your family friend.

Identifying trustworthy experts does require some degree of intelligence, but deciding to trust them requires an entirely other sort of mental exercise. Don't think too ill of whom others choose to trust.
