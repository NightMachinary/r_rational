I know this kind of person as well. I found this talk [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdJCFEqFTU]] - I dont remember the timestamp for this particular piece of info unfortunately- enlightening. The referent puts forth an at least partially plausible hypothesis.

The parameters of your own neural network are very carefully weighted to find a good balance between "inventing new hypotheses" and "disproving new hypotheses". Obviously "inventing new hypotheses" is what being creative is all about; crank this up too much and you get schizophrenia. But a successful buisness person needs to have passed both thresholds; not only "inventing an economic niche" but also "not immediately disproving it into the ground", which seems like its a very common failure mode(eg. not pursuing further because "will not work for XYZ reasons").
