One of the various projects I'm considering writing for [[/r/rational]] is a memoir of some of my adolescent years with a focus on my father's pursuit of a perpetual motion machine and its effect on me. The man's a brilliant programmer who's been doing important work since computing was new, in many respects he's one of the smartest people I know, but he's just completely convinced, and has been for many decades, that free energy is relatively easy and it's just that no one's thought of it before. He managed to convince a young me of his position, and /man/ did it mess me up psychologically.

Would this be a good fit for [[/r/rational]]? It's an irrational nonfiction as opposed to a rational fiction.
