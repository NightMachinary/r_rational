Ok I reread the definition given and see that there is an interpretation I can make of that text which would enable having the number grow, which I now assume is what was actually meant. But somehow i think this actually makes the number even less relevant, seeing as it would be going up and down seemingly randomly and would be massively effected by the number of splits in the tree at least as much as the actual length of them.
