ok that makes sense for an external observer, so you will indeed be able to tell if this works by observing other people and their meters.

in that case the closest i can model this world is basically pretty close to a world where you have a clock for when you die, unless i am missing something important. i mean, i basically get a paradox the moment i try to model how it will actually work. For example lets say someone is going to be hit by a car while crossing the street in a year. for now lets assume the probability of that is 99.999%(i.e. the watch will show 0.001% are alive) without the watch. but with the watch showing the number the probability is 0.0000001%(i.e. 99.9999999% are alive), so now you have a problem. either you show it and the number is not correct because actually only 0.000001% will die after seeing such a scary number, or you show 0.0000001% of death and then the person will not avoid the death. how is that resolvable? The only way i can model that is a world where people only die when there is nothing they could do about their death by knowing about it in advance..
