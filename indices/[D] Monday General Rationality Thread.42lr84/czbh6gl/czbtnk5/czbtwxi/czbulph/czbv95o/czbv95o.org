The large complexity and small basic unit scale of brains strongly suggests to me that they, given the same starting conditions, will randomly make somewhat different decisions. This alone, given the butterfly effect, would be enough to change everything else about the environment, but I even find it doubtful that brains are the only thing in our common experience like this.
