Well, for one thing, I think truth is more valuable than happiness. I'd rather be miserable than delusional.

Also, it's possible to face pain and horrible things, and stay happy/positive. It's certainly harder than just being dumb, It requires strenght, toughness, and mental discipline, but it can be done.

Personally, I'm definitely more miserable and scared now than a few years ago when I was more oblivious, but I sure as hell wouldn't trade it back.

Also there are mental tools like meditation and flow that help you to control your thoughts and emotions while staying honest about facing reality.

Personally, I'm making an effort to face all the things that are so difficult to face, but at the same time, once I did that, I can use meditation to stop the pointless and obsessive thoughts and anxieties, and focus on getting joy out of things I love about life and can control.

Edit:

To be honest, I probably do use self-deception to a degree, as a form of emotional management. But it's not really about lying to yourself and trying to convince your brain about false things, it's more like the rational part of my brain that knows what's up telling the emotional part "dude, be cool, focus on things you can control, and we're gonna be fine."

You can face the truth on one level, while on another still have your mind be engaged in pursuing goals and valuing and enjoying things, etc.

Frankly, I think even Eliezer uses this kind of stuff to a degree. It's not like when he's writing HPMOR or working on AI he stays constantly 100% aware of his mortality and futility of existence. It's not like he's constantly conscious of the fact that whatever he does universe will end up in the same dark, uniform, slightly warm state after the entropy.

I'm not sure mind truly can function in the complete void. People who practice Zen and such are supposedly trying to learn how to function while being truly aware of death, but I think even they are full of shit, they're just working hard to convince themselves that the world is okay and the fucked up thing not really a tragedy that they are.
