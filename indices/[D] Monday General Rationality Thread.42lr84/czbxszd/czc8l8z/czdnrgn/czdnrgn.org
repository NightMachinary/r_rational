  Frankly, I think even Eliezer uses this kind of stuff to a degree. It's not like when he's writing HPMOR or working on AI he stays constantly 100% aware of his mortality and futility of existence. It's not like he's constantly conscious of the fact that whatever he does universe will end up in the same dark, uniform, slightly warm state after the entropy.

I wonder to what degree depression is connected to the inability to push out these thoughts. It's a common theme when I'm suicidal, definitely, even though that chain of logic might not make much sense (but then, "not making sense" is kind of part of the definition of being mentally ill, isn't it?).
