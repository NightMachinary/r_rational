I know a guy /just like that/. Incredibly brilliant, holds a bunch of patents, made a ton of money through his engineering company ... and believes in all sorts of crazy stuff. I attribute it mostly to an anti-authoritarian streak, though I did once talk with him about the JFK assassination, which I think had a profound effect on him and the search for meaning there made him much more open to fringe science.

Also, fringe science tends to be more fun to read about than established science, because everything is new and revolutionary, one step away from changing the world, which people really go in for.
