There is this friend of my family. A 50 year old man, who works as an honest to Albert inventor. He's been a tech wiz since childhood, and he and a few others have had their own company for decades where they are asked to make a piece of technology that does x and has to work with xyz, and they make it. Mostly electronics, but not exclusively. They are doing pretty well for themselves. I'm not sure if he's rich, it hasn't come up, but I'd be very surprised if he makes less than $10k/month. They have a tech lab at his place of work, but he also has one at home, where he fools around with things on his own. He is a very intelligent man, and whenever he gets guests he's super excited to show people what he's working on or reading about. Sometimes I can follow along with most of it, but usually it's too specialized. He's very interesting, and a nice person too, so I really like him.

But. He also gets very excited about things that most scientists would dismiss immediately. He's very interested in Cold Fusion, and thinks it's the way of the future. He thinks global warming is real but will be solved without detriment with future technology. His bookcases are full of books about conspiracy theories and 'alternative history' and aliens. And a few weeks back he told us he's been reading up for months on electromagnetism, including notes and journals by people like Maxwell and Tesla. And he's convinced that the Ether is a real thing. He's hoping to be able to come to a point where he can do meaningful experiments in the lab he has at home.

I just... The man is more intelligent than me. A lot more disciplined. And /massively/ more educated, especially regarding anything to do with physics. So I don't understand how he can get so 'into' things you'd only see taken seriously on the History channel. But at least he's sincere enough in his convictions that he spends thousands of dollars on lab equipment so he can go hunting for knowledge himself.
