So what do you guys think about [[http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/derren-brown-convinces-three-people-7172605][pushed to the edge]] ? both in regards to what it says about people and about what it says when that passes for entertainment\is legal?

personally I don't think it really says a lot as is, because the participants were apparently selected(based on how "obedient" they were) and the fact that we can't even know how many people were tested to produce those 4 people which reached that last point, out of which only 3 actually did it.

I wouldn't be too surprised even if 75% was the actual number(of people willing to murder in some circumstances), but I tend to be skeptical as-is considering the motivation of the producers to sensationalize.

As for the legality of the show, I don't see an issue as long as the actions of the participants were not illegal, and even then i am not sure if its really a problem(to intentionally cause someone else to commit a crime)
