Have you read of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment][Milgram experiment]]? It provides some context for this sort of thing - and makes me feel that the show could conceivably have been run unscripted/unprompted and achieved much the same results. However, as it is a TV enterprise, it would make the most sense for them to have a pretty strong script and manipulate things to deliver whatever narrative they think would resonate with viewers and drive audience interest and news reporting upward, in search of higher ratings, as all 'reality TV' has done forever. A show that came out with the message "most people are pretty decent and don't murder people" wouldn't make the news.
