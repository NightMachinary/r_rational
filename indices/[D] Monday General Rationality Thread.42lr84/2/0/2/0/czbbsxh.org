They have the same guy (Bernie) being pushed over the edge of a roof multiple times, partly because of a homage to Weekend at Bernie's. So, no. It's all a setup. Everyone in the show that isn't one of the people deciding whether or not to push is definitely an actor / conspirator / etc. The people doing the pushing may also be acting rather than being genuinely bamboozled - with Reality TV-esque stuff like this, it's pretty safe to assume that the producers /make/ it interesting to televise, by hook or by crook.
