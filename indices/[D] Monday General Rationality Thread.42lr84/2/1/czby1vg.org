Have you seen the episode/feature where Darren Brown (the same guy) apparently hypnotises audience members to such a degree that they willingly rested in a bathtub of ice? After they were shown unable to keep their hand in the same tub for a prolonged period of time?

He's actually released a book about some of the techniques he uses. Its really hard to determine how much of it is real or what the trick is (as is the case with a lot of Darren Brown's stuff, which I would generally recommend watching). It would seem that some people are more readily suggestible than others.
