It should probably be mentioned that the reason the people "murdered" was because they were brought to the situation where the victim, who was supposed to be some billionair, will sue them and generally make their life hell. As well as being instructed to to so by "higher status" people from a "board of directors". The entire thing was built to loosen their morals. Starting with a relatively "harmless" point where they were just helping to conceal his "death" so as to not cancel a fund raiser for poor children, all the way to being in a point where he is sitting alone on the edge of the roof with no witnesses and they get to choose if they want to push him or leave him
