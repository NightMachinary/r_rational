Does rationality, in its pursuit of perceiving truth in an effort to make the best decisions, negate the beneficial aspects of self-deception? Could that harm someone?

Self-deception seems in many ways protective of our own psychology and those without self-deception are more likely to be clinically depressed according to the psychologist interviewed in the latest rationally speaking podcast.

Is there a Lesswrong post someone cant point me towards about this topic? My brief search for one (which acknowledges that argument for self-deception) during my lunch hour was unsuccessful.
