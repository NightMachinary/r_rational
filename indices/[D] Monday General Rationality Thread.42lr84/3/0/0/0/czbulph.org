See, that's what my question is though.

The butterfly effect is strong, in that weather systems are unpredictable, but that doesn't mean that given perfect information we wouldn't be able to predict weather. What we need to know is how much effect quantum-level changes have on the macro scale; it doesn't matter if weather systems have a sensitivity to initial conditions if those conditions are psuedo-deterministic. How much of a butterfly flapping its wings can we predict purely with classical physics and how quickly does deviance show up?
