What makes you think human brains are effected by that? does that mean you believe that if you were asked to answer the question "1+1=?" a thousand times you would give different results based on quantum events? if no what do you think is makes a particular brain event susceptible to quantum events?

I am having trouble seeing any support for quantum events effecting anything macro without artificial amplification.
