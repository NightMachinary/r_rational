If we built a simulation of the universe that /didn't/ take quantum effects into account, how often do you think that it would be wrong about whether I was dead in a year? I think that's the question that I'm left with.

On short timescales and with large objects, the universe appears to be deterministic. The motions of the planet can be predicted using even crude measurements, with the quantum-level stuff having very little to do with it. There are certain things that quantum-level changes are never going to have an appreciable effect on.

Now, does this extend down to the level of humans? Do quantum level effects have any bearing on what I'm going to eat for breakfast tomorrow morning, or whether I'll fall in love, or whether I can remember the right answer on a test? So far as I know, that's an open question that dips down into fringe science, mostly because we don't have a good way to experimentally test any of the predictions that people are making. But if humans /aren't/ (by and large) subject to quantum-level effects, and we live in a psuedo-deterministic world, then most of the time the death-o-meter is going to say 99.99% or 0.01%, because many-worlds just doesn't really enter into it, and the information gleaned from the death-o-meter won't be too useful unless you try to munchkin it.
