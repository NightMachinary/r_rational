Yes, the device includes itself in its calculations. The device anticipates changed decisions, but once any uncertain probability becomes certain, the device will update. For example, if a certain event has a 50% chance of killing someone and a 50% chance of doing nothing to them, then after they survive it, the device's readings for them will double.
