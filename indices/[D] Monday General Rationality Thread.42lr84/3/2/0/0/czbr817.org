Ok, that solves the update plans to update your reading problem, as it will give out a reading including the effects of its own readings.

It might be possible to make this a halting oracle, but I'm not exactly sure how to structure the experiment. Use death row inmates, set it up so they are executed if the algorithm halts. There's likely a better way to do this, but it at least lets us check some low-hanging fruit. It also lets us break passwords which take less than a year to check with your fastest computer.
