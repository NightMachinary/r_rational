Ok, I've got the People's Republic of China's next 5 year plan:

Year 1: Construct a bunch of new prisons specifically designed to prevent information from leaving them by unauthorized means and draft a set of protocols to accomplish this. All staff live on site for the duration of the 5-year plan and cannot leave, all shipments of food and other materials are automated once they reach the security perimeter, etc.

Year 2: All crimes in China which have a prison sentence of longer than 4 years will instead be punished with a suspended death sentence. Transfer all such prisoners into the new prisons.

Year 3: Calibration. Determine the average death rate in the new prisons, using the boxes. Nobody is executed this year, so all you need to do is figure out what the average percent across all prisoners for that year is. This number does not leave the prison system.

Year 4: Calculation. Use some hash search algorithm to search for a valid seed program for FAI which will unfold into a fully functioning AI deity in a year. At each step of the algorithm, a program outside the system chooses a set of random prisoners to stand for the different elements in your search algorithm, and then checks the death percentage for each of those prisoners. The ones whose percentages spiked above the average will be executed once the FAI has finished unfolding. Of course, this shouldn't work under normal circumstances, as the prisoners' percentages will jump precisely a year before their execution, rather than at the time they are chosen as a correct step forward in the hash, but by hiding all such information from the program doing the choosing, the jumps may be correctly isolated as having been caused solely by being a correct step rather than a random step. In addition, the execution happening after the unpacking is done means that the system gets to "check" whether the seed program was correct, completing the P=NP loop.

Year 5: You don't need a year 5.
