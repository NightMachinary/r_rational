As others have noted, this depends heavily on which events are "really" (quantumly) random and which are just complicated and difficult to predict.

Coinflips, for example, aren't actually random - they're just difficult enough for humans to predict that they may as well be for most practical purposes. You can model a coin's path and predict which side it will land on, given time and computing power.

Of course, this could also be a world of magic, where timelines split based on something other than quantum effects. Or you could argue that the butterly effect is really that powerful.
