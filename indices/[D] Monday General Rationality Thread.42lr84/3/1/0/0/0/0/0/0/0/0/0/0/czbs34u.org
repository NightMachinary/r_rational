In what /possible/ world would someone be doomed to get hit by a car a year before it happens? That sounds like a fate thing to me, which isn't realistic. You probably don't have a 99.99999999% chance of getting hit by a car even a /minute/ before it happens.

It doesn't matter what probabilities exist in the counterfactual world where the device's readings are inaccurate; they are not relevant to the probabilities that the device shows, which are accurate.
