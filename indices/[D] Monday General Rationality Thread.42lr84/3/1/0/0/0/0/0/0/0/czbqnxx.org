how could that number possibly ever increase? how could "probability" increase in such a context? the device has already obviously incorporated it.

also after thinking about it some more i am having even more difficulties with the definition you gave.

how could anyone ever know that the number is correct? even if supernatural forces made you assume it is correct as mentioned how could you ever use this information considering the fact that the device is basically absolute. if it is not absolute what is the model by which it works? wouldn't 99.99999% of the alternate universes where the person exist be exactly identical on the macro level, i.e. most "universe splitting" would happen because some atomic event happened\didn't happen. but for a specific quantum event to be felt on a level that may effect human lives you would need an amplified of some sort. but those would still be significantly less frequent. so essentially whatever kills 1 copy of you would kill 99.9999..999% etc percent of you, and those that aren't killed could be in completely different worlds. it would require some crazy modeling to get even an idea. and even then you go back to the original issue of not being able to know anything from the number. how do you even define a "you", i.e. a specific human being?
