What makes you think the world is so random at the macro level that it would not be likely that most event that you experience are "predetermined" to such degree of assurance? as far as i can tell the world is very predictable on the human scale, which is good actually because it would be difficult to live in it otherwise, and as such except for "amplified" events such as for example atomic clocks, experimental particle physics and similar such things almost all other quantum events(of which there are -a lot-) all have practically no effect on human life.

Anyhow the percent is completely irrelevant, what is relevant is that while its easy to say "the device already compounds its own effect on the probability" there is no actual way for that to work unless you assume human reaction to it is somehow a quantum event, and that the event's probability could always find some equilibrium between the number the device will show and the probability of an action taken by the user to change it.
