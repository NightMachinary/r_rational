In terms of general announcements, I hope to publish a couple of long-form stories on [[/r/rational]] starting soon. The two I really have pinned down are an original fic and a fanfic. (The fanfic is /not/ going to be the same one I planned several months ago; my interest in that project sadly faded during the planning stage.)
