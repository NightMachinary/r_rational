I don't think being "capable of murder" is necessarily a bad thing. You have to be very brave to act to defend yourself or your family. Sometimes people start fights, and you have to fight back. HPMoR called this "killing intent", and while all supervillains have it, plenty of perfectly virtuous people do too.

It's one thing to have the inherent capacity to kill another person. It's another thing to do it when you don't have a /very very very/ good reason.

So a reality TV show has manipulated people into revealing an aspect of their personality that they wouldn't usually show? How unexpected. Also, turns out the Pope is a Catholic and bears shit in the woods.
