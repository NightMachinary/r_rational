Yeah i am aware of that experiment, from what i read the guy who designed this supposedly took lessons from that experiment as well as the stanford prison experiment(thus he made sure the subject felt "low status" compared to the people giving him orders).

Anyhow i think there is a difference between giving a shock which "may" kill a person and physically pushing someone from the roof..
