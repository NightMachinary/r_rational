You distinguish between correlation and causation to avoid falling afoul of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law][Goodhart's law]]. If X and Y tend to come together, and you want Y, so you do things that increase X, that works out fine if X /causes/ Y, but not if the causal relationship between them is more complicated - in fact, a correlation between X and Y may exist even if deliberately going out of your way to prioritize X actually /decreases/ Y.
