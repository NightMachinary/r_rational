  It's a catch 22 because your advice to change the habit, under the prevailing cultural imperatives, will be discounted because you have not yet proven causation

No, it wouldn't. You shouldn't /tell/ people that changing the habit will help. You're very much welcome to /try and see/ whether changing the habit helps. The difference is in confidence.

  How about if the choice is between two seemingly similar alleys, except that one is being occupied by a group of 20 year old young men and the other by a group of old ladies? Statistically, young men are more likely to assault you.
#+end_quote

Since the scenario assumes no opportunity cost, then sure, go to the old ladies. I don't think anyone would oppose that.

I don't think correlation/causation ever has much impact on individual, reactive decisions - i.e. I want to get home and minimise risk of a fight. However, once you are trying to either address causes of something, or trying to generalise rules, that's when you have to watch out for acting on spurious correlations.
