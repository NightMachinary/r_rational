  Simply put, it is easier and cheaper to establish correlation than prove causation. Having established it, correlation could be said to be useful as a heuristic in different areas of decision making to refine the outcome. Let's say that you're in the medical field and notice that a certain disease is strongly correlated with certain habits, such as eating a certain food or smoking. Because the budget is tight or thorough research simply has not yet been done, you cannot prove causation. Do you tailor your treatment or preventative policy simply on the overwhelming correlation even though you can't prove causation and rather likely improve the outcome, or do you strictly follow the idealistic guidelines to not act without established causation.

Well, it depends on what the cost of trying is? By recommending that people change their habits, you are effectively trying to prove causation - if this then causes the disease to become less common, you've done it. If not, you know that the correlation is spurious.

If the change in habits is small (i.e. the cost is small), this is a reasonable thing to do.

  Is it foolish or suicidal to deny factoring only correlation in personal decision making or even public policy by imposing a moral duty to satisfy a far more onerous rigor of causation.
#+end_quote

I don't think the moral duty comes in at this stage. You have a moral duty to not tell others that the causation exists, etc; and to avoid confusing correlation with causation yourself. But that doesn't mean you can't act based on the correlation - just that you have to be aware your action may turn out to be useless.

  In choosing your walking route from point A to point B at night, you can take a well lit boulevard or cut a shortcut through an alley where a group of young men are hanging out. Does avoiding the alley based on knowing that prisons are filled with young men imply a cognitive bias if you don't have research at hand that "being a young man causes violence".

Well, I would argue that you should take the boulevard because it's well lit, whereas the alley is dark. Not because young men hang out in the alley. If there was a well lit boulevard and a dark alley, and you knew young men liked to hang out on the well lit boulevard, would you argue to take the dark shortcut?

That to me seems exactly like what you want to avoid by distinguishing correlation and causation.
