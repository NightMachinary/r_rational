OK, so in biology, suppose presence of a certain gene X causes disease Y, and also causes much higher requirement for sugar in the diet. People with gene X are even more prone to Y if they're not ingesting enough sugar, because their organisms become weaker.

You will see correlation between ingestion of sugar and Y. This might lead you to suggest that the patient eat less sugar. However this will only make them more likely to catch Y, because they're now starving themselves.

Also, it sounds like isolating and confirming the 'contextual intersection' is basically equivalent to isolating and confirming causation.
