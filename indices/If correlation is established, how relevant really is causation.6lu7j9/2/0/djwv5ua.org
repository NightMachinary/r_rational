I find these exhibits misleading and intellectually dishonest because they compare measure of no contextual intersection (I just made that term up but I think it offers some semantic value). A contextual intersection would be a medium in which causes and effects can interact. Such a medium in the example of habit vs disease would be the human organism and its general responsiveness to various intakes (such as eat too much, get fat etc) could be taken axiomatically. There appears to be little or no interactivity medium between drowning in a pool and Nicholas Cage.
