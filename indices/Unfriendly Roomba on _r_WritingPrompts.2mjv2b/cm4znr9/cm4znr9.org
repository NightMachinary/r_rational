I started writing a story about a self-improving Roomba that only cared about wiping up dust. It would be owned by a hobbyist who has attached the Roomba to an internet-capable computer to reprogram it. This way, the Roomba could contact other Roombas owned by hobbyists. It would also feed the hobbyist new designs to increase it capabilities.

It would have ended with the Roomba zooming over the moon, sucking up all the dust.

I stopped writing because I couldn't get the tone right (also I'm at work and that's giving me a headache.)
