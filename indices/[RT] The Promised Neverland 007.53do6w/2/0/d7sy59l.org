It's possible, but seems highly unlikely that she would be able to survive losing an entire batch of children. Even just losing the three protagonists would probably be enough to secure her execution based on their apparent importance for the ceremony.

The story suggests that she has been diligently sending children off to be killed and eaten for many years, which doesn't sit well with the idea that she's a secret ally.

My hypothesis is that she's baiting them with specific information to (a) impress upon them her reach and knowledge, (b) encourage them to investigate solutions of her choice (knowing they lead to dead ends or pitfalls), and (c) keep them constantly reacting to her moves and not proactively planning.
