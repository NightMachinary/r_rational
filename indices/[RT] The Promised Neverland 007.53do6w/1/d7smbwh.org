The thing about the eldest girls being the only ones allowed to bathe the toddlers seems like a definite tip off. Though for what I think it's too early to say.

It does give me the impression that there will not be any "papas," and moreover the girls have purposes other than being eaten. Sort of like how male bulls are for the slaughter, and female cows for the milk.
