The third verse of The Girl Who Climbed The Tower:

#+begin_quote
  They say the third step is the cruelest,

  Walk when the moon is at her clearest:

  Love ends with the kiss of the knife,

  Trust is the wager that takes your life
#+end_quote

The first sentence of this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  The moon was out in full, and though part of me still grew irritated at the sight of the pale orb I'd learned to ignore it.
#+end_quote

So I'm pretty sure The Girl Who Climbed The Tower is a song about Cat and that each verse refers to each book (i.e. first verse - book one). If you think about it, what Cat just did was rather cruel, both to herself and to Kilian. The last two lines are still up to debate imo.

Before this chapter I thought their relationship would be re-established (Cat's trust in Kilian would be the "wager") and later Cat would be betrayed and die. However, the opposite happened - Cat finally ended her relationship for good.

So who's going to betray her trust? Could it be Black? Maybe one of the Woe?
