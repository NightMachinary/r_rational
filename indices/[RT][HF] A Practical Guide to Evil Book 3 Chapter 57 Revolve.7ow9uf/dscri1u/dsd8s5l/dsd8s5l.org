I think Killian nailed that door shut, though:

#+begin_quote
  “Do you really think /friends/ is what I want from you? Getting just a part of someone after having had all of them can't be counted anything but a loss.”
#+end_quote

It's actually a really darn good quote for anyone who thinks you can go from being lovers to just being friends when you still have romantic feelings for each other. It's all but impossible, because at least one of the parties involved doesn't want to be friends!

Edit: Well, thanks for the gold anonymous stranger! I'm going to just pretend it was from EE and I have been blessed by the voice of the gods (above or below: it's not certain which!)
