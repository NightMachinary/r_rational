What a superb chapter. Sometimes this story's in a cycle of â€˜merely' good set-up and skirmish chapters and I forget for a second these poignant character moments that eclipse so much of the material I read. PGTE has some great action set pieces and an enjoyably complex level of politics and scheming when appropriate but it's these defining character moments, these scenes with such feeling, where I can struggle to name more than a couple other stories, past and present, that compare.
