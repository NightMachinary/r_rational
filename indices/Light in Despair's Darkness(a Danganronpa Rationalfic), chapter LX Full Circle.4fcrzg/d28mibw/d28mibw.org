been waiting for this, I'm glad to finally see the new chapter, let's see what's going on...

Well, that's quite something.

I did notice that the story was getting more well written as chapters went on, characters other than the MC basically had no voice, I'm glad that got better as time went on and the later chapters were more enjoyable.

Although I'm not entirely satisfied with this ending, it feels sort of lacking, not crazy enough. That's why I voted for saving alter ego, I wanted to experience full-on crazy stuff happening but sadly people voted more for enoshima and her "demise" was quite boring, compared to what I expected alter would have brought.

I hope there will be a sequel in the future, with Enoshima alive a lot of DR2 would be really different.
