Yeah, I did my best to incorporate other characters more as time went on, hopefully by the end at least that was fixed.

I went with a slightly slower ending since I wanted the piece to kinda feel complete and resolved, even though there's a lot more plot left to happen in the world. There will be a sequel(possibly two, I'm not sure whether I want to combine DR:AE and DR2 into one story yet).
