[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180021-naked-economics][Naked Economics]] was required reading in AP Macro econ when I took that class a decade ago. I really liked that book.

I think [[/r/econmonitor]] is great for deeper economics exposure.

Edit: Also, [[https://plato.stanford.edu/][Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] is the best philosophy reference.
