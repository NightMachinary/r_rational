One thing I enjoy doing is exploring the banal. As you go through your day, ask yourself "Would this thing I just did seem like wizardry to someone from 500 years ago?" If so, figure out why.

As an example, you've probably had a mug of tea or coffee in the last week, and you probably don't live near a place where tea/coffee are grown. Okay, what is the backstory of that tea/coffee? How did the leaves/beans get to where you bought it. Imagine it's a film in reverse: The barista takes the beans out of the pot, puts them in a large container, loads it onto a metal cart (truck) powered by explosions created by burning the oil of plants (well, algae/plankton/etc) that died hundreds of millions of years ago. That truck drives backwards across incredibly flat and smooth black roads that climb up and down enormous mountains and pass through giant tunnels. It moves tirelessly at a speed fifteen or twenty times that of a horse across dozens or hundreds of miles to a port. Men take the bean containers and load them into a steel box the size of a small building (aka a cargo container). The steel box is picked up by a metal arm larger than a building (a powered crane) and placed onto a metal ship larger than multiple football fields. That ship is crewed by fewer people than crewed a Yankee clipper, yet it travels five times faster than the fastest wooden ship ever built. It sails backwards halfway around the world, shrugging off the worst storms on the way and never losing its way despite no one aboard ever checking their sextant. At the other end it's unloaded by another massive metal arm and onto another truck where it's driven to a plantation that stretches for miles.

You get the idea. Now, take any piece of that story and start googling. How exactly does an internal combustion engine work? How does oil form and why is it found in the places it's found? Is there any correlation between the cultures in oil-producing areas? What is the history of one of those areas and how did oil production affect it? How and why were container ships developed? Why is cargo transported in containers instead of loose, and who came up with that idea? How do ships navigate? Do they divert around storms or sail through them? How do they know where the storms will be? And so on.

It's a fun way to learn about the structure of the modern world and, as a bonus, it provides an appreciation for how amazing our lives are.
