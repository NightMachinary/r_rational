This explains a lot. Like Chapter 14.

But seriously this is a great list, including some I hadn't heard of, thank you!

  I guess I should also say that I had a liberal arts education, and took a bunch of different classes about all kinds of things that had little in the way of practical application, but which helped inform my thinking in one way or another.

And so much this. The liberal arts education experience is no joke in exposing one to a broad selection of ideas, from which connections and ideas can be built with later on in life. As a basis for improving science it seems like a pretty useful practice considering how many of the classical scientific giants had such broad interests in a number of subjects.
