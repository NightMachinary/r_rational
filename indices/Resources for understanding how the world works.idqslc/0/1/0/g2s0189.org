I can't come up with a non-fallacious argument why it wouldn't be, but that doesn't mean there isn't such an argument. If I use this fact as the basis for believing that eventually an ironclad argument will be discovered which will disprove your assertion, I would be committing the "fallacy fallacy" fallacy.
