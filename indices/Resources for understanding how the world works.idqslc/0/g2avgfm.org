Honestly, I owe a lot of what I know to Wikipedia, mostly because it's always there, instantly accessible. I'll visit at the drop of a hat, ready to read and follow links, and I think that's a good way of getting a lot of broad understanding of the world, because you can plug in gaps in your knowledge in relatively short order. Having some level of information hygiene is an important part of that, but yeah, there continue to be a lot of things I don't know, and I use a combination of Wikipedia and Google to keep myself informed.

Broadly speaking, I think it's best to go for authors and works that you can read most easily, even if that comes at the expense of information density, because you'll absorb more, faster if you're having fun than if it's a slow, confusing slog. There are a lot of books and works of landmark importance which I think you're better off just ignoring in favor of more digestable modern versions: [[https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text][/The Federalist Papers/]], [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations][/Wealth of Nations/]], or [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_the_Communist_Party][/The Communist Manifesto/]] are all important works to have some familiarity with, but they're not the best ways to get those juicy ideas, because their authors (and target audiences) came from a vastly different time and place than our own. I have a deep love for source documents like that, but so many of them have been refined and distilled down that it's more efficient to get them from a modern source.

I often gravitate toward "brief histories" of one kind or another, especially those which have anecdotes, or are centered around some particular thing that I know will also help me get a broad understanding. /Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator/ was ostensibly about elevators, but touched on a lot of history, class struggle, technology, architecture, and other things in a way that helped to weave a contextual web of ideas. Similarly, /From Front Porch to Back Seat/ was primarily focused on courtship, but also talked a lot about urbanization, economics, etc. in a way that I found helped me to connect some ideas. Just try to make sure that you're not reading someone with an axe to grind, or if you do read them, make sure that you know about it ahead of time so you can correct for it as you read.

A handful of recommended books:

- /The Law of Superheroes/ goes into a lot of legal topics through the lenses of fictional characters
- /A Little History of the World/ covers an enormous amount of ground in relatively entertaining fashion
- /Godel, Escher, Bach/ is perhaps a bit too up its own butt, but introduced me to a lot of topics and ways of thinking that would have taken me a lot longer (though enough of it is mainstream now that this has kind of become a source text that's lost its punch)
- /Technology in America: A Brief History/ really goes into the nitty-gritty in a lot of places in a way that I appreciated
- /How to Invent Everything/ is a guide to inventions for a time traveler, works best as a reference work, but has a ton of information

These are all books that I've read that I took something from, all fairly broad.

I guess I should also say that I had a liberal arts education, and took a bunch of different classes about all kinds of things that had little in the way of practical application, but which helped inform my thinking in one way or another. (I double majored in English and Computer Science with the intent of going into technical writing, but graduated in 2008, when the goal became 'get a job, any job'.)
