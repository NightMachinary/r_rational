Oh, I nearly forgot about Youtube, which I sometimes put on while writing or doing other things (especially cooking). Some recommendations:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo][engineerguy]], science and engineering, including a production of Faraday's /The Chemical History of a Candle/, which is well done
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkS_HP3m9NXOgswVAKbMeJQ][Then & Now]], history, philosophy, politics
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw][3Blue1Brown]], math
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpa-Zb0ZcQjTCPP1Dx_1M8Q][LegalEagle]], law
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkp4xDOwqqJD7sSM3xdUiQ][Adam Neely]], music and music theory
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoGR_EedlhKDVuWNwYWRbg][Voices of the Past]], readings of historical accounts
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy0tKL1T7wFoYcxCe0xjN6Q][Technology Connections]], inner workings of technology, typically 1980s or later
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ][Wendover Productions]], logistics
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxr2d4As312LulcajAkKJYw][Townsends]], historical cooking
- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWnlQMQ-ACfhpD68yWRsnJw][Todd's Workshop]], historical archery, arms, and armor

That's taken from my subscriptions list, trying to narrow it down to those that I think are high value and /mostly/ educational.
