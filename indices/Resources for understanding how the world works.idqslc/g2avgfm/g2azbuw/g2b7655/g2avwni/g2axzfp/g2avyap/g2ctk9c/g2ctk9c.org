Small nitpick here because that's something I know a little about myself, but if someone is going to try to look for the cliffnotes version of Socialist/Communist/Marxist theory */you don't want the Communist Manifesto/*. That work, as iconic as it might be, it's basically a long and detailed pamphlet.

*/Das Kapital/* is the one you need to look a modern explanation of. */Wage, labor and capital/* is like a simplified precursor that some people insist is a very good staring point. And */Critique of the Gotha Program/* is kinda important too to learn the difference between pre-marx or utopian socialists and post-marx or scientific socialists.

Of course, I would recommend anyone trying to learn about that to actually read those works instead of explanations of them because they're a chore to get trough, but those are the works that actually mattered, even if the manifesto is the famous one.
