I think it would be interesting to go through and make an annotated version of the story, but it would take time that I don't have, and I don't really know how it would be best to implement it for easy consumption. Maybe if I find myself doing a full edit and/or re-read, I'll do that. Or maybe if I can figure out a way to do a community sourced version.
