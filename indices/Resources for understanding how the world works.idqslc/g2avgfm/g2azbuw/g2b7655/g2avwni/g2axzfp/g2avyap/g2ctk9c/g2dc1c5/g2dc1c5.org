I love your story, but I don't have a good grasp on your actual writing process. So please take this request with the knowledge that if it would be a pain in the ass to implement, it is my most heartfelt wish that you ignore it. That said:

- It would be neat to see your own Wikipedia references or what-have-you for each chapter. An out-of-story research log that we can follow? A list of inspirations or sources of knowledge?

I often find myself Googling things out of WtC just to pull more contextual information in for myself, but that's a bit flawed as Google is not a perfect or equal search engine.
