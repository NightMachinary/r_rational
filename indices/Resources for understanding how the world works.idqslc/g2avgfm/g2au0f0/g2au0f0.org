The obvious answer is of course [[https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality][the sequences]], if you haven't read them (along with classical philosophy often found in college or highschool just so you can understand what the hell everyone else is saying; I'm sure someone somewhere has a better list within easy googling). The author (of the sequences) also self inserts a list of books into his [[https://hpmor.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_books#Non-fiction][HPMOR fiction]] that one might consider a new rationalist to have read (note the */context/* of some of these books; some of them were used by the /villain/ as justification, some were mentioned as books people should look at with a critical eye). [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wfJebLTPGYaK3Gr8W/recommended-reading-for-new-rationalists][This post by the same community]] (read the comments for the primary response; though the post itself and the pingbacks are meta-links to other lists) is a great jumping off point for related stuff ([[http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html][Paul Graham's essays]] show up a lot), though mostly in article format. I'd be curious if there was a better list of books by this (the less wrong) community I missed somewhere.

For continuing learning the issue becomes a bit more difficult. One could use the above to build a good base of knowledge, but to continuously update and exercise that knowledge is also important. For financial news and theory I follow [[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine][Money Stuff]] ([[http://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/join/4wm/moneystuff-signup&hash=54223001ca3ffcf40f2629c25acea67a][subscribe link]] to beat the paywall) as a jumping off point every day. Professionally I use the news aggregator [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]] (managed(-ish?) by Paul Graham from above) along with various reddit communities (including this one!), as well as some interpersonal connections I maintain. But this is a very personal answer.
