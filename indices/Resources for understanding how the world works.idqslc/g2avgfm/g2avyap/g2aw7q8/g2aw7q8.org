Oh, I've always loved elevators. Not in a weird, obsessive way, but they're one of those "invisible" things that most people don't think all that much about, and there's something about those hidden things that tickle me. I got the book because of a love of elevators, rather than for any other reason, and elevators show up a lot (or at least, more than you'd naively expect) in WtC for the same reason.
