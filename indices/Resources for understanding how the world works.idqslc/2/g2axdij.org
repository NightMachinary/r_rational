Yudkowsky's sequences on LessWrong are useful, if quirky, for general rationality and cognitive biases. Some more in-depth but /far/ less approachable sources are Causality (Pearl) for the nature of probabilistic reasoning and causality, and Philosophical Investigations (Wittgenstein) for the philosophy of language (work your way towards these, don't dive straight in). I actually don't know anything that addresses cognitive biases as well as the sequences though.

Some fun introductions to philosophy are [[https://existentialcomics.com/][Existential Comics (webcomic)]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/c/thephilosophytube/videos][Philosophy Tube (youtube channel)]]. Since "philosophy" includes everything from political-economic theories (Smith) to completely opposed political-economic theories (Marx) to ill-advised attempts to describe the world using formal logic (Wittgenstein) to rejections of the idea of language as formal logic (also Wittgenstein) to complete horseshit (Thales), it helps to have some a fun survey of what's out there before diving in.

I learned economics so long ago that I don't really have a good source anymore. One huge thing I see most sources ignore (including the ones I initially learned from) are is the effects of ownership - you usually see microeconomics as a toy model of a two-person transaction and a lot of conclusions get turned on their head if there's a third person who decides whether or not the transaction gets to happen. One good framework for this is Marx's distinction between personal property (stuff you own that you use) and private property (stuff you own that you can charge other people to use), which can be very handy when analyzing things (Marx is a mixed bag but this bit of insight really is golden). For fun economics, shoutout to [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou][Spice And Wolf]], an anime about microeconomics and romance (and an anti-shoutout to Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, the other anime about economics and romance, which has a child's understanding of both).

I'd recommend [[https://acoup.blog/resources-for-world-builders/][A Collection Of Unmitigated Pedantry]] as a fun intro to history. He does a good job of covering how working historians actually go about their job and think about things, as well as some more specific stuff like how state power works and how the tactics/operations/strategy division works (he recommends Clausewitz on this, but I haven't even started reading him yet). Recommending this mostly because a lot of pop history subscribes to a horribly outdated model of history based on great men, great ideas, and great battles, and once you've seen the real thing it's a lot easier to be suspicious of that stuff. Also shout out to [[https://www.youtube.com/user/donoteat01/videos][donoteat01's Franklin series]] for some American history and some very good history of labor activism, but he's much more pop history than acoup. And shout out to [[/r/AskHistorians]], another place where you can learn the real history vs pop history smell test (but I think acoup is better at it).
