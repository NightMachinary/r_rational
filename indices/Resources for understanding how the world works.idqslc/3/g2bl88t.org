A lot of this stuff is also bullshit. I love Yudkowsky, but he builds a lot of stuff on extremely questionable psychology. Nearly every physcholgy experiment he mentions in HPMOR (Stanford prison, Asch conformity etc.) had been compromised and mired in awful methodology. Most other authors are even worse with their American centric understanding of politics.
