What are you doing, man? Seriously, why are you claiming to have copy/pasted when anyone can demonstrate in 2 seconds that you did not? I just edited my first comment to post it directly so people can see how you're misrepresenting things, and you're still actually claiming to have copy/pasted? Why? Who are you hoping to fool?
