It is indeed common for quotation marks to be used that way. I don't like it, and personally I sometimes use «these things» for paraphrasing, but it's how it is.

#+begin_quote
  you do not seem to actually know that you are paraphrasing, since you attacked YOUR version of my critiques and not mine.
#+end_quote

This sounds like what would happen if someone was aware that they were paraphrasing, but had misunderstood the original text and as a result was paraphrasing badly.

Given that you're already accusing them of misunderstanding you, this extra accusation doesn't seem to have much explanatory power.
