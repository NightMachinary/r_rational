Yo daystar, I like your content and agree with your arguments here. I don't think this was a very constructive comment though. Your opponent is more likely to get upset about being accused of forgetting and misreading than they are to respond constructively.

Can you write this in a way that respects your opponent more or rephrase your own arguments in the places where he misunderstood?
