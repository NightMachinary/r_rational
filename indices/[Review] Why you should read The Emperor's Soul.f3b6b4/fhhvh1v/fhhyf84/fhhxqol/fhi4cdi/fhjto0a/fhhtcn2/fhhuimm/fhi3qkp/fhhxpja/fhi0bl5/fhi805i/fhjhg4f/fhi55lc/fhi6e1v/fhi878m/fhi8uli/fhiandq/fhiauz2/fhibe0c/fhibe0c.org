Yes, obviously I'm talking about my original post, since that's the thing I keep pointing you to reread since you misrepresented it.

If you are now insisting that paraphrasing is fine because you didn't use "quote bars" but instead used quotation marks, no, I don't see that as "very clearly paraphrasing," because that's not how quotation marks work, and you do not seem to actually know that you are paraphrasing, since you attacked YOUR version of my critiques and not mine.
