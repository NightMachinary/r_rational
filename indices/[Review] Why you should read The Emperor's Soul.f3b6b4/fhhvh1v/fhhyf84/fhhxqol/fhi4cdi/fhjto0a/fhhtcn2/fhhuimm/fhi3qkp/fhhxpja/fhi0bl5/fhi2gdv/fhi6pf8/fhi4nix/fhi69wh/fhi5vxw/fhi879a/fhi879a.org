  I don't understand where you think that, for example, Dalinar's powers that allowed him to summon stormlight in the final battle of book 3 were anywhere predicted.

So, you say that this is a super common thing that happens throughout the books repeatedly. I say that the only example you could give happens at the very end of an unfinished series, and that it gets a pass until we learn more. You then say "Don't forget about that one time it happened at the very end of the unfinished series!" Your lack of ability to point to any example other than that one is good enough for me.

  You misread me, and the book, again. Please read more carefully: he DID manage to do this during training in book 1. How long has it been since you read the books?
#+end_quote

You see him practicing, in a controlled environment, a very concentration-intensive and canonically difficult skill with a single half-success. I don't know whether you've ever trained any martial skills in reality (I hate to pull the veteran card here, but it actually is relevant), but c'mon. This is silly. Even if the quirks of training martial skills weren't specifically highlighted in that very chapter, this would be a reach.

  Sorry, you know you just contradicted yourself, right? I mistook which of Shallan or Jasnah has the ones called Cryptics, but you just said he never talked about "talking to them," which I never said he did, and implied that he ONLY talked about "people" following him. So you were wrong, as you're admitting now, and he did NOT just talk about people following him.

So cannot at all see a reason why an unhinged person who organized his own assassination attempt might say those words - /other/ than that he is being followed by /unheard of/ creatures from beyond your dimension.

  It would be insane for anyone to call him on it THEN. Not LATER when they all know what spren are, 2 of them know what cryptics look like, and all of them have talked about these things together, as a group. You are not reading my criticisms carefully.

"Hey, Elhokar! Remember that time you got kinda crazy and talked about assassins in mirrors and shit? Well, none of us have actually met full Cryptics yet (we've only seen Pattern, at best), but I just want to make sure that you weren't seeing spren. In fact, the first time anyone other than Shallan or Jasnah will see cryptics in full will be right after you die. So... yeah. I guess I should have talked to Jasnah about the actual word-for-word specifics of a single line of Elhokar's ravings from 6 months ago."

Seriously, I think we're done here. You seem like the kind of person that absolutely requires getting in the last word - so go for it. You're getting a bit foolish in your arguments.
