Well, it's true that he could have handled that more gracefully and rephrased his point.

But from what I understand, it /does/ seem like you completely misunderstood that very short point.

Given that you apparently also disagreed with every single one of his other points, it does give the impression that you stopped honestly weighting and/or trying to understand his arguments at some point and just rejected everything on principle.

*So*, let me rephrase his arguments for you. (Bear in mind that I haven't read the series in question.)

*He says:* The god sent prerecorded messages. He did not only (somewhat stupidly) not declare them as such, but did also (very stupidly) send messages like "Yes.", "Yes - definitely." /without any context whatsoever/, like some deranged Magic 8-Ball, instead of an intelligent being. This constitutes an idiot ball.

*You reply:* Had the guy receiving these prerecorded messages replied with different (unread) messages than he canonically did, he would have come to different conclusions than he canonically did.

Your "counterpoint" is a true enough statement. But it does not contradict the point that the god is acting like an idiot. What the receiver of the messages does or does not do is completely irrelevant to [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s point.

*EDIT:* Note, I am not claiming that [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s point's is correct. I do not know. I have not read the books. [[/u/DaystarEld]] might be mischaracterizing what happens, or the received messages might be out-of-order, altered or fragmented for some legitimate reason for all I know. (Though in the latter case, the plot might be attacked on the grounds that it requires a ridiculous contrivance of coincidences.) All I am saying is that your point does not at all address his point, which makes you latter statement be quite out of line.
