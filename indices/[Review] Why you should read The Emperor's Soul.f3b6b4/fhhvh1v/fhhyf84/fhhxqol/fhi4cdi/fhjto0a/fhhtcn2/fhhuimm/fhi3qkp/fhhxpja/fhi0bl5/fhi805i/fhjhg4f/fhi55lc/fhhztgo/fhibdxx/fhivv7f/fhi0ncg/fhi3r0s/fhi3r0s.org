I haven't been able to get myself to read Sanderson, after finishing The Wheel of Time, but I'm pretty sure I can tell you one major reason people love him. His writing speed. Having spent 10+ years waiting for WoT to finish (out of the total, almost 23 year publishing history of that series), with nothing from Robert Jordan in the interim, having an author who publishes two books a year seems cathartic in comparison.
