  When a character refuses to engage in normal and well. .. expected behaviour

It's very clearly because it's 'expected' 'normal' behaviour that Adolin doesn't want to do it. He's a romantic and he believes himself better than the others of his generation because of his purity and virtue.

It's honestly not out of character at all. I didn't know Sanderson was a mormon and did not at any point wonder why Adolin was avoiding sex.
