Do you believe that the Doors of Stone is going to:

- cover Kvothe's history with all its character-/crucial/ details up to the point where he moved to the inn, and

  - (skipping some character-important details clearly will happen, and has happened in the previous books, but not /crucial/ details)

- be at most 10x the combined length of the preceding two books

I don't think that's remotely plausible. I don't think that there is enough space to cover all of the things the plot to date requires that it cover. Which include:

- Kvothe kills a king or does something which the public construes as him killing a king, making the name of the trilogy appropriate

- Kvothe fights in a war

- Kvothe meets Bast

- Kvothe encounters the Doors of Stone and understands why this is significant

- Kvothe steals a princess back from a sleeping barrow king

- Kvothe meets his mother's family and knows he has done so

- Kvothe does or experiences something so horrible that he renounces his name, and probably his Name, and becomes Kote. This quite clearly is not just him being a wanted man, despite his claim.

- Kvothe becomes so impressive that he unarguably needs three days to tell his life story

The story as framed in the first two books of KKC is clearly the /tragedy/ of Kvothe, though whether it's a Greek tragedy or a Romantic tragedy is not totally clear. It is not an origin story, it is the story of how he became the person who is hiding as an innkeeper in a small village and yet is worth seeking out for his life story. Will there be loose threads? Absolutely; what kind of person he is after Chronicler's tale is written is a fascinating loose end that must be raised. But there is an arc, and it has an endpoint which is possibly the most /immutable/ endpoint of any novel series, and Rothfuss has made barely any progress toward that endpoint.
