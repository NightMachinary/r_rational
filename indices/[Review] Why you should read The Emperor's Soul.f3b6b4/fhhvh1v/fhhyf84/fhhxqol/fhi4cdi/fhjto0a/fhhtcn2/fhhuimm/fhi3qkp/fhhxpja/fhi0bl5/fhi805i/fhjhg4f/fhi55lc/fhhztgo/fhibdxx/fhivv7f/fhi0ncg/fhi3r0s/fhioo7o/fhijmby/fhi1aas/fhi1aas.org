I disagree with you on a lot of points. The Mistborn one books were overall terrible, Vin gained power as the plot needed to move on. Didn't read era 2.

Stormlight was fine up untill they left the bridge. He was building up to something he couldn't deliver.

The third book was just boring, after some meandering on book two. The spren world is... so bland and underwhelming for creatures which were embodiment of concepts.

Kaladin also gets power as the plot demands, plus everyone is a fantasy mormon and sex is icky, so they feel inhuman - 'Oh lol, let me charm you by talking about shit during dinner.'

  Rothfuss, Martin, and Butcher are all much better authors imo.

Martin is a legitimely good author - Butcher and Rothfuss I don't care for.
