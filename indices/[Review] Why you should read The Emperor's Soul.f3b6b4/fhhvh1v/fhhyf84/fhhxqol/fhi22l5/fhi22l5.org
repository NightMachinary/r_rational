They're related, but distinct, as far as I can tell. We don't fully understand soulcasting yet, but it seems to rely more on perceived authority, confidence, and being persuasive to the spirit of the object you're trying to change.

Forging, in contrast, focuses more on the plausibility of a change. Plausibility here means something like "is it possible that the desired effect could have been the case, if something in the past was different" Instead of convincing a chair that it would would prefer to be broken, you use your magic to make it so that something that /could have/ happened, insects chewing up one of the legs, /did/ in fact happen. How much magic and skill it takes to accomplish any desired effect is dependent on how much of a bend in reality it would take for that desired effect to be true.

If you want to make a wooden chair turn into solid gold, you would have to essentially convince reality that the creator of that chair decided to make the chair out of gold, instead of wood. Maybe there's some extremely unlikely universe where that happened, where an emperor happened to want a chair made out of gold and picked this artisan to make it, but that's such an implausible change that the magic is almost guaranteed to fail.
