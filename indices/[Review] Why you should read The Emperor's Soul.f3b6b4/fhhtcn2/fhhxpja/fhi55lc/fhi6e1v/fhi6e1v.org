You misquoted my post, multiple times. You've also contradicted yourself post to post, /and/ you are failing to explain the events of the books that support your arguments instead of mine.

I don't really care if /you/ think I'm wrong, at this point, when you cannot even accurately quote my criticisms. I'm talking to others, who should know better, particularly on this sub.
