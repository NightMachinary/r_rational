Then you changed your posts after they were written, because yeah - that was all direct copy/paste.

I also did some editing for grammar after one, and you quoted the incorrect grammar version. Welcome to the internet, dude.

EDIT: Ah, unless you're talking about the first post. See how they're not in quote bars? That's very clearly paraphrasing. Not hard to see, and that too happens sometimes. Welcome to life, dude.
