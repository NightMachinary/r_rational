That may be what you're /saying/ now, but it is not what you /said/ in any of your comments above.. You said "[that] he'll ruin with [...] thinly veiled fantasy mormonism". I replied that they don't have "thinly veiled fantasy Mormonism", and you replied with a bunch of places where details of the world match superficial trappings of the Mormon mythos, and repeated the claim "It's fantasy mormonism.". (Some of which weren't even really correct, like the "angels", which is just a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention][TVTropes/TranslationConvention]].) And then, when I emphasized that it doesn't have Mormonism, just some superficial trappings of the Mormon memeplex, you seem to be retreating to a new and different claim, that drawing any inspiration from the stories his religion tells makes his fiction worse, and claiming that it was the claim you were originally making, when it very clearly was not.

Your new claim is also baseless, as far as I can tell, but I am not going to engage regardless because if I do, you'll just switch to a third claim and pretend it was what you said all along.
