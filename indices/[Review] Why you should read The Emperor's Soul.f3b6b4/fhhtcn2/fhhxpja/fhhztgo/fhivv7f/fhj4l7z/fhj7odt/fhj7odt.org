The plates of steel in era 1 aren't about religion; if anything they're The True Physics. "Here is the way this world works, with these testable empirical consequences; good luck."

I haven't read Mistborn Era 2, but I know what you're referring to as "angels" and it's not angels, just something some characters in-universe believe are angels. Reality check: humans tend to believe in gods and angels, by whatever name. Since we're getting the story translated to English, their names for gods and angels will use the ones English uses, which were set by Christian English-speakers.

If you're going to disqualify anything with something that in some way reflects the structure of the universe their religion believes in as being a reflection of their religion, you're not going to read much. Objecting to some trivial trappings of religion being used as source material and inspiration for a fantasy work is cargo-cult atheism, forgetting why religion is bad and using it as a boo light.
