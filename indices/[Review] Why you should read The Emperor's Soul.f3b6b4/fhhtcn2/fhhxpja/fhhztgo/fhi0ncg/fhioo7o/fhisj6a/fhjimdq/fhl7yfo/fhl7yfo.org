Dresden Files feels like a good TV series that has run too long. The first few books were really punchy and stuck to the detective formula, and the recent stuff has been /slow/ and not as good. +I'm not aware of any clear plan for an end to the series.+

ASOIAF was supposed to have a timeskip and Rickon was supposed to matter. GRRM has no idea how to stick to a plan for his series. The brutal political maneuvering and low magic is good, but if he knew how he was ending it, the last seasons of the TV series wouldn't have been such a dumpster fire.

KKC has all the problems you described above.

So, one of my favorite things about Sanderson is just that he has a plan for the entire arc before he actually gets my hopes up with published prose. This lets me get excited about speculating / fanboying because things that seem like hints or foreshadowing probably are going to actually come up, instead of just being dropped in to be mysterious.
