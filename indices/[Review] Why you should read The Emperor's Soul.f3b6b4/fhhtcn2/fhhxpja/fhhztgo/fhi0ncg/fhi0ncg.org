The Mistborn trilogy is highly overrated, and I barely managed to get through The Way of Kings despite everyone praising it to the high heavens. The second and third books were a lot better, and I can see why people enjoy him now. But he's not nearly as good as he's hyped up to be. Despite his world building and magic systems being great, Rothfuss, Martin, and Butcher are all much better authors imo.
