Asking your opponent to re-read has never been a successful technique for me in any online debate ever. I have also never seen it succeed. I have seen it cause offence many times. It often gets taken as an Ad Hominem attack regardless of the intent.

Starting with that, my recommendation is to quote the specific part you want him to understand better and possibly even restate the point it makes differently.

Also sadly, when people are debating a point that becomes a contention of memory, I don't think there is anything to do but either drop the point or do the hard work. It is unlikely that he will re-read or change his memory. I recommend actually finding an example or two from the book or tabling that part of the argument until a later time.
