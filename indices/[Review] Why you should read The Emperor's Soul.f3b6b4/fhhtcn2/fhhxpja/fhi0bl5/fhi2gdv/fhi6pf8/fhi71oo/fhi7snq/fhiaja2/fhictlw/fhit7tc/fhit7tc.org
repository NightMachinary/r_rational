True, and I did for most of them. The only one I just skipped over entirely and told him to reread was the one where he missed the point entirely, wasn't even in the same ballpark. I still don't know how he could have thought I was complaining about Dalinar's actions when I actually, specifically PRAISED him for testing his beliefs. It really comes off to me like he just skimmed the whole post.
