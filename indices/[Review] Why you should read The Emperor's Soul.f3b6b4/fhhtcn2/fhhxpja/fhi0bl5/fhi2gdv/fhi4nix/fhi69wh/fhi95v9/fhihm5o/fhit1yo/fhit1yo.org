  Though in the latter case, the plot might be attacked on the grounds that it requires a ridiculous contrivance of coincidences.

Thank you, this is in fact exactly what my argument was. The god does in fact say that it's all a prerecorded message, but the character and readers don't know that because the character apparently just forgot about it due to how traumatic the visions were, which I also find... difficult to swallow, but even taking it for granted, the actual criticism is that this entire event is utterly contrived to get the protagonist to trust the visions to disastrous effects.
