I've only read Mistborn and Stormlight, but I disagree that he does this. The rational way to solve the plot in a way that's still interesting is to have the characters think of using powers both they and the readers already understand in new ways. I can't recall a time when this happens as the actual thing that solves a plot point in a Sanderson book I've read. Most of the major plot conflicts are solved by entirely new powers being realized, or in people utilizing their powers in ways that they were not capable of doing before.

And it's fine if people enjoy Sanderson despite this. Keep in mind that my original objection was to the idea that he writes rational fiction. He writes well constructed worlds and magic systems, but his characters and plots are very far from rational.
