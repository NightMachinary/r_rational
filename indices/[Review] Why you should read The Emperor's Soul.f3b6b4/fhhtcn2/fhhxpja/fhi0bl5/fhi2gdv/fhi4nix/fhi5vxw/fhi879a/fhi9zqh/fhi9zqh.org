  I say that the only example you could give happens at the very end of an unfinished series, and that it gets a pass until we learn more. You then say "Don't forget about that one time it happened at the very end of the unfinished series!" Your lack of ability to point to any example other than that one is good enough for me.

Again, for the 7th time at least, I have to point out that *you are misunderstanding the criticism.* Your argument about it being at the end of the third book doesn't actually change anything.

It is NOT enough to explain things AFTER they happen. My argument was that they are not explained /beforehand,/ which makes them come off as deus-ex-machina. Coming up with explanations afterward, in future books, does nothing to make that problem go away.

  You see him practicing, in a controlled environment, a very concentration-intensive and canonically difficult skill with a single half-success. I don't know whether you've ever trained any martial skills in reality (I hate to pull the veteran card here, but it actually is relevant), but c'mon. This is silly.

And yet he still does it in combat and gets it right the first time he does. /shrugs/ If you think it's silly that I expect him to try the skill earlier, that's fine.

  So cannot at all see a reason why an unhinged person who organized his own assassination attempt might say those words - other than that he is being followed by unheard of creatures from beyond your dimension.

Why are you still responding as if I didn't explicitly say the later books? Why are you still acting like this is all about book 1?

  "Hey, Elhokar! Remember that time you got kinda crazy and talked about assassins in mirrors and shit? Well, none of us have actually met full Cryptics yet (we've only seen Pattern, at best), but I just want to make sure that you weren't seeing spren. In fact, the first time anyone other than Shallan or Jasnah will see cryptics in full will be right after you die. So... yeah. I guess I should have talked to Jasnah about the actual word-for-word specifics of a single line of Elhokar's ravings from 6 months ago."

"Wait, THAT'S what spren can look like? GUYS THAT'S THE THING I SEE FOLLOWING ME SOMETIMES!"

You have an abysmally low expectation of intelligence for these characters. You do recall my objection is that Sanderson is not writing RATIONAL fiction, right?

#+begin_quote
  Seriously, I think we're done here. You seem like the kind of person that absolutely requires getting in the last word - but yeah. You're getting a bit foolish in your arguments.
#+end_quote

You have failed at every single argument you are trying to make here. Failed in expressing my critiques and failed in substantiating your points. It's not about wanting the last word, it's about wanting to point out that my arguments are being misrepresented.

But instead of addressing this you've just been doubling down again and again, so if you want to stop now that's probably best. It's literally all there in my post for you to go back and look again if you cared to.
