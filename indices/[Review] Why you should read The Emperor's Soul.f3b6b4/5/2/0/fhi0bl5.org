Alright - I'm gonna have to wall of text this, because every single one of these objections is... kinda contrived.

1) "There's no indication ahead of time when or how the oaths will manifest." followed by "it gets cheap and anticlimactic once you see it coming." Yeah, that's what happens when a mysterious ancient power gets to be slowly understood. It always had clearly defined rules, you didn't understand them and they seem like Deus Ex Machina, then you do and they seem anticlimactic. This objection makes no sense. If you already knew the normal progression of a surgebinder, book 1 wouldn't have a dramatic ending. It would be an expected victory lap for the clearly standard path the main character is following.

2) "Adolin took too long to learn to throw his shard blade." You see him practicing it, he references how he's still practicing it in book two, and then he throws it in book three to so-so effect. Considering the relatively quick timeline of these books, it's really hard to call that one an idiot ball. That's a normal progression of a minor skill from a secondary(ish) character in a series that highlights the difficulties of training martial skills.

3) "Why didn't Elhokar say the words just to try them out?" Considering his obsession with the concept of being a hero, he certainly did. But it would undercut the dramatic moment that I wont spoil here if it had been shown. It's fairly well established that just saying the words doesn't do shit - there has to actually be understanding behind them on the part of the speaker (in fact, the actual words and their phrasing don't seem to matter as much anyway). Not showing the entirety of a tertiary character's journey for the sake of allowing perceptive readers to predict the dramatic moment is normal for any well written book, rational or otherwise. And he never talked about talking to spren, I don't know why this guy got that impression. He talked about people following him and being watched - which, for a paranoid king who tried to organize his own attempted assassination, has a much simpler explanation.

4) Why did Dalinar test the messages from the god and then correctly act upon the results of his test? Gee. Would he have gotten different results if he had conducted a different test? Of course. That's how things work. But he didn't, because he wasn't handed a plot baton. He suspected something was amiss, tested his theory, and got a result.

5) He complains about not liking the characters. I think it's safe to say he's in the minority here. I suspect, however that this is his /actual/ objection to the series, and the rest is derived to support this dislike.

6) He complains about Sanderson not using the arguments he prefers for atheism. This is more of a wtf response from me as a lifelong atheist. Ignoring the fact that this is a world where literal gods do exist (and I would expect the arguments in such a world to be different), Jasnah's arguments are all both reasonable and common in real atheist-religious confrontations. She even has a few that are somewhat unique to that world. He doesn't like that the atheist in Mistborn gained more nuanced views on religion as part of the process of /becoming a god./ Seriously, this one doesn't make sense to me at all.

I was prepared to accept real objections to the series, here. But these... just don't make any sense.
