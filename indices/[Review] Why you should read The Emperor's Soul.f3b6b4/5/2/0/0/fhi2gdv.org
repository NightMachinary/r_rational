  Yeah, that's what happens when a mysterious ancient power gets to be slowly understood. It always had clearly defined rules, you didn't understand them and they seem like Deus Ex Machina, then you do and they seem anticlimactic. This objection makes no sense.
#+end_quote

You missed the objection: it's not that they seemed anticlimactic because I understood them, they were anticlimactic because they were predictable as /story beats/ while also being utterly unpredictable in /effects./

You seem to be saying that the magic system's rules are clearly defined, and this is just not true. There is nothing in the books that indicate ahead of time what the powers the characters suddenly gain will be.

  "Adolin took too long to learn to throw his shard blade."
#+end_quote

Not what I said, read more carefully please: he learned to do it in book one, he never bothered trying to use it in combat until book 3, where it worked the first time he tried it after his practice session. You seem to be misremembering the events of the books.

  Considering his obsession with the concept of being a hero, he certainly did. But it would undercut the dramatic moment that I wont spoil here if it had been shown. It's fairly well established that just saying the words doesn't do shit - there has to actually be understanding behind them on the part of the speaker (in fact, the actual words and their phrasing don't seem to matter as much anyway). Not showing the entirety of a tertiary character's journey for the sake of allowing perceptive readers to predict the dramatic moment is normal for any well written book, rational or otherwise.
#+end_quote

This is my point about predictability: you are basing this off of what is predictable for /plot structure/, not what is predictable for the magic system. You cannot claim that Sanderson's magic system is predictable and understandable when the trigger is something as subjective and internal as "when the speaker truly understands them." It's a gimmick that works well for letting the author decide when they want things to happen, but is not compatible with a truly rational and understandable magic system.

Which is fine, if that's the kind of magic system Sanderson wants to write. But he wrote the Law of Magic that states that the magic system's ability to solve plot points should be proportional to how well the readers understand it, and yet he constantly solves plot points with a magic system that is not just unpredictable in its development of new aspects, but also its effects.

  And he never talked about talking to spren, I don't know why this guy got that impression. He talked about people following him and being watched - which, for a paranoid king who tried to organize his own attempted assassination, has a much simpler explanation.
#+end_quote

This guy (who is me btw) got that impression because he very explicitly was describing spren, specifically the same ones Jasnah sees, Cryptics. You may not remember it or have noticed it, but it's certainly there in book one.

  4) Why did Dalinar test the messages from the god and then correctly act upon the results of his test? Gee. Would he have gotten different results if he had conducted a different test? Of course. That's how things work. But he didn't, because he wasn't handed a plot baton. He suspected something was amiss, tested his theory, and got a result.
#+end_quote

You completely missed this argument's point. Please reread it.

  5) He complains about not liking the characters. I think it's safe to say he's in the minority here. I suspect, however that this is his actual objection to the series, and the rest is derived to support this dislike.
#+end_quote

If you think I disliked the series before I even started it, you're just assuming bad faith, which I have no answer to. But again, please read more carefully: I disliked the characters in book 1 specifically. Most of them got better.

#+begin_quote
  6) He complains about Sanderson not using the arguments he prefers for atheism.
#+end_quote

I did note this is the most subjective one, but my actual problem is that the arguments for atheism are not actually good ones considering the world she lives in. You even bring it up yourself: "where literal gods do exist." If you're writing an atheist in a world like that, particularly from a brilliant academic who's the premier skeptic in her world, I expect a better class of argument than the ones Jasnah used. If they were acceptable to you, great, but I found them very weak.

#+begin_quote
  I was prepared to accept real objections to the series, here. But these... just don't make any sense.
#+end_quote

Hopefully this clarifies things.
