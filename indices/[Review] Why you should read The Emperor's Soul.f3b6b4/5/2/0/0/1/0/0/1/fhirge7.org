The idea that you can assign "jobs" in arguments by examining their broad structure and ignoring specific details seems misguided.

If Alice makes an argument and Bob responds based on a misunderstanding, then /surely/ before telling Alice what her "job" is, you should ask such questions as: "is Alice able, with reasonable effort, to present the argument in a different form?" "Did Bob appear to be actually making an effort to understand Alice?" "Are Alice and Bob trying to convince each other, or to convince bystanders, or just arguing for the sake of it, or what?" "Do Alice and Bob have a broadly friendly relationship, and would they like to keep it that way?"
