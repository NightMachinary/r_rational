  You seem to be saying that the magic system's rules are clearly defined, and this is just not true. There is nothing in the books that indicate ahead of time what the powers the characters suddenly gain will be.
#+end_quote

We must have read different books here. There are only two people who's powers aren't fairly explicitly defined on arrival (maybe don't skip the epilogue that lines out how they all work). The first is Kaladin at the end of book 1 - and they're foreshadowed heavily both by his own story and the presence of someone who specifically outlines how they work in the prologue. Testing the details about your powers (ala Shallan's lightweaving practice) is a common trope in ratfics anyway. The only /real/ example you can point to is a single action by Dalinar at the tail end of book 3 - and given that we have no reason to believe we're not starting another cycle of "explaining how that was a normal progression" (there's no book 4 yet), I'm giving that one a temporary pass until we learn more.

  Not what I said, read more carefully please: he learned to do it in book one, he never bothered trying to use it in combat until book 3, where it worked the first time he tried it.
#+end_quote

And you can't come up with a reason that someone wouldn't throw away their weapon before training on how to do so with effect? More to the point, it is explicitly called out as something very difficult to accomplish at all (let alone use in combat) by Hrdalm, the person he saved.

  You cannot claim that Sanderson's magic system is predictable and understandable when the trigger is something as subjective and internal as "when the speaker truly understands them."
#+end_quote

I think you're being obtuse here. If you don't see a difference between me reading from a script to see if I get powers and actually internalizing concepts, then I don't think you're speaking in good faith.

#+begin_quote
  This guy (who is me btw) got that impression because he very explicitly was describing spren, specifically the same ones Jasnah sees, Cryptics. You may not remember it or have noticed it, but it's certainly there in book one.
#+end_quote

Shallan sees Cryptics, not Jasnah. And I absolutely remember it, because it was one of the clues for the aforementioned "perceptive readers." Let's stop speaking in generalities. In the middle of a speech about how he sees assassins everywhere and thinks he's being followed, Elhokar says:

#+begin_quote
  I see their faces in mirrors. Symbols, twisted, inhuman.
#+end_quote

He says this to a room full of people who do not know anything about spren (or even the concept of sugebinding), and who all know that he is a paranoid little shitbag. It would be insane for anyone to call him out on it. I mean genuinely weird. I mean "how can you even think that would be a reasonable response" weird.

#+begin_quote
  You completely missed this argument's point. Please reread it.
#+end_quote

Not gonna do your work for you.

#+begin_quote
  and don't recall the story itself that well for the other half.

lol
