Well, sort of. You need something that's new on /some/ level to make 'solving the plot' still interesting, what Sanderson does is throw around enough rules and hints and clues earlier, then throws them together into a new form at the end in a way that's kind of like a mystery novel. This happens in Way of Kings, in Elantris, in Mistborn at least a couple of times, etc.
