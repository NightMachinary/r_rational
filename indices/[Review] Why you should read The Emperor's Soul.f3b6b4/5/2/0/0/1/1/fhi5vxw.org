  We must have read different books here.
#+end_quote

Yes, but luckily we can look at the books again to demonstrate which of us recalls the real ones ;)

#+begin_quote
  The only person who's powers aren't fairly explicitly defined on arrival are Kaladin's at the end of book 1 - and they're foreshadowed heavily both by his own story and the presence of someone who specifically outlines how they work in the prologue.
#+end_quote

...you cited the only example of powers that ARE clearly defined, for the reason you listed, and ignored all the other ones that are not? I don't understand where you think that, for example, Dalinar's powers that allowed him to summon stormlight in the final battle of book 3 were anywhere predicted. Can you please point to where this was foreshadowed or explained at all?

#+begin_quote
  And you can't come up with a reason that someone wouldn't throw away their weapon before training on how to do so with effect? More to the point, it is explicitly called out as something very difficult to accomplish at all (let alone use in combat) by the person he saved.
#+end_quote

You misread me, and the book, again. *Please read more carefully*: he DID manage to do this during training in book 1. How long has it been since you read the books?

#+begin_quote
  I think you're being obtuse here. If you don't see a difference between me reading from a script to see if I get powers and actually internalizing concepts, then I don't think you're speaking in good faith.
#+end_quote

Let's not throw around words like "obtuse" when you can't even get my criticisms right, or the events of the books, alright?

#+begin_quote
  Shallan sees Cryptics, not Jasnah. And I absolutely remember it, because it was one of the clues for the aforementioned "perceptive readers." Let's stop speaking in generalities. In the middle of a speech about how he sees assassins everywhere, he says: I see their faces in mirrors. Symbols, twisted, inhuman.
#+end_quote

Sorry, pause real quick: you know you just contradicted yourself, right? I mistook which of Shallan or Jasnah has the ones called Cryptics, but you just said he never talked about "talking to them," which I never said he did, and implied that he ONLY talked about "people" following him. So you were wrong, as you're admitting now, and he did NOT just talk about people following him.

#+begin_quote
  He says this to a room full of people who do not know anything about spren (except Kaladin, who only knows the one honorspren - which is completely irrelevant), and who all know that he is a paranoid little shitbag. It would be insane for anyone to call him out on it.
#+end_quote

It would be insane for anyone to call him on it THEN. Not LATER when they all know what spren are, 2 of them know what cryptics look like, and all of them have talked about these things together, as a group. You are not reading my criticisms carefully.

#+begin_quote
  Not gonna do your work for you.
#+end_quote

You're literally attacking a criticism that doesn't show up in my post. I don't know what else to tell you other than to read what I actually said: I can't defend a point I didn't make.
