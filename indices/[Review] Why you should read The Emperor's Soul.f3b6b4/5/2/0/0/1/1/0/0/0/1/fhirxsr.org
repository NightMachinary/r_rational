Magic can certainly occur before it's explained, as you say this happens all the time. The argument here is that plot conflicts should never (in rational fiction) be solved by unexplained and unpredictable magic.

This is in fact Sanderson's First Law of Magic:

  An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.

Which makes it all the worse that he breaks it in practically every book.

The equivalent in, say, HPMOR, would be if Harry first uses his Patronus 2.0 in Azkaban, when his life is suddenly in danger and it's the only thing that can save him.

Where HPMOR would have failed at this is if he used the knowledge that lets him cast Patronus 2.0 to be able to get the Dementors to stop. Instead this fails, and he just resorts to threatening them to drive them away.
