That's good advice. My frustration here is that it means I have to do twice the work for him, and people should be able to recognize that if they read the argument itself. My first mistake in part was not just posting my thing myself instead of linking to it, but you're right that the best path would be to specify each point line by line that he misrepresents. I just find that tedious, and I hoped I would not have to do something like that in this sub of all places.
