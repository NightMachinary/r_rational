Let me repeat that I especially recommend this book to those who dislike Brandon's works. I was on the verge of dropping him as a whole when I first stumbled upon tES, and to date I think it's his best work yet, lacking Sanderson's usual writing flaws.

Give it a try! You'll be pleasantly surprised, I think :)
