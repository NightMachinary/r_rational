  Rothfuss, Martin, and Butcher are all much better authors imo.

I enjoyed KKC and Dresden, but they have their own sets of problems. KKC has the problem of not fucking going anywhere, for example. Two books into a trilogy and hardly anything has happened with the main plot. Yes, the prose reads quite nicely and the magic seems interesting, but where is this train going?
