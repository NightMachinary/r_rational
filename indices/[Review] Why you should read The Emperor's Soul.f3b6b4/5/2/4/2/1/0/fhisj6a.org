Certainly, but their problems are lesser ones than Sanderson's, in my view. I like long and meandering stories as long as character development is occurring, and in KKC that's satisfied, for me. The idea that the "main plot" isn't being advanced feels more like a matter of expectation.

For example, I don't expect the story to be wrapped up by the end of the third book of KKC, and I don't know what would make this seem the case when the story starts with the world clearly in dire straits. I think the first 3 books of the trilogy are just going to end with why Kvothe is at the inn: it's his origin story, basically, and the whole thing with the Chandrian is clearly still ongoing and will have to be dealt with afterward.
