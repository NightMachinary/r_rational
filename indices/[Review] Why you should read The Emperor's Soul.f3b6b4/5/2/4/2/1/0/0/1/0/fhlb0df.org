Dresden Files does have a clear plan for the end to the series; however, Butcher has the same problem as GRRM where he doesn't know how to get there from here.

Specifically, after 20 books of the episodic Dresden Files, his plan - formulated ca. book 5, IIRC - has been an apocalyptic trilogy where all the big threats start arriving. Skin Game was the first novel which started seriously prepping for the endgame, and it turns out Butcher could only churn out a book a year like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxi-90UMu0M][Sanderbot 0-7]] while he /didn't/ have to make them prep for the endgame. I forget if he has a name for the trilogy, but the books have names already: /Stars and Stones/, /Hell's Bells/, and /Empty Night/.
