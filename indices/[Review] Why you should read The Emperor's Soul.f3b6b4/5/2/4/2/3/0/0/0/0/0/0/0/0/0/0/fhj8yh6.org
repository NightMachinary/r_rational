You certainly sound like one - or one of the target group of sexually repressed group Sanderson hails from.

I would say 'Self Control' would apply if there was any justification for why him having sex would be bad - but I don't see them, neither is it brought up in sex. When a character refuses to engage in normal and well. .. expected behaviour, seeing as he is a young man who is clearly attractive and attracted to girls....

But would make perfectly sense for a member of the author's religion I will call bullshit. To think otherwise seems rather idiotic.
