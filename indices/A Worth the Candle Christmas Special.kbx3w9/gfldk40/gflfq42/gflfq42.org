[[https://youtu.be/V7nSKqfBk6k][Carol of the Bells]] is the only Christmas song I actually enjoy. Mostly because it just sounds cool, in a creepy-dramatic way, but also because the juxtaposition with the cheerful lyrics makes Christmas sound like an unstoppable force that will change everything and everyone whether they want it or not.

Which, you know. Accurate.
