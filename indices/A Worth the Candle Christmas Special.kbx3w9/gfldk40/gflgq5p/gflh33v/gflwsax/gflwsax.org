Delightful chapter! Thank you!

  “Juniper,” said Amaryllis, looking at my gifts. “Was that the best you could do with wrapping?”

  “You have your own idea of Christmas, and I have mine,” I said. “It's tradition to use too many pieces of tape, have to slap on scrap pieces when you miscalculate how big the boxes are. Or you just put everything in the nicest bags you can find.”

Since this is [[/r/rational]], I would like [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1140][to note]] that "when recipients open a gift from a friend, they like it less when the giver has wrapped it neatly as opposed to sloppily... [because] recipients set higher (lower) expectations for neatly (sloppily)‐wrapped gifts, making it harder (easier) for the gifts to meet these expectations, resulting in contrast effects that lead to less (more) positive attitudes toward the gifts once unwrapped."

Since first hearing about this effect many years ago, I've rest assured that my sloppy wrapping technique may persist in the ultimate service of friends' joy :D

edit: also, if entad shops exist in the main timeline, why haven't Juniper and co. cleared them out yet? Trivial-sounding effects might be able to interact in strange and powerful ways.
