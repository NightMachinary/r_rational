Is the entad shop owner Forty-Two the changeling, Uther's Knight? Because he reacts strangely to Raven being mentioned and apparently looks younger than his age. It seems like a long shot and if the entad works exactly as described his lifeline would be lengthy, but it's also an interesting number to choose.
