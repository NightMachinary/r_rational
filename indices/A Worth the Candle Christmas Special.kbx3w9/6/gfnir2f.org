As fun as this story was... I want to analyze it for hints...

- They still got the backpack, I bet the DM had that planned out as fun item, so he ended up with it.

- Locus but no Solace... this would tie into the idea that Solace is holding the Locus back? Or maybe Solace died and Juniper was further skiing with Locus loyalty and managed to leverage that somehow?

- Fenn is still flirty with Joon but he never made a move and they don't seem to be together... maybe the Unicorn blood is the key factor that moved things along.

- Has Juniper not learned Groglir yet on this timeline? No translation of the terms and Grak doesn't switch languages to explain easier so I don't think he has learned it. Also, he originally learned it after Fenn died.

- His blade bound skill is good enough to cut a Christmas tree down. Is his build substantially different? No wait in respec he has level 21 and thus the basic blade bound bonuses... and Nascent blade bound was at level 10 anyway.

- They didn't watch any Christmas movies or listen to Christmas music, +so it seems without the time chamber Amaryllis hasn't been able to tech up as much (but she got some down with her power converter).+ no wait it mentioned at the beginning she had been watching Christmas movies. So Amaryllis managed to work in some teching up time one way or another. I guess Juniper doesn't associate strong feelings/traditions with Christmas movies (with my family we have a few cult classics we always watch every Christmas and a few more we often rewatch, so I subconsciously assumed Juniper would have at least one Christmas movie he wanted to watch).

- It seems without the time chamber Fenn and the others haven't read up on Earth Culture as much? Amaryllis has because of course.

- Entad shop is cool. Interesting to see something like that.

- Valencia still likes Harry Potter!

- interesting that Juniper could anticipate that cutting down the tree might bother the Locus and he could read its facial expression. Maybe a better relationship with the Locus which ties into the conditions that allowed the Locus to escape its limits?
