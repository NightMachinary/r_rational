Other than the obvious divergences back in Uther's time it feels like Juniper maybe never went for soul magic and so didn't get into a spiraling pissing match with the DM of trying to break the world. He's actually trying to become a god through straight levels. Maybe it's just a non-postmodernist version of Aerb. Either way, I'd definitely read this version of Worth the Candle too.
