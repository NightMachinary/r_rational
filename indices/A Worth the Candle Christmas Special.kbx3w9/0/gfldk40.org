I gotta say, I am thoroughly intrigued by this (seemingly) lighter and fluffier alternate timeline, even if I know it probably won't ever be explored further or elaborated on ever again. The little hints of things that somehow went differently (the lack of Bethel and Solace, for example) and offhand references to events that didn't happen in canon (like the "monster of the obsidian plains") definitely spark my imagination.

Also, I can absolutely relate to June's desire for a War on Christmas and I'm glad to see I'm not alone in those feelings.
