Neat! Thanks!

So as usual for a psychology paper, the test subjects are a bunch of university students, and if you have reason to think they're not representative then that might be a problem. On the other hand, the effect sizes are pretty convincingly large.

I'm a little confused by their study 3. This shows that neat wrapping is preferable for gifts from acquaintances, and sloppy wrapping is preferable from friends. However study 1 involves giving gifts to test participants, and found that they liked the gifts better if they had sloppy wrapping. Do the test-givers count as friends?
