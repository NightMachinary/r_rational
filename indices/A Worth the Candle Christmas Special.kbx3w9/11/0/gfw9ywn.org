As I conceived it, the Marvelous Moving Mansion has a really inconvenient method of moving around, which is that you turn a bunch of dials and it will find you the spot that most closely matches those parameters, which has all sorts of implications and problems with it.

High wilderness, high urbanization can mean a few different things, depending on how you quantify those, but a few general thoughts:

- If 'urbanization' means lots of people, you could have a more 'wild' city that's grown up without a lot of central planning, infrastructure, etc., something like Kowloon Walled City. Here, this would be interpreted as 'urban wilds'.
- If 'urbanization' means lots of infrastructure and build up, and wilderness means a dominance of wild systems, then you could end up in a city that's undergoing some kind of collapse or turmoil, like a civil war, disaster, or something of that nature.
- Most conventionally, you would have the stereotypical fantasy cities that are completely in harmony with nature, either built in and among the trees, or otherwise with wilderness being a defined part of the city, integrated rather than cleared away.
