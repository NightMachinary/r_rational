I found the seduction scene completely ridiculous and it took me right out of the story and into questioning the author. Maybe this approach would work on a woman who was looking for sex already, but the idea that an incredibly powerful woman with an agenda just melts and throws herself at any male with power is just silly.

The idea that someone could predict that putting on a show of their power would seduce a God who could read their thoughts and then have it come true makes the whole thing feel contrived and unbelievable.
