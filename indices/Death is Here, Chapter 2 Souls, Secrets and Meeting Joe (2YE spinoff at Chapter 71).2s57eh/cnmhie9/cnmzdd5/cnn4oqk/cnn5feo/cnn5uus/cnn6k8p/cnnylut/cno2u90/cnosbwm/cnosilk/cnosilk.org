So it certainly is impossible to keep anything from her, based on what's here. If she's looking. What I'm trying to ascertain is that, if I, a common peasant in some backwoods corner of the world, started plotting against her, that knowledge wouldn't just pop up into her mind. Now, maybe if I associated with someone she was aware of, say a worshipper, or an enemy, maybe she could daisy chain her way to me. But she isn't passively aware of each individual piece of knowledge's contents. So I could do that and easily escape her notice, although I would assumedly get caught 20 weeks before I made a significant move, based on the way her power works.
