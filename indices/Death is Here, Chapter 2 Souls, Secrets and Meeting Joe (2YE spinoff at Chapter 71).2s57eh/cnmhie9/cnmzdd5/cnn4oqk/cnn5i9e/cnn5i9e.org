It's Portfolio Sense. Her mind is literally structured to take that into account, in the same way that Death can register the ending of hundreds of thousands of lives a second, yet still pick out any one of them and specify.

Also, it may not function on all thoughts, simply ones with meaning. I can think up a line of gobbledegook that has no semantic meaning, and with no stored information, I doubt it could be considered a 'secret' or 'knowledge'. Nor likely would a repeated thought trigger the sense twice.

Most general thoughts of most people likely wouldn't cross the threshold of 'knowledge' or 'secrets' I suspect.
