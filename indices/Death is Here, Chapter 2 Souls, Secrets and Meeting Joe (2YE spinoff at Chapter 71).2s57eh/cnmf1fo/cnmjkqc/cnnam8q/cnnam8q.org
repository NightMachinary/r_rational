  Well, she was pretty much built out of the personalities of everyone who took part in the ritual, so it's not too crazy to think she'd have a reasonably near-human psychology.

Good point. Although the *vast* majority of her personality is derived from Loki, who was never mortal. The number of secrets he donated outmasses all others by multiple orders of magnitude.

Of course, all gods are built from the stories told by mortals, so it's reasonable to think that they all have at least certain touchstones to human psychology. I'm not sure that "women dig powerful guys" is one of those touchstones, though.
