You are correct that she is constantly notified whenever a new secret or piece of knowledge comes into existence. She can, however, handle it. By definition a god is a sapient embodiment/representation of a particular aspect of reality. They have the storage and processing power to handle their aspect.

Personally, I don't worry about it too much. Whenever I'm writing her I just assume that she knows essentially everything, since she can get the answer in realtime if she wants it. The point, though, is that she doesn't know your thoughts automatically; she has the option to not know what you're thinking.
