here's my main motivation for asking: If she's anonymously notified every time a new secret/piece of knowledge comes into play, but NOT notified of what it is, this means that the world is, essentially, a field of constantly filled noise for her. Every second, she's being informed of every blade of grass' movement, every squirrel's cough, every new idea in a person's head. This means that her passive awareness is constantly being "pinged" for lack of a better term, making the world white noise to her. This is, of course, assuming each ping is equal in importance and scale, prior to her investigating them. If these pings were to scale by, say, how much they affected other life forms (a blade of grass waving pings like a cricket whisper, Jake's orbital assault pinged like a fog horn), then she could sort of keep track.

Basically, what I'm trying to clarify, is that when Herr√∫n is in a place where knowledge is being constantly spawned (anywhere in nature, basically) she's getting a constant stream of pings that knowledge is spawning. Meaning she can never, really, be passively alerted to things, since things are happening all the time. Unless, as I said, the pings scale.
