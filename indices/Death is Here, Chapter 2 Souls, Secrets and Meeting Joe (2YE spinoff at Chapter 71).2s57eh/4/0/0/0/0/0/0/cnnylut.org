I'm not saying she can't perceive each part. But based on what eaglejarl said, she has to CHOOSE to look into it. So while I'm sure she CAN choose to look into each single, perceivable ping of knowledge she receives, I'm sure she doesn't, as most of it is trivial. So, unless she can /passively/* discern the scale of importance of these pings, it's still all just white noise, unless she does choose to perceive each single ping of knowledge. At least as far as I understand her nature to function.
