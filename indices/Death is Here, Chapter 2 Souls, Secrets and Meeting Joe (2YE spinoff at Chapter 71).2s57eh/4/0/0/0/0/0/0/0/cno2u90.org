Remote Sensing. a Greater Deity can perceive fully at least 20 different locations at once, in a radius each of !DivineRank Miles with perfect clarity.

So Greater Dieties of Rank 20 for example can necessarily perceive at the very least 20 spheres with a radius of 20 miles each (33510 cubic miles x 20 = 670,200 mi^{3)} with perfect sensory clarity simultaneously.
