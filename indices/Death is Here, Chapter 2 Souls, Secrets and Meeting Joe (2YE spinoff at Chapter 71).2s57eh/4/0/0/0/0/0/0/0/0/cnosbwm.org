I'm not saying she can't multitask and think of many things at one time. Basically, what I AM assuming is that she chooses to NOT look at each individual piece of knowledge that spawns. While she, in theory, CAN do this, I don't think she has the processing power to stay sane and relatable to humans while doing it. Even accounting for her divine heritage, you're asking her to simultaneously process trillions of bits of new information per SECOND. EJ stated that

So, again, I say that, unless Herrun chooses to sit there and parse each individual ping of knowledge, the world appears to her as mostly white noise. I assume she'd want to actively parse each ping associated with her godly relatives, and maybe a few key areas of the world, but beyond that, I can't imagine she would bother to do it. Even gods have limits.
