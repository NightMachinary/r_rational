So does this mean that Herr√∫n is notified whenever new knowledge occurs? So every thought someone has, Herrun is informed? Even if she doesn't necessarily KNOW the knowledge, she is aware of its existence being spawned? I ask because, if that IS the case, then that must mean there's too much noise for her to really discern anything, since new knowledge is being conceived all the time among sentient creatures. Is that a correct interpretation?
