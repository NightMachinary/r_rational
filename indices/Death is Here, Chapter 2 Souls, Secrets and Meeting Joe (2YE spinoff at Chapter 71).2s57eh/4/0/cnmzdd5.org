[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm][Going by RAW]], it's easy to keep your thoughts from Herrún unless she really wants to know them. Here's the skinny:

#+begin_quote
  Portfolio Sense

  Greater deities [which Herrún is] automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios, regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every divine rank they have. *When a deity senses an event, it merely knows that the event is occurring and where it is.* The deity receives no sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices an event, it can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.
#+end_quote

[emphasis added]

So, Herrún always knows that you have secrets and/or knowledge; if she wants to, she can look and see what they are. That's an active thing though -- the secrets don't just spontaneously appear in her brain at all times. Specifically, she's not omniscient.

A more powerful (i.e. higher ranked) god could theoretically use the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm][Block Sensing]] power to stop Herrún from learning his/her secrets, but in practice that wouldn't work. Herrún can look up to 20 weeks into the past to see the secrets, so they'd need to be using their Block Sensing power constantly for 20 weeks in order to keep something from her.

EDIT: Also, in general, divine ranks only go up to 20 and Herrún is rank 20, so there are no gods that are strictly higher ranked than her.

(Technically there are the Overgods, who are all rank 21+. In RAW they don't interact with the mortal world at all, although nothing is said about their interactions with the divine world. In 2YE they basically don't interact with gods either, except to very occasionally step on one for doing something they don't like, and the gods have all pretty much learned to not do that.)
