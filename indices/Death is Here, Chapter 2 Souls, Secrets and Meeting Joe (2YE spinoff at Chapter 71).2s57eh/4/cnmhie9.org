Alright time to brainstorm how to keep secrets from the god of secrets, though it really depends on how the Great DM in the Sky decides to define secret.

My idea is to shatter all your thoughts into N tiny pieces and drop them into the minds of random people/your worshipers. Then they're technically public just really hard to put together.
