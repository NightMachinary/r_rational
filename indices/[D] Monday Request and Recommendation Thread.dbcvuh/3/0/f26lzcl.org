Are there any other isekai or medieval fantasy stories with that kind of premise? I'm reading RTW and watching the Dr.Stone anime, but I'm not sure how or where to look for more stuff like this. Dungeon fics scratch a similar itch, but most of them are about upgrading the dungeon itself and not getting an entire nation/civilization up to speed with modern times.
