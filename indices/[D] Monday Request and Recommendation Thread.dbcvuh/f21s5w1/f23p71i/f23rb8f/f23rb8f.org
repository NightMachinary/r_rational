She's a sidekick, so far. But she takes a smaller role in the plot after the early chapters. I figured a lot of her completeness can be attributed to Veda being a complete blueprint from the Gundam universe, and the general tendency of tinker creations to work with minimal resources. I can't say she'll be unimportant forever, but she doesn't trivialize every encounter or something like that.

EDIT: Also, Worm isn't that realistic about AI in the first place, so it's not necessarily out of line for the setting.
