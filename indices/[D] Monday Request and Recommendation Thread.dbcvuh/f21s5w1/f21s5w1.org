It's been a while, because I kept trying to make a big monday post. This might end up that way, but I figured it's more important to give out recommendations than it is to give out a lot of them. Standard disclaimer: none of these are necessarily rational, but most of them are intelligent or otherwise suited to this community.

*WORM:*

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/daystar-worm-exalted-crossover-au.773104/][/Daystar/]] is a Worm/Exalted crossover. Just saying that is a blast from the past, but it's a relatively recent story. It starts pretty interesting, but I feel like the last arc has lost a lot of momentum. I'm still not sure where it's trying to go. It also has a budding Taylor/Sophia relationship, and that ship can burn in hell where it belongs. Nevertheless, it's got okay grammar, and it's over the 30k word hump, so it beats like 75% of /Worm/ fanfiction. What I like more is...

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pyrrhic-victory-rwby-worm.775690/][/Pyrrhic Victory/]], a RWBY crossover where Pyrrha Nikos is inserted into the body of Emma Barnes after Pyrrha dies in season 3, a year or so before /Worm/ canon. This story really delivers on the feeling of impostor syndrome that such a situation would create, but it's still not out of its second arc. Still, at 49k words, I feel like it has a little while to go before it dies. I'm really loving its direction.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au.680881/][/Trailblazer/]] is a great Gundam alt-power/fusion. I feel like I read it and dropped it before, but I must be imagining things, because when I went through it recently it felt like one of the best /Worm/ stories I've ever read. It really nails the dissonance between Taylor's perspective and how the rest of the world views her - her costume has a /dramatic cape/, but she has no idea that she comes across as authoritative and put-together. It's nearly at 350k words and updates regularly. If I had a complaint, it's that the AU elements from Gundam could have been introduced more smoothly.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/][/Tank/]] (complete) is a piece of /Worm/ crack fiction where Taylor has the power to turn into an endless army of Soviet tanks. Roon is probably the only person in the fandom that could have written it, because the story parodies two things simultaneously, in brutally hilarious fashion. The first is the explicit parody of USSR-brand communism. The second is the meta-commentary about stories which try to portray /Worm/'s neo-nazi faction as sympathetic - she's trying to tell the brain-dead idiots on Spacebattles that those stories are exactly as absurd as Tankie!Taylor is. It's amazing and I love it.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mauling-snarks-worm.41471/][/Mauling Snarks/]] is actual trash. I've read one hundred and fifty chapters of it, mostly because I ran out of actually good Worm fanfiction, and I can say without a doubt that it's the blandest wormfic I've ever read. Everyone has the same voice, there is no villain beyond redemption, and /nothing ever happens/. Even when you think it's going to dip into fanon and offend you, the consequences are so minimal it's hard to muster the energy. /Why/ have I read 150 chapters then? Because there are elements of it that are fascinating. There's this dissonance between how the author has written/views the main character and how the character actually looks when you zoom out on their behavior. After reading most of the story, I can really buy that this character is Jack Slash's niece: the weird emotionless tone of the narrative fits with a sociopath who only gets entertainment from fucking with people, and Taylor's bizarre willingness to cross boundaries as if they never even existed fits how I would imagine a Slaughterhouse 9 member. I don't recommend you read this story, but if you feel like those things above would give you enough value, it will do in a pinch. Updates regularly, and has a huge backlog of chapters.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/still-defiant-worm-defiant-peggy-sue.789799/][/Still Defiant/]] is a brand new story, at three chapters long. Normally I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend something that early, but this story has the distinction of making the most succinct and accurate assessment of a peggy-sue scenario I've ever seen. This story is the closest to classically rational on this whole list. Quote:

  There's a remote possibility that this is a simulation of some sort, but that sort of worry is something completely unaddressable. I'll act as if this is real, and if it isn't then I'll either never learn otherwise, or discover the truth and adjust accordingly.

  In much the same way, my memories of â€˜the future' could merely have been a sort of one-time precognitive vision. But, I'll never be able to know the difference. Better to take them at face value - doubting myself in such a way could only be a hindrance.

*NARUTO:*

- About once every two months, I return to Naruto fanfiction to scope out what people in the fandom seem to think is the best of the best. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize][/Sanitize/]] is one of the stories that justifies coming back. I found it in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/bn5cec/the_gold_standard_of_naruto_fanfiction_20page/][Gold Standard Recommendation List]] - I can vouch for about half of the stories in there. This one is among the better ones. SI with a basic recollection of modern medical technology gets inserted into the Warring Clans era and runs her own clinic, quickly turning it into neutral territory. I really love how down-to-earth this story is, compared to the frenetic action of ninja. Slow updates.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12566900/chapters/28622888][/Retrograde Motion/]] is a Sakura peggy-sue story, also from the Gold Standard list. If I'm being honest it's kind of trash, but it isn't terribly written, and when you acknowledge all of the AU elements for what they are it can be entertaining. A good time-waster, and a novel experience if you haven't read Naruto fanfiction in a while. Sloooow updates.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17401478/chapters/40958717][/What You Knead/]] was published early this January, so I'm a little late to the party. As a short story, it's pretty easy to miss, but even at its current length it more than meets my minimum standards for a good fic. Kakashi decides to become a baker as a hobby, and it helps him work through a lot of his trauma better than his usual coping mechanisms. It's actually remarkably similar to /Loaf/ from the /Worm/ fandom - another recommendation for that, if you haven't read it. Definitely a feel-good story. In progress/On hiatus, but it's slice of life, so it could sit as it is forever and still be worth reading.

*MISC:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10572048/1/Walk-Two-Lifetimes][/Walk Two Lifetimes/]] is a Bleach SI fic, set from the perspective of someone with "vague knowledge of two arcs of Bleach" who is reincarnated into Hisana Kuchiki. I put "vague knowledge" in airquotes because the author /really/ overestimated what knowledge that would be. Nevertheless, it's emotionally compelling in a way only the best SI stories could be. It ends on a cliffhanger, and it's not due for another update for six or so months, but if you're okay with a little bit of sadness it's a must-read.

- [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/theatrum-alchemicum-technical-waifu-simulator-tournament.8063/][/Theatrum Alchemicum/]] is a NSFW quest on Questionable Questing that misled me into thinking it was actually NSFW. There's a lot of risque fanservice moments, but currently no actual sex scenes as of when I caught up. Instead, there is a lot of interesting worldbuilding going into creating the context for the "waifu tournament" that the main character takes part in. I'm really happy with how this quest is going, and how the quest-maker is rewarding the players for making risky plays instead of punishing them. Like a Royal Road story, only competent. Updates frequently.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/united-we-stand-halo-mass-effect-crossover.736864/][/United We Stand/]] is your typical Mass Effect crossover where humanity is swapped out with the the UNSC and UEG from Halo. It, in true Spacebattles fashion, spends way to long on individual battles and goes into way to much detail about the military capabilities of all of the participants. But where it stops being typical is in how it treats each of the different parties. Instead of reading like an [[/r/HFY]] manifesto, /United We Stand/ allows the Citadel Council the be both realistic and altruistic in how it acts: not as an adversary, but as an ally against a much greater threat. And even the Covenant are given their fair shake - for a genocidal alien race, anyway. They may not be sympathetic, but you /can/ understand how and why they operate, even if the reason is fucking stupid. This novelty alone is a good enough reason to push through all of the battles, for me. I can't wait for the next updates. Recently revived, but has been written entirely within the span of this year.

As always, don't count on these being great to read for you. But they all get my seal of approval for being tolerable enough to catch up on. I'm up-to-date on the latest chapter for most of these, and the ones I'm not up-to-date on I'm waiting to binge through. I can guarantee that the grammar in each is well above par for fanfiction, and I can also guarantee that none of them have done things that would have made me drop them.
