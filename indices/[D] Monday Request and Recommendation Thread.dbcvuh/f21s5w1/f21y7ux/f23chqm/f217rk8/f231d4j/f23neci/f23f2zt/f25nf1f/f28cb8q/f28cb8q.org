Vigilantes jumped the shark for me when It turned out the protagonist had actually been suppressing the true nature of his power due to childhood trauma and his quirk is actually on the level of a pro hero's in terms of power and versitality Given that we had the EXACT SAME narrative bullshit in the main series, anyone hoping that vigilantes moves away from it would be a bit disappointed.
