As I don't really want to get into a discussion about prophecy and determinism right now, I'm just going to say that even if it could be rendered not-creepy in a Watsonian sense, it remains kind of creepy in a Doylist sense. That is, the fact that Pullman made a romantic liaison between thirteen-year-olds necessary to save the world (regardless of how far that off-screen intimacy progressed) is what is creeping me out, even if it could be explained in a way that made it completely not-creepy in-universe.
