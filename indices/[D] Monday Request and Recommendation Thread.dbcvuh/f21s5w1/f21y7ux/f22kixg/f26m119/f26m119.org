Seconding /Nine Princes/ (Corwyn cycle only).

It has some of the best character development in fantasy I've read. The titular nine princes do a lot of growing up over the course of the series, despite their ages. All the clever power plays that are the heart of the early books seem incredibly immature in retrospect.

It also has the best take on ye olde amnesia plot I've seen anywhere. Too often, a shallow blank-slate protagonist slowly discovers a past self that's essentially a complete stranger. But here the protagonist clearly /is/ their past self, a complete character with all the depth of personality and experience - only missing the memories. That makes the mystery so much more tantalising.
