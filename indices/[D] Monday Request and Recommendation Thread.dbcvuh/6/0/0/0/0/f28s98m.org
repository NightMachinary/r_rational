To each their own. People discovering "new dimensions" to their quirk or "unlocking" new abilities for it reeks of the deus ex machina shounen BS that i thought BnHA was trying to avoid. It's worth noting that in the main series, that whole bit about being able to do so only really started being a thing after the protagonist got their own deus ex machina upgrade. The only one I really liked was Twice's, because his was rooted in actual deep psychological trauma that was clear from his character introduction, not "oh yeah i spanked u as a child until u stopped floating around, guess u forgot lol"
