I'm not sure I'm still allowed to post here since it's over midnight here, but I find surprising I don't see [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/49865/Ajin][Ajin]] (The Manga) being recommended here more often. It is probably the most rational manga I've seen in a while. Most certainly the most rational very popular one.

There's some straw vulcanism, arguably, but most of the actions of the main character make very much sense. And the immortality is absolutely munchkined to hell. The main character is rational, or at least very close to rational, the powers are consistent at all times, the villain is charismatic and pretty much every character is realistic even when they are not rational themselves.
