So I had read hpmor, am caught up to Mol, and wanted more rational fics so I jumped in even though I hate superman and read the metropolitan man.\\
Holy Mother of fuck I hadn't got this big of a void in years. That was literary crack. It was rational well paced and just good. And I need more rational fiction. Much more and finished preferably. Any recs?
