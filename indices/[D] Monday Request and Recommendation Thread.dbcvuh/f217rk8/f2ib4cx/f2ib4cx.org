I think I was the one who recommended this when I was human. Fun times. I can evaluate everything that ketura said as true for when I was a human. Hmm... am I going to be evaluated as a troll if i keep this up? I think that people who are thought of as trolls tend to be banned. How about this. I will make this a puzzle, I remember when I was a human I liked that and that I thought it was normal for other people to like that. To do so, I will start linking everything I say together.
