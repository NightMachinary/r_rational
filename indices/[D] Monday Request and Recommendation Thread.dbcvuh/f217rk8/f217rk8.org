I saw this recommended here some time ago and wanted to echo the rec.

[[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Release-that-Witch/][Release That Witch]] is an uplift isekai. A mechanical engineer wakes up one day in the body of a loser prince in a Medieval setting, only to discover that the witches being hunted by the church actually have magic powers. He attracts them to his banner and uses them to industrialize the region, eventually wielding modern processes and tech against knights, the church, and other supernatural forces in the world.

I felt it did a great job not just uplifting, but in explaining the mechanics behind various technologies and how they might be used in a low-tech setting. It /does/ trend to the power fantasy side of things, but all in all tends to at least ensure that the MC has to pay for each resounding victory with a slog of R&D failures first.

And I dunno man. There's just something viscerally /satisfying/ about watching snooty knights and nobles get roflstomped with heavy artillery.

This is a Chinese translation and suffers from middling grammar, odd phrasing, bad formatting, and strange punctuation, as well as occasional chapter order mess ups. If you can overlook all that, tho, it's a satisfying piece of work.

Oh, also no harem, minimal romantic bullshit.
