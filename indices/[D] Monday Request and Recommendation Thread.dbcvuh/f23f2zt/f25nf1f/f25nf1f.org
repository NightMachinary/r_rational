Loosely speaking, the [[https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/my-hero-academia-vigilantes][vigilantes spinoff]] is more rational than the base series. Its power level is lower than the regular version, and concurrently it's somewhat more "thinky", with the important battles (and even some of the less important, played-for-laughs ones) have a greater focus on well considered use of more limited powers. Lest I give you the wrong idea, it's not munchkiny, though.
