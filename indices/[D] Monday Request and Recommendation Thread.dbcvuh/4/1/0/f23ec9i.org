I've seen some. The first season is pretty faithful to the source material except for the end. The second season deviates and goes in a completely different direction. It's not bad, but I believe the manga is a bit more in line with a rational story than the anime. Plus, it's still ongoing, though it seems to be getting to its end soonish.
