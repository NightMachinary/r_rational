I've finished Luminosity now and Radiance, the sequel. Someone warned me the sequel was terrible and was a marked drop in quality but I honestly noticed no difference - Radiance has a new viewpoint character who I didn't like as much but I still liked fine, and the plot was a lot more complicated (I lost track of a few characters and was scrunching my face up going "who is Jane, again?"), but it was still an incredible story. I'm working my way through the short story collections now.

If anyone was scared off by the thought of (mild spoiler about the nature of the endings (e.g. happy vs sad, satisfying vs unsatisfying)) Luminosity having a sad ending and Radiance being no good , rest assured that Radiance reads great and has a satisfying ending, and even has a collection of assorted shorts/flashes that do prologue and epilogue stuff in very cool ways

Whole-hearted recommendation, though I was hoping more romance from a Twilight fan-fic. The series didn't really deal with romance in what I'd consider a rational way: the romance was a lot of the time supernaturally "forced", so relationship issues didn't feature into the story. That said, it was good to see a rational work that didn't completely ignore romance. But my quest continues.
