The topic today is retro fantasy.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92121.Nine_Princes_in_Amber][Nine Princes in Amber]] by Roger Zelazny. Zelazny was known more for sci-fi than fantasy, but this fantasy series moves quickly and paints in broad strokes. The premise would be a bit of a spoiler for the first book, but its ontological implications might be of interest to those on the sub.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/152328.One_for_the_Morning_Glory][One for the Morning Glory]] by John Barnes. Could be considered a predecessor to Practical Guide in that it's about characters aware they're taking part in stories. Has some amazing lines. You should take this book very seriously and not at all seriously, just as it takes itself. The opening execution sequence alone is worth the price of admission.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18116.His_Dark_Materials][His Dark Materials]] by Philip Pullman. /What if souls were empirically real?/ This question has a huge number of epistemic, ontological, theological, ethical, and practical concerns, and Pullman pokes into an impressive number of them.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642.A_Wizard_of_Earthsea][A Wizard of Earthsea]] by Ursula K. Le Guin. This book is incredibly spare in conception and prose. Rewarding reading.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104089.Tigana][Tigana]] by Guy Gavriel Kay. What if the name of a land were stolen from its people? Kay is one of the better writers in fantasy, and this is one of his better books.
