Nine Princes in Amber &al: a lot of fun. First five books are better than the second five. Don't read if you care about minor continuity errors. Stay away from the Betancourt prequels.

His Dark Materials: Excellent first two books. Third book... has problems. The downer part of the ending is contrived (though I'll forgive that if the sequel trilogy it sets up is any good); the victory over the (arguable) primary antagonist is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, and, well, there's some implied creepy stuff going on given the ages of the protagonists.

A Wizard of Earthsea: I really need to re-read this. If you liked the bits of HPMOR about seals that shouldn't be opened, there's a lot of people opening those seals and having to deal with them.

Tigana: All I can say about this book is that, after reading his debut trilogy, I was emphatic about not reading any other GGK novels. I was assigned this book as part of a college course, and it completely reversed my opinion of the author (though not of /The Fionavar Tapestry/), and I went on to read most of what he's written since then. It's /that/ good.

I haven't read One for the Morning Glory.
