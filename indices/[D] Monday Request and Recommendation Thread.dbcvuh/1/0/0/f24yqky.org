  well, there's some implied creepy stuff going on given the ages of the protagonists.

I mean, that stuff is creepy if it involves adults and teens. Given the ages of /both/ the protagonists... they're a bit on the young side, but I'd say it happens. I wouldn't call it creepy, it's not like there's anything voyeuristic about it, nothing is stated outright either, it's just vaguely suggested.
