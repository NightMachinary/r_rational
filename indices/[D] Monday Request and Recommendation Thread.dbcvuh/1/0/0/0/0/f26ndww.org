Fair, but from a materialist deterministic viewpoint, free will simply doesn't exist and pretty much everything is preordained from the start anyway. What you're pointing out is the fundamental problem of free will - an issue that exists within all narratives that include prophecies and future-past feedback loops. If such things really were possible, well, we'd have to deal with a lot of situations in which we both would have the impression of having made a free choice yet the outcome was effectively determined from the start. Or from a different point of view - is it any more moral, or any less existentially terrifying, that Harry Potter might have been forced to kill Voldemort by prophecy, than Lyra and Will just making love, without being prompted or pushed, simply following what at the time was a genuine impulse they felt, even though it was also prophesied to happen?.
