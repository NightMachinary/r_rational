Not exactly "rational", but what is the book that has the most realistic portrayal of the effects magic (or some other weird thing) would have on society? Bonus points if the author actually has a background in economy/sociology. Extra bonus points if it either modern times (harder to explain technology), or at least tries to explain why society hasn't evolved technologically for thousands of years.
