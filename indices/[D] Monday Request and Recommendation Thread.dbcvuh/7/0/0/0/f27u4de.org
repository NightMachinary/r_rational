The only other story that comes to mind at the moment is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles][Metaworld Chronicles]].

#+begin_quote
  Gwen Song awoke in a new world where all that she was familiar with had disappeared and she must begin from zero. A 21st-century tale of an Earth ruled instead by magic, where humanity lives in enclaves shielded from magical beasts and otherworldly beings. Follow Gwen as she struggles to once again rebuild her life in the new world, a tale of companionship, adventure, and Spellcraft! Grow with Gwen as she grows from high school to university, and finally onto the real world, discovering the secrets of a real-life world made unreal by magic and Mages.

  Inspired by the spell system of classic Dungeon and Dragons, but set in the Modern World.

It does deal with economy ad society (in her previous life the MC was an economist/business owner), but it's not exactly "deep." Plus the way the author writes is a bit odd, slightly jarring but not terrible.

It also deals with politics (to an extent), a society that had to build up a country around mages (the "Tower system") and the MC travels to different countries with their own distinct culture, government, mythology, etc.
