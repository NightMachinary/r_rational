The worldbuilding is my favourite part. Seeing how the Chinese communist government shoot themselves in the foot because they refuse to use faith-based magic when fighting the undead, or how the Incas survived by creating a state religion that essentially creates a mini-god and everything else is a breath of fresh air compared to another generic medieval European society.
