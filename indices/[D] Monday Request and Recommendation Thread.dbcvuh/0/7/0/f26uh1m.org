The Gold Standard of Worm fanfiction looks something like this.

Longfics:

- /A Cloudy Path/ probably gets the Original Flavor award for being pretty similar up until maybe the last five arcs.
- /Split/ is devastating and wonderfully written. Best version of a Trump power.
- /Mixed Feelings/ is cute but has a lot of padding.
- /Trailblazer/ really captures the good parts of mech anime and everything else doesn't suck.
- /A Subtle Knife/ is the best crossover set in a different universe.
- /El-Ahrairah/ gets the specifics of Worm's shardlore wrong, but it does the best I've seen in any fanfiction.

Smaller fics:

- /Deputy/ is the best unpowered Taylor, but it would be beaten by /Denial/ if that hadn't died.
- /Camera Shy/ is the best cluster!Taylor. Out of maybe three or four fics, sure, but it's still good.
- /Aspects/, for nailing Wildbow's style instead of just Worm's style.
- A ton more alt!powers and stuff under 100k words, many of which I don't have time to sort through.

And finally, specific authors:

- Anything by UnwelcomeStorm for character interaction driven stories, but especially /Constellations/.
- maroon_sweater for crackfics, and I'll stand by that until roon finishes something that /isnt/ a crackfic. Maybe Loaf counts.
- Harbin is a good writer with a lot of dead stories.
- ManMagnficent for good characterization (usually)
- RavensDagger, but only read until the jokes start getting old.
- Any authors that are popular in other fandoms and have branched out into Worm, like Ryuugi.
- And pretty much anything else by an author on this list.
