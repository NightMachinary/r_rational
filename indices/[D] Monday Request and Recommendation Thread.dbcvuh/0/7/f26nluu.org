Just curious, but as someone who also has consumed a... less than healthy dose of Worm fanfics, which one is your favorite out of all the ones you have read? Not asking for a top 5 (although if you can I'd be all up for it) but which one did you enjoy the most, found most memorable, keep thinking back to, etc?
