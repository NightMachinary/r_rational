I second the recomendation.

Only up to chapter 11... but it's really good so far: the author manages to make each race distinctive without making them caricatures, and each caracter feels like theyhave depth. Probably helped that it ticks most of my favorite tropes, but the tempo and writting are far far superior to your average fanfic. Saying anything more would be redundant since you get the picture, go read it you'll love it.
