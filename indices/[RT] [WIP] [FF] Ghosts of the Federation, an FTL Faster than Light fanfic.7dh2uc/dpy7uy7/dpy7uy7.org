Is this your writing, OP? I'm really enjoying it. The little touches about alien culture and psychology really help make the world feel real--the early scene with Kat and the psych unit was one of the main things that hooked me initially, and I'm also a big fan of the engi having gone out of their way to engineer an intoxicant just so they could bond with other species in that way. And I became emotionally invested in the friendship(?) between Brant and 78 almost immediately.
