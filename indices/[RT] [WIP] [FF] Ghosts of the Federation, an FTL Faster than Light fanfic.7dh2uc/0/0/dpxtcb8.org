FTL is an amazing game. It has a stupid amount of depth and replayability.

It's a tactical roguelite and I can't recommend it blindly to anyone, but it is an incredibly well-crafted and polished game. It's fun because almost every time, when you die it was actually your fault. Losses can almost always be traced down to your own mistakes of mismanaging resources, being too greedy or prioritizing wrong upgrades. The underlying mechanics are clean and simple, but the depth which emerges from having to juggle and consider everything gives it an incredibly high skill ceiling.

Even a hundred hours in, it's not difficult to come across minor tricks and gimmicks which can give you a slight edge on any given fight, like intentionally disabling your shields mid-fight for a split-second to let an ion blast through and have it disrupt a less critical subsystem instead of the shields.
