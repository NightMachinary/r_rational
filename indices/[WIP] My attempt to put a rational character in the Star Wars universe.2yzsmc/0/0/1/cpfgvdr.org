I read it as just getting actual force training that a pre-master newb usually wouldn't, with the what and how of that to come later in the story -- maybe during a "teaching his friend" bit. A re-grounding on saber fundamentals, plus /passive/ stuff he picks up because he's a giant nerd like that explains his growth /as a force user/, I think.

Maybe training more like Luke had with Yoda, just...perhaps with dangerous Sithy shortcuts. In any case, nothing wrong with a little plot-as-you-go on that point or dramatic tension on the details.

Luke doesn't get much lightsaber training before trying for Vader, either, just lots of training in using the force. Vader wasn't just messing with him. Luke pushed him back a few times, and Vader was supposed to be a monster. Even scores a hit on his armor before losing.

From that point of view, the dueling stuff is just our protagonist's pod racing scene, to show how in touch he is with the force now. That his opponents tried to trip him up after seeing him winning by losing their own style-focus and emotional control could be telling. The force clearly wasn't with them in any case.

Or maybe he let the Sith take direct control of his body until after the contests were over. A risky strategy, and one that might explain his conversation after with her. And why he was avoiding his friend during that period. How he limited that sort of thing would be the trick, otherwise she'd likely have done something more or still be in control. Maybe she /did/ do something to guarantee his "loyalty" in learning from her and falling to the dark side.

--------------

Regardless, movie canon is that people don't detect /real/ Sith and the more passive use of their dark side powers until it is too late, even while standing right next to them. Unless they have a powerful prior relationship or /specifically/ want to be seen, that is. Darth Maul in Ep 1 is showing off during his final "ambush". Maul almost killed them without being detected earlier in the movie, after all. Any galaxy spanning, dark side detection jedi powers are all very much only in the EU.

I think it was suggested in this story that the jedi masters were looking for him using force techniques during his duels, but they might not have been looking for specifically Sith stuff. Detection of someone passively using the dark side in person is sort of vague and could go either way. Even detecting someone is full-on Sith is super hard for jedi masters.

In later movies, Darth Vader has a connection to Luke, which is how the long-distance sensing thing worked between them. Only started after TESB, when Luke got some training to power up. Even then, it was only after Vader was told who Luke really was and they met in person, face to face. Still ambushed Luke three times, though. Sith are sneaky like that. They don't have some evil aura or something.

Point is, Luke can't sense the Emperor long range. Or vice versa, as Vader senses Luke on the moon when the Emperor doesn't (at first, at least). Same deal with Obi-Wan and Vader, at least at relatively close range.

You practically have to make them whip out the force lightning or the red lightsaber to positively identify. So in this story, he might just be hiding any Gray or Dark force use. Works for direct control scenario as well. Will be interesting to see what you do with this point in the story.
