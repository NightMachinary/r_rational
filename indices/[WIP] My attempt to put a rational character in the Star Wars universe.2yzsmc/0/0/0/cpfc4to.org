It's an interesting story, but we kind of need to see at least the first conversation or so before you can move on. If this was a story about someone else, and we the audience were to discover that they were influenced by a Sith Holocron later on, that would be a good way to write it. But he's the main character, and the influence these teachings have on his philosophy and methodology are kind of important, so we need to see more of that journey than you've shown.
