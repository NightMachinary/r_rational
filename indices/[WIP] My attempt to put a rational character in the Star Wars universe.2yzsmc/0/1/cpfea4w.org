  I am pretty curious how a Sith's teachings allow him to mend years of neglect in light saber training but it doesn't necessarily cause disbelief.

It's not entirely improbable. I studied dueling[1] for a number of years, and I recall that small things could make a huge difference in performance -- getting a grasp on distance and learning to beat foible-to-forte (as opposed to middle-to-middle) being two good examples of things that can be learned in a few hours and make a large difference to your combat ability.

[1] Fencing is a sport based around making a light come on by touching someone with the tip of your weapon. Dueling is the art of killing someone with a Western-style sword.
