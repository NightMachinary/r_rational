You sure? [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Service_Corps][This wiki-article]] seems to say the opposite:

#+begin_quote
  The Jedi Service Corps was an organization formed by the Council of Reassignment during the Old Republic era as an alternative to serving in the more traditional capacity of the Jedi Knights. Because it was run by the Jedi Order, the members of the Service Corps were all considered Jedi, though many of its members had failed to pass their Initiate Trials and therefore could not proceed in training at the Jedi academy.
