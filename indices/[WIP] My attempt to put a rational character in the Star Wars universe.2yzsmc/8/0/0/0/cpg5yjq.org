Good point. "Run by" reads to me as religious ownership of a business, or bureaucratic management of a government labor organization/concentration camp for failed ubermensch, but it could read in other ways.

Jedi is actually used in the films to mean more than in the EU books. I don't see how Vader can say to Luke, "Most Impressive, but you are not a Jedi yet" if a farmer without a lightsaber is one.

I mean, sick burn and all, but it doesn't logically add up.
