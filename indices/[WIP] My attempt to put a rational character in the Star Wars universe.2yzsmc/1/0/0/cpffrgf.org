I'm almost certain your fic has to be well /before/ Revan does his/her thing in the Second Sith War, or a good while after.

Before means you need to do some research, after means some added complexity and fewer available KOTOR characters. Or just say "meh, none of that is official canon anyway now" and write something that sounds jedi-esque. Both work. I'll assume you want /some/ EU stuff.

[[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Sith_War][Great Sith War]], [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mandalorian_Wars][Mandalorian Wars]], [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Civil_War][Second Sith War]]. Lots there to work with. Check it out.

--------------

If placed after any of those wars, some scars would surely still remain, and people coming into contact with Sith stuff will be much more closely watched for a long while. After those wars, increasingly so after each, there were a lot fewer jedi for a while.

That didn't seem like the case here, so I'd shoot for before any major wars, or suggest that there was a /very/ quick return to Jedi Order status quo if placed soon after.

Which might in itself be effective. More commentary on how static and unchanging the jedi are. I don't remember /how/ secret the Darth Revan thing turns out to be to the general populace in either the games or EU stuff. Might be a good secret for someone finding their own way to stumble upon. Would be pretty shocking.

Especially the whole "mind wipe" bit. That's...not good. Memory wipe is death in almost all rational universes. That Revan has magic personality resilience was sort of a happenstance. No reason to think the Council wouldn't try to mindwipe our hero too, if he got annoying.

--------------

Character reference wise, a passing wave at Revan (before or after the council takes him/her down) or some such might work, maybe during the Mandalorian Wars. Could also do something with Exar Kun if the Great Sith War kicks off during the story.

But I wouldn't overdo it unless you want to start a fixfic for KOTOR or some seriously AU stuff. Again, might be easier to just place it somewhere vague if that isn't what you want to focus on.

Oh, and good start to your fic. Keep it up.
