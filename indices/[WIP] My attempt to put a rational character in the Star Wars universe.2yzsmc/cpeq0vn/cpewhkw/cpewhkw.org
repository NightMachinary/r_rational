Or a single year before the events of Episode Two, on a different planet that wasn't in Yoda/the council's area of influence.

A galaxy spanning organization having a central temple implies other temples, as we also see in Old Republic fics. There is also an organizational size issue. This could just be the "red shirts" level view we only see in EU books.

Good 'ole George's limited scope of imagination never really handled large scales very well. Distances, populations, economics, all shit in the movies. Even a couple of jedi per planet (making those selected for training one in several billion) would fill a single building of the scale of the central temple shown in the movies many times over.

Remember that senate room? Those aren't even assigned per-planet. Thousands of senators would be needed to fill that room, and they only represent a plurality of planets in the galaxy. No Hutt space, little outer rim, lots of systems not even represented.

Even suggesting most jedi are away from HQ most of the time doesn't fix that, given training rollup requirements (if that were the only temple), logistics trains, and pre-war conditions. Do only one in a hundred, or a thousand, jedi have direct access to that nifty library? Is Yoda's class the only one in that cohort? Seems iffly even if you allow for that. It's a mess.

Still, you are likely right. Seems like Old Republic given the setting cues. Might even be a Reven analog with the coming conflict as the same war he/she fought in. If Mandalorians start showing up, that'll be a tipoff.
