  I will note that that is still 'The Old Republic', which I meant as 'pre-Galactic Empire' and not 'Revan's time, ca. 3970 BBY'.

Understood. Not exactly the correct terminology, I think. But that makes sense. This says the Old Republic period [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Republic_era][ended in 1000 BBY]], though I'm not sure about the citation.

  There is a limit to what can be shown on screen however.

This is my rant time.

That excuse just doesn't work anymore. Maybe for Eps 4-6, because of budget and scope and setting, but not for the new prequels, when the jedi order was supposed to be at its height. The Clone Wars cartoons, which get a lot better later if you have the stomach for it, don't even expand on this.

It would take maybe five words to minimally establish. With CGI and modern animation, you don't even need to make an expensive matte painting for a quick establishing shot if more was needed.

Everything is always about the temple on Coruscant, which in the prequels is the /only/ temple and the only force sensitive order at all (*in canon*), which just doesn't fit with the proper scale of things. Even the KOTOR games get closer to right, and they are still way off. The size of the Empire is at least that of the Republic. The Old Republic should be even larger at some times. Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars III re the current Empire:

That's big. And that only counts the Republic planets, and they don't own the entire galaxy while apparently still accepting any force sensitive to the order. Anakin not being a republic citizen wasn't an issue that was raised, after all.

Still, if we're talking Republic space only, and /only/ around ten billion people per /system/ (assuming only /one/ habitable planet and no orbitals or other habitats), we're still looking at crazy huge scales here.

Thousands of systems, meaning at least two thousand, times ten billion, times how rare are jedi? Are successfully trained jedi literally one in ten billion? If not, the jedi order is too small. Two thousand jedi trained and in training is too small, and way more than are ever even /suggested/ to exist in the movies. Not even the AU books fix this with their agricorp blathering.

There could be maybe a hundred jedi knights in the Clone Wars cartoons (the most extensive look we get), but only a dozen or so that we ever see in detail. There are only about as many jedi masters as apprentice padawans shown, maybe three times as many younger students /in total/ at the central (and apparently only) temple, and in direct defiance of all hierarchical logic almost no "solo" knights other than Anakin even hinted at.

This is sloppy and bad, not just budget constraints. This is on the order of a planet being destroyed and it being "as if millions of voices suddenly cried out". A galactic war killing "millions" is a common failing in sci-fi. This dearth of jedi. Darth Dearth would be great.

A single line about "all the smaller fights" or "the lesser battles for the scattered temples being hard fought" or a single temple outpost behind Separatist lines would give much of that needed depth to the universe. There is simply no excuse for portraying a /galactic/ scale organization like that. Given how long they've existed, and the fact that they're a order guarding the galaxy's peace, not simply the local Lion's Club, Jedi should be as numerous as the clone troopers, at least at the lower levels of the order.

Lucas had no trouble with epic space battles and legions of anonymous CGI storm troopers. That there is limited time simply isn't an excuse that works anymore when CGI people can be made cheaply to add to the background. He showed how large the Republic government was with CGI. Why is the jedi order shown to be a handful of masters, with maybe two dozen jedi to muster with Mace when the shit hits the fan?

There should be /millions/ of jedi in the universe. Hundreds of thousands of jedi masters. Hundreds of temples, each headed by an elder at the level that might be considered for a council seat. That's how /real/ religious orders work, why not space ones? That's how a /real/ space opera would work, echoing or playing off familiar themes of things like the Catholic church or Buddhist orders.

Such lost opportunity.
