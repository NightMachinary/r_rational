  Or a single year before the events of Episode Two, on a different planet that wasn't in Yoda/the council's area of influence.

I will note that that is still 'The Old Republic', which I meant as 'pre-Galactic Empire' and not 'Revan's time, ca. 3970 BBY'.

What you say makes eminent logical sense, and there are clearly other temples (we see the one on Dantooine in KOTOR for example) but the Coruscant one is the most central. There was a great library on Ossus, but it was destroyed in 3996 BBY by Exar Kun.

  Even a couple of jedi per planet (making those selected for training one in several billion) would fill a single building of the scale of the central temple shown in the movies many times over.

This is especially true since we know some races have much higher percentages of population that are force sensitive - there simply must be more temples and training areas.

There is a limit to what can be shown on screen however.
