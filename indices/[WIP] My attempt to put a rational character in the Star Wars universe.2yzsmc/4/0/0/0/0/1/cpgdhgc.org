  I suppose part of the problem with the Jedi is that millions of Jedi would not be defeatable. Especially with FTL and precognitive psychic sensing and communication.

More on this in a moment.

  Order 66 doesn't work on that scale, even if you had the trooper numbers to pull it off - at those numbers there is no way to avoid a much larger percentage of jedi slipping through the cracks.

Well, I'm thinking Order 66 could include attacks on /all/ temples, which would have been where most jedi non-combatants retreated during war. If the Dark Side clouding their perceptions work on a galactic scale on two dozen people, it doesn't exclude it working on a galactic scale on ten thousand, or a million people. It seems to be the distance thing was the hard to understand part there, not clouding the minds of lots of jedi. Anyway, even if it required thousands of Sith trained dark side force users (like Jade in EU) hunting down librarians to pull off, that isn't impossible. Then the clones frag their commands and Vader spends the next twenty years tracking down the dregs, along with a few thousand of his own trained non-Sith dark siders.

And we know they don't just kill all force sensitives. Jedi weren't doing a great job repopulating themselves either, so that didn't slow births of force sensitives. There will still be just as many being born after the purge. They just won't be getting trained /as jedi/. Wonder what the Emperor has planned for /them/. Egh.

But that's not the bad part of large numbers of force sensitives. It gets worse. I'm thinking about other larger groups this implies even during the "peace" of the Republic.

First, consider the Jedi Order* needs to be functional (rationally speaking) to in at least one thing to have it last 25,000 years mostly intact. Continuing to exist. And Sith all go straight for the Order when they pop up.

Now consider a million force sensitives in the Jedi Order maybe, total. Ten times that many rejected, dropouts, or "other". Not exactly a safety school here in the US, but still. I'm being generous.

Say, three times /that/ below entry threshold, never picked up, or part of the other force sensitive groups that /obviously/ should exist -- unless the jedi are keeping their Monopoly of Force in using the Force by...force.

/Ahem/.

That's a lot of non-jedi force users.
