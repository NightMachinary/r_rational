PART TWO OF TWO (SEE [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yzsmc/wip_my_attempt_to_put_a_rational_character_in_the/cpgdhgc][PART ONE]], the Nerdy Menace)

--------------

To get a feel for the scope of the issue, consider a back-of-the-napkin model of the "peaceful," not-at-Sith-war galaxy at a single point in time (WARNING READING REQUIRED):

- *One million trained and training jedi* in the galaxy, the top members of which sit on a council running the Republic's command and control organ for force-sensitives, i.e. the Jedi Order.

  - Which, X-Men style, also has a small fighting branch, the Jedi Knights. A /Force Special Forces/, if you will...Okay, I'll be good. Mouse away from the downvote button.

- Some wash out, so say one in ten graduate the school of serene knocks. I think that's actually better than the X-Men ever manage. That leaves *ten million more losers half-trained or worse*.

  - Who then either become normal dirt farmers (really?) or fall and become dark-side opponents at some very small fraction. All the better to prop up the Republic's jedi-industrial complex and their own religious beliefs about people who aren't trained falling to the dark side, 'natch.
  - NOTE: these are not true Sith-trained master/apprentice pairs, they just throw the lightning and maybe wear too much dark eye shadow.
  - Maybe at the rate of one in a million failed trainees turning? Seems low, doesn't it? Well, too high and failures would rationally just be killed, like Slytherin sortees should have. They were like, what? One in a thousand for becoming Death Eaters between the '60s and '99, and most rational readers consider that criminal. It isn't that sort of rational Jedi Order I'm discussing here, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that their methods work as they say.
  - So *ten or so meh trained dark force users* in the galaxy at any time directly caused by jedi training failures, assuming no major Sith bases running or massive cloning operations or such.

- Three times that are never asked. *Thirty million force users are left behind* in the galaxy.

  - /About/ two thirds not being worth training plus those not found makes sense if they recruit from -1 Ïƒ and up, assuming /those with force powers/ are on a bell curve
  - The rest of this figure is made up of those missed, found too late, outside Republic search program zones, living on crapsack worlds, joining other force cults, etc.
  - Call their dark side rate as actually higher, thus giving the benefit of the doubt to the Jedi Order -- you can sort of follow that logic.
  - Say, an order of magnitude more likely for them to turn? That's a lot. Call it *three hundred self-trained dark siders*.

- /Maybe/ *ten thousand combat ready Jedi Knights* at any time. An absurdly high rate for civilians, but also not exactly fighting monks levels. That's one percent of jedi actually being a warrior trained to kill people, and proven good at it. WWII was about 12% of the US population actually in the military, many fewer using weapons.

  - More than enough to find and contain the *three hundred ten or so dark force users* in the galaxy, not including the environmental Sith effects at whatever rate they pop up.
  - Much of that...err, /force/ will be used to keep casinos in business and merchants from being robbed by space pirates lead by wild talent force users who /aren't even dark siders/. Another budget prop, but actually justified in a galaxy where some people have superpowers /and/ super tech.
  - That level of control let's them say the galaxy is "peaceful" from their point of view, and helps justify their Senate budget bills by every dark sider breakout event scaring a few locals who report up the chain and hit galactic headline news.
  - Think L.A. car chase news, but with more face paint and dark clothing. Not genocide level stuff usually, but people die in city and planet significant numbers because of the dark side force users. And all news at high tech levels is galactic news.

- Here is where it gets weird. I started running these numbers before working out the consequences. So, call it *two* "true" *Sith* who actually studied the inner sect secrets coming from at-risk force users (failed jedi /plus/ unaccounted for force sensitives, all 40 million) at a rate of /not very often/.

  - Say that's a one in a million thing to happen to a vulnerable force user. What's that mean?
  - I'm assuming those already using the dark side would be most likely to be drawn to dark Sith secrets and relics, because Force.
  - That means once every 3,000 years or so (during relative peace times, more during open galactic warfare) two Sith pop up to wreck shit.
  - That just about fits, with three major Sith-related wars (counting the Rebellion against a Sith controlled Empire) in the Republic's 25,000 year history, plus a lot of rooting out lone gunmen Sith studying naughty things like immortality (this is canon). That means there is something like a 50/50 chance that a Sith pair will start a major war /just by themselves/.
  - A war that will kill /hundreds of trillions/.
  - Note that these two Sith will be /fighting/ 10,000 or or so Jedi Knights only if they get drastically stupid. They can obviously hide well. And are powerful.
  - But if you (a Sith) can cause even a small schism within the jedi order, you can get a force of tens of thousands of force sensitive trainees to torture into combat effectiveness quickly. This trope matches with Sith being heartless task masters (literally) for lots of little dark force user drones while also trying to avoid Sith on Sith violence by (eventually) limiting enrollment in the inner secrets.
  - Huh. Can kinda see the jedi's point with these numbers. *By only adding a small number of failures with their tactics to the potential Sith pool (compared to not training everyone -- which to fix would require bad means), the biggest issue is trained jedi splitting off the order when a random Sith shows up.* Better to not even train those people who would so defect, since that's where your problem really is -- trained jedi falling.

- I haven't included a conversion rate for trained jedi falling to the dark side or straight-up becoming Sith here. I'm giving the jedi the benefit of the doubt that /if people follow their methods/ then trained jedi don't fall like that, or the very few who do are pruned before the fall and are included in the loser dropout numbers of dark siders.

  - An order that loses many people post-secret-handshake works a lot different than the Jedi Order, who seemed surprised that people like Asoka and Dooku would just up and leave. That indicates it is a rare event as well, and they are mostly concerned with people splintering because of religious differences, not some instant-Sith disease or artifact effect.
  - And they're already set up by numbers and temperament (and even librarians being armed and partially trained civilians) to pile on and insta-gib dark siders and Sith who are so obvious as to become known to them by, say, cackling wildly during summer festivals or gutting a couple of students in the Garden of a Thousand Cliches.
  - Which makes obvious evil a non-starter and the canon secret Sith plots quite rational.

- As for the rest of the jedi, call it 100,000 in training at any time, and the rest just being monks, diplomats, scholars of jedi-specific topics, and teachers. I'd expect lots of effort there to avoid letting in someone who's about to chestburster into a dark sider, wandering the galaxy being self-important and wise, and lots and lots of wisely watching their own for heresy.

  - The upper tiers would be swapping in and out from running peacekeeping duties and central administration at HQ. They don't need to be combat monsters, just masters of the force.
  - Still, I'd expect a lot of art to come from the jedi order, pieces on philosophy and science. But they are all about containing ambition, so...that's effectively a dead population group for advancing culture. Sad, really, but not statistically significant on a galactic scale, so they don't suffer too badly for it.

--------------

Weird. I was expecting something else going in. But it seems like, given my assumptions (including a moral and effective Jedi Order as written), they actually do a really important job. Without 10,000 Jedi Knights cleaning house, the dark siders would run around unchecked, building up until a Sith popped out and started trying to rule/destroy the galaxy. And another. And another...

And it all seems to fit with canon "facts" and tropes. I think rational Star Wars is a lot more possible once you stop making the Star Wars story about a single shawarma joint full of superheroes, and more about managing ubiquitous and double-edged superpowers at a galactic scale.

*/tl;dr, a snarky Sith fan concludes that with realistic galactic numbers of force sensitives, dark siders ruin everything, the Jedi Order a necessary force for order in the galaxy./*
