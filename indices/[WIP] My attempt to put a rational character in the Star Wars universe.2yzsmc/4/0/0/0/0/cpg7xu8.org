  Understood. Not exactly the correct terminology, I think. But that makes sense. This says the Old Republic period ended in 1000 BBY[1] , though I'm not sure about the citation.

I suppose. Notable however is that these seem to be historical period names akin to 'Middle Ages', or 'Classical Era' and not 'the set of all years in which the Galaxy was ruled by the Republic which existed before Palpatine's empire.'

The fact that the so called 'Rise of the Empire' period, which for some reason extends a thousand years before Palpatine's birth includes within it [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Age_of_the_Old_Republic][The so called Golden Age of the Old Republic]] tells me that whoever is writing these histories is a bit flaky.

Then again, ask 5 modern historians what years constitute the 'High Middle Ages' and you'll get 7 answers, so it's not surprising.

The rant is spot on. It's similar to the problem with Warhammer 40k's Imperium in a way - the Imperial Guard is noted as having trillions of members, which makes sense for its size, but even at their height, most Space Marine chapters have what, 1000 members? For multiple solar systems?

Even if each member was a man sized main battle tank that could fight for weeks, that's not enough to effectively conquer a single planet in any sensible length of time.

I suppose part of the problem with the Jedi is that millions of Jedi would not be defeatable. Especially with FTL and precognitive psychic sensing and communication. Order 66 doesn't work on that scale, even if you had the trooper numbers to pull it off - at those numbers there is no way to avoid a much larger percentage of jedi slipping through the cracks.
