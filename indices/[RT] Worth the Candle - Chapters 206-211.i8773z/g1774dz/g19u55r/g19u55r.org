In addition to the whole "lots of IRL people do crap like this", I think he was always hoping for a way out. He'll never escape the exclusion, of course, but maybe the Empire will crumble or change its operating philosophy. If he's immortal, then it's pretty much a waiting game, combined with a "get big enough that nobody will fuck with me". The hostages are a useful deterrent, of course, but there's always the possibility that, say, a dragon will decide she wants him dead and doesn't care about the casualties. So he gets into a cycle -- make more zombies, so he has a bigger army/can produce more stuff to sell, which means more resources are needed, which means more zombies to create those resources, etc. Eventually he reached a point where he needed to deal with anybody would still work with him, and damn the moral consequences (something something "it's cool cuz they consented").
