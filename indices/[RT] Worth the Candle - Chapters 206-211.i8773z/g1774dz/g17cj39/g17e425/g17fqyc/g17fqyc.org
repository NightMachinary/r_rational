No, real life billionaires are infamous for stuff like that. Starting from the worlds first billionaire, Leopold of Belgium , who made the money by slaughtering fifteen million people in the Belgian Congo, and cutting the hands and feet off more than a million children when they or their parents couldn't keep up with his work quota's.

Just in the past year we have that massive child abuse scandal with Eppstein ,Wexner and seven other billionaires. Not to mention the hundreds of other rich and powerful people on the flight logs.
