I take your point, but breeding children to sell them to the hells seems much worse than what real life billionaires do. I guess I do sometimes wonder why billionaires don't stop as well though, [[https://www.cnet.com/news/bill-gates-being-very-rich-is-the-same-hamburger/][once the money doesn't do as much for them]].

I feel like a better comparison morally would be: why do dictators keep going (torturing and imprisoning people) when they could retire. Which again, doesn't fit Captain Blue. He is reasonably secure against his enemies, he can more or less do what he likes, he doesn't have to hurt people to survive (like the Doris's).

It just seems like he thinks he is engaged in some kind of positive project and is a force for some kind of good in the world. So what is that good thing he's aiming for?
