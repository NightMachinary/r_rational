My take is he's pwned by the devils.

Like, according to this guy, paraphrasing:

"Those things everyone says are incredibly good at socially corrupting your values? Rubbish. They are garbage at it. Also, I decided, entirely of my own free will, to send them millions of souls in exchange for resources that I use to expand my 'send them child souls' operation. And, also of my own free will, I continue to espouse a repellant philosophy which guarantees I never have anyone else to talk with. My entire life is an ever widening maw by which they are funneled souls, and it is all of my own free will. They are so crummy at manipulating people!"
