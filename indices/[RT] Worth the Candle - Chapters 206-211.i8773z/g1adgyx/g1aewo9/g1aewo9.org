That's a good point. The text quest says "You know his weakness" about Fel Seed, which I've always interpreted to mean that it's Arthur, but what would Joon do if something in one of his campaigns was way too strong? Nerf it into the ground. The solution to beating Fel Seed might be to get everything excluded so Fel Seed can't use it.

Although, unfortunately, we know from Blood God Doris that dimensional gates let you break exclusions, so if Fel Seed is in the dimensional gate he'd still be a threat.
