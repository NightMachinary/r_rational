still and vibration magic are an interesting case, since it did take a ritual. I'm not sure off-hand of examples where she was using it. but, even if we grant that I think it's something closer to like Gem magic, where you need a physical component to channel the spell; she can't just use gem magic without a Gem if Joon is holding one, and similarly she would need her own hoard for gold magic.
