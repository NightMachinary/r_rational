Mildly obnoxious objection that occurred to me about an hour after reading: Amaryllis has Synergy, so she has half of Joon's skill levels, right? And Joon, as of the moment he's flying into Celestar, has at least 13 in Gold Magic, which puts Mary at 6. Now, she doesn't "own" an actual giant heap of gold at that point, so you could argue that her skill is irrelevant, but Joon has a virtue, courtesy of the Doe, that allows him to fudge technicalities, and that seems like the kind of technicality that really deserves a fudging. Unless you argue that six-eyed only applies to Joon personally trying to BS the DM on his own behalf, which I think goes somewhat against the spirit of it.

Bottom line, I think Mary had a fair case for being allowed to fly up and stab Perisev a little bit, even if it would be just like the DM to only consider her to "own" half the gold pile.
