The implication seemed to be that straight soul-edits would revert over time due to connections with underlying values in the spirit. That was why Juniper needed to learn spirit magic, so he could both edit his "level up" desire priority lower /and makes it stay there/. So that change should persist, since it's still supported by the spirit-level edits he made, but other temporary changes like the reduced pain sensitivity should revert. Or was that one sprit-based? In which case he still has access to spirit magic and can revert it manually.
