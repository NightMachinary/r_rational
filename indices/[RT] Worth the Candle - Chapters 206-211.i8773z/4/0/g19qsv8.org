  I hate it when MCs get huge power nerfs.

Yeah, the whole second half of this act (basically everything from the first confrontation above ground on) just made me feel irrationally angry. Like yes Essentialism has been ridiculous, /but/ it was also integral to almost everything the party has done and the dangers they faced meant it wasn't really a mismatch that the DM should have removed. It's resolved otherwise intractable problems in interesting ways, and offered hints about really cool ways that some of the most unsatisfying permanent losses might be resolved happily someday where no other skill could do so. With that tool gone, an entire world of numeric certainty is gone, and the exclusion doesn't even appear to be enpersoned or locational so it seems like he's just completely screwed. Amaryllis can never become his perfect mate through editing herself to gain a fundamental part of human experience that she was born without, so that whole sexual incompatibility is just going to grate on their relationship either forever or until it breaks. Without the ability to repair from his backup soul he might now be permanently disfigured from the dragon fire which would just be gross. This loss is just so enormous and the enormity hasn't even sunk in yet.

Gold magic is at least /explicitly/ temporary which will make its eventual loss still annoying but decidedly more palatable, but the last paragraphs where people are just being silent at Joon make me expect that it will fuck up all his relationships even worse than they were already fucked up and I think he's going to make some really really annoying choices before he gets off the ride. That's going to be hard for me to read. ugh.

And in the face of all the rest of it, losing the Egress is a huge blow too. That would have been devastating alone if we didn't have much worse things immediately adjacent.

I think the problem from a more meta perspective is that Joon found ways to gain ultimate power early in the story at a low level. They were really cool to read. But then because of all the munchkining (which don't get me wrong I looove that shit) he doesn't have any urgency towards getting "legitimate" level ups that would let him have a high /base/ power level without the "cheats" that seem to cause exclusions. Thus the only way to continue to have a "boy becomes man" type of story, is for him to get periodically nerfed into the fucking ground. Ouch. Maybe he'll figure this out before things get worse, or maybe in the end he'll find a way to un-Exclude things and reform them so they don't get excluded again (I can dream).

Ugh. I still love the story overall. Gold magic is new and interesting from an MC perspective. The fights with the dragons were exciting. I still want to see all the skills and their virtues get revealed and munchkined--that's been really really creatively and excellently done so far. But I feel kinda winded. Maybe I just like Mary Sues too much, but fuck the Dungeon Master. I can't wait to see him get killed/usurped.
