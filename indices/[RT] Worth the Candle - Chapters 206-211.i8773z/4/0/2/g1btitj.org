Hasn't it been suggested heavily since day one that Amarillys was specifically created for Joon? That's as close to "perfect mate" as it gets. Her asexuality is a non-issue because she's fully willing to have sex to satisfy Joon, even though she doesn't care for it. The issue is him having whatever hang ups about sex from Maddie, and Amarillys shouldn't have to change her soul just so Joon doesn't have to work through them. Moot point now, but still.
