As a side not. Modern cochlear implants are really cool. My sister who has one can screen out all noise at various distances from her (Bubble of silence in noisy restaurants), she can pipe Bluetooth directly into her cochlea and decide what percent of what she's hearing is external and what percent comes from the Bluetooth. She can also go deaf to sleep like the dead no matter how noisy the environs are. They are quickly approaching being better than baseline human ears.
