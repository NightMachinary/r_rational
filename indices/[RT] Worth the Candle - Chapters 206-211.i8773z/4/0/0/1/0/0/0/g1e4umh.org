Okay, this came out to about 16,000 characters, so it's getting split up. Whoops. Original post begins below:

This is a good example to use in this context; I have a few thoughts about it. (...reading this understated opening two hours later when I've finally finished typing was pretty funny)

Firstly, personal perspective (and probable bias contributor): I sometimes feel like my sexuality gets in the way of other things in my life, and I feel like for me personally if I was offered the option of giving it up (or, say, tuning in down; something that'd be considered equivalent to "hard of hearing" in your example) it'd be something I'd have to weigh with pros and cons rather than a "what, no" sort of situation. This gives me the initial intuition that it's not quite a one-to-one comparison, but probably leans me towards the conclusion I reached above.

Secondly, I honestly hadn't even considered the topic of minors or young children who are having others make a decision for them. That gets a little complex, and I do get into it later as it's the real meat of the argument (in cases where people can make decisions, respecting them is correct for me pretty much as a centrepiece of my subjective value system; where they don't cause harm to others, etc etc, but we're not here to dig out my entire values matrix!) but for now suffice it to say that none of my reasoning really applies to "what to decide for people who can't decide for themselves", and also to say that I'm not asexual myself which changes the character of my position compared to a deaf person arguing against the implants for someone else.

Thirdly, there's some inaccuracy in comparing sexuality to something like hearing. The big one is that hearing provides obvious mechanical benefits to a variety of activities; sexuality provides, to the individual, access to a single class of activity and primarily social benefits otherwise. Obviously there's tangential overlap between sexuality and other spheres of experience, but in most cases that's by choice: people produce art related to sex, or bring sexual topics into other areas of life. In the case of sound, the effort required would be to keep them OUT, so there's a baseline part of most (arguably all, if one considers "silence as distinct from sound" to be part of being able to hear) experiences that's gone missing.

The other main one is that sexuality brings with it a level of compulsion (at least, this is how I understand it). There's a case to be argued for this for any sensory input; that a desire to consume sugar to excess isn't a reason to argue taste is a net negative, for instance. The difference I'd draw here is that I'd blame the desire on sugar in the first instance, and on sexuality itself in the second. I feel that offering someone with sex addiction the opportunity to become asexual would be declined less often than offering someone the loss of their sense of taste in response to unhealthy levels of consumption, and I feel like this matters in some way. (Note though that the use of "feel" was consciously chosen here; I have no hard data and only my general instinct on how humans work to draw on, so I'm mainly putting this here as part of my thinking. In particular it can be argued that sexuality is multifaceted and level of compulsion is but one of those facets, and that adjusting it in isolation would be preferable to turning the whole thing off)

There's some additional nasty complications around a "cure" for asexuality being conceptually similar to a "cure" for homosexuality. There is something in there which is okay on paper (the hypothetical ability to allow people to change their sexuality at will is hard to construe as a negative; even with social pressures, the blame rests with the social pressures and not the technology), but referring to it as a cure causes...I want to just say "messiness", but the sort of messiness that can make it actually worse in practice to try and develop something. Like, if you go out into the world and say "we should cure asexuals" that's liable to lead to people doing stupid bad things a la conversion therapy.

There's also the literal meaning of "disability" to think about. Deafness is literally an inability to hear, but attempting to express asexuality in similar terms leads to something like "inability to feel sexual desire/attraction" (pretending for a moment that asexuality refers just to the endpoint on a spectrum of sexual desire, rather than the swath of that spectrum considered sufficiently lower than average as is traditional). It's a different kind of lack, and unlike the inability to do something, the general class is not inherently negative: an inability to feel despair would be argued by many to be a positive. This means that disability is a poor match, term-wise, for asexuality, and that its use loads towards asexuality being a negative in a way that I don't consider justified. I don't know what term I'd use in its place, though.

After sitting and writing, I think what I'm coming to is that...I was originally going to say something about a category difference but I keep coming back to the idea that there are some environments where one would PREFER to be deaf, hypothetically, but we a) basically don't inhabit one, and b) have tools to apply temporary deafness (earplugs, etc) if required. Sexuality lacks both of these; there's no on/off switch, and it's a lot more ambiguous as to whether an individual would prefer it or not in many environments that exist or could reasonably exist today.

What I'd argue then, is that in the case of asexuality there's an argument to be made that sexuality is...okay, nothing is truly an unalloyed good, but sexuality is less so than hearing and a line must be drawn somewhere and wherever I'd draw it, it's somewhere in between them. It might just come down to personal value; I value differences between people fairly highly, and value finding joy more than following a path to it. The tricky part, then, comes in determining what is best for someone whose own values are unclear or undeveloped.

On that subject...I don't know. There's enough differentiation that it feels wrong to me to make an irreversible decision for somebody early in their life in the way that one would for deafness, but at the same time it's easy to picture people regretting that the intervention wasn't performed on their behalf later in life, but at the same time it's easy to imagine that that's not fundamental but rather due to societal values in which case I'd argue the fix is to change those values rather than change people to fit them (this is a general position I hold; change society before forcibly applying change to people), but at the same time we live in a society [bottom text haha] so it's really difficult to tell whether it's a social issue or fundamental one.

I suppose when it comes down to it I would say we should err on the side of social when uncertainty exists because as a general rule that will cause less harm (certainly, enough harm has been done by erring on the fundamental side that I would prefer to give the alternative a go), but I am aware that if I were actually in a decision-making position this would be a high-stakes decision that would require constant outcome monitoring and course correction. Weighing on this, too, is that I think erring in favour of non-intervention is an important principle in this area; the burden of proof is on the intervention to demonstrate overwhelmingly that applying it is a significant positive and not applying it is a significant negative. This will lead, in individual cases, to interventions not being applied that may have provided net positive, but sticking to the principle will additionally prevent interventions that apply net negatives (potentially quite significant ones) which I believe to be a net positive trade-off, to the degree one can ascribe "trade-off" to people's lives.
