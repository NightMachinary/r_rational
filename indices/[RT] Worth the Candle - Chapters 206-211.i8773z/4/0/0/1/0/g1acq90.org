I read (past tense) "fundamental" to refer to the experience being fundamental to BEING human (which implies...less humanity in asexual people, since they're missing something that's "fundamental to being human", which definitely invites bad outcomes), and I'm like 98% sure that's not at all how you intended it based on what you've said here. So, definitional mismatch on that, I think.

Similar feeling for the "core part of human experience" thing; I'm not sure I even understand what the term means if it's not "core part of the experience of being human", which then again kind of implies that missing any of it means being less human (unless you can be human but not experience being human, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me). Again, though, that's how I read it. I wouldn't say it's an entirely out-there reading (which is why I felt the need to comment), but at the same time it doesn't look at all like what you were going for.

Regardless, I would define core human experience VERY narrowly, and I'd disagree that that's a ridiculous stance to take. I'd refer to the stuff you're describing as "core" as something like "common" instead; the vast majority of people have that shared experience, and that's useful information to keep in mind, but assuming any individual does is also something that'd invite bad outcomes. Take note of the majority but account for statistical outliers, don't assume any individual falls into the majority simply because it's likely, etc. I'd reserve "core" for...you know, I'm actually not sure; I tried thinking about how I'd classify "language" and realised it's a grey area. I'll have to ponder that some more; this post is long enough as it is.

That said, I don't think it's the only valid stance, and it seems apparent you have a different one. That's fine! The thing I was worried about was this leading into dehumanisation of asexuals (I have a personal stake in that not happening, though I am not asexual myself), which doesn't seem to be the case here and which I'm definitely not accusing you of. Maybe a little trigger-happy because it's something I'd accuse OTHER people who have used this line of reasoning of, but that's not really relevant in this context beyond explaining my initial motivation.

Although I'm not sure "missing the desire to have sex" and "missing the ability to see" are quite comparable, and there are SOME issues surrounding the idea of treating asexuality as a disability in the same way we do blindness, that's ultimately secondary to the underlying conversation. It mostly manifests, I believe, as more asexual people refusing the hypothetical option to become more sexual than blind people would refuse the offer of sight, and in theory both groups should be respected in their decision regardless, so it really shouldn't matter.

I will say I prefer my perspective because I think it gives me a better sense of how drastically different from each other people can be while still being human, but I'm pretty sure everyone prefers their personal perspective and I would guess that yours acquires that sense via a different mechanism; I can vaguely picture a few, but they're not my own so I can't get much further than "they exist and are workable".

I'll also say that writing this gave me a good opportunity to really sit and think about how I viewed these sorts of things and (more importantly) how other people do, so I do appreciate that.

Oh, and I think it's important to note that the impact of becoming sexual/becoming asexual (coming from the opposite, in a highly simplified sense) is also something that varies from person to person; I'd guess the idea of becoming asexual is fairly negative on your end, I'd guess it's less negative on mine, I can't really guess how Joon/Amaryllis feel about it (I probably should be able to, but top of my head, nope), and I'd also guess that impacts how different our views are on the subject.

Lemme know if any of that needs expanding or clarifying; this has been, like, half journal entry for me and I'm posting it now before it gets any more out of hand, so I might have left some rough edges or disjointed stuff in there.

If you or anyone else wants a tl;dr: I think mostly I misunderstood what you meant, but I also think it wasn't an entirely unreasonable way to read it and I'm glad you let me know more about how it was intended. Also some brain dump that probably didn't need to be in there, but adds context to my position and response, I suppose.
