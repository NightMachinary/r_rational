Meh I don't agree with that at all (and by extension, yes, I don't agree with Joon's idea in the story that editing himself is equivalent. It'd have been an act of caring in a more extreme version of people who shave their heads to support those close to them who have cancer, but it's not equivalent).

But I guess it depends on how ridiculously narrow you want to define "core part of human experience." I think all five senses, as well as the emotions, maturation stages, and the generalized life experiences that the vast majority of the species get, all qualify easily. I think that it's both absurd and inviting bad outcomes to exclude any of them conceptually, and just because not every single person gets an experience doesn't mean it's not fundamental. Importantly, the concept doesn't mean people without sexual desire are less than or deserve exclusion any more than it would mean the same about a blind person. It merely recognizes that there is something which is both important and typical that they sadly don't get to be part of, and that that is true whether or not they feel the loss themselves prior to having the experience become available through magic.

But I can concede at the same time that the classification is one based at least in part on subjective value, rather than moral principle. I think it's silly to do so, but it's not /objectively/ wrong.
