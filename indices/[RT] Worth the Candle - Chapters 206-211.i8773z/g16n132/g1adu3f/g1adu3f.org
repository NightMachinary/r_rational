Doubt she's a DMPC. Realistically it's just a straightforward factor of the Doe seeing her as a shackle. And the Doe has obviously known Solace for centuries through multiple rebirths- it makes sense that the Doe sees Solace as a crone.

Joon can't self-modify 'effectively,' but he could still feasibly fumble around with Spirit magic and make long-term changes, even if he can't see what he's doing the way he could with soul magic.
