Not going to lie, this chapter set felt a lot weaker than the last bit. I still enjoyed reading it, and there was some interesting worldbuilding bits, but I reread the most recent (prior to this) chapter to get myself situated and it felt a lot more engaging, even given that I already knew what happened in it at least vaguely, which normally saps that for me.
