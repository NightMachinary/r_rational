Is it insensitive to feel that your depressed headspace might've made the desolation in these chapters more...palpably wretched? I can't remember what the method acting equivalent of writing is, if there is one. I think a lot of us are feeling small and trapped in the slipstream of our times, but (pardon the ouroboros) taking a page out of Joon's pad, the less-than-eudaimonic reality and wicked problems of the world are things we have to confront sooner or later to grow, adapt, and overcome. Even if reading about shit mountains is eliciting escapist or vicarious narrative dissonance, literature occasionally serves to push us out of our Comfort zones and it's still much gentler than life. The timing and serial format are unfortunate, but it's not like WtC ever catered to wish fulfillment anyway.

BTW thanks for introducing ludonarrative dissonance; it's such a great fit in the litRPG context. A degree of reasonableness and it moonlights as a critique of the litRPG genre: it reminds me of the friction between "roleplaying" and "game", the disconnect between narrative and game elements, and the reader's malaise as the tool grows so large that its gravity distorts plot and meaning. Throw a few more degrees and it's an iffy metaphor for life - that storified delusion/feeling that we're meant to do something, but the mechanics of circumstance dictate otherwise (or theoretical vs practical). So all's to say no surprise on the fiction-is-better-than-reality crowd.

Thanks for the chapters and hope you're finding simple pleasures!
