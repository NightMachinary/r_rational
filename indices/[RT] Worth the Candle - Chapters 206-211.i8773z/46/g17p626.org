Until the latest exclusion, there was a hope of finding the places where various bits of soul magic were excluded to and using them. Now, if the soul magic exclusion is in a different location, does that mean those exclusion zones won't work?

Possible workaround if the DM willed it so:

On different planes, the soul magic exclusion overlaps with different pieces of excluded soul magic. So now you can only use Gestalt in a certain part of the plane of blood, can only change your species in a certain part of the plane of chitin, etc.
