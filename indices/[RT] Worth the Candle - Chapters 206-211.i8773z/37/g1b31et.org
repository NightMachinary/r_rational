Immediate Crackpot Theory that popped into my head: DM took over Mary to warn Juniper about the exclusion. She /might/ even be DMPC, but for various reasons, I don't think so. However, wasn't Arthur's DMPC also his first companion?

Also: amazing chapter. I'm sad to see Soul Magic go, how are they going to handle Fel Seed without being able to gobble up souls?
