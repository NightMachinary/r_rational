This latest batch convinces me further that Grak is the DMPC, or the closest to this concept in the gang.

Obviously Joon is going to replace Solace as the Last Druid.

I like that Essentialism is excluded. That was a huge Damocles' sword above the team's heads and skill sacrifice + scaphism was pushing Joon into a diminishing-returns arms race with every new challenge he faced. Hopefully we will see less munchkinry, more playing to their actual skills + specificities and especially *more teamwork*.

I think Elisha Blue's quest stands ultimately as a way to force Joon to question the ethics and author responsibility with his designing Aerb the way he has, by putting an emphasis on the ongoing and HUGE issue of the Hells. The captain essentially is wedging himself in between his victims and the crapsack nature of Aerb, in order to coerce them ‘consensually' by ensuring existence itself constrains their choice to what he ‘offers'. The only way Joon is getting out of this satisfactorily is by designing better alternative existences for the victims and therefore for everyone in Aerb.
