I don't think that's a very accurate parallel; the gems are a necessary intermediary to tell the magic what affect to achieve--the gem's color and cut affect the properties of the beam--more analogous to a bladebound's weapon than the gold hoard. The gold is a prerequisite that doesn't even need to be on the same plane for the user to employ the magic, and functions only as a crude power potential limit.

I could see any number of annoying limitations being built in by the DM, like forcing Mary to assist Joon in appeasing his goldbug, or her effective hoard limit being half as big, but requiring her to have her own hoard would be effectively impossible since it would turn her and Joon against each other. The spirit of synergy should allow a hitchhike.
