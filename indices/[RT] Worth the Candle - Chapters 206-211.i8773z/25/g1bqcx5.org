When you constantly talk shit about Reimer munchkining things during sessions you deserve to get hit when you try to do the same. I'm honestly surprised he didn't see the exclusion coming and stopped himself when Mary brought it up.

I'm curious to see where it goes from here, since Essentialism has been what allowed him to survive going from one situation to a worse one for a while now.
