It's not clear that the location has to be where the exclusion actually happened, and we have no particularly good reason for Illusion beyond theories about deception and thematically matching the fake dream skewered. But there are also already other mini-soul magic exclusions for individual aspects of it, i.e. we already know that Manifest's exclusion likely had something to do with soul magic.

Also, it'd be kind of silly to take away what was basically an overpowered hammer, just to let him find some trove where he can use it to fully reoptimized, respec his character sheet to get rid of the "new" dump skills (i.e. gold magic, eventually), etc. It might be cool if it was some middle of nowhere place, though, if it allows him to do something like yolo with Analysis or Engineering to produce plans/create something that he or Mary can execute on afterwards, rather than combat skills in the moment.
