If you go on places like [[/r/shitlibertarianssay]] and look at the absolute worst, you can find people advocating for no child labor laws and no age of consent laws or lower age of consent and the right for people to sell themselves into slavery, so I don't think the author was short of real world examples on how to make Captain Blue in the Bottle horrifying and I don't think it's unbelievable...
