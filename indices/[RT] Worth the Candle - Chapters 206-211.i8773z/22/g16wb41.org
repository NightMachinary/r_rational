I just realized how underleveled Raven is. She's less the the Doe.

Also, I really want to see more with the Doe. That relationship just seems to have the potential of being one of the most positive ones, with Jun learning how to stop finding flaws in what he does. I'm definitely worried and paranoid about Solace, though.

And fuck gold magic. It definitely represents abuse, negative thoughts, paranoia, sunk costs, and so on. I really hope he drops it soon, otherwise it looks like he's going to go into a downhill spiral (unlike last chapter set, which ended on a very positive note). I'm very worried about how his gold shit ended this chapter.

Moon society by elves feels like the schloss stuff, where something appears with no prior evidence of its existence through reality bending. I don't remember anything about it at all.

And fuck it's really bad that Essentialism got excluded. In the middle of it too. The DM really is a bitch.

This chapter set just ended on such and downward spiral. And it's insane that Alex was able to come up with the depths of depravity that Captain Blue does. The elevator scene was pretty funny though.

Finally happy to have another chapter set, though I'm sad it'll probably be a while until we get the next.
