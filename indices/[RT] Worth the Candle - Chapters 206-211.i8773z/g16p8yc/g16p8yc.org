Still reading but: they're sitting there talking about how the end game is getting past Fel Seed and getting to Arthur, and learning lessons about redeeming terrible people isn't useful, and... it's never been more obvious that Arthur is Fel Seed, and the /actual/ endgame is deciding whether he's redeemable despite all the terrible things he's done.
