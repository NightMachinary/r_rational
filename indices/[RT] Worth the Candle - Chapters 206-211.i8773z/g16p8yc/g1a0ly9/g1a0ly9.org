I concur, but I keep on thinking of the part in HPMOR where Harry tells Hermione Draco is a product of his environment. People are weak and flawed, and it doesn't take a particularly bad person to double down like Captain Blue. I mean, look at the world around us. Billionaires are essentially shitty dragons, and everyone in the world uses smartphones and eats chocolate even though you can't get either one without slave labour.
