We saw Celestar counted as separate from Aerb in some ways for the purpose of the teleportation key (to lock it off). But I don't think it's impossible that another tool like Star Magic or Engineering will let them reach Celestar. And while the game is happy to lock away a quest permanently, Finger of the Sun as part of the 13 Horrors quests might involve a return there.
