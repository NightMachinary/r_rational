I have an Idea what the Celestar Apocalypse was.

The "singularity" obsessed elves managed to build a perfect garden. Not: "Perfect according to Elf Standards". Actually perfect. They then discovered that the contrast between the garden and their own, by comparison, imperfect selves was intolerable. They could not bring themselves to /unmake/ the garden, either, so they all left so they could stop thinking about it.

And any young elf who takes up gardening gets very frosty stares until they give up on that idea.

So why do all those expeditions disappear? Because nobody who is not an elf can bring themselves to leave. Or bring themselves to tell the world, since it becoming a tourist destination would obviously damage it. So all the space travelers who get there defect and stay.
