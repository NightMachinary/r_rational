  Appreciate that AW has the balls to talk shit about his own magic system in-story.

Emphasis to the "in-story" part of that though. Juniper is not omniscient, and while to him Gold Magic's abilities might be poorly connected to its requirements, it seems highly likely (at the very least at the Doylist level) that gold magic's actual ability is "go hand-to-hand against a Dragon matching its strengths " - in which case the requirement "have a large hoard of gold" makes a whole lot of sense.
