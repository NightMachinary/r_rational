I enjoyed these chapters a lot. They definitely had a bit more of a bite to them than the last batch, but that's not bad.

There were some great costs to the battle, but probably the thing that has me most on edge are some of the character relationships. The last conversation with Raven didn't end great, and the batch ends on the note that most of the characters didn't have much to contribute in the dragon fight. And the solace thing, wow, I have no idea what to make of that.

(Incidentally, the fights where everybody is contributing are tons of fun, so I do hope we still get more of those. Still waiting for a Juniper/Raven team-up.)

We also end on the note of this 'call of the gold', although it's unclear that Juniper will be able to hold onto gold magic much longer no matter what he does, and he can always just choose to lose the power. But somehow, I suspect the world will set things up so that it always seems tempting to keep it going just a little while longer.

Essentialism is gone, and that was a huge driver of the story for a lot of it, but I think it's great that we'll get to focus on some other things.

- I like that AW isn't afraid to have "numbers go down" (i.e., take major OP powers away).
- I wonder if they'll be able to find the location it's excluded to? If so, they'll get some limited use out of it back. But it might be more interesting if they can't.
- Soul magic is so uncommon, that there probably won't be a lot of knock-on effects. Although, tattoo magic supposedly had a lot of knock-on effects, but our cast actually hasn't really had to deal with them (kind of disappointing, now that I think about it).
- And honestly, it makes a lot of sense if AW's/DM's plan is to force Juniper to blow through some OP powerset when it becomes absolutely necessary, then make him pick something different for the next one.

Never imagined this would be the reason they go to Celestar. I did like the explanation for why all their stuff survived catastrophe.

Tommul attacking out of nowhere and causing the exclusion to happen earlier was an absolutely hilarious move.

Appreciate that AW has the balls to talk shit about his own magic system in-story. (TBH, I'd sort of thought the same thing about gold magic myself.)

The elevator monologue was funny for some reason. The scene setting was good (I dunno, just the image of them standing there going down listening to this super-monologuey monologue was great) and their interjections were funny too.

I love the idea of them prepping for some big zombie fight and then finding they have to deal with a humanitarian crisis instead. Hope we get more of it in the coming chapters.
