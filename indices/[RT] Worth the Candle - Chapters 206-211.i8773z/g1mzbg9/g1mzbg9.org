I don't care what all the detractors say. I loved this set of chapters. Maybe I'm a weird person, but I love it when stories are realistic. All of these, from Blue in the Bottle's self-rationalization (which so closely mirrors some of the worst people I know in real life), the dragon's escalation (which seems to be an allegory of how the rich elite in the world react to threats to their power), the logical extremes of soul magic seemingly reflecting current ethical discussions of AI...it gave me the shivers.

Also Alexander, it sucks that covid has been bad for you. Honestly, it makes me really grateful I'm just a PR of the US and can move back to my home country anytime. I fully 100% believe that a collapse within the next 20 years is imminent.

I've always been an extremely cynical person, both of people and governments. I really hate stories that are too idealistic especially when it doesn't make any sense/doesn't reflect reality at the least. I really appreciate the opposite, writing coming from a deep understanding of human nature, and it's one of the reasons why this is my favorite story.

Unpopular opinion: Escaphism was fucking overpowered and I'm glad it got excluded.
