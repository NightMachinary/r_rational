Maybe I am just speaking from the benefit of hinsight but it seems insanely risky of Perislev to put herself in a can't-be-allowed-to-live position by attacking Juniper. She apparently believes in the power of stories and think world narrative is currently resolving around Juniper, which makes him potentially a Uther level combatant. Why would you put yourself in the path of someone like that? What did she think letting Juniper live would lead to? I feel like I'm missing a lot of information on her motivation.

Like, it's one thing for uninformed people to want Juniper dead at this point, he's basically causing exclusions left and right, but she seemed well informed of his power potential.
