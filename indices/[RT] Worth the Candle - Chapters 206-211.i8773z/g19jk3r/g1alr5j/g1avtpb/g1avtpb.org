Joon should be stat capped for most relevant combat skills which is due to his level, because skills are locked to 3xPrimary or 5xSecondary stats.

If Joon was going all-in onto a grouped stats like phys, level 18 would get him to 22 in a group of 3 stats (40pts counting IIRC a +2 stat point boon he got, which would leave all other stats at 2 except luck at 0). Assuming he managed to get stats that all had both primaries and secondaries in the same stat group, he'd be capped at 66 for any of those.

If Joon were to dump all stat points into a single stat then try to pump up the secondary stat to match, he could reach 27/17 in a single primary/secondary stat, which would only let him get up to 81 in a single skill.

In comparison, Onion was at least level 100 in Parry and One-Handed (which are SPD and POW primaries respectively). If Juniper wanted to copy Onion's build and exclusively rush to just Parry and One Handed, he'd have to be level 41 at the /minimum/ and Joon speculates that his skill is even higher than that. At the very minimum, Onion is over double Joon's current level and was probably closer to 3x his level at the time of the fight.

I don't think any level of optimization would help Joon overcome these challenges aside from exploits (which get excluded).
