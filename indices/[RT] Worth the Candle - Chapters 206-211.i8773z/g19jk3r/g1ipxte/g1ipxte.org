"Plot armor" is common in action stories - if a situation is a credible threat, there's more than a 1% chance of death. After even a handful of encounters survival is improbable.

At least there's a feasible excuse here, it's explicitly a computer simulation. It's obvious that rolls are fudged and encounters rolled back, they even muse about it very often. ("Could Uther lose?" Which has been very clearly a very big "NO. But he can be stuck in limbo because he forgot to cap Woodworking like some kind of absolute moron.")

Even if June dies, he gets to have power fantasy adventures... in hell! He can't randomly get eaten by Fel Seed and a GAME OVER is the final ending of this story, that's not a way power fantasies can end.
