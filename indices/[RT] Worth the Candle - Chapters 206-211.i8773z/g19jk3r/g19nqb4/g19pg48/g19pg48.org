A DM can put a party up against an insurmountably more powerful foe once or twice and expect them not to fight. A DM can't reasonably run a 6 month campaign where there is nothing but insurmountable foes and expect the party to never fight if the majority of their skills are combat. And most of those were forced moves or had reasonable expectations of combat. You flip a coin 10 times, it's going to come up heads at least once, and in these cases heads was always "Joon needs to cheat or there's a total party wipe."

Keep in mind that the party /didn't/ fight more than half of the insurmountable combat encounters: 2xDragons the first time, the army of Doris Finch, Blood God Doris, or the millions of Blue's zombies. That is much more pacifist than I'd expect any tabletop group to be.

Hell, take /this chapter's encounter/. Perisev waited at the exit of the dungeon when she attacked the party. If the DM was pulling the levers, then it was his decision to make when he had a dragon start an impossible combat. It's not like the party ran at her swinging swords. Then when they were busy /not/ fighting the dragon, their travel was interrupted with a different dragon. If there's any DM hand in these events, it's pushing them into these encounters well above their level.
