Well I feel personally attacked right now, because "avoiding combat" and "introducing insurmountable threats you don't expect the party to face" are both things that I do in my (generally well-received) DnD campaign. That being said: if they had been sufficiently afraid of Perisev they could have killed Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle like she demanded they do. Instead they were willing to deny her, to her face, because they thought they could beat her. Same with Onion, in-fact: Joon demanded a trial by combat, despite knowing Onion's reputation, because he thought he could beat anyone they put him up against. It's not the DM's fault that Joon is confident.

Plus, for a lot of those encounters, they didn't need "bag of holding in a portable hole ICBM" solutions. They did for Mome Rath, Onion, and Tommul, although it's uncertain what other options they had, since they just jumped to these incredibly powerful methods because they knew they could do them. But they otherwise used things like Spirit, Gold Magic, void, and warding.

Hell, take /this chapter's encounter/. They used a bullshit solution to try to deal with Perisev and it didn't work, and then they resorted to using the Egress despite knowing they had the dragons' attention and that it would likely attract attention, forcing them to waste Scaphism and Meta Stilling on Tommul---this honestly seems deliberate on the DM's part. Then for Perisev, Joon used Gold Magic and void bombs, two of the earliest things introduced in the story, which he could have done from the beginning instead of having to resort to exclusion-worthy tactics.
