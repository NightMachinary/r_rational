Joon is a Vibration Mage who habitually stops anyone but who he's talking to from hearing his conversations, so "earshot" doesn't matter. Also Grak set up a ward against Necromancy around Elisha before going back up to the surface, so it /especially/ doesn't matter. Agreeing to kill him doesn't end the way you're saying it would.

Edit: Also I do feel the need to point out that you've repeatedly referred to these scenarios as "impossible" or "insurmountable" when they've won every single time, often without significant losses, so maybe change your perception of these events?
