  Joon demanded a trial by combat, despite knowing Onion's reputation, because he thought he could beat anyone they put him up against.

What do you actually suggest Joon should have done otherwise with Onion?\\
Onion is a person with a reputation for killing people and he'd just broken a truce at a neutral meeting to drug/rob/torture/imprison Juniper and then told Juniper that he'd murder him and flay him alive. Juniper could either challenge him to a duel, get captured by the baliffs, or have him and all party members become outlaws chased by Anglecynn. With /any/ of those options Juniper would have to face just as hard or harder odds.

Either the DM didn't set it up. Or he did set it up and gave the players nothing but bad options and then punished them for choosing Bad Option A instead of equally Bad Option B or C, which is bad DMing.

  Instead they were willing to deny her, to her face, because they thought they could beat her.

No, they were still talking when she decided to get unreasonable and go for combat.

Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is himself a high level threat with millions of zombies. In some alternate world where Joon agrees to Perisev right there /within earshot of the zombies/, we just get to have this conversation again about them being against imbalanced impossible combat except this time it's dealing with millions of zombies.

(And notably, we should assume that antagonists aren't stupid. Perisev went and got support from the other dragon because she's not stupid. Captain Blue had one of his literally millions of followers free him because he's not stupid.

And no, /I can't know for sure/ that multi-billionaire genius Captain Blue had a contigency plan. But in an alternate world, we'd be arguing that Joon shouldn't have fought 10 million zombies and should have just talked to Perisev and /we can't know for sure/ that she would have cut off diplomacy and attacked.)

Situations are occurring where there is no option except for combat into impossible scenarios. That is either a bad DM or the DM isn't setting up situations anymore.
