I've recently been dissatisfied with the story because it has gotten sloppy about how narrative is applied and is mixing it into the writing directly. There used to be three layers going on:

1. The physical reality of the physical world of Aerb
2. What the DM is weaving on a narrative sense
3. What is actually going on when Joon takes action in the world (the written story we all read)

It feels like the story is breaking down between layer 2&3 and being written as if there is no longer a distinction. The DM can control the setting, but he is not controlling if Joon decides to pick up a void pistol and blow his brains out, however the story is being written /as if the DM is controlling that/.

There's been half a dozen bullshit encounters against insurmountable combat threats in a row: Mome, Captured, Onion, Shia, Doris, Blood God Doris, a million zombies, and 2xDragons. The author knows that Joon will be fine at the end of the fights because he's writing it. Joon will do whatever he can to survive. But the DM isn't acting rationally because it's nonsense to expect the players to invent a new 'bag of holding in a portable hole ICBM' and then keep doing that five times in a row. It's even more nonsense to punish them for it when you planned it in the first place.

What was the DMs intended resolution having two dragons attack Joon? Did he plan for Joon to invent some new bullshit and get excluded? Did he not plan and just assume Joon would die? Or was he not involved at all?

I'm trying to give the story the benefit of the doubt, and the only sensible conclusion that I can come up with is that layer 2 is now gone. The DM isn't scaling encounters because he's not there; fights are going off the rails because dominos he set up a while ago are now colliding in imbalanced ways without him there to nudge things or are part of the setting of the world (eg exclusions). Hence a dragon cutting off diplomacy and going bloodlusted when there is zero way for the party to fairly defeat her.

If that's the case though, it's frustrating because Joon doesn't even bring up the possibility (eg layer 1 is disconnected). If the world is running on a new paradigm that's DM-less or at least functionally so, then Joon needs to adapt. If encounters aren't being scaled to difficulty anymore then Joon needs to go grind on skeletons or something* until he's not needing to risk party wipes and exclusions every single encounter. It's not something he'd allow if he were DM'ing but either he's not DM'ing anymore or he's DM'ing badly and that layer of the story no longer makes sense.

*hell, go be sky pirates if there's no DM.
