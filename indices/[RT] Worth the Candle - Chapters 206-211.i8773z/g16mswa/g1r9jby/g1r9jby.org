Your life and your happiness, that of your child, and your family are much more important that this webnovel.

I've been rereading and I'd say I've caught so many bits of foreshadowing, so many beautiful details.

If nothing else, you taking the time off you need will be a long term good, when we look at your lifetime wordcount.
