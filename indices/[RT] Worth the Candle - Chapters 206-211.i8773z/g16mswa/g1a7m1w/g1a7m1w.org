Since reading that "Aerb is shaped like a hexagon" is part of the world's common knowledge something has been tickling me. This link prompted me to finally sit down and work through it.

A plane tiled by a hexagon is /also/ tiled by a rectangle, so this fact about Aerb is more of a statement about the conventions of the inhabitants than a statement about geometry. (Barring some extra in-world demarcation of the boundaries).

The following rectangle (in hex coordinates) will do: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0, 0.5, -0.5), (1, 0.5, -0.5). However, it's still not the same as an ordinary grid.

More generally, there are 17 ways to tesselate the plane, each of which has a corresponding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#The_seventeen_groups][wallpaper group]]. Aerb's tessellation corresponds to the group p1.

Tessellations of this type are characterized by a pair of translation vectors. For the ordinary grid the vectors are equal length and perpendicular to each other, so we can draw a map on a square and the edge will line up. With Aerb it wouldn't - the translations are offset by thirty degrees. To tile the plane using our rectangle we'd need to shift rows over in a brick wall pattern.

But a parallelogram doesn't have that problem. A parallelogram aligned with the translation vectors would tile the plane cleanly.
