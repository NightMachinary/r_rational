Note: this is actually 206-212, for whatever reason, the chapter didn't publish with the others the first time, but should be there now.

My apologies for the enormous gap between chapters, I'll just repost [[https://www.patreon.com/posts/worth-candle-ch-40329999][what I've said about in on Patreon]], and thank you for your patience (or at least not being too vocal about your impatience).

  I was going to write a whole big thing here about why writing is slow, and what's been going on in my life, but ... it would probably suffice to say that I have a small child who I'm the primary caretaker for, and the unexpected appearance of the coronavirus in my life has meant that he's no longer going to preschool, and we're being more cautious with his grandparents, and it's causing a lot of anxiety, which inevitably leads to depression. I live in the United States, and have been waiting and watching the numbers go up since early on, when a friend on Facebook who live in Wuhan began talking about what was happening there.

  Similarly, I live in Minnesota, and have spent a fair amount of time in the Twin Cities for one reason or another, with a lot of friends and family there, and the protests, and riots ... the world is feeling particularly oppressive at the moment, and the coming American election has me expecting the worst and wishing that I lived in less interesting times, or at least in a less interesting country.

  So writing has been slow. I've been anxious and depressed. The days have been blurring together, and I'm putting a lot of my little remaining willpower into being a good father and a good husband. I sit down in front of the computer to write, and get a couple sentences in before my mind wanders, or I get depressed by the stuff that I'm writing on top of where my mind has been. I took an internet sabbatical, but that didn't really help much.

  (I want to say that the last week or so has been better, but it's really just been more focused anger than anxiety, which is a step up, but not exactly healthy.)

  Anyway, that's the abridged version, I'm sure you have your own travails, and hope you're well. Thanks for the support.
