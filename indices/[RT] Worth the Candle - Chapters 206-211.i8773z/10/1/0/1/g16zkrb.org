A running theme of level 100 skills seems to be that they make the skill apply to more---throw anything, still game elements, parry stuff with two degrees of reasonableness, no dodge is impossible, etc.. Given that, there's a decent chance that the level 100 virtue for romance is "Romance anything". Also since we already know Woodworking 100 is "Make anything out of wood" (per Aerb!Reimer), I can see that being broken.
