I kind of like your theory because of endgame abilities with Woodworking, which we know is broken. But he also had something like 12 weapon skills at the start. Obviously some like unarmed and the handed skills or thrown weapons are great, but having pistols, shotguns, bows, and rifles at the same time seems way too unwieldy.
