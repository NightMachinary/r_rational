I mean Skin Magic had to be combined with Essentialism and Still Magic to be excluded, so I'm assuming a number of exclusions are from combinations of things, and 40 is the maximum limit of these that could occur, with overlap between meaning a sub-optimal order of causing exclusions would make it impossible to "achieve" 40/40. If Essentialism was excluded before Skin Magic, the reasons for Skin Magic being excluded wouldn't have occurred (although the DM likely knows many ways to skin a cat and all that, so Skin Magic could have been excluded through other ways, but I doubt all 40 possible exclusions have multiple, non-overlapping ways to themselves to occur).
