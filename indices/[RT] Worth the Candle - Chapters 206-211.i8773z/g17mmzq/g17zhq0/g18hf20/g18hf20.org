... That is a pretty big chunk of text for me to have missed. Oh well.

I am still presuming Blue was playing for time to sell every soul not in their immediate vicinity down the river - If he is willing to sell souls to hell to get food supplies to raise more kids to sell to hell, he is certainly willing to make the standard bargain of selling souls for a nicer afterlife for him personally.

Which means, next up the war with hell, since having a couple of million souls there due to events he kicked off will be a lot more salient to juniper than the uncounted billions already suffering.
