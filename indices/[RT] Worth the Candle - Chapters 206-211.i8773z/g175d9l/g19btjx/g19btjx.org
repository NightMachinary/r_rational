Amaryllis, particular, doesn't have a lot of room to critique Blue for this particular crime. Her 'every new-generation Tuung stepped forward to volunteer' (because I, who control their upbringing, taught them they should) is his 'every zombie gave me their consent' (when they were eight, and had spent their whole life being told they should).
