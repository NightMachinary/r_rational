So I've had some big picture thoughts after rereading portions and rereading old comments, a few of them are actually pretty relevant to these new chapters. There are some interesting ideas in old comments that haven't been discussed much yet...

- So Uther's knight are all twist on characters that his friends had role played. What if Fel is Seed meant to be Juniper's character? Like is Uther went on a quest to find/meet Juniper and met Fel Seed in a horrifying display of DM sadism?

- Uther's experience with meta-narrative seems different than Juniper's. Juniper assumes his is correct since he met the DM but what if there is some broader meta-phenomena driving it? Like if “narrative” is actually a unique pseudo-magic that got concentrated in Uther (possibly by Vervain?) and personified by the Juniper in the form of a DM (kindred souls)? The conversation with Perisev fits this theory pretty well. It seem like Amaryllis and other interested in Uther would have considered this possibility but if it was subtle and ineffable and spread out before Uther maybe they missed it. In this case, the climax with meeting Uther is going to be some very reasoning on what the meta rule about the narrative actually is.

- Related theory to the above two... Fel Seed is a result or an element of Uther's attempt at meta-narrative manipulation, perhaps to stop the heightening escalation, or to create a story that traps him and draws up a new protagonist (to meet Juniper?), or some other purpose....

- This chapter added some more fuel to the Solace DMPC fire. I'm hoping it's just resentment over being coped up a bottle for centuries.

And some thoughts on these latest chapters:

- Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is horrible, but not implausibly so... I'm reminded of the absolute worst of the most extreme “libertarian” thought that engages in apologia for child labor and selling yourself into slavery and such.

- Amaryllis's religious studies are surprisingly accurate in predicting the DM. I would go so far as to count this toward evidence that the DM and meta-narrative aren't quite what Juniper thinks they are.

- Once Juniper naturally levels soul Scaphism, all sorts of degenerate abuse would be possible with a good logistical system to collect souls. So the exclusion isn't too unreasonable (especially if the DM only excluded soul Scaphism). But excluding all of soul magic seems excessive. Furthermore people will notice Juniper is now involved in 2 exclusions leading to problems. But the zone might not be on Poran since they couldn't get into their souls while there.

- How does the DM expect them to win these ridiculously high level fights without abusing the system? It seems like evidence against Junipers conception of the DM and more in favor of Uther's perception.

- I am sure there won't be any large scale consequences for devastating Celestar... (I bet Elves will notice even from Aerb).
