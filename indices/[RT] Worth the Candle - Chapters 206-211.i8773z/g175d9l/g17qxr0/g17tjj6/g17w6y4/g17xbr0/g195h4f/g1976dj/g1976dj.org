But they do have the antimatter exploit that Amaryllis figured out in the library timeline and presumably figured out again since it is mentioned as an option. (Juniper mentions “an unused rune magic exploit” in chapter 212). So if the DM/meta-narrative follows the pattern with Skin Magic and Soul magic, Juniper might get away with using the Rune Magic exploit once or twice or maybe even 3 times (Juniper made major skill sacrifices 4 times before Soul Magic was excluded) but it will end up getting excluded eventually if it works well and can be optimized.
