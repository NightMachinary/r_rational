Thank you for your sacrifice; I know how difficult it is to be swimming in some of these darker themes, especially when it feels like they're being reflected /everywhere/ IRL right now.

And also, these chapters are exactly what I needed to read. It's comforting that someone else is seeing the same shit mountain that I see. It makes me feel like I can keep shoveling.
