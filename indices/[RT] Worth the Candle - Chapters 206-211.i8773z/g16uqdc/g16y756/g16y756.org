I think that's fair. Part of the problem might be that they're coming from a place of anxiety and depression, during a period of time when that's not really what a lot of people are looking for. The lessons and themes of this part of the story kind of need that though, and I hope that when the whole work is done, people will at least see the point of it, or be able to take interesting interpretations from it.

(It might also just be that my brain is currently compromised, and that detachment of depression is leaking through. I guess we'll see.)
