I think that authors posting serials online are in an interesting position re: reader feedback, and I'd caution you (particularly given how you've said you're feeling) from taking any particular criticism too much to heart. There will always be someone who feels a particular chapter or decision or what not is worse than some other part of the story or some preference or prediction the reader had. And those holding that view are more likely to express it here than the silent crowd engaged with the story. But in this case I'd note there's a large, interested crowd with positive things to say about these chapters.
