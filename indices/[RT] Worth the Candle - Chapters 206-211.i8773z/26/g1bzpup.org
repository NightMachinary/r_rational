This is beautifully written, but i think I have to get off the WtC train until its completely done. The feeling of growing unpleasantness of the setting, the fact that nothing unequivocally /good/ can happen, it all reminds me of Worm and why I ultimately put it down.

It's a beautiful story with amazing world building, but I just can't keep reading it. I no longer buy that there's a positive medium term payoff to the emotional gut punches that keep coming.
