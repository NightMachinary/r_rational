Really enjoyed this set of chapters.

This batch made me adjust upwards some of my ideas about how significant it is that Juniper's relevance to the party is very much mediated by the fact that he's the source of ungodly supernatural power.

For Amy in particular, first and foremost, Juniper matters because he's a 'lever by which the world can be moved'. Enjoying her relationship with him to the extent that she does is secondary to the extent that it isn't helping her to utilize him as a lever to move the world, which is her ultimate priority. I choose to believe her when she said she would 'smash his head in with a hammer' to keep her world alive, and her loyalty to him is contingent on that being what helps her to keep her world alive.

What I'm saying is, Juniper really is to a large extent merely the conduit for the power that he represents. What this means though, is that if she thinks that acting at cross purposes to Juniper is worth it to achieve what truly matters to her, she will do it. And Juniper, for all the power he has amassed, has a big SOC shaped hole by which he can be manipulated and deceived. I don't think his party is above taking advantage of that, and the more WTC I read the more I get the sense that there is a lot of it being gestured at, in big ways and small. Maybe I'm reading too much into the significant looks that party members give to each other in the text and other hints of that kind, but while Juniper is playing his game, the others are occupied more than anything with simply trying to keep a handle on him and best nudge him in their preferred direction, something that only becomes more true the more powerful he gets individually and the more unilateral control he gets.

hashed predictions based on this batch:
