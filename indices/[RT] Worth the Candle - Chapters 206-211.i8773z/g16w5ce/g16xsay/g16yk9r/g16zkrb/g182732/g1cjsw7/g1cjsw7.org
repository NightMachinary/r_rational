I've been holding onto a parody/fanfic thing around this for /ages/. How the true meaning behind the (7 member group that has an elvish name) is they're all things Joon needs to learn to bang but is too repressed to do. Something something the monster at Li'o is a metaphor for the one night stand (countless limbs in weird positions, people who leave have complete amnesia afterwards regardless of prior promises to call, the fact that Joon defeats it with a combination of "/bone/ magic and a *giant throbbing blood spear*". Also something about how it's summoned by wailing/screaming).

Also other stuff that I probably should have written down. Oh, right: this is what Fel Seed's " you know his weakness" comment means - said weakness is /a good rodgering/, but Joon is just too repressed to acknowledge it, which is why it confuses him Something something harem made up of a perfect waifu, a character whose main specialty is barriers and who is /totally/ female -honest! - whose race is universally related to the concept of /"beard"/, a harem member that's literally a house ("kinky!" comment here), fucking a deer something something, Raven is an old flame, something something something.

If I were going to edit this into something readable I would have done it months ago, so fuck it. Also it's 3AM.

Edit: also, on a /meta/ level the hidden theme is that [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] is offering threesomes as a Patreon reward.
