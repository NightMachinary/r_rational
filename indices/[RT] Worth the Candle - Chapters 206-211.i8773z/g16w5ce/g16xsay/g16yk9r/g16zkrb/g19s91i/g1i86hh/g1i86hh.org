I know it's just a jest, but the gang seriously has some brain disease that doesn't allow them to understand what the word "anything" means. Whittle a little command center that interfaces with the control system of the simulation they're in, whittle a little key that gives him admin rights, log in and remove the other guy's admin rights, presto you're God! Could have been done months ago.

The DM is sitting up there, shaking his head going "What's taking him so long? I had Reimer give him the answer..."

(I know it's "so the story can happen" and every skill gets its chance to shine in the spotlight. At least it's not as glaring as when June finished a quest and leveled up when he was trying to fix the problem of being an exp hungry psychopath... My ears would still melt off being told I could make "anything" and make it my #1 priority immediately.)

(I think that's the true final message of Worth the Candle. It isn't about wrestling with the demons you create and doing your best to be a slightly less shitty person, it's about "When someone uses the word 'anything', you listen!")
