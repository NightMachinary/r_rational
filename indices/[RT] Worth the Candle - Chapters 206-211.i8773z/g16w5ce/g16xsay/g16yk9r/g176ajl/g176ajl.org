I've had the theory that the original character sheet was set by Aerb!Juniper or Earth Juniper but just memories were erased and that it was originally optimized towards several very powerful endgames. I would bet level 100 Woodworking possibly as a combo virtue with smithing, engineering, or alchemy enables at will creation of Entads or recreation of existing Entads.
