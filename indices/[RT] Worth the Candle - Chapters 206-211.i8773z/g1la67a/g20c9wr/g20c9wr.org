Another way to see it is that the game wants him to learn multiple routes to power instead of finding one trick that seems to always work and only using that. Being a one-trick pony is great up until your trick doesn't work. So, the game lets him have fun with a trick for a while, explore all of its parameters and consider all the ways to munchkin it, then excludes it so he has to keep his thinking skills sharp.
