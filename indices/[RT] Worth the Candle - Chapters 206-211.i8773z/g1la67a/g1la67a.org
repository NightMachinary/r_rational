Powers getting excluded as soon as he figures them out seems like really shitty design, given that the entire premise of the game is that he can become a God in the end. The conceit expressly asks him to seek power, then punishes him for gaining it.

What I think this means is that rushing the power seeking isn't really the path forward. There's also a social and personal growth element he has to go through. Each companion and arc helps him confront some of his own flaws and hangups, making him a better person the hard way (as opposed to essentialism) and he has to make his way through these stories to reach his ultimate goal of absolution, maturity, and paradise.

Just like how the game twisted itself to give him ! multiple ways to meet amaryllis at the start, even if he gained the power to defeat fel seed early and dove down that hole, it would turn up empty of he hadn't completed his personal growth arc.

With this meta narrative in mind, his approach should really be pumping Social and improving his self awareness & maturity, and pursuing the companion story arcs.
