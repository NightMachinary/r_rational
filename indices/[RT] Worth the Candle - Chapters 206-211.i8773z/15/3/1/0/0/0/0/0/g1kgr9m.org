Not really I posted it elsewhere about the character.

He is justified in thinking he is one of the most moral people on earth because the vast majority of people would have sacrificed their morality to profit instead of bothering with the billions or even trillions of £€$ he's spending on being moral. No other company in existence has gone to this lengths even back in child labour or slave labour days.

That is to say his studies on conceptualizing decisions at 8 year olds must be very convincing otherwise he would have made it way younger like at object recognition stages or something.
