Hmm, Leopold is a good example - especially as he didn't seem to have a grand vision, was reasonably secure in his position and just wanted money. And I agree that his actions were comparable to Blue's.

I guess selfish billionaire/dictator rationalising his actions makes the most sense for explaining Blue's behaviour.
