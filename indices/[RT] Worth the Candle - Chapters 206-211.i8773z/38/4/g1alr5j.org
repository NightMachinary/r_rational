Joon is a level 19 adventurer at this point. By D&D standards, he /should/ be facing off against threats that are basically unrealistically powerful. The problem is at least partially how poor his build is - if he actually had a good build, focused on a single stat or having brought a single skill up to max, he would be fine. Even better if it's pseudomagic like Bladebound or something meme-y like Woodworking, which he got rid of. It's a modern RPG, there's no grinding needed, but you still need to stick to your build, not go for a Wizard/Fighter mix with two levels in Rogue and expect to perform to the same level of combat in a game that's intended to be 'hard'/is scaled around your munchkining.

If he was a bladebound and focused purely on bladebound abilities and the related physical abilities, he could feasibly have been at Onion's level in a one-on-one fight by the time he reached Onion. Onion was at least partially bad luck/limitations and a forced chance to test physical combat, because Joon's build has otherwise gone fairly heavily into the magic route, but even with his 100x learning speed or whatever, time that he spent taking water magic to level 20 could've gotten Vibrational or Still magic up an extra ~5-10 levels for a permanent virtue. Ink Magic is probably up to ~30+ at this point and has had a couple nice knicknacks but mostly duds, but maybe that'll turn around in the future.

I think Soul Magic exclusion helps. He was 100% abusing it and he certainly got to have his fun with it before it was slapped down. The single other earlygame OP tool that's still being overused to this point is the unicorn bone. I almost feel as though if he achieved Meta-stilling 'normally' at skill level 100 (which has been the driving force behind both exclusions), with Scaphism normally at skill level 80 or Kenner's Eye through his own work on Tattoo magic and Art, they wouldn't have been excluded.

Also, at the end of the day, he did bust out Gold Magic and has at least ~two other OP options to use (Runes, other memetics), plus the power of friendship (aka Blood God Doris or Bethel). I'm really thinking that messing with rune exploits will cause an exclusion, which then means being forced to tackle the hells. He'll also be "allowed" to use Gold Magic at least once more, and there are a host of other magic abilities to pickup or treasure troves to find through his existing quests. He could choose to stock up on other creative options- not that Soul Magic was bad, but I felt it was at the point of overstaying its welcome considering how OP it was and how it felt like it was able to solve basically any situation. And he didn't even use his companions in this fight, so anything that used them would've been a fair expectation from the DM. Most PCs don't solo a dragon at their level, they do it in a party or 4-6 adventurers.

Finally, it was their choice to oppose Perisev, and it shouldn't have been a surprise that they'd need to consider going up against a dragon and prepare the necessary tools or resources.
