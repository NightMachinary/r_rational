Was Onion lvl 100 in parry or one-handed? I didn't think he needed either to be that high for his combat feats against Joon. He for sure had grandmaster bladebound as a perk, but it's unclear if you need lvl 100 one-handed for that or not. The only indication that he had 100 one hadned was when he was fighting while not registering his injuries, which I could see being done without the perk.

  I was a better swordsman than Onion. I'd known, going in, that would probably be the case, since if we were evenly matched, then my advantage would be sky-high skills, and his would be high attributes.
