Of the examples you provided I think only Mome Rath is a good example of what you're talking about. In every other circumstance he either had another option that didn't end with fighting but avoided it because he was fairly confident he would win, didn't actually have to fight and so didn't have to pull any bullshit solutions, or went with a bullshit solution instead of just calling in Bethel and Valencia (or Blood God Doris). Mome Rath was the only unavoidable, insurmountable combat threat that he didn't have any precedent of being able to beat, and the fact that he got two level ups from killing it implies that it was so beyond his level that even that had another option beyond combat.
