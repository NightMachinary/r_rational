Yeah, I think part of Joon's problem is he doesn't want to behave as if there were things that could threaten his life.

In his negotiations with Perisev, he's basically in the situation of a small island country facing the full might of a US aircraft carrier, with the carrier's admiral telling him "surrender or we'll flatten your island to the ground", and his immediate reaction is to reply "fuck you, you can't tell me what to do!".

The lesson to be learned is not that he should keep finding new bullshit powers as they get excluded, the lesson is that /he can't always solve all his problems with one-sided violence/.
