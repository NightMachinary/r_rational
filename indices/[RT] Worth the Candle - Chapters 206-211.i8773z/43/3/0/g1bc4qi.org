Am I missing all of these flags / hints or something?

I mean I noticed she's different, in a number of ways (Religious because Christianity keeps her sane and it's a fun narrative twist, more intimate because she stopped altering her soul to not love Joon, "sillier" as Joon put it because of clone-lives), but none of them seemed like they were hinting at /Betrayal/.

Do you (or [[/u/GlueBoy]]) have anything specific you can quote that suggests it? Really curious now.
