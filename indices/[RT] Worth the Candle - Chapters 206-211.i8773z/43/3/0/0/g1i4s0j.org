[[/u/Yuridyssey][u/Yuridyssey]] has a good comment about it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/i8773z/rt_worth_the_candle_chapters_206211/g174cck][here]], in case you missed it.

I'd add on that Amaryllis has been shown to be a supremely rational actor again and again, and a rational person faced with the current stakes *would* hedge their bets, they *would* make contingencies for many possible scenarios, and they would absolutely put the ends above the means. Would she even see it as a betrayal to put the survival of Aerb over that of Juniper?

Finally, the only way to have it happen and not garner the entire readerships eternal hate is by doing a lot of foreshadowing you can point to after the fact, which is what I feel has happened.
