On my recent re-read and now with this batch of chapters I'm getting really weird vibes from Amaryllis. I don't think it makes sense narratively(it would be very dissatisfying) but I can't shake the feeling that there's going to be a big betrayal from her. Also Valencia.

I absolutely adore her as a character but there do seem to be a bunch of flags around her and Val. Am I alone?
