He can't really grind can he? He needs dangerous situations to get the skill level to go up past level 20. Of course, he hasn't tested if expert training will get around this cap. And he assumed the DM/meta-narrative would retaliate or at the very least not reward him if he tried grinding manageable enemies (he thinks this first time he heads out into the datura desert). Of course he hasn't tested that either... maybe he should spend a few days to weeks killing thaum-seekers just in case? And then if the DM doesn't respond with some urgent matter popping up he will know that is a valid strategy.

He also has several quests that will result in more reclaimed Entads (the glass exclusion zone), but a few more Entads isn't enough to beat the kinda of enemies he is regularly up against.
