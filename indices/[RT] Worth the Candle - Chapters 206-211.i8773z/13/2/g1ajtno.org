I hope soul magic is gone gone. They've properly explored the interesting parts of it, now it is standing in the way of the story. It's too big a tool, everything comes back to soul magic at the end of the day. No more sacrifices, no more soulfucking, no more self-edits, and hey...being maimed has long-term consequences again for everyone but Joon.

He just wants new and creative abuses. No one gets mad the first time someone tries to turn a bag of holding inside out, but after that it is tedious.

Spirit magic is still going to allow for some level of munchkinry.
