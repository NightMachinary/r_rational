  How does the DM expect them to win these ridiculously high level fights without abusing the system?

I think it's more about learning how to let go and move on. By procedurally excluding the magics that Juniper learned to break, we get to see a story about a person who perpetually needs to update strategies in order to survive. This seems to be the thesis of WtC, so it makes sense to me that this is the primary motivation of the DM as well.
