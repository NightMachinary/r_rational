I get what you're saying, and I understand that I may be wrong. All the same, I can't help but think that the Essentialism exclusion probably made Aerb better off as a whole. It seems like most of the people we've encountered with soul magic are the exact /wrong/ people we would want to have soul magic, and I'm not sure that a marginal benefit to our protagonist outweighs all of the probable abuse happening behind the scenes. (Especially when Joon ends up being able to solve his problems anyways, just using other means.)

In fact, it seems like a lot of exclusions are put in place solely in order to prevent what might otherwise be major threats to civilization as a whole. The price of survival is letting go of everything that's hinders that survival.

I think there's also an argument here about Joon and Amaryllis using Essentialism as a crutch to solve their relationship issues. I think that they're going to grow more through dealing more directly with their problems. It's like, the world didn't end when Farming magic was excluded. It just meant that people got back to farming.
