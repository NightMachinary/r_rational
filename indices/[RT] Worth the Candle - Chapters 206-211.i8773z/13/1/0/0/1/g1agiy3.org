Its interesting how the only tool the DM seems to use is total Exclusion. I've been in several situations as DM where I gave my players something unintentionally broken, or a set of items with ridiculous munchkin potential. Whenever that happens, I just nerf the specific overpowered interaction, or rework the item to close the loophole.

I can see why retconning would not be a viable tool, as that level of reality changing would really ruin the world, but a targeted nerf doesn't seem that egregious. I guess its used as an anti-munchkin threat, but it doesn't seem to be an effective deterrent in this case. June and Co. now focus on finding a wide spread of exploits, and holding onto them until desperate moments.
