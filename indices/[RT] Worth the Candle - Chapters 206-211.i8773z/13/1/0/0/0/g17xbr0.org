You might be right about the Essentialism exclusion, but I don't think Juniper can count on the next exclusion not being something ultra critical. The tattoo magic exclusion sealed away everything anyone had on a surface sheath and made translation tattoos stop working and numerous other problems. A rune magic exclusion would mean the standard method of bottling souls would stop working and millions would go to the hells.

That is an interesting point about the Essentialism as a relationship crutch. I wonder if that was a major part of the DM's motivtion (similar to how the DM claimed that tattoo magic bored them and wasn't meant for Juniper and the Prince+Kenner's Eye interaction with Still magic was just an excuse).
