Amaryllis mentions that they're done designing a television, and are now working on making content for it. I thought that television was nixed due to the Couch Potato? I remember something about even in the library timeline they gave up on it because there wasn't a safe way of mass producing them - and even if there is a way, that seems like a massive waste of their very limited time and resources. Did I miss a conversation somewhere?
