Oh! Do I have good news for you!

Essentially, look for single origin dark chocolate - these'll be 70%+, and they'll say where in the world the beans came from. No lactose, organic-yadda-yadda (Claudio is reportedly to finnicky about his trees to let ANYONE tell him what to do with them, so he's not /technically/ organic-certified), and you don't get the waxy / bitter you get with, say, dark Lindt. (CC does something extra special so he's got a 100% cacao bar that isn't bitter, which is cray). You definitely do pay a price premium, but damn... I would say definitely worth it.

LMK your location and I can see what I can find near you in the way of best chocolate.

PS - The waxy flavor comes from "soy lecithen", which is used as an emulsifier in most chocolate.

PPS - I have a lot of tricks for finding and identifying best chocolate. In the before times, when travel was a thing, when I'd go to a new city I'd tour best chocolate shops and antique book stores. Not every place has any (didn't find any in Kazakhstan, for instance), but most have /something/.
