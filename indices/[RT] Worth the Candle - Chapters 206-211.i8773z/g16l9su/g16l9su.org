I took notes while doing a reread between the last posted set of chapters and now, and then condensed those notes down at work last night when I noticed the document said this batch was being posted today. Posting these before I read the new batch (which I will do tonight at work); I'll edit this if anything ends up being addressed.

- Random pieces of worldbuilding serve to disguise Chekhov's Guns---any number of things could come back up again, but almost definitely not /everything/. Numerous examples of this throughout the story, but the one that made me think about this was Raven's mention of bloodline attacks, which are excluded, but given how many other excluded magics have been mentioned it's hard to know whether it will be used (like illusion magic) or not used (like frost magic, probably).
- Tree magic doesn't exist. In-universe, Aerb!Joon came up with all of this stuff and put it into a game, and just happened to be surprisingly correct about stuff like Library Magic, Spirit, and the Monk superclass. Tree Magic is something he came up with but didn't use, and it doesn't actually exist. In fact, given the recent mention of Joon making "new magic" like Arthur did, it's possible this is Tree Magic, which would bring up a lot of interesting questions about predestination.
- The number five comes up a lot, with some notable examples being: five dream skewered (other than Arthur and Joon), five gods, five forerunner races (that Raven knows of), and the five rune forges. What if these are all connected? The five gods (Mango, Armada, PPMD, Hungrybox, and Mew2King) are the only remaining members of the five forerunner races (endlings). They created/oversee the rune forges, and in an effort to emulate the DM they also brought people over from Earth to act as their champions (like Arthur), but weren't able to replicate the Knack or any of the game elements.
- Of the Jubjub bird, Pallida said "I'm pretty sure that a five hundred foot tall bird would stick out like a sore thumb." Now I'm really curious where the Jubjub bird is hiding in plain sight, because that's too good a setup, but I can't think of anything that could be it.
- The value of "level up" was lowered too much, and that effects the extent to which Joon is willing to prioritize it, even though leveling up is still really useful. It was said to be lowered to "rock bottom", which implies neutrality/negative feelings towards it, which isn't the best idea. I'm honestly surprised Amaryllis hasn't brought this up already (although it's possible she did off-screen).
- Arthur made the same deal with Perisev that Joon did---stories from Earth, retrieved via an entad, in exchange for increased goodwill on her part. It would explain why she knew Arthur was dream skewered, and her question about whether Joon would use "the same entad that Uther had". Contemplated not including this note since it seems very obvious.
- Amaryllis is going to be turned into a zombie, and she might just die afterward. Her story arc is done, Joon had a conversation with Grak where he was like "I should get over myself and tell her that I love her" which means that definitely won't happen, and the party is now incredibly powerful with all of the items she's providing them. Honestly the smartest thing to do might even be for Joon to respec Charisma and become the face of the party so she can stay somewhere safe and guarantee they keep their items, but that would either fuck with the narrative and the DM would kill her anyways or Mary would /argue/ that's what would happen and they would decide not to do it. This is likely already addressed in the new batch, so edit incoming.
- "She had everything, we had nothing, and she wouldn't share", per Star Doris. While there's a roughly 50% chance that any clone would be descended from either, it's perfectly fitting for Doris that the very first clone she made would have killed the original to get her stuff.
