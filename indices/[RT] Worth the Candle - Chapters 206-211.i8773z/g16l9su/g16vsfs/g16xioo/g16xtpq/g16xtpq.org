A story of a building is typically 10-15 ft, I think. Something like that. And the Jubjub bird is 500 ft tall, so 33-50 stories tall.

What if the Jubjub bird /is/ one of the pillars. What if it's buried beneath the earth, and all the pillars are part of its body? (I can't remember where Jubjub bird is mentioned, nor any other facts about it besides the ones you just said. So I'm just spitting out random connections here.)
