This set of chapters was pretty grim. The disgust of being forced to work with someone morally abhorrent to get the best outcome, the awkward disappointment of messing up that brutal conversation with Raven and the stark reality of “make a heaven for me when you win” from Grak, the unfairness of Perisev forcing a confrontation that costs so much, the fatigue from not wanting to kill the dragons but being forced to because they can't be trusted to keep their word and have high-level worldview and value differences that have resolved into violence against June, the unpleasant manic coercion of gold magic, the gut punch of total Soul Magic Exclusion that robs the party of some serious utility that they've relied upon AND takes away the ability for June and Amy to decide themselves how to work out their relationship's sexuality issue....

Even when interesting stuff like Celestar comes up, the wonder of it is swallowed by the creeping emotional unpleasantness.
