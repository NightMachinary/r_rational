mm, a lot of our fiction sanitizes or outright glorifies violence. It's the weirdest thing to me about humans - there's so much killing in say Star Wars or whatever, never much in-depth reflection upon it. The news shows you the missiles go up, doesn't show them when they go down. Especially the bodies.

I have a rant where I complain about how silly/messed up it is that Vader killed millions and millions of kids but when it's /his/ kid on the ground going "daddy it hurts" he suddenly grows a heart. Onetime someone thought I was talking about the prequels and I was like "no bro, that was the very first movie. He blew up a planet. /There were kids on that planet./"

This has been my essay on how actual thought put into the morality and ramifications of violence are intentionally absent our media. Intentionally or not, it is a form of propaganda.
