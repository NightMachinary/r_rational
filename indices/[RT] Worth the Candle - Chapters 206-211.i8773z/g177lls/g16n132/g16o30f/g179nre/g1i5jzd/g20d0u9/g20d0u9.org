worth the candle makes you think. there are numerous points throughout the story where the events turn our worse than i would expect from my fiction. Many stories give the main character the choice between two bad decisions. few fictions give the MC the choice between two decisions that feel bad. WTC does this and doesn't handwave the repercussions.
