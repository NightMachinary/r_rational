I found these chapters hard to read, not in the sense that they were poorly written or constructed, but because I found the undercurrent of fatalism, futility and hopelessness running through them tough. There were much needed moments of levity and happiness that I really enjoyed, but threaded through every event was just this sense of inevitable failure. In that way it feels like a sharp contrast to the last batch of chapters, where we left on a (relative) high note and a hope for the future of the Doris Finch EZ.

In particular, the killing of the two dragons was /almost exciting/, but just felt wasteful and sad

I think these chapters were good, but I'm gonna have to sit with my thoughts for a while. Definitely left with mixed feelings.
