My lens doesn't say curing deafness is a negative; the point I was making is that I'm not using QoL as a metric (or at least, limiting the use in specific ways) because it's corruptible. If you're arguing for "all changes that improve QoL should be taken", you run into issues with turning people into joy machines (or more realistically, designer babies). This isn't automatically bad, but it's not automatically good, either, so I'm not relying on it without having settled on a conclusion. So the metric I'm using is more along the lines of "what bad thing happens" rather than "what good thing doesn't happen".

With deafness it's stuff like "you don't hear a car coming and get hit by it", whereas with asexuality the 'negatives' are all things like "people who consider sex integral to a relationship don't want to be in a relationship with you", and of course the reduced experience from doing something sexual (one thing I did mention last time is that it's not the same thing as sex AVERSION; this comes up in WtC where they engage in sexual activity and Amaryllis mentions that the act itself is meh but knowing someone she cares about derived enjoyment from it is a positive for her, too). In short, lack of positives.

Anyway, the point from earlier was that I don't think we should perform interventions to add potential positives, but thinking about it more I come to two things: firstly, we shouldn't be doing that YET, it's something that should probably be a whole package deal and "ensuring peak sexuality" comes under the same umbrella as things like ensuring peak muscle and brainpower; it's more like "curing" people of being born with less potential intelligence than it is something like deafness.

There's a lot of literature on this subject (GATTACA is the, like, baby entry-level thing but it's what I'm remembering right now, and there's that short story Yudowsky wrote with three types of alien, one of which was called 'babyeaters'? Three worlds collide or something?), but the point is that the decision to go for species-wide enhancement is distinct, in my opinion, from the decision to do things like curing deafness or genetic edits for faulty cancer-y genes, and while asexuality could be argued to be a grey area I'd argue that it's on the enhancement side. This warrants significant caution on any implementation, which I think separates it from the deafness intervention.

I'm mostly arguing for this point in time; I'll acknowledge that there might be some hypothetical future knowledge set that leads asexuality intervention to be a good idea...but technically that's possible for deafness, too? Less likely, but the future is inherently uncertain and all that. I'm just mostly looking at the here and now and the probable near future, and not seeing it as a good option.

Secondly, I don't think I talked about this enough, but it's very hard to say "we should set people with zero sexuality (out of a hundred, say) to a higher number" while saying "we should set people with one sexuality to that higher number, too". If you wanna set them to one then that makes almost no difference so why bother, and if you want to go higher then it's no longer about giving sexuality to people lacking it, it's about giving more sexuality to people without enough. This is a pretty crude way of putting it, but I didn't just want to say "slippery slope" and run away and I think there is a difference in kind here that highlights how "sexuality" is distinct from "hearing ability" in a way that matters and separates the two in terms of argument.

Also I'll be a little blunter about this, this time around: Part of that argument works against homosexuality. The number of people who want to pair bond with a homosexual is reduced because more people are heterosexual, therefore it reduces QoL on average, therefore we should "cure" it. If I want to reject that (which I do) then I'm rejecting the same argument applied to asexuality as well. (EDIT: Quick train of thought: assuming we have an intervention it could be applied to make the population 50/50 or apply some mix that's considered ideal; but then, that's off into the "enhancement" weeds again, and who's making the decision on what's considered ideal? Big, scary stuff)

The core there is, again, difference vs. diminishment, and I mentioned some stuff about sexuality itself being a possible negative (there are people addicted to sex for whom that reduces QoL; it could be argued their QoL would be increased by having been born asexual). There's some stuff about broad human variability being a positive that has to be counterbalanced by SUFFICIENT negative QoL, not well versed on that score though.

Not sure about the bonding effect thing, but top of head I'm not buying it as an unalloyed positive; it works on people in both good and bad relationships, and as someone in a relationship with an asexual person it kind of feels more meaningful because I know that's not present and it's still working; more room for it to be personal connection and compatibility as opposed to a very direct "I like you" chemical. I doubt this is a good generalisable argument, but the point is more that there are points of view, possessed by non-asexual people, from which the pair bonding itself isn't enough of a reason to intervene.

Random side-train: without some "padding" around what to intervene in and what not to, it would be easy to argue that either asexuality reduces QoL in which case we should intervene, or it INCREASES QoL in which case we should intervene in non-asexuality instead (chance of it being strictly neutral being extremely low). This then goes out to "everything should be changed because everything has some impact on QoL", etc, etc, etc.

The point this makes is to say that I think there's a buffer in here where something has to reduce QoL SUFFICIENTLY to be intervened against. (and, as above, in a removal way rather than a "lack of potential upside" way)

Oh, there's also the whole "change society before changing people" thing. Something can reduce QoL because it's stigmatized in which case the correct response is absolutely not to remove the thing; it's to remove the stigma. So straight QoL research would have to link the reduction to things that apply regardless of culture, which I would think to be a fairly difficult task in this case.

Also! Someone else commented saying that cochlear implants are approaching improvement over regular, unmodified hearing. That actually sums up a lot of what I'm thinking/feeling; asexuality intervention feels a lot more like those implants getting further ahead and then arguing for giving them to people with baseline hearing rather than just people born deaf. It's a different character of argument that comes broadly under "upgrading the human race" rather than "curing things", and I feel roughly the same way about asexuality.

Anyway shorter response was expected; I did a long one because it suited me. Summary is I'm not convinced it's all upside, and even if it was I don't think it's the right kind of upside to make a slam dunk case. I'd be open to new research, although, uh. I'd point to similar "research" about homosexuality and suggest a lot of caution; science may be flawless, but scientists are not.

I'm almost tempted to say that where society is now we literally can't make a good collective decision and so we should stay away from the topic altogether due to a lack of urgency; not in a "don't wrongthink" sense, but in a "conducting unbiased research on this topic is close to impossible because controlling for confounding variables can't be done" sense.

Well, either way, the solution is to completely banish asexual stigma before getting started, so I suppose I'm fine with whichever. If we're ACTUALLY in a world where the research would be conducted out of pure intellectual curiosity and would not be tainted by social impact on the subjects, then we can start answering the question. I don't expect to see this in my lifetime, mind.

EDIT: Also quick pin in "diversity of human experience is valuable in general terms"; I think there's positive there you need to overcome in tradeoff in order to remove any potential experience from all members of the species, and I think existing without sexual attraction (or with a lowered amount) is a distinct experience in this regard. (So is lack of hearing, mind, so it's evidently not an unclearable bar, but)
