I enjoyed reading you think about this. One thing which might be of interest to you is deaf culture. Cochlear implants basically cure deafness, but they are only effective (brain plasticity issue) if implanted in young children. Deaf culture is on average strongly anti implanting grounds that it mutilates the child by removing its deafness. Children with cochlear implants are frequently bullied / rejected by deaf people to such an extent that institutions (schools primarily) designed to care for them usually have to separate them. My familiarity with this is due to the majority of my many siblings being deaf and one of them having a cochlear implant. This seemed very tangental I'm sure so let me bring it back to the topic. I think it is very very easy to turn your (general your, not you specifically) disability into a point of pride / identity. I think this makes people resist cures for both themselves and others because it damages their self image. They allow this protective impulse to set them against something that the vast majority of people who have that thing love and would never give up. To explicitly tie my points together. I think your position on asexuality is similar to the deaf communities stance on cochlear implants and I think both are incorrect. I think hearing and sex are both overwhelmingly likely to be sources of joy and that even though people build identities around the lack of those things, we should still treat them as disabilities we would desire to cure.
