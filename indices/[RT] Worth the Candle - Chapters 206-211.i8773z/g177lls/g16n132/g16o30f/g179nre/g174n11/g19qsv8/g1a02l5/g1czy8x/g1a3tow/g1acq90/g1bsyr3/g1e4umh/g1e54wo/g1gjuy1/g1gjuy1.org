Again, I appreciated watching you think about this. I feel slightly bad that I'm not going to give as extensive of a response.

Deaf adults pretty uniformly deny that there are meaningful downsides to being deaf and that there are social benefits to being deaf that outweigh the minor downsides. That makes it seem, through your lens, like we should not be attempting to ‘cure' (A word that deaf culture hates) deafness. However, deaf adults have an average of a 6th grade reading level (average of 10th grade for the gen. pop.) and correspondingly lower income. As a very interested outside observer, deafness seems like it actively degrades quality of life (QoL) yet, from the inside, they cannot tell.

I don't really know anything about the asexual community and a brief Google search did not turn up any research that looked either topical or credible. But I have the opposite impression that you do. I think (to acknowledge your intentional use of feel I want to point out that I used ‘think' here as a concession of uncertainty) that asexuality must reduce QoL on average. It seems like it must make it harder to pair-bond in the long term ways that bring long term QoL advantages. The number of people that would want to pair-bond with an asexual must be considerably reduced and presumably they don't benefit from the oxytocin bonding effects that most of us get from sex. I could be wrong about all this but my experience with the deaf community has primed me to be suspicious of self reported outcomes.

I actually totally agree with you that persons (roughly adults) should have final and full decision making power over their self, whether or not they make ‘bad' choices with that. But I don't think society should make the mistake of promoting things that are bad for most people even if we promote autonomy that allows people to make ‘bad' decisions. I think our society should be encouraging the implantation of deaf babies and (research pending, assuming I'm right about QoL) encouraging ‘curing' asexuals.
