That's true, although my understanding is that a lot of how the spirit was understood was through where it hooked up to the soul; without the soul sight aspect of Essentialism, it'd be a lot like trying to modify a program with generic variable names to produce targeted changes in a database which you can't see.

I can think of a couple things that might work (looking for differences in spirit activity while engaging in sexual activity being the most obvious one) but they'd come with risks (primarily, the risk of modifying something unintended) that I can't imagine the party signing off on. Basically the spirit just isn't labeled nearly as well and I think that nixes the idea.

...I hope this isn't going to come back and cause problems with the level up thing somehow later down the line. levelup!Joon did promise some pretty scary stuff if he ever returned, I'm not sure how they'd deal with it this go around, and fumbling around half-blind with the spirit seems like a good way to accidentally summon him again. What is it they say around here sometimes? "I will not call up what I cannot put down"? Something like that. Let's hope these guys are smart enough to keep that in mind...
