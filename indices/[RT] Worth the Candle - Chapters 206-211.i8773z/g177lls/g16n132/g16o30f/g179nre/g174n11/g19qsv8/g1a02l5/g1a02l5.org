  Amaryllis can never become his perfect mate through editing herself to gain a fundamental part of human experience that she was born without, so that whole sexual incompatibility is just going to grate on their relationship either forever or until it breaks.

I really feel the need to comment on this because I feel like it's...look, I'm gonna settle for "Joon editing to match instead would have been an equally valid option". The human experience is different for everyone, and barring base survival requirements like "everyone drinks water" I don't think any part of it can be said to be fundamental. To the species as a whole, sure, but not to every individual or even to every group of individuals.
