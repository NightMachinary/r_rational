One-sided, surely, or this would be an astonishing revelation.

I feel like this echoes a thought I'm sure we all had several books ago.

It feels intentional. As writing, it is a nice touch. I like it.

  He thought about trying to educate them, but they were dragons, notoriously independent and willful creatures.

There is a lot here, supposedly to be covered later. We can try to take a peek at it in advance, though.

The obvious stereotype invocation against non-human young. But can we dig deeper for something else?

By "educate" was Uther really considering something more like human-value-aligned Dragon upbringing? Then Raven's meaning is that the problem with the plan was that it wouldn't work, not its morality.

Or maybe Juniper just thinks this is such a flimsy reason to give up on a plan? Additionally, he may suspect motivated cognition.
