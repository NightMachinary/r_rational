Reread and Oh you are right... that's even more pointlessly evil than I realized. Perisev does mention the devils like having children raised to specification and not alway 8... maybe the age of 8 is a trade off in how much the devils will pay vs. how much Blue stands by his last moral scruple? Gotta charged extra for a 7 year old raised with a shred more happiness!

Or maybe he started with a saner age, and the possessed nonanima gradually talked him down lower and lower over the years. The devils have to take it slow, since Blue prides himself on resisting their manipulation and going too fast might make him realize. In another century he might be down to teaching toddlers to consent.
