Let me guess , you were also on the train of people that thought Mary soulfucked Joon?

There is a portion of WtC's readership that share the view that " Juniper really is to a large extent merely the conduit of power he represents" for his party (and especially Amy). The problem is that you are largely evaluating their situation as the Chosen One and his companions in a vacuum , while mostly ignoring how their individual interpersonal relationships and their significance might impact that situation.

For Amy in particular , that view was absolutely true... in like the first 1-2 books of WtC. She was pretty blatant about it too , even Juniper picked up on it immediately. Around the time they traveled through the Datura Desert (when Amy sprained her ankle and Juniper carried her on a sled) , she began by her own admission to have feelings for him. I don't particularly care going into more detail , since the developments that have transpired since that point in the story are many , considering its length , but it has become fairly obvious that her loyalty to Juniper ( which sits 26 by this point , only behind Val's , for whom Juniper is pretty much the pillar of her existence) is in no way "contingent on that being what helps her keep her world alive" and is deeply personal. The conversation June and Amy had right after Rosemallow's murder all but says it outright.

As for the rest of the party and your belief that they are not above manipulating him through his obvious SOC deficiencies , they are personally loyal to him in pretty much the same way , with the exception of Raven, whose precedent to the situation is the complete lack of influence she could exert on Uther who pretty much always acted unilaterally . Even if they were not loyal , Bethel wouldn't care at all , it's not Grak's style and the Locus is the Locus. Val as it stands is certainly not above manipulating Juniper , but it's pretty much strictly in what she believes will ''benefit" him in her often misguided way , and that manipulation is limited to small interpersonal matters.
