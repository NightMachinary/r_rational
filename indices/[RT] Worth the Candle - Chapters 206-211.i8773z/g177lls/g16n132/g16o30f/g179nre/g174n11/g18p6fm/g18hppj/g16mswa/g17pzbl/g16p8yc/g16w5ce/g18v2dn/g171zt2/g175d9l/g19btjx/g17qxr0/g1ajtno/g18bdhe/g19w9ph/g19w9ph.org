  Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is horrible, but not implausibly so... I'm reminded of the absolute worst of the most extreme “libertarian” thought that engages in apologia for child labor and selling yourself into slavery and such.

I think Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is a parody of Ayn Rand and her character filibusters.
