  why do dictators keep going (torturing and imprisoning people) when they could retire.

That's an excellent metaphor, and the answer probably carries over, doesn't it? If Hussein had /actually/ developed WMDs he probably wouldn't have been hanged; if Gaddafi hadn't renounced his then he probably wouldn't have been tortured and shot.

Captain Blue was evil enough to have a lot of enemies who want him to suffer horribly, at which point "live out your retirement" might no longer be on the table. Then, doing /more/ evil things for more power might be the only way to accumulate defenses faster than you accumulate people itching to break through them.
