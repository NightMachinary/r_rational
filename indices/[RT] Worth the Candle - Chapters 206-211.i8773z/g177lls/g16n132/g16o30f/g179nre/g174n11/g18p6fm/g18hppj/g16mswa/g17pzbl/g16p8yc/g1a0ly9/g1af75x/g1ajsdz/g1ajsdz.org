Fair point, and you're right. I was at the part on the elevator when I posted that, and I really was just thinking of the way that monster is an unhelpful label, just used to turn monstrous people into 'te other,' kind of a crutch to avoid thinking about difficult things. Not that this guy wasn't a monster. Not that there aren't monstrous people in real life. But that I'm not sure what it even really means to try and hold anyone but yourself responsible for things that happen. Which is kinda related to the utilitarian way Juniper talks sometimes, but hes also pretty angry and murdery at this point.
