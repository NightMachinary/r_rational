  Edit I reread what Green0photon said, and they meant Schloss within Juniper's time on Aerb, which is definitely wrong. Juniper mentions Celestar the very first time he sees the moon at the beginning of the story.

Don't be down on yourself. The two planets being mutual schlosses of each other is way more interesting than me forgetting about Celestar's existence (or more precisely that there's a pristine set of housing on Celestar). You really might be on to something with that. (Or maybe it's some sort of star magic thing which brought them close together. Or maybe both?)
