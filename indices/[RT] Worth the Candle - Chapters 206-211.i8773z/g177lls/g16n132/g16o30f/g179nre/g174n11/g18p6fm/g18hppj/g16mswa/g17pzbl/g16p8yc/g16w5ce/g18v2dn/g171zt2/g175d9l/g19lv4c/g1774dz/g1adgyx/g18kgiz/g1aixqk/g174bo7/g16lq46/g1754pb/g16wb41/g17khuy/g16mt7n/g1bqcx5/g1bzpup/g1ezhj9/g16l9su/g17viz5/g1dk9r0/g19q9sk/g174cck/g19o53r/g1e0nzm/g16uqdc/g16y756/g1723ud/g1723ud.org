If I was living in America right now and had to deal with the mass of bullshit going on there I'd probably had a harder time reading this batch. I remember I hard to stop and start throughout reading Worm because the recurring theme of "and then everything got worse" across arcs didn't mesh with how I was feeling at that point, despite it being a well-made work I look back on fondly.

For what it's worth, the amount of bullshit occurring globally for so long seems to me a more major source of influence for people's perception of this part of the narrative than whatever variance in your writing one batch of chapters that just came out. After all if it's affecting you there's no reason it can't also be affecting a bunch of your readers independently (some of them more significantly than others, and the more of an outlier someone is in how they're affected, the more strongly they'll feel and the more likely to voice a comment on these feelings they are).
