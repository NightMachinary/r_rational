I mean at least in real life they're actually getting richer and gaining more power. Blue is just running on a treadmill, the numbers in his book go up but he is unable to meaningfully use his wealth in the real world. He can't buy much because very few people will trade with him, and even then only in a limited secretive capacity, and he is essentially incapable of using his money and production capabilities to exercise power for the same reason. Like, I get the inability to admit that he's wrong regarding the zombies, pride is a deadly poison, but the kids are just insanity. He's committing genocide on an industrial scale for no material gain except for the satisfaction of being more productive.
