  What was the DMs intended resolution having two dragons attack Joon? Did he plan for Joon to invent some new bullshit and get excluded? Did he not plan and just assume Joon would die? Or was he not involved at all?

The DM doesn't expect Joon to survive. Join made a stupid decision (in the dm's mind) in pissing off the dragon and the DM is simply playing out the consequences of his actions.
