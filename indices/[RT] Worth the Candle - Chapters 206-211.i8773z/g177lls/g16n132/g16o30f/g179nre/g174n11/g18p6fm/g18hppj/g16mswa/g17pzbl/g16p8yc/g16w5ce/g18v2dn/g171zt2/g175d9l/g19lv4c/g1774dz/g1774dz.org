I guess my biggest question with Captain Blue is, why?

Why keep going with the zombie procedure and even do worse things over time (selling children's souls to the hells, where it's unclear what he actually got in exchange).

What's actually driving him to do this? Why isn't he happy to retire with a small population of zombies/humans in his EZ? It seems like he's driven to keep expanding and growing his economy, and feels like he's forced into making lots of horrible tradeoffs because of this. But these tradeoffs are totally not required! He could've just not expanded! I feel like what drives him to continue on could've been better explored. My best guess is simple pride, he wants to rule over a rich and powerful polity, and feels like that was taken away for him because of other people's hypocrisy.

I'm also confused about all the extra labour zombies he has underground. If he kills the children and sells their souls then surely they can't be made into zombies? So where do the new zombies come from? The few conscientious objectors?
