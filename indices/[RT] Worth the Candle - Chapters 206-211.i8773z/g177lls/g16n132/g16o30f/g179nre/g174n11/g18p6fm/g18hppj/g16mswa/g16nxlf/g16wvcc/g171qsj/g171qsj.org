You're my favorite web author and easily one my top five living authors.

You're the reason I made D&D friends and dm silly little stories with them.

If you need the time take it.

If you need a break from this story and want to write some cute/silly short stuff we would love that too.

Shit will pass so just focus on your health and family. If you can find time after that for writing that's cool too.

From Ohio with love,

Joe
