He's got some big WH40K energy with his desiccated corpse, devotional civilization and total refusal to die.

I'll be taking the dragon's word that he's terrified of dying since it neatly explains his actions/character.

Tying into the 40K thing, I'm expecting him to cause a Hell Breach and evacuate into the Hells or equivalent. Doris managed to tunnel into other planes, and Juniper did call out Zombie-Wizards as an expected enemy.
