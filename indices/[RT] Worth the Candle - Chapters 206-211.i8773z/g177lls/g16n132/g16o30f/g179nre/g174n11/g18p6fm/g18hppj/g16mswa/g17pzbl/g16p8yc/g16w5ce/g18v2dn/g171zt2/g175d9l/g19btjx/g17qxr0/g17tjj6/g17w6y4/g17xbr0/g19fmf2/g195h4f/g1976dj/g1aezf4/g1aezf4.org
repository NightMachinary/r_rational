Losing Rune Magic won't be a big deal in the grand scheme of things. It just changes the target of the next adventure and moves some timelines around, which is already something that the quest hooks have been doing regularly. We know Valencia managed to at least force a truce with the hells in the library timeline. Joon's level, and and therefore her abilities, have only increased since then. Including the level up in the library, Joon has leveled up 5 times and has hit level 18- in terms of traditional DnD level, he's nearly Epic level. He's jumping the gun by calling himself a demigod, and soul magic cheese was a big reason he's been punching above his weight, but he's getting close to demi-god status "normally." The team might not be at the level of truly tackling the hells and definitively winning yet, but they're in a much better position overal.
