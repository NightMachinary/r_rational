  Amaryllis had moved ahead with her Earth exploitation endeavors, perhaps emboldened by the fact that she was living in a “doomed” timeline. She engaged in some ethically questionable television testing using volunteer tuung and worked out several solutions to the Couch Potato problem, but none that she thought would survive reverse engineering.

Seems like they decided the solutions wouldn't work between the doomed timeline and the actual timeline.

  Amaryllis was working on a prototype television that wouldn't kill or brainwash anyone, but it was going to take awhile

This was from chapter 135, so it's likely this process continued.

  She put up a network of ‘satellites', hung in place above Aerb using rotating shifts of still mages and other magics, and allowed by a complicated agreement with the Draconic Confederacy. It was a huge investment of capital, but it made the ground repeaters for radio obsolete, allowed for the construction of ‘dumb' geolocation devices, served as a centralization point for distribution of television and radio programming

Also talking about the doomed timeline, just serves as further confirmation that a solution /was/ actually figured out in that timeline. Guess a solution was figured out in the real timeline off-screen as well, although hopefully we get further confirmation about that.
