Am I the only one who thinks that the way Six-Eyed Doe sees Solace might not actually mean anything negative? Imagine an old woman walking alongside a horse, and the old woman has a rope tied around the horse's neck. What's their relationship like? A single rope isn't going to meaningfully restrain a horse the way a bridle or harness would; all it would do is guide the horse the way the woman would want it to go. If the horse did try to run, it would probably just yank the rope out of her hand. You wouldn't see this being done unless both the horse and rider trusted each other. In terms of Solace and the locus, seeing Solace that way could just mean that Solace is weak without the locus's power, but the locus is willing to lend the power to be used as Solace wants because they trust and take care of each other.
