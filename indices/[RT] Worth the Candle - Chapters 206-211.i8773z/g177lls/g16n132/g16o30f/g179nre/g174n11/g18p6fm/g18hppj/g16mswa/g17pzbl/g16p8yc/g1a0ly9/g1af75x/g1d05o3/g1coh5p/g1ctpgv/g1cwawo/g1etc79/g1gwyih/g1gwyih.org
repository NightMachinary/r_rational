Hmm. I'm seeing a few excellent looking truffle shops, but you don't want that (well, either it's caramel interiors, and not chocolate, or ganache, and that uses cream).

These folks look amazing, and their chocolate bark looks like a match, plus that corn milk thing looks interesting and might not have any dairy: [[http://www.jinjichocolate.com/]]

Hmm. That's it from this looksee... Also look at the most up-scale super markets you can find; Whole Foods sometimes cuts it, and there's a thing here called Erewhon that definitely does (although they stock from some local makers)

I can also take a look around DC another time.

(PS - All this is just from searching "chocolate" in Google Maps and then knowing what to look for)
