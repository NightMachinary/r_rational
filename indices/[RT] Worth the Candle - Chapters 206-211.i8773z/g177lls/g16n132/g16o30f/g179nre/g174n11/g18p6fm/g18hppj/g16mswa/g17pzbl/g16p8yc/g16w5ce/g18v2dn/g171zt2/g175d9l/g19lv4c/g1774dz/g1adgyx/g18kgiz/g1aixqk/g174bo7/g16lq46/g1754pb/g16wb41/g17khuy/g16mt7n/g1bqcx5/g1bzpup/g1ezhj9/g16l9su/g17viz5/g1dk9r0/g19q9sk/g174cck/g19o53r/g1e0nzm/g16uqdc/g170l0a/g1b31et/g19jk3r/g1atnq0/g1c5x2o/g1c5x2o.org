I wonder what the effect of Juniper's injury-reflecting sword would be on a highly asymmetric opponent. Like, if my face has 2 eyes but they're not remotely in symmetrical places, does an injury to the left eye reflect to the right eye, or across to the corresponding spot on my right even though there is no eye there, or does the reflection not work at all since the vertical line down my face isn't actually an axis of symmetry on my body? And just how asymmetrical do I have to be for your answer to apply?
