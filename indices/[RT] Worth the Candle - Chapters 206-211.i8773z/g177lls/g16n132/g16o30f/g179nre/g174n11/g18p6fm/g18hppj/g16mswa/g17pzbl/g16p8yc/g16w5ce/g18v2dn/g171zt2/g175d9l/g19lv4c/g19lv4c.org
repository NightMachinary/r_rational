I suspect the purpose of moving the gold to Celestar was to protect the gold from Juniper in the event that he tries to reclaim the gold without gold magic. The call of the gold has a monopoly on travel to and from Celestar, because teleportation entads don't work between there and Aerb. Even the locus might be unable to take him back from Celestar, because all of the greenery there is fake and orderly, undying because it isn't alive in the first place.
