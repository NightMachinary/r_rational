I'm not a Latin expert, but I think /Deus ex Dominia/ in 206 should be /Deus ex/ */Dominio/*. /Dominia/ is the nominative plural of /dominium/, but the expression should use the ablative singular (i.e. "from the domain" instead of "the domains"), as in /deus ex/ /māchinā,/ which also uses the ablative singular.

Edit: Actually, I guess Juniper is probably just making up a word that ends in -a, so it's probably intentional. Never mind then.
