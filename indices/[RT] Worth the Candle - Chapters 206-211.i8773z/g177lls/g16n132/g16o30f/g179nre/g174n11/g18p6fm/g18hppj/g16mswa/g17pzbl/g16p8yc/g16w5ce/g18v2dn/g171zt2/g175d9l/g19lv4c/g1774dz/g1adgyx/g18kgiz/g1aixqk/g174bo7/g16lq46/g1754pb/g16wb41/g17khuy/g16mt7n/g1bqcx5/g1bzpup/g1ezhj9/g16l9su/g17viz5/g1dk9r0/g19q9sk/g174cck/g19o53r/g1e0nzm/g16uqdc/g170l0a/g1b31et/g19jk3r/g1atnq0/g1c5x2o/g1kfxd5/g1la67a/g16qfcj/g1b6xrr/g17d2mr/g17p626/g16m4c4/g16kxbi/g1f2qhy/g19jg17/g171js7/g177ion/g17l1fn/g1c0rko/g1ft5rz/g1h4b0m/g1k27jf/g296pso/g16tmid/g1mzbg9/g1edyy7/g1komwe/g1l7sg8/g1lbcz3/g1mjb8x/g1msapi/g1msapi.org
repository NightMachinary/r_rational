Yes, but there's precedent for Mary using magic without satisfying preconditions. She didn't go through all the stuff Joon did at Sound and Silence, for example, yet she can still (IIRC) use both still and vibration magic. Gold is a bit of an oddball because of the weird maintenance need and the way "skill" is divided into two parts (skill level plus amount of gold), but if she can piggyback with every other kind of voodoo I don't see why she can't piggyback onto this too.
