If you read the world building document, the origin story for Celestar feels like mutual Schloss, to the elves, Aerb just appears in the sky one day and vice versa. This is actually the origin story given by one of the gods for the whole of Aerb. And Cidium has a million years of history while Aerb only has 30,000.

Edit I reread what Green0photon said, and they meant Schloss within Juniper's time on Aerb, which is definitely wrong. Juniper mentions Celestar the very first time he sees the moon at the beginning of the story.
