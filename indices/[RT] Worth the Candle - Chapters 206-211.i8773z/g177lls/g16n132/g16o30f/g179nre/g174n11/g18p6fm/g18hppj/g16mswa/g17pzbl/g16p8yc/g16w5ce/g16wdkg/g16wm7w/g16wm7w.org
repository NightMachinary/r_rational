And how how does the Call of the Gold interact with Juniper's thoughts? Like, scarring Celestar is a good way to be able to find your gold again without it being marked. But he doesn't explicitly think that, just hints at it later; and so perhaps he doesn't notice it consciously, or he's hiding it from himself so that the Call doesn't notice.
