I wonder how many newbie gold mages have been required to move their gold to the moon. Theoretically it could be a lot of them. Celestar could be littered with abandoned hoards. In fact, if it's not, I would suspect the existence of a Moon King who watches for gold mages to drop off their hoards and then scoops them into his gigantic Moon Vault.

Aerb is not a planet. Its moon isn't held in place by gravity. What keeps Celestar on course in the sky? /The titanic tactile telekinesis of the Moon King, Aerb's mightiest gold mage./
