I essentially agree with Behemoth: Juniper has been given so many tools and so much flexibility that it's perfectly reasonable for the DM to not carefully curate the level and timing of encounters the way you would seem to prefer it. He had the resources to take out two dragons in two entirely different ways, without drawing on the help of two of his most powerful party members, who he has chosen to leave on the shelf for now. Lacking the help of these party members, he so out-classed his last adversary that he won despite having what appeared to be his most powerful ability excluded. It took creativity, sure, but as noted he's been pretty consciously saving "becoming a gold mage" for a rainy day this entire time. It was also shown with Blood God Doris that even when given an explicit quest to destroy an enemy, there is room for alternate paths and compromise. Here he didn't even have a quest to kill these dragons, and there might very well have been paths he could have taken to avoid the fight.

Or in other words, that's, like, just your opinion man.
