I do not believe that the very rich, very intelligent man who's leads a nation of millions and has planned for this for hundreds of years is completely helpless. He has shown an interest and ability to successfully predict Juniper's future moves either through pure skill, some kind of future prediction, or devil assistance. It's likely that if Joon were the type of person who would even consider killing him in the first place then Joon would have had to wade through 18 cities worth of zombies from the beginning.

Again, we should assume antagonists are not stupid. Trying to waltz downstairs and kill him wouldn't end the way you believe it would.

Re Impossible: these scenarios /are/ impossible within the context of the acceptable rules. Juniper is surviving only through exclusions, as they're essentially exploits and cheating that are getting patched. It's like throwing a Tarrasque at a level 5 party because you know that Greg has a rigged d20 that will always get him nat 20s, but at least you'll take it away after this fight.
