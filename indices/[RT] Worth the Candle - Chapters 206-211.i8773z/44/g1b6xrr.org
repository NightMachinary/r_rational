Some discussion about Captain Blue:

How moral do you have to be to put the effort he has gone to? Think about it from his perspective for a moment and consider the insane efforts he went to to justify his work. Consider any actual real world situation, has any business mogul ever gone to this effort? No of course not. He must be spending billions on what is basically charity work that gets him no tax credits and no benefits from good will.

1. His position won't convince anyone.

This guy has decided to murder kids at 8. He must know that no one would be convinced that this is moral. So why bother doing it? Why not just kill them the moment they develop a soul? He spent billions of dollars and seriously massively ruined his own business for no benefit at all.

It would have been far more efficient if he didn't make people sign contracts that no one accepts as justified. So why did he do that?

1. No one will ever know about anything he did.

This guy did not plan to be discovered or have to surrender. In fact considering how he organised (or rather lack of) he doesn't even care that much about legacy if he suddenly died all of his paperwork and the such would have been useless. His sudden planning for this surrender shows that he did not prepare for any possibility that he would be dead. Therefore he never intended to share any information with the world. Most people, you, me and everyone else, are moral in large part because of social pressures. When we're in different societies, even different groups, our morality shifts. But this guy has literally no one pressuring him to conform to social moral standards. So why would he bother?

1. We are given no reason to doubt him.

You might say perhaps there is another reason why he waits to 8, why he bothers educating or getting consent but we're given no reason in text to doubt him and if anything it's verified via the crown.

So from his perspective instead of becoming a multi trillionaire murdering babies before they're out the womb, enslaving vast numbers of people without any threat of recourse and profiting far more he increases his cost of business by THOUSANDS of percentages for NOTHING?!?! So he can feel that he's justified in his position?!

It's insanity! Show me any IRL capitalist who has gone to this efforts. IRL capitalists worked against labour laws, they only give to charity for the tax benefits and social capital. This guy has given more to charity (and real unrequited charity with zero benefits for him outside of his psychology) than any other human in existence on this world (maybe apart from Arthur).

Imagine going to the effort of making studies and making education programs. He could have just waited until they were 18 or 100 or whatever and then sold their soul right? After all he's already made it clear that he's willing to give up profit for morality. So that means that he was genuinely convinced by his studies that his test he devised is genuine and 8 year olds can prove consent at this age. It means that he genuinely thinks people can give up their autonomy in a contract. And yet he's still choosing the minimum

Seriously it blows me away just what a good guy he is trying to be. You might think your moral but IRL practice shows that if you can save 1 trillion dollars by reducing the age of the test to 7 years old or 1 year old every capitalist will do it. But this guy fucking resisted that massive temptation. Not for PR, not for tax credits, but for his own morality?

It's impossible to believe someone can be this good and also still run the business he is running.

Every day he must be faced with yet another problem about contracts or about feeding millions of children and realise that yet again this is entirely self imposed regulation. And with no threat of someone coming in to regulate him. Again as far as I know this has no real world example, businesses only regulate themselves to stop the government making a regulatory body.
