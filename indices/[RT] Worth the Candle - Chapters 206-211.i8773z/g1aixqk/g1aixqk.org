So glad to see soul magic gone. It was a super interesting premise but by its nature forced our characters to do a ton of navel gazing and trust exercises. The story felt like it moved along more fluidly prior to its introduction.

Excited to move on to content where a single member of our party being isolated by a potential enemy doesn't have to trigger a half chapter of secure handshakes.
