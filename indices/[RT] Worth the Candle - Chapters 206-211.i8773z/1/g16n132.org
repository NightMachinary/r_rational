  most striking was Solace though. She wasn't her teenage self, she was a hag, stooped and withered. She was holding onto a rope, which was tied around the neck of the locus.

- So Solace is the more powerful of the two? DMPC incoming? Or merely need to level the Doe?

  There were a lot of components that went into any good magic system,

- Really interested in hearing what AW identifies these components as.

- Also, there's a parallel to Joon's ultimatum to Blue and Perisev's to Joon. Both Blue and Joon are very fixated on self-justification here. Joon ultimately refused cooperation - will Blue?

- What does the Gold entity(?) want? It appears intelligent. Will its ever increasing demands seek to ruin Joon? Can he negotiate with it, perhaps at high levels of Gold Magic? Is it guided by any goals other than increased marked gold, and if so how strategic is it about them? Is it something like a homunculus Gold!Joon (similar to the levelup!Joon if he had been a separare entity?)

- It seems like Gold Magic might be about sunk costs, or digging yourself in deeper, or knowing when to turn back (paralleled with the logistics of the flight to the moon and space-travel's associations with points of no return...) And also about paranoia, obsession, abusive relationships, and voices in your head. So far, it seems to have already have begun on a path of setting some cracks in Joon's relationships.

- Joon beat Onion in a bladebound contest. Joon didn't get to use the same tricks here - instead, with his hoard of gold, he out-dragoned Perisev.

- Also, barring finding the relevant exclusion, this ends the Joon/Amaryllis-self-modification discussion. Hopefully this and the gold magic don't result in a downward spiral.
