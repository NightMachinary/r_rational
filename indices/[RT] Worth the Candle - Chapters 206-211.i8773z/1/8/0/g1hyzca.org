There are a couple reasons to think that path is barred. One, is that it was brought up so explicitly right before all those plans were made obsolete - it seems unlikely that this would turn out to be of no consequence, from a lower-case n narrative standpoint.

Two, Joon had an unrivalled facility with Essentialism. No other soul mage got clear labels and numerical values. On the other hand, what Joon has for Spirit is perhaps as bad as possible, and without being able to refer back to what's going on in the Soul, it is unclear whether he can even determine a collection of threads whose modification would yield what he wants. Just confer with all the discussion around whether Joon's clamping down pain made him into a homicidal maniac Onion-killer back a few posts ago.

Spirit doesn't work in a clearcut way like Soul, so the default /isn't/ "just turn some knobs". And we have no reason to think that something as complicated as creating a sex-drive for Amaryllis, potentially ex nihilo, is within Joon's purview. That said, the author could go any number of ways with things, and often does the unexpected. We don't even /know/ that essentialism's out, that they won't find it conveniently Excluded to their current residence once they turn back home. But I think a lot of us assume that the default position is that those plans are gone.
