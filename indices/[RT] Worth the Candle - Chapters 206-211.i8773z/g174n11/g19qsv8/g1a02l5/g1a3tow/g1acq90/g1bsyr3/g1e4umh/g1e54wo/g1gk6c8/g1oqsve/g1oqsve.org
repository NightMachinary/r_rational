This is in fact an interesting aside; thanks for bringing it up! I, er, may have missed that you were the same person I was talking to before and referenced you in my other reply as though you weren't; whoops.

Actually this opens up a kind of third path: I was talking about a "hearing knob" being superior to a straight deafness cure in an earlier post, and it kind of sounds like that's what she has (indeed, that functions as a much harder slam dunk against the "don't provide the implants" argument; she could choose to remain deaf if she wanted).

I was also talking about an analogous thing for sexuality, which would sidestep the issue entirely, in theory; although now I think about that if we invented it today it would almost certainly be used to have everyone conform to what's considered the social norm, which...sounds really bad.

I think I'm concluding that society sucks and that screws up most if not all attempts at doing something in this area, and that regardless of stance the correct thing to do is get rid of the social forces in question before doing anything else.
