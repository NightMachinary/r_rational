[Post-cut second section; I could probably have been more succinct, but there's enough nuance that I don't really trust myself to not express something seriously screwed up that I don't actually think without a full brain dump, so to speak. This way I can be assured that if I do express something of the sort then it'll be something I ACTUALLY think and attacks on it will be justified]

I'm getting a brain tingle here on "deafness enhances other senses and provides a different but not worse sensorium" as a line of argument, and that hearing is primarily better also because the world has been built for people who can hear and we could change that instead, and even that requirements to hear that aren't social have largely been eliminated...and I almost feel like there's some merit to all that, as it's similar substantially to what I'm saying about asexuality, and there's interesting comparisons to make to hypothetical alien species with different sensory experience. One could say that the human sensorium co-evolved with hearing in mind, but the same is true of sexuality! But then that could devolve (heh) easily into saying it's true of HETEROsexuality, which would flow into curing people of homosexuality, which there's a much stronger and obvious ideological objection to.

Actually, that brings up an interesting point: sexuality is a spectrum; there's not just "sexual" vs. "asexual", there's differing levels of desire and compulsion and payoff for each individual. Supposing we found an "ideal" point on this spectrum: would it then be correct to, assuming it possible, tune everyone to hit that point? Hell, if we found a point on the spectrum that no human is born with that provides more joy than any point humans ARE born with, should we tune for THAT? This starts to intersect with the idea of engineering people for enhanced pleasure and away from their humanity as a result, and into questions of what a "human" really is, and...well, parsing the implications could be an entire topic in and of itself, but I think my conclusion is that making changes to "increase joy" isn't an unalloyed good and that the argument for cochlear implants that runs along the lines of decreasing suffering instead (hearing being a useful tool to avoid negative outcomes in a variety of circumstances) is stronger. That argument doesn't apply to sexuality, which I would therefore say weakens the comparison.

A comparable subject is perhaps autism; I received an intervention for this in my teenage years (cognitive behavioural therapy, specifically) and I don't know whether to credit it with improved personal functionality but I do know that there are a number of things that are generally categorised as "part of autism" that I would regret no longer having on an object level rather than an "I've built my identity around it" level. Well, half and half; I have built an identity around these capabilities and behavioural patterns, to an extent, but I feel like from a neutral position they would still be valid things to select. I feel like sexuality constitutes an opportunity to engage in a specific source of joy but also a kind of push to do so, and that the negatives of the push could for some people be considered to outweigh the positives of the option (I know I've felt this to be true at times >_>).

Perhaps, then, the answer is that we shouldn't be looking for a "cure" so much as a way to deal with negative externalities that might arise. An option to allow people to "switch on" without soldering the thing into the on position. I think that's where I'm running into friction: The negative externality of being deaf is not being able to hear, but the negative externality of asexuality is not feeling a specific motivation towards a specific activity and a specific payoff from engaging in it.

Bringing us back on topic, Amaryllis engages in sexual activity in the story and receives a payoff: Joon's satisfaction from the encounter. She just doesn't experience the motivation or payoff that someone with "baseline" sexuality would. Without going into too many personal details that I'm sure nobody wants to hear, I will just say that from personal experience I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this modality. Certainly I don't think there's enough wrong with it to justify early life intervention to prevent it. (EDIT: whoops, unintended double negative)

Indeed, of hypothetical magic solutions to the issue, the ability to snap one's fingers and select a sexuality (pun intended) at will seems more appealing. Of course, a volume knob on one's hearing would be strictly superior to the cochlear implant we have today, but I think more people would spend some of their time tuned to "asexual" than tuned to "deaf".

To conclude my ramblings...I think it's a good comparison for illuminating the issue but I don't think it's a good enough comparison to function as an open-and-shut case. I think in the case of people competent to make decisions we should respect their wishes in both cases; I don't think this is a point of difference.

But I think in the case of people we have to make decisions FOR...well, ordinarily I'd say try to have them understand as best as possible the decision being made, but the nature of sexuality makes this both impossible and irresponsible. As-is, what I'd say is that the focus should be on dealing with unambiguous negatives rather than chasing even unambiguous positives; I think the stronger argument for hearing is that there are negatives attached that are not "missing out on a positive", and I don't think that argument applies to asexuality. Combined with our general history of intervening in sexuality at younger ages, I would say that seeking a "cure" is not a good use of time or resources and that if we're going to wish for hypotheticals, it would be better to wish for a comprehensive at-will sexuality modifier than for the removal of asexuality during development.

Perhaps later advances in relevant fields and human understanding will open up some path I'm not considering or change the calculus, but for now I think this is where I'm at. Definitely something to reassess as society progresses (notably we could find that asexuality has baseline negative impact on overall psychology, but equally we could find that it has baseline POSITIVE impact; evolution is a blind idiot god, after all), but for where we're at now I'm...not necessarily "comfortable" with this position, but I think it's the only one I can feel reasonable staking out as part of a complicated issue. I don't think asexuality causes direct negatives, I think the indirect negatives (i.e. positives being missed out on) are not absolute, and therefore I don't think that early intervention is justified in the same way that it is for something like deafness where there are direct negatives which are being prevented. Indeed, the ease of building up an identity around the shared non-experience indicates that we generally do not end up with people regretting not having received an intervention earlier in life, which further suggests that such an intervention doesn't clear the bar to be performed.

There's some more big-picture questions, like where the correct trade-off point between species-wide human suffering and species-wide human diversity is, but that starts bleeding out into other topics real fast, so I'll cut it here. Again, well-chosen example; while I think the comparison has flaws that render the positions sufficiently non-identical to hold differing ones on each side, I think FINDING those flaws has been an important exercise in clarifying why doing so is reasonable (at least, in my opinion).

In case anyone wants a tl;dr: I don't think the comparison is apples-to-apples enough to justify a hypothetical intervention for asexuality similar to cochlear implants, I wouldn't support such an intervention if it existed, and I don't think the comparison correctly captures my position, either. I think it's close enough to be interesting and informative, but not to correctly sum up or fully analogise the position I have taken. I also don't think disability is the right word for asexuality, I think asexuality itself is more like the zero state on a multi-dimensional spectrum of variables that comprise sexuality (EDIT: As discussed and as Amaryllis presents in the story; in common parlance it refers to a whole slice of the spectrum), and I'm not convinced that even said zero state is an unalloyed or even net negative, let alone other states on that spectrum. In terms of hypothetical interventions, I think the only reasonable ones would require informed consent and that any intervention prior to the capacity for informed consent is not indicated.

Again, let me know if any clarification is desired or of potential negative externalities from this line of thought.
