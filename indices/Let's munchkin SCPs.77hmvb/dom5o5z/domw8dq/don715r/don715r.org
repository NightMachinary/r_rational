The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem#Programming_consequences][Halting Problem]] is that you can't necessarily tell if a program will finish running given a certain set of inputs, becuase it will take at least as long to do that as to just run the program and find out. Not sure what that has to do with predicting yourself and then doing the opposite (that would just be a deliberately bad prediction).
