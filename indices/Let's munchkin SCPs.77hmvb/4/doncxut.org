SCP Foundation's site has a story centred on this already: [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld][/Visions of a Better World/]]. It's a collaborative work which works like this: someone comes up with a way to muncking an SCP, describes the Foundation doing so; next person writes how it went horribly wrong, and adds another munckinry idea.

Of course, these stories are deliberately written to go wrong, but this is sort-of canon: it's the Foundation's policy to not use SCPs in its work /because/ it's quite likely to backfire. Munchkinry /isn't done/ in this universe, not with anomalies.

Did that ever stop [[/r/rational][r/rational]], though? Ha! My idea:

Put 1 [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-963][SCP-963]] and 1 recording of any simple memagent capable of putting a slight suggestion on the target in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914][SCP-914]], refine on "1:1" setting. Iterate until you have a two-stage memagent which rewrites the mind of the victim with the mind of someone who first perceived it. Use it on a trusted operative.

Then infect [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal][SCP-001.Swann]] with it.

Did someone mention "Global Victory"?
