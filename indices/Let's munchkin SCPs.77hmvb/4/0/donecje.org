This is SCP-001's reaction to your munchkining attempt:

SCP #: SCP-██

Special Containment Procedure: Feed SCP-██ to SCP-963 under the setting "Very Super Entropic Coarse", with a cleaning crew nearby to witness.

Description: SCP-██ is some dude from [[/r/rational]] who thought he could munchkin SCP-001.Swann. So we wrote an SCP for him.
