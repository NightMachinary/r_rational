  But we found out that there is a God, and it is SCP-001.

This is my interpretation: SCP-001.Swann is the only non-fictional SCP. SCP-001 exists. SCP-001 is the SCP universe, and everyone who has contributed to SCP is part of SCP-001.

Your best bet to munchkin SCP-001.Swann is to hack the website, become admin, and change articles. Or buy the website from its owners. Something like that.

And yes, my little story will never get approved.
