That'll never get approved! SCP-001.Swann is self-policing: it will not allow such a low-grade article into the database, because the majority of it would not want that. It breaks the Foundation's character, and nothing which breaks the narrative would be accepted, while anything which is /good/ for the narrative could be implemented. This is a huge weakness, a weakness most authors exhibit that a clever meta-character could exploit.

Additionally, SCP-001.Swann does not, in general, have self-preservation instinct or anything similar. Likely, it doesn't consider anything happening in the database/simulated world "real", and would find attempts to munchkin it /entertaining/, rather than dangerous, more entertaining than smiting "people" who try to munchkin it. It will happily approve such attempt, if framed remotely fine.

Naturally, that would be its downfall.
