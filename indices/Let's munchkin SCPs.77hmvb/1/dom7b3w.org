One I've come up with a while ago is based on [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-674][SCP-674]]. You precommit to performing some action (such as attempting to kill SCP-682 with a certain SCP) if a given person dies. Then you have someone shoot that person in a security camera, and have them report what happens.
