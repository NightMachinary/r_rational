Christ where to even start, for one given the stuff 294 has dispensed you could likely get it to dispense anomalous materials that would let you achieve world domination, or potentially a cup of grey goo preloaded with an AI that would take on the most consistent version of your utility function or something similar.

Also there's that SCP that is a child with godlike power (so they could probably be relatively easily used to do damn near anything with slight persuasion), plus there's an SCP that is basically god and yet is portrayed as human enough that you could potentially convince them to take actions which would let you achieve world domination either directly or indirectly.

And I mean those are /just the one's I can think of off the top of my head/, the full list of one's you could use like that is probably in the dozens. However, the ultimate issue here is that given the canon of SCP actually trying to do nearly any of these things is likely to end in some horrifying eldritch horror eating the universe. Simply because the world continuing to exist is so much due to luck and precarious balance that trying to do nearly anything of consequence probably dooms humanity (or at least dooms us perhaps marginally faster than we would have been otherwise).
