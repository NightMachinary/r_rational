The idea is essentially that the Entities, with their huge processing power, have to bruteforce solutions by going through all the possible solutions in the vast, massive solution-space one by one. While creative beings, such as humans, can look at the question and the results of various attempts to find the solution and then grasp the shape of the answer, skipping over vast fields of solution-space that definitely do not contain the right answer. Thus creative beings need much less resources to find the same answers.
