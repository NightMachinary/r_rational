Humans, by virtue of evolving in an environment that didn't reward fancy long-ass mental gymnastics (well..more like you need the ability to think fast without superpower brute-forcing), have a bunch of heuristics to help them think things through,yes.

The problem is that a lot of these heuristics have their problems or work well enough for six foot creatures navigating a much smaller environment. The Entities have shown power that would make them need it as much as a plane would need a horse to traverse the landscape, even if the horse had advantages the gap in speed is just too great. Not to mention that they themselves can learn and it would be significantly easier for them to learn the valid human mental tools than it would be for humans to just explode in processing power.
