I...dunno.

The way Wildbow uses "creativity" is something that I don't really get. I simply intuitively don't buy the dualism between creativity and massive, massive processing power of the sort the Entities have shown. My natural instinct is that we focus so much on creativity and consider them different because of the weakness of our computers currently and because we can't really model others' brains that well, so everything gets put down to some unpredictable spark like "talent'. This shouldn't be a problem for the Entities yet they're still "dumb".
