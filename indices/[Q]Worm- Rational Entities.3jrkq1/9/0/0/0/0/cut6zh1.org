Maybe the Entities figure that it's better to be cheap than to be fast, and so linking together a large number of small processors that already exist and need little to no resources to use (and that have heuristics that give them the possible ability to happen upon regions of solution-space that the Entities have a difficult time reaching due to their own mental architecture) is a good idea. Or maybe they do work on the problem on their own as well, and just figure that there's no reason not to take advantage of humans as well while they're at it.

Obviously it's a plot device to force the story to exist, but I don't find it sufficiently distracting to really stop me from enjoying the story anyway.
