The stupidest thing the entities do is not announce themselves and communicate with their test subjects. You're looking for ideas. You have no need for a double blind here.

"Hi. We are effectively what you would call gods. We are trying to stop entropy in the multiverse. We would like your help. We are willing to help you. This is Panacea-Shard. Use it to help yourselves. This is Accord-Shard and Contessa-Shard. Use it to help us. A catalog of other available shards are available. Please consider carefully the implications of a multiverse and its entropic decay we seek to reverse. Here is our work so far. And here is a crapload of Tinker-Shards. Try to find some combination that reverse entropy on a multiversal scale instead of just stealing from other universes. This is your new best friend, Simurgh. It will let you know when someone has found something significant, and will build anything you can imagine sufficiently well, just in case you need some vital testing apparatus. This is your other new best friend, Behemoth. We're putting it right here, in this barren wasteland, and it will crap infinite energy into the environment for you to use to power whatever you need. Just build something around it to eat the energy. This is your other new best friend, Khonsu. If you need to be somewhere, or need more time to think, walk into the spinny thing. Oh look, you've invented a Khepri already? Yes, that's what we're talking about, very good. Let's get this done."
