Reminds me of [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mad-science-intensifies-yet-another-worm-cyoa-fic.14968/page-2#post-2924670][this]] CYOA fanfiction, where after hacking his way to godlike power, the protagonist starts dealing with the Entities as a whole:

#+begin_quote
  It was at this point I realized that, given my current capabilities and all the horrors the Entities were responsible for, I might as well go genocide them. However, it was not impossible (improbable, but not impossible) that there were a few entities who might possibly be described as ‘benevolent'. Therefore I would target my extermination of the entities on a case-by-case basis.

  First target: Abbadon

  Verdict: Subject appears to not give a shit about the ‘hosts' either way, and does not actively harm or assist them. Seems to like screwing with other entities however. SPARED.

  By my estimates (and highly accurate multiverse-wide D-scans), there were roughly 2*10^{3010} Entities in existence. This would take a while. Ultimately I just decided to fork my consciousness 10^{3008} times so each fork would only need to deal with 100 entities before re-merging. I had more than enough bodies to do it without needing to grow any further.

  The particular thread of consciousness this narrative will follow had to deal with the following

  Subject: #001

  Verdict: This entity is extremely blunt about its intentions at a given world, blatantly stating that it needs them for their problem solving abilities, and its nature. It does not have a partner, and does not give out powers. SPARED.

  Subjects #002 & #003

  Verdict: These entities are even worse than Eden and Zion. They give out powers to people most likely to sacrifice themselves to protect others, then get their conflict quota by assaulting the target world with an endless stream of kaiju. ERASED.

  Subject #004

  Verdict: Uses standard methodology of granting powers to those who suffer trauma. These powers do not mentally influence host species, unlike those granted by subjects Zion and Eden. Does not use endbringers or manifest an avatar, merely allowing psychology and infighting to produce conflict. Still commits genocide at end of cycle. ERASED.

  Subject #005

  Verdict: Grants 30,000 shards (power granting included) to a single host, who is selected as the one most likely to lead their species to greatness, with them usually becoming a benevolent dictator. It doesn't grant Tinker powers. Ever. At end of cycle, it copies the functionality of the specie's technology, adding it to its own repertoire, and uses shaper powers to copy-paste back all the shards it gave out before leaving. Worth noting is that this entity seems to have taken up the hobby of etching quite intricate designs onto small planetoids. SPARED. CONTACTED.

  Subject #006

  Verdict: This entity is using the Standard Eden/Zion methodology. Analysis indicates it spawned from them about 10 cycles ago, and evolved to go solo. ERASED.

  Subject #007

  Verdict: Uses methodology from subject #004. Will now be referred to as Cycle 4. ERASED.

  Subject #008

  Verdict: Subject is using methodology 2 (endless kaiju barrage). ERASED. Cycle in progress, derailing. Stopping kaiju maker. Re-programming remaining shards to bud to hosts likely to improve people's lives and removing mental contamination.

  Subject #009

  Verdict: Subject is not granting powers per say, but twists target civilizations towards species-wide mad scientist syndrome. Still commits genocide at end of cycle. ERASED. Dub as methodology 9.
