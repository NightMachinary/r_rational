Well, I may be wrong about this, but it seems to me that the only shards that would even have a chance of doing something against entropy would be thinkers and tinkers. Thinkers because perhaps that species would be able to see something in the data that you couldn't, and tinkers because of the unique position of technology wherein it can actually improve over time. It seems that it'd be really stupid to give shards that appear to violate conservation of energy (e.g. Most blasters) but don't (because that would discourage hosts from trying to find solutions). Tl;dr: Few shards would be actively helpful for their goals, and many are probably actively hampering them.
