The entities are capable of perfectly modeling humans (shown in Eden's interlude if nowhere else). They're also capable of blocking cooperation when it happens. So ... it would take a very specific sort of psychology in order to recognize that humans will attempt cooperation with each other and then subvert that, while also not understanding that cooperation is valid for arriving at solutions. Possible, but seems utterly contrived to me.
