Perhaps everybody's just wrong about the Entities being made for preventing Heat Death through experimentation.

Because if you look at it from that angle, the Entities don't look like they're optimizing for producing practical schemes for combining powersets to reverse heat-death.

They look like they're optimizing for creating individual powers that are really good at keeping the user on top of things in a world of constant, endless conflict, where literally nobody else can be trusted.

What sort of a conflict has those aspects? An invasion by superpowered infiltrator pod-people? A cosmic-level zombie plague? If we follow this train of thought, the implicit 'actual threat' the Entities are preparing for starts looking pretty scary.
