Yeah, the issues the Entities face is:

1. Though the univere (s) they inhabit are truly stupendously enormous, with more universes than there are atoms in any one reality, they're explicitly finite in number and (presumably) each still subject to entropy.

So when Phir Se launches a giant laser beam or Alexandria lifts a building pillar, they're all borrowing that energy, in one form or another, from another reality.

The entities are trying to get around this ultimate problem, because the other solutions (that readers try to propose as if they're original) like birth control or cooperation, are not long-term solutions at all.
