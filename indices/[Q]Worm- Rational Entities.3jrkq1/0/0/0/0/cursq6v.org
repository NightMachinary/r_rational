Oh yeah, I wasn't attacking your ideas, I was really attacking the common fanon on Spacebattles or [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]], that the issue with entities is that they're not like humans and that they should form societies.

Its like proposing that the issue with people is that they don't cooperate like ants do, so we should adopt ant-like societal structures.

Apologies for the confusion.

I think your idea for cooperation amongst hosts is good, but remember that cooperation does happen. Only in small groups, and large-scale cooperation, absent Cauldron meddling, is extremely unlikely amongst para humans, but it does happen.

Look at the Undersiders, the gangs, etc.

The entities think that that kind of small-scale cooperation is better than societal cooperation, probably because they figure super large-scale cooperation will just lead to orderly societies, which aren't as innovative (so they think) as constant low-grade conflict.
