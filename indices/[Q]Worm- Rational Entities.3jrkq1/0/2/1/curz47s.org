Its complicated. From the little psychology we get of the Entities we know the following:

1. They originate on a planet where they've devoured everything else, consumed all resources, and are stuck in an endless loop that will eventually spiral into a local lack of usable energy/food.

2. A lone entity proposes an idea-->everyone consume everyone else, or submit if they're too weak to compete, and the 'winner' of this fight, which is really a meal/absorption, will spread from that planet to other planets.

3. This idea wins out, the entities cooperate/eat each other, and spread to other planets.

Obviously Scion and Eden can cooperate, but it seems that their whole idea of cooperation is centered around this original, nearly religious act of combining into a greater whole for a higher purpose. This is why Eden and Scion are both searching for something that will let them transcend the existence they're now in, where thy spread from planet to planet .

On Earth they limit cooperation to small groups, and actively (in Eden's future through her interference and weak!Endbringers) or passively (through shards selecting impulsive/violent hosts and mild psychological fuckery) limit large-scale organizations from curtailing violence.

It seems to me that they made an educated guess, using precog/modeling, that small-scale cooperation and conflict is better than large-scale cooperation.
