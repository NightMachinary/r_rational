I actually think one of the things the entities are being shown as really (sensibly) good at is adding in restrictions in order to steer away from optimal solutions. That's the whole reason that Manton limits exist; if you give someone the ability to use force fields and make them fight to the death, /of course/ they're going to use that force field in order to just bisect the brain of their opponent. If you give them telekinesis, /of course/ they're going to just end the fight by squeezing someone's heart. So the Manton limits are in place in order to encourage creativity by putting a roadblock in front of the optimal path.

So I'm not sure that the entities would have too much trouble with finding a way to restrict the solution space to those uses which are creative/novel. But maybe you do have a point.
