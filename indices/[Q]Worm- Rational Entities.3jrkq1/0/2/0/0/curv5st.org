One possible answer: Cooperation tends towards a certain set of solutions - Shard A can do X, Shard B can do Y, but combined they can do Z, Z is massively useful. Perhaps societies, if allowed to cooperate enough, settle into a pattern of certain uses of shards for optimum, which is fine and dandy for them, but annoying if you're devouring universes for science. The best way to work out unconventional uses of shards, then, is to encourage novel combinations of shards as dictated by necessity.

I still don't get why they don't land on a planet, upload a bunch of creative monkeys, and feed in data until something useful comes out, at which point they enact the suggested interaction themselves.
