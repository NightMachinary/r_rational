The entities are acting stupidly. Really, really stupidly. They built shards to inhibit cooperation in favor of conflict, which means that shards are only getting used by a single person most of the time. As anyone who has posted to even this (comparatively small) subreddit knows, a whole bunch of people working in concert together are going to be much better at finding solutions than a single person working alone.

So if I were a less stupid entity:

- Encourage cooperation, not competition.
- Target shards at people with a high general intelligence factor.

(That's assuming that giving people shards is somehow efficient in the first place, which I'm not convinced of, but we don't know enough about the entity's limits or capabilities, nor about the various costs incurred. It's well possible that they can beat the heat death of the universe with half a second of thought, if we knew what they could actually do. It's implied that every use of energy is just pulling from a different universe, so somehow that means heat death is still a problem?)

Edit:

- Give the host society some sort of feedback on their energy usage. Parahumans currently have no way of knowing what kind of power they're drawing, or even that the energy isn't "free", so why would they optimize for efficiency? They're just going to be blowing through their power stores without fear of consequence, which is the opposite of what you'd want if you were trying to get some novel applications that are good for preventing the heat death of the universe.
