I believe the Scion entity didn't trust itself to be creative. They seek out other life forms because they recognize their own lack of creativity, even though it does seem as if they are, in fact, capable of being creative. Eden seemed like it might be creative after being exposed to Abaddon, but died because creativity overwhelmed it, and it crashed.

On the one hand, we say that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, but what happens when you don't realize that you have, in fact, learned from history, but you don't /quite/ understand that you have grown?

One could also make the assessment that Eden and Scion were approached by a far more successful member of their race. Abaddon was a single entity, not a pair. After it interacted with Eden, eventually Eden and Scion's existence were ended. This indicated to me that Abaddon was far smarter and more creative than Eden and Scion. It set a chain of events in place which led to the death of two of it's competitors, and all their future offspring.

Abaddon started from the same source as Eden and Scion. Somehow, it developed differently. So on one level, the space whale learning process worked. Evolution will now move forward. Eden and Scion were simply unable to compete with the more advanced Abaddon.
