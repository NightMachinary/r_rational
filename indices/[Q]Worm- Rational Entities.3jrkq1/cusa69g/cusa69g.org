I played around with similar thoughts a while ago. One interpretation I came up with is that the entities are not sentient, but shards are. The entity is essentially a giant biological bureaucracy of shards, and the shards are all highly selfish competitors. Were the shards to attempt to solve entropy directly, their methods would be determined not by the ideal value of information but by the ease of negotiations, political alliances, unimportant path dependent occurrences, that sort of thing. So using planets as natural experiments and tying each shard to a host that is difficult to manipulate offers a way of preventing biased incentive structures from determining the results of their study, which seems similar to the lines you're thinking along.
