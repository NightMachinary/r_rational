This is handwaved/explained by precog/simulation powers generally requiring more energy to predict a future and mine that information than it would to carry out that whole scenario.

Given that entities are concerned about total usable energy in the universe, this is why entities generally use it sparingly.

Even Scion, who (mostly casually) destroys continents and Endbringers by the end, sparingly uses precog. It's obviously immensely costly.
