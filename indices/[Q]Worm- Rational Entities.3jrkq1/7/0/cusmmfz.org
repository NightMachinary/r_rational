Heat death of the universe is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-quotes-and-wog-repository.294448/page-3#post-15024624][Word of God]].

#+begin_quote
  The entities are trying to answer a question. How do they survive when they're done? When all's said and done and they've taken every planet and everything's shifting toward the same ambient state. How do they survive the heat death of the universe? They don't have the answer, and if they're going to use simulations to figure it out, they need as much data as possible to justify the expense, by the time they reach that point. They don't have a lot of creativity, so they borrow it from others. From humans.
