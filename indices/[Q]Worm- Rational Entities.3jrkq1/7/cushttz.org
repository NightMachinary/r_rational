Things like path to victory cost them lifespan. They have a certain amount of a certain resource, and deplete it by using their abilities, and recharge it by giving their powers to "mortals" and taking them back and seeing all the new combinations and doing something with that information. I don't remember anything about heat death of the universe being mentioned.
