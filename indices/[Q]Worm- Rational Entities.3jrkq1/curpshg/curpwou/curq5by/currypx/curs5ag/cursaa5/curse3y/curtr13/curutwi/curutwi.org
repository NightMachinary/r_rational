If you can go back in time you can use it for computation, and live forever in a never-quite-closed Groundhog Day loop.

Of course to outside entities that would look like you just vanished, or if your own extrapolated future states aren't stable you'd fall out of the loop in a randomized state, but to you you're as immortal as you can be in a different direction of time.
