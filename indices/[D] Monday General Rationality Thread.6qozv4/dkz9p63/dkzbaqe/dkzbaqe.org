My solution for this might be super weird, but the way I try to correct this bug is to expose myself to anecdotes where things seemed like they could go horribly wrong that don't. That's how I'm able to trick myself into seeing optimism as rational, sometimes things do just work out as you wanted them to.

Where this gets weird is that I know my brain interprets enjoyable stories as if they were anecdotes of real events, so I just watch slice of life anime as a way of reassuring my subconscious that it's okay to be content sometimes. Seeing likable character go through life with no major conflicts is soothing.

/K-On!/ helped me get me through the worst string of anxiety attacks I've had in my life and I've heard /School-Live/ is interesting in how it shows people being happy in an objectively horrible situation, but the one that seems most applicable to you is /Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid/.

One of the reoccurring themes of Dragon Maid is how the situation the characters are in could collapse at any moment because of the dragons power and inhuman psychology, but then it doesn't so they all get on with their lives. It helps that the characters and setting are actually quite rational.
