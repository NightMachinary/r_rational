Look for "Junior Software Developer", "Junior Software Engineer", Junior Application Developer", "Junior Programming Analyst" and anything else that fits the pattern "Junior #Technology-Noun #Profession-Noun" (If you're looking to write software, that is.)

Your degree will help (two of my colleagues are math majors) but unless you're familiar with programming it probably won't be quite enough. I'd suggest going through some online training courses. Places like [[http://codingbat.com/java]] and Codeacademy.com are both highly structured and were wonderful for when I was learning.

I hope this helps some!
