What are some good entry-level jobs in STEM I should consider searching for? I recently graduated with bachelor's degrees in physics and math, but have no work experience relevant to those fields. I need to make $2,000 a month to support myself and I've yet to find a decent job on the boards I've subscribed to.

The suggestion I've heard more than any other is teaching, but I *really* don't want to be a teacher. I managed to find part-time work as a tutor, but it doesn't pay much. Some people have suggested looking into IT jobs, but while I /can/ code I have very little experience and no computer science degree.

It doesn't help that my social anxiety makes it difficult to market myself. Even writing a cover letter feels like more trouble than it's worth when I'm applying to so many jobs and not getting any callbacks.
