From my experience with interviewing and hiring, the only standout negative aspect of your resume is the lack of work experience. Not particularly helpful, I know (since the only way to add to that is to get hired somewhere), but I'm mentioning it if only to assuage your fears that you're "doing something wrong." Also, if you've been working as a tutor, I would suggest adding that to the list.

As for specific entry-level jobs, +1 to [[/u/ToBeKing89][u/ToBeKing89]] 's suggestion of Implementation or Technical Support. While support experience helps, many companies prioritize general problem solving skills, professional demeanor, and demonstrated ability to learn (you'll generally be supporting their software, and they don't expect you to know it coming in). Additionally, Technical Support is often a great jumping off point for higher-paying jobs in development, operations, etc.

Some potential job titles in this sub-field:

- Technical Support Engineer
- Customer Success Engineer
- (Technical) Implementation Engineer
- Professional Services
- Technical Account Manager
