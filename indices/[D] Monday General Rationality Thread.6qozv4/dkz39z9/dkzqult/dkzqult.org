Going into IT can get you a pretty decent job in San Francisco, San Jose, or Sacramento. This is how I got my foot in the door in the tech industry and it worked well for me. You can expect a starting salary that is enough to support a single person in the area. Back when I got started, this was 40,000/year with no IT-related credentials, which is enough to survive but (at effectively $20/hr) not a particularly good salary if you are in IT, and quite bad if you go into programming. If you have the skills to get a job in programming, this pays much better. I was not able to get one without a relevant degree or experience at first.
