Because the writing skills thread is defunct, I'm going to use this thread to discuss my story each week unless there's a problem with that? (The Friday Off-Topic thread is less convenient for me for Reasons)

So, here's my weekly random stream of consciousness update about my in-progress rational supernatural romance story:

After some intense beta reading from my husband and partner, I'm probably going to have to rip the entire thing into tiny pieces and then reassemble it again. (Also, re-reading it after putting it on the shelf for 3-6 months has made me hate parts of it, and made parts of it seem out of place). It's daunting but ultimately the story will be better for it. I'm still not completely satisfied with the major conflict, and I need to live in the main villain's head a bit more too. Plus I need to add more... life to the romance. Fortunately all that crap is in my head, so I just need to put that on the page, so that's easy.

So all in all, my coauthor not being available to do any of /her/ vitally important edits has been less of an issue than I thought since the whole thing needs a bunch of stuff done to it that I'm perfectly capable of without her.

And I'm learning a lot about writing rationally and worldbuilding from the story. One big concern that keeps coming up is My Vampires are Different, but because vampires want to keep their differences secret they're not obvious to the reader. But I probably need to make more of those differences "reader-facing". The interlude I posted in this thread last week has done that, at least.

Finally: because of plot elements that feature heavily in my story, I'm interested in finding an African-American person who is able to give me their opinion on how I've handled them. Preferably someone in the SJW-type camp as I want to err on the side of getting the story /more/ ripped to shreds rather than less. This will not require reading the full story (unless you really want to), I would abridge it to include only the stuff I'm most concerned about. (Or if anyone has recommendations for a subreddit or other place I can go to find someone, or knows someone who might be willing to do it).
