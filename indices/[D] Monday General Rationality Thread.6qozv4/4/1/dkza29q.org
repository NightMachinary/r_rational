Hm. I would generally use the red line in both cases, but that's because I have a thing for arbitrary rules that have no moral weight but collectively make up a substantial amount of civilization's glue, and am inclined to follow them.

Sometimes I still cut across grass rather than the sidewalk when I'm on my college campus, though, so who knows? Maybe my brain just isn't convinced that "don't walk on the grass" is a real rule, or it thinks that the rule is only real in certain cases (I never cut across the grass of individual properties).
