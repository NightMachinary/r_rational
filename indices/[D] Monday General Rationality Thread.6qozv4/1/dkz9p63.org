I've recently gotten out of a bad situation that I've been dealing with to varying degrees for a few years now, and I'm encountering a pattern of thought that I haven't been able to properly disrupt: I'm feeling genuinely, unreservedly happy--so my brain is /panicking/, looking for the clouds that I've oh-so-obviously missed, if I can be so foolish as to think that things are actually looking up. Worse than thinking that everything is awful is being convinced, on some level that I can't talk myself out of, that if I can't see the Bad Things on the horizon then they must be right behind me.

Anyone know what might help? I'd like to get rid of this, because it'd be nice to not just be happy but be conscious of my happiness without immediately compromising it.

I experience Bipolar-II, a form of bipolar where the lows are not so low, and the highs are not so high, as in the bipolar disorder that most people think of, but they are much more common. This might be relevant.

Now that I've finally moved out of a town where my only options for therapy are "Shitty counselors whose jobs I could do for them" and "People who endorse crystal healing, gay conversion therapy, or both," I'm going to see about getting a professional, because there's some other stuff that I need to work on too, but it seems to me like this problem, in particular, might be something that others on this subreddit have had experience with.
