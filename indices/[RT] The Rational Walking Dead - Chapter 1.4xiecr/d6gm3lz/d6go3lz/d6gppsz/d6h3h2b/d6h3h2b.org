The issue is that it's not just a plague, it's every person that dies with their brain mostly intact revives as a zombie. So every single person that dies is a new patient zero. Combine that with some human on human conflict, and I don't think that complete social collapse is off the table. Even if there's only a 1% chance of the cluster fuck getting that bad, "this is a story in which that 1% chance happened" is an acceptable premise for a story, imo.
