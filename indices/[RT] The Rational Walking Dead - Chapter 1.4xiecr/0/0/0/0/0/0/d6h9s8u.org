Well, for starters those are all useful against massed hordes. In, say, a major metropolitan area that's just a clusterfuck of panicked civilians and zombies? How quickly would /you/ give the order to just saturation bomb the whole place? What do you do when afterwards, you learn that there's 30 new outbreaks in the suburbs? What about when they're in your own base because not all of your soldiers who committed suicide after going Full Dresden on a US city thought to shoot themselves in the /head/? When some of your soldiers are panicking and having meltdowns over killing family members and random zombie kids? Throw in a few acts of sabotage from religious fanatics because the end appears extremely fucking nigh. Maybe you couldn't even get authorization to deploy military assets on the mainland US until it was dangerously late in the game due to a government in denial?

Honestly, I still think the "total civilizational collapse" outcome is extremely unlikely, but like I said, it's not off the table. If I were to do a "rational" zombie apocalypse, I'd probably escalate it into something like Cthulhu-cultists with access to necromancy.
