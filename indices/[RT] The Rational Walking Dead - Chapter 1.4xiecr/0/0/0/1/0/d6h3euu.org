Well, from a simple perspective hordes are going to be in urban areas, and tanks can drive through buildings, but only until one of said buildings falls on them.

Tanks are fine in a zombie horde, just as long as they are buttoned up and don't try to save anyone. Zombie swarm in the open are toast.

Zombie swarms in a skyscraper, with survivors in it, call for the demolition of the building. Not because I am a heartless bastard, but because zombies are really scary on the game theory side. Cheap troops that are generally immune to light caliber small arms fire and some significant percentage of every civilian killed becomes another zombie.

After a zombie outbreak kicks off the game theory side is all about preventing the spread that will both cost you population and infrastructure needed to fight the swarm, and expand the outbreak.
