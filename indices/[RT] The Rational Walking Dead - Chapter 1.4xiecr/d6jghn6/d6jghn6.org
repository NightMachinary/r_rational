[[http://www.baen.com/categories/books-by-series-list/council-wars-by-john-ringo.html,%20%5BPosleen%20Wars%5D(http://www.baen.com/a-hymn-before-battle.html][Council Wars]] and *definitely* [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457572/][Fido]] may be of interest.

CW is about abrupt collapse of high-tech civilization, and is basically about the historical re-enactors / creators using anachronistic know-how to survive (and then thrive) against magic-via-tech opponents. Some parts are extremely cheesy, and is DEFINITELY a military wank-fest. I still read it, and it is likely to provide good inspiration for how to run something vaguely similar to a post-zombie apocalypse society.

PW is about the Army Corps of Engineers teaching a horde enemy to be afraid. And shitty alien politics. But if you want ideas for how a drastically superior and horrible outnumbered force can fight unarmed hordes? Should provide some.

But Fido! Fido is, actually, perhaps, one of the more intelligent handling of a post-zombie world, although it's predicated on a few premises that won't really translate. Still! Should also be good for inspiration, if only for smaller cultural touches, like burial rituals and nursery rhymes. Definitely deals with the whole "when anyone dies they come back" issue, which IMO isn't too bad to deal with if you know it's coming.
