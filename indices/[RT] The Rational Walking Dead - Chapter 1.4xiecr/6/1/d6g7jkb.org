I disagree. My favorite rational fiction stories all take place in fantasy settings or with fantasy elements. A writer doesn't need to give a logical explanation for Hogwarts, Krypton, vampires, or superpowers. The way characters respond to their unlikely settings is what makes the fiction rational or not.
