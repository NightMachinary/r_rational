Well if you were to make the Walking Dead rational, you'd have to reevaluate how the zombies work before anything else. There's nothing wrong with having a reanimated corpse or some sort of prion based virus hijacking an individuals body. But to have essentially a carcass remain mobile for years on end without consuming food, being constantly exposed to the elements, and in a state of near perpetual motion is far from logical. The average human corpse takes around a month to completely putrefy, and that's only while remaining stationary.Add in the heat and humidity present in Atlanta or DC with the presence of flesh burrowing insects like maggots and the like, the prospect of a zombie apocalypse becomes less a matter of years of survival or rebuilding society, and more waiting for what amounts to about a semester of school
