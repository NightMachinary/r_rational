I figured it out when I started reading The Nothing Mage by Nixia on RR. The things this story has that I want right now are:

A world where magic is commonplace

A world where efforts to understand that magic have been undertaken, with the attempts making enough progress such that the magic system is relatively hard (as opposed to soft magic) by the time the story takes place. This is why I thought people on this subreddit might have good recommendations.

A main character who has a unique trait that makes them able to do unexpected things with magic (greater versatility, greater power, quicker at learning, whatever) and makes sense in the magic system, it isn't just them being the chosen one or whatever. I really like this about The Nothing Mage. Basically magic is like EM radiation and the main character's mana is at an extremely high frequency and low amplitude, making it nearly a straight line, so he can copy other kinds of mana by bending his nearly straight mana into any wave.

That main character begins relatively untrained at magic and a solid part of the story involves them progressing in skill/capacity

I think that so far, the only stories that I have read that have all of these things are Mother of Learning, The Nothing Mage, and the Mage Errant books. These are also the stories I've read recently that I've enjoyed the most, so I definitely think I've found a genre of fantasy that I really like. Now I just need to find more stories that meet it! Any recommendations for someone who likes these things in fantasy? Also, I don't care too much about the quality of the writing so long as the worldbuilding is interesting and the dialogue isn't completely inane, so feel free to recommend lesser known webfictions or books.
