The first... six arcs? are kinda like that; feeling a bit disjointed, others have called it a "monster of the week"-formula. They mostly tie into a greater plot later on, but it's not an immediately apparent one.

The story lives and dies with how much you like reading about the Lambs, much more than Worm hung on the Undersiders. They don't really have a greater cause, at least not until quite a ways into the story.
