[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-high-priest-worm-dresden-files.752524/][The High Priest]]: Worm's Eidolon from his death during GM in Dresden Files post-Skin Games IIRC. Pretty sure it's dead.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tower-of-adamant-worm-dresden-files-crossover.782339/][Tower of Adamant]]: Worm's Alexandria from when Skitter killed her during Cell into Dresden Files. Still updating, not much is there yet.

Not actually a crossover, but perhaps relevant:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/skitter-studies-dresden-files-worm.36003/][Skitter Studies]], which reconstructs the Worm setting using DF characters, organizations, and mechanics. Taylor is a witch, like her mom was, the Empire Eighty-Eight are White Court vampires, Lung is a Dragon Disciple, and Emily Piggot heads the city's Special Investigations Department, which is handed all the "weird" cases and told to find explanations that don't involve words like "Magic", "Troll", and "Nevernever".
