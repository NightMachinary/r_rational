I would add the web serial "The Iron Teeth" to your list. Blacknail, the goblin protagonist, is initially very hard to sympathize with but if you stick it out you'll get decent characterization, good world building, a logical magic system, and good combat scenes.

I've found Ward, Worm's sequel, very good after initially not liking the idea of the main character and her particular issues not resonating with me.
