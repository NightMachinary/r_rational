I never see people talking about this series, despite it being one of the old school actually good HP fanfictions. Good to see it mentioned. I definitely enjoyed the series, and the author has recently begun writing/releasing the next book after a seven year break. I honestly feel they could strip out the (few) explicitly harry potter aspects with ease and publish it. The protagonist is quite entertaining (though not exactly rational) and the american magical culture is really interesting. I will say the series is kinda depressing.
