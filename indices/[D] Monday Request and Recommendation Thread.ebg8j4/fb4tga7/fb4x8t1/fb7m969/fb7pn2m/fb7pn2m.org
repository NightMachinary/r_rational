That doesn't make it antirational, in my opinion. While Alexandra acts like a muleheaded child, /the world reacts to her like to a muleheaded child/. She gets in trouble with all and any authorities, scares away people, and largely gains admiration only from other troublemakers.

You could claim it's unrealistic that she doesn't learn from her mistakes, or not quickly enough, but I'd have to disagree. Kids sometimes /are/ that stubborn and difficult to reign in. Add to that that most of the time, her disobeying didn't only get her punishments but also tangible benefits, and it's easy to see why she keeps acting like she does.
