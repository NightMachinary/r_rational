I've recently been looking into alternative sources for my fiction, and tried spending a day delving into the depths of AO3, before finding that I simply... couldn't.

I've delved in the depths of many fanfiction or original fiction sites (SB, SV, FF.net, RR, AH, TopWebFiction-even QQ, Anonkun and FimFiction with careful search filters) over the years, and it seems this is the one whose search function I just can't tackle. Not even FanFiction.net has buried me in such a horrible deluge of mediocre, poorly written yaoi smut when I just wanted something, /anything/ interesting to kill time with.

And so I turn to you, the [[/r/rational]] community. If any of you know of interesting, preferably long running fiction hosted on the Archive of Our Own, please spare me the pain of seeking it out.
