The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Alexandra Quick]] series is on AO3. It's set in the world of Harry Potter, but in the US in the 2000s. It follows a rather headstrong girl who grew up muggle, and is invited to a wizarding school. I'd say the writing is better than canon, and I find Alexandra a more interesting protagonist too. Wouldn't call it /rational/, but the worldbuilding makes more sense than most magical worlds.

Right now the series is on book five, where each book contains a separate schoolyear, but also contributes to a larger plot more than each HP book did. In total it's more than a million words, so you'll have enough to dig through.
