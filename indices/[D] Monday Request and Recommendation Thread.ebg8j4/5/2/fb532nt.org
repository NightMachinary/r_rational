After that it becomes fandom dependent. Certain fandoms attract too much bad romance to be worthwhile, but it's not like they're any better on ff.net

Also, if you haven't checked them out yet, go to SB/SV/AH/QQ for older, male-dominated fanfiction fandoms. Writing quality isn't any better than female fanfiction authors in the same age cohort, but romance stories are much rarer. Royalroad is a younger, male-dominate original fictiom platform, with attendant age demographic problems.
