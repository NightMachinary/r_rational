*SPOILERS*

I disagree with most of that (obviously, having liked it), but fwiw: I thought the social manipulation was hamfisted at times, lacking the finesse or persuasiveness of perfectly delivered manipulation. However, it was more than good enough in execution, especially because the narration goes into detail on /how and why/ it would work. Also on the contrary, there's only been a few longer interactions but the characters that were given social screentime had plenty of life. Excepting the great prologue, they're ordinary people with ordinary inertia (I don't know what your standard is for "inner life"). There are quite a lot of OCs later by necessity and most of them stand out. There's a weight to their names, not as major players but as real voices - albeit drawn into the wake of Taylor's charisma.

I actually thought the action sequences were well done, not dragging on but long enough to paint a challenge. Also given her powers and the crossover, I don't see a reason for condemning fisticuffs. Without asking the author to use a different alt-power, what uniqueness is possible within the limitations of Taylor's current powers and means? Personally I think the body control aspect is a tad overpowered, but we're in a sub that appreciates utility, so I wouldn't condemn usage of powers until it becomes a crutch that resolves all (cape) fights. Rather I feel like the power is /too/ ambitious in scope - as her arsenal grows, it becomes harder and harder to rationally justify why she uses one power and not another.

I might've made a mistake bringing up moral ambiguity, when it's more like moral irony. Taylor is the definition of neutral evil (with some caveats and lawful/chaotic moments), but the fic doesn't hide that. It constantly reminds you she's a sociopath, but one that's /evil to evil/ (or at least those seemingly deserving of it). If there's any moral ambiguity, it's a question of whether the enemy of my enemy is a friend.

It's not supposed to be a real mystery beyond the 2nd time it happens, but I do think the scenes when her power's off could better illustrate the psychological contrast. At the moment, she's slowly desensitizing but without the power on, she's just not different enough to sell the whole guilt-ridden nausea blackouts.
