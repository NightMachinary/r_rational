It felt like reading the Jack Slash interlude, except not as a subversion. Both are constantly exerting violence, both are surrounded by people who approve of their every action, neither are ever in danger except of getting bored. The difference is that Jack is portrayed as thinking himself smarter than he is, while the author of that fic seems to want us to accept that yes, Taylor /is/ the smartest cookie in the room.
