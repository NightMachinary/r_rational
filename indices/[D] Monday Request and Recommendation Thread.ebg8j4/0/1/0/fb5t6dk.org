Thanks! I'm just looking for good stories, maybe lesser known or newer ones as I've read a lot of the well regarded ones years ago. Sadly I've read all three of those and recommend them as well.

On top of Monster, I'd also recommend the author's (Naoki Urasawa) other works, especially /20th Century Boys/ and /Pluto/.
