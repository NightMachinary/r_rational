I don't wanna get too deep into Godwin's Law, as I lack the expertise to convincingly argue either side. But if we're comparing to actual history, it's misleading to imply that Hitler was solely responsible for his policies. He's been vilified to the point where people like to treat him as the source of all Nazi Germany's evils, when he's really just one person. Yes, he's the spearhead enabling everything, but those policies didn't happen in a vacuum. Besides the faulty premise here, you're setting up a straw man when you claim Tanya would surely have approved the assassination campaign (also might be mixing up premises, is the assassination of communists one of Hitler's unacceptable policies?). There's a few other fallacies here but I'm too sleepy to pick them out. Anyways, just wanna say I'm not saying your overall interpretation is wrong. If you see it this way, someone else surely does too. Overall I feel it's pro-Hitler's successful policies and anti-Hitler's atrocity-related policies.
