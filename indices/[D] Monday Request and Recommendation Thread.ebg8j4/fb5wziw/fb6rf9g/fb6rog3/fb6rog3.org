  why not have everyone ask around for interested and committed participants and play a private game on a specialized forum

That's essentially what the xkcd forum became, and people got new jobs, had kids, I went on a long holiday, etc and we stopped having the number of people we needed for a fun game. It's hard to play when you can only get 7 players; I'd love to play in a 25 player game again, which are tons of fun but the xkcd forum hadn't been able to support that for like 5 years. So yeah, the problem was also attrition and not having new people coming on.

The online mafia games we played were really excellent: we used lots of stuff I found really innovative, with plotting and tons of interesting flavour text and a bunch of creative powers.

It's different to in person, because you analyse peoples' posts, and you can go back in time and find things from past game Days. So it's a more analytical game. It also allows some really strange and fun powers. I highly recommend it!
