I was looking for this rec. It is really, /really/ good. Its worldbuilding is great, and while it doesn't get as much focus as the worldbuilding in something like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]] (another major rec on my part), it's one of the greats nonetheless.
