*TL;DR: anyone know of a play-by-post forum mafia somewhere and that they want to recommend?*

A bit of a random one:

You know forum mafia/werewolf? Where there's ~10 players, 3 are bad guys, and you have to vote each other out, night powers, plot, etc?

I've been playing it on the xkcd forums with a group of about ~7-8 regulars who are very enthusiastic... and then the xkcd forum has been down for 3-4 months and will probably be down forever, as new signups to the forum broke about 2 years ago and it was unlinked from xkcd.com at about the same time.

So now the 7-8 of us want to find a forum where we can play mafia: we don't really care what the forum is for (a hungarian soccer team fan forum? sure thing, as long as they play mafia in English!). We don't particularly want to join mafiascum or any of the really big mafia forums, we are hoping for something with O(10-50) active users as we liked the small community feel of xkcd. Because forums seem to be withering away in general, we know that we'd have welcomed an influx of 7-8 new plays a year ago, so the ideal would be for a smallish forum to be equally excited to make some new friends/players. But we're not fussy.
