[[https://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/circus-maximus.78/][Smogon's forum games message board]] hosts a lot of mafia and mafia-derived games. NOC (no outside communication) games sound the closest to play by post. Other games allow for outside communication (Discord (they have a discord server) , etc.).

Edit: You mentioned that you've seen interesting games with interesting mechanics and flavor text. These have become the norm in Smogon mafia games.
