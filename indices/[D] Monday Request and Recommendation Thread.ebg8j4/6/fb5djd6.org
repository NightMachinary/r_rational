I'd really like to recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896/chapters/35757684][Hear the Silence]], by EmptySurface. An excellently written Naruto SI, with realistic characters and a well thought out world behind them. At over half a million words and still regularly updating, I believe this to be one of the best self inserts I've read, and one of the best interpretations of the Elemental Nations I've yet come across. Because when you have child soldiers, what do you really need? That's right, therapists.
