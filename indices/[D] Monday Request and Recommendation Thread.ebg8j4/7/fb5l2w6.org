I started "The Lies of Locke Lamora" recently as per a recommendation from the Friday Threads. Really enjoying it so far and recommend it for a fun protagonist.

I also started Game of Thrones and wonder if there's anything similar but more [[/r/rational]].

Are there any books, shows or fics with political intrigue and characters like Littlefinger, Margaery Tyrell or Tywin Lannister?
