[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig's]] protagonist, Sylvester, lives and breathes social manipulation and intrigue. Every word out of his mouth is carefully crafted for its intended audience. He has only one goal in life; keep his friends and himself alive, and he'll go to whatever length to achieve that.

The setting isn't medieval low-fantasy, but 1920s alt-history, where the Frankenstein experiments were picked up by the British empire, who then went on to conquer and subjugate large parts of the world with their zombie armies. It plays out on the American continent, in the Crown States, which are on the brink of a rebellion.

Sylvester and his friends are an Academy Superweapon project geared for stealth and infiltration, and they will be used in that war. The story is about these Lambs growing up and finding some independence from their creators.
