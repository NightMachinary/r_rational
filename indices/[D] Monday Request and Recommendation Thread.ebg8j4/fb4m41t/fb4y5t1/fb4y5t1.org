I'd like to recommend [[https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/][Should the Sun not Rise]], a complete Urban Fantasy webserial set in contemporary America. It follows a woman of supernatural Aztec origins (what kind is a spoiler, revealed halfway through). She's been largely ignoring society, waiting for the day when someone inevitably catches proof of the supernatural on video and brings supernatural beings into the spotlight. Her solitary existence is shaken when murder victims are found, killed in the style of Aztec sacrifices. As she is the prime suspect, she's forced to investigate and prove her innocence.

I enjoyed the themes of the work, her struggle to stay human even though everything in her nature wants her to rip people's hearts out on top of pyramid. Mesoamerican religion and history isn't really taught here in German schools, so that was a nice change, too. Also it had a fascinating chapter, where a Professor of Mesoamerican history sat down with a young woman and unknowingly had a conversation about religion, identity, and culture of a time period she actually lived through.
