I read most of it, but could not really enjoy it due to some worldbuiling/setting aspects:

(It's been a while, so I might misremember some details.)

- The world feels incredibly small.

  - We are told that this is a world in which all the myths are true. But we introduced to only a few characters in a single city. You can pinpoint the culprit way before any incriminating evidence is presented, just because there are no other possible suspects. There is just no sense that anything interesting exists beyond this city and a handful of people.

- The supernatural powers are very weak. Mere gimmicks for the most part.

  - A ghost or a monster of ancient mythology, you are probably better off with a gun and a couple of grenades than trying to rely on their magic in combat. Spiky stone forearms, exploding hummingbirds or werecoyotes are not really more threatening than a mob hitman.

- A couple of backyard rituals, or even just the exposure of the supernatural to a wider portion of the public can end the age of man and usher in a new age of magic.

  - This has been so for centuries and is a stable state of affairs. Somehow. This is despite the fact that the enforcement of the secrecy of the supernatural ranges from incredibly ad-hoc to non-existent.

- Relating to the previous point, it is noted in the story that the proliferation of smart phones will reveal the supernatural to the public and usher in a new age of magic soonish anyway. So the whole central struggle seems a bit pointless.
