[[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]], currently 760+ English translated chapters and nearly 400 chapters ahead in original Chinese.

It's certainly "alternative", considering it's a translated original work from a non-English author. If you can stomach through the sometimes questionable word choices by the translator, it has an excellent overarching plot with many cinematic moments that transcends language barriers.

The work also stars one of my favourite rationalist MCs, someone who makes logical inferences in his head that you can follow along with like a "Level 2 Intelligent" character as described by [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]. I've been recommending this work constantly here.
