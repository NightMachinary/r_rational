I'm a little late here so I'm assuming that I won't get answers but I'll try anyway. Does there exist any good or rational fanfics based on the league of legends universe?

I've been reading up on the lore but in essence it seems that their fantasy earth was created by one group of deities("good") in order to produce living weapons that could be used in a war against another group of deities("evil"), The "evil" group seems to have low creativity but by analyzing the earthlings they can now create their own living weapons. It seems like an interesting premise and I'd love to see it explored.
