Definitely not wildbow levels (circa pact anyway). spoilers It's kinda a downward spiral. She gets screwed by the system (and fate) repeatedly. She very often overcomes problems by strategies that just cause bigger, slightly delayed problems, or sacrifice the unique advantages her efforts have earned for ephemeral gains (she's really not very careful or rational here, and has a bias for taking action even when sitting back would clearly be better. It makes her an exciting protagonist, but also sometimes annoying -- less so than eg Harry Potter though). For example look at the description of the newest book which succinctly describes how we last left off seven years ago. "Expelled from Charmbridge Academy, wandless, and fated to die..." Admittedly she doesn't really let this get her down, which makes it readable, but I found it a bit depressing.
