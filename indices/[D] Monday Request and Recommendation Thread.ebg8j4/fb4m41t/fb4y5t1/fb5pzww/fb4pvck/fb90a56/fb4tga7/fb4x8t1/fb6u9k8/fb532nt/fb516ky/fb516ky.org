Does [[http://topwebfiction.com/][TopWebFiction]] count? Pretty much everything in the top ten or thirty (besides Metaworld Chronicles, for whatever reason) is high-quality and long-running. As far as other webserial recs, I have a bunch, many of which are still active, but not sure that's what you're looking for.

Is 'not being hosted on Ao3' a dealbreaker?
