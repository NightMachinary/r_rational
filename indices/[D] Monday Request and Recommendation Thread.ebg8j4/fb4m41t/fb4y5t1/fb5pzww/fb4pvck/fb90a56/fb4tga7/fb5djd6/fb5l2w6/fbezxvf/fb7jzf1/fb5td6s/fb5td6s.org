I would like to recommend a Worm FanFic. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-different-time-a-different-age-worm-age-swap-au.797873/page-11#post-62811979][A Different Time, A Different Age Worm Age-Swap AU]]

I would say it is as rational as Worm and my favourite fanfic right now

Something odd has happened on Earth Bet. Ages, relationships and social positions have been changed around, and nothing was as how it had been before. What was once the story of a young Taylor Hebert is now the story of a young Danny Hebert, as the boy struggles to find his place in a world that is more of a mess now than it ever has been.

Also looking for similar recommendations.
