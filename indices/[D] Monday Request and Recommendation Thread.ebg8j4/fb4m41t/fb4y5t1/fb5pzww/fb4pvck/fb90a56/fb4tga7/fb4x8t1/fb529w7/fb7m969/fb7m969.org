I'm going to have to antirec this one. I tried to read it but Alexandra makes Harry Potter look like a calm and emotionless doll. Pretty much all of her problems are caused by her impulsiveness and lack of forward thinking or planning, and she often survives just by the skin of her teeth due to the intervention of a more powerful figure or sheer luck. It's well written mechanically, but it's pretty much anti rational.
