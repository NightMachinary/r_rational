Pre-holiday dump of recs, some are repeats from others' recs over the months and definitely missed a bunch. Weekly threads have been awesome at turning up new stuff, but I feel like it's a shame that some excellent recommendations never get a rerun and new community members miss out.

First of all, shoutout to [[/u/Robert_Barlow]] for the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c4pfw9/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/erxw2b1/][Monday rec post with single biggest yield of stories I enjoyed.]] Just a quick summary below of 4/7. Nemesis is short and great, didn't read Magical Girl Escalation Taylor yet and didn't like The Simulacrum.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]] (Youjo Senki) - Source is alt-history of WW era with magic. No knowledge required of canon and much more exciting than its title suggests. Politics in fanfiction has never been so...inadvertent.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-the-gamer.601118/][Greg Veder vs. The World]] (Worm/The Gamer) is a decent Gamer!Greg litrpg action flick, but if you only have patience for one Greg, go for this one instead:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/][A daring synthesis]] (Worm/The Gamer) - The first few chapters are unbelievably cringey (and fortunately intentional), but after that it's quite the trip of self-awareness. All around satisfying character growth and modern bildungsroman (i.e. dank memes).

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/][Deep Red]] (Avatar: The Last Airbender) - Quest played as an OC older sister to Zuko and Azula. Have to agree with Robert_Barlow that the writing is unparalleled for quests, especially considering it was written live (on [[https://fiction.live/stories/Deep-Red/3Qk82fibaeXXuvJXm/home][fiction.live]]). Probably dead, partially due to poor voting. OC aspires to rationality despite her cognitive distortions.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest]] - Tongue-in-cheek title but the best original quest I've read so far (not many). Borrows from light novel and mecha traditions and makes it better. Played as a traumatized veteran mecha-girl who's technically the side character. Good worldbuilding, great technobabble and fight articulation. Not rational; it's basically above average anime.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2][Let Me In 2]] is a sequel fanfic to /Let Me In/ or the superior Swedish original /Let The Right One In/ (recommended). Rational vampire story - read [[/u/Sophronius]]'s [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/btahxu/rec_let_me_in_2_a_rational_vampire_fanfic/][recommendation thread]] for more gushing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17734931/chapters/41842241?view_adult=true][Silent Partner, Unfinished Business]] (Death Note) - Great/thoughtful what-if execution. Naomi Misora survives. One of only two DN fics I've really enjoyed, the other being:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431989/1/If-It-s-Not-Me-It-s-You][If It's Not Me, It's You]] (Death Note) - Light's personality doesn't change when he loses his memories. Cat and mouse a-go with more tension and introspection.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13166639/1/Unmade][Unmade]] (Oregairu) - Hardboiled crime/romcom from the memorable perspective of the cynical loner protagonist of Oregairu. Set years after canon so some familiarity with characters is recommended. On the dramatic side, but each of the opening chapters keeps topping the last. Not rational, but entertaining romcom banter and detective drama.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kaleidoscope.717019/][Kaleidoscope]] (Worm) - If you like the questionable morality of PGTE, you'll probably like this. Anything more would be spoilers: it's a blend of lawful/chaotic/neutral evil done right and Machiavelli would undoubtedly approve.

[[https://mangabat.com/manga/serie-1088885674][Dorohedoro]] (Manga) - Imaginative dungeon-punk (not sure what to classify as) fantasy worldbuilding and characters, though not rational. Quirky and distinctive flavor of grimdark comedy and lighthearted gore.

Now for requests...does anyone have:

1. Quest recommendations with standout storytelling or characters? Some quests are fun to play/watch, but I'm not invested in the characters.

2. Manga recommendations? Preferably seinen.

3. Or rational-enough RPGs/survival games? Preferably on PC.
