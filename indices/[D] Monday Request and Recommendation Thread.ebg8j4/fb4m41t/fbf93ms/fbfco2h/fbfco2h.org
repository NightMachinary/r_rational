I assume you're speaking from a meta standpoint, because in story, everything she does backfires on her intentions, hence "inadvertent." She doesn't downplay her responsibility; she's just written as some near-idiot savant who has zero ability to read the (political) mood. But if we're talking meta, I can see your point about the story validating Hitler's actions and policies. However, I don't see it as apologetics or excuses for Hitler's atrocities. Rather it seems like the story is saying the post-war political climate was an ideal breeding ground for hate and warmongering and that Hitler's actions and policies were successful for a reason. Her hate-on for communism aside, her whole spiel for the rest of the story after the ill-conceived warmongering episode is about avoiding war (albeit wielding a bigger stick as a deterrent). She's no paragon of ethics, but she seems like the eminent politician Hitler would have been if he wasn't completely evil and out to make enemies with the entire world.
