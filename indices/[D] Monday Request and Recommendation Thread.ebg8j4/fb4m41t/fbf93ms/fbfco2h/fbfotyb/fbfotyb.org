You are correct, I am speaking from a meta standpoint. Inside the story, all of her actions make sense from her perspective. Outside the story, events are constructed such that it can make sense, and that she can stay in ignorance of her effects.

For example, at no point does Elya ask for clarification, recognition, or praise for her campaign against the communists. We hear about the leaders being found dead and later the entire organization falls apart from additional missing leadership. Had Elya done so, the campaign could only have continued with Tanya's approval. The situation is constructed such that we, the reader, know that Tanya is not responsible. Since Tanya is filling the role of Hitler within the fictional world, we are meant to conclude that Hitler may not have been responsible for his policies.
