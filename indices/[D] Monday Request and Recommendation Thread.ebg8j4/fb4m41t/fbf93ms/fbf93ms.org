  A Young Woman's Political Record (Youjo Senki) - Source is alt-history of WW era with magic. No knowledge required of canon and much more exciting than its title suggests. Politics in fanfiction has never been so...inadvertent.

I'm not sure if I would call it inadvertent. I got about two-thirds of the way through, and everything about it feels intentional, like an apology for Hitler. At every point, the main character downplays her involvement and responsibility, rising through the political ranks of pre-WWII Germany.

- The execution of the communist party leaders, framed as an overzealous subordinate.
- The call for rounding up and killing all French nationals, framed as trying to drive away moderate voters.
- The increasingly warmongering rhetoric, framed as trying to get France to call for her exile.

The writing is good, but the politics of it feel like it is trying to excuse Hitler's actions and policies by framing each as a reasonable next step.
