If you are looking for a complete story at the end of chapter 20 (if the 28 chapters on fanfiction.net) the author posted:

#+begin_quote
  AN2: If this were a real publication, we would end the book here with Tanya's realization that she's stuck as Chancellor (ideally this would be the end of book 2, with book 1 having ended as she first took the position). I did consider ending the whole story here, but I think there's room for one more plot arc as Tanya works towards peaceful coexistence in Europe. This would be in A Young Woman's Wartime Leadership if it were done up as a separate book/fic.

The author has worked on multiple stories simultaneous before, so although posting has slowed down the story is still going.
