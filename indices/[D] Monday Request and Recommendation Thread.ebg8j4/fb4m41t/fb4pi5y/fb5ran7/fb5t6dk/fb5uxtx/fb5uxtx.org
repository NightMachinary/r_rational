If you're looking for something lesser known, Id recommend Island Mine by Refusenik. Its a rational(ish) short shory, not a manga, but I enjoyed it a lot. The general plot is one guy gaining alien power/technology, and the lengths governments will go to stop him. Despite jokingly calling it "libertarian erotica" I would highly recommend checking it out.
