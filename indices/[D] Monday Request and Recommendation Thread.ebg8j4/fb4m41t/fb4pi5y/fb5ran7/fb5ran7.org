For seinen manga recommendations I've got a few, though I don't kmow if you are looking for rarional-type manga or just general ones.

First there is Berserk. Don't go into this if you're looking for a completed story, cause that probably wont happen before the heat death of the universe. However it is a brutal manga that is exceptionally well done, and I would definitely recommend checking it out. Fair warning, it is decently NSFW.

Another seinen that has more of a "clever" main character is Monster. Featuring a doctor trying to track down a former patient turned serial killer, it's widely renown and for good reason.

On a (slightly) more lighthearted note is Akumetsu. While technically shonen it doesn't fit the sterotypes of the genre. It features a vigilante fighting against widespread corruption within the japanese government.
