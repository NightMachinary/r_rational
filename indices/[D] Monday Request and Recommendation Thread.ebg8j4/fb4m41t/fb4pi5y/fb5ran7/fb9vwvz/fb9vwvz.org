  Kaleidoscope (Worm) - If you like the questionable morality of PGTE, you'll probably like this.

I like PGTE, and I didn't enjoy this. I skimmed more and more as I went until I dropped it after Scarlet 1.12 was page after page of stuff I didn't care about. Spoiler-laden commentary below:

The first few chapters built up something I'd be interested in - it was clear there's something off about our protagonist, but interesting to puzzle out exactly how and what strange goals she might have. But the further I got the less substantial it got. The social manipulation is hamfisted and unbelievable because the characters have no inner life and their personalities have no inertia. The combat scenes are lengthy and portray move after move of anime fisticuffs without portraying any unique ideas. The power-based problem solving is interesting in some of the early uses of illusions, and remains one of the better parts of the fic, but increasing use of body control illusions made it clear that this was going to become a hammer that solves all problems. The moral ambiguity is undermined by the protagonist's constant asides to remind you that she's a sociopath. Somehow it's supposed to be a mystery why the protagonist throws up when turning her powers off on some nights and not others, but despite the incredibly obvious answer it's spelled out for the audience explicitly by the third time.
