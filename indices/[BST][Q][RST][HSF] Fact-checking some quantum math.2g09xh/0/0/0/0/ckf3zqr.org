/There/ is the reasoning I was trying to intuit out, in the spherical-cow approximation way. I was thinking less in terms of Venn circles than of a table of the possible scenarios, eg:

A. Lives, NoTicket, NoDisaster

B. Lives, Ticket, NoDisaster

+C. Lives, NoTicket, Disaster+

D. Lives, Ticket, Disaster

... but that's just a different mental model of the same thing in the end.

(Now, all I have to do is work out the details of how to include the disaster-hinting lottery ticket in my story... :) )
