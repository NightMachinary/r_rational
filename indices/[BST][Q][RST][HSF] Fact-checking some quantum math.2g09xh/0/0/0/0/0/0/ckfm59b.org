A comment on LessWrong is leading me to consider an alternative scenario: There are two ways to survive the disaster, either pleasantly by having enough money (via winning the lottery) or unpleasantly (such as by having to amputate most of your limbs to reduce your bodymass to have enough delta-vee). I'm currently trying to use Venn-like overlapping categories to see if I can figure out any "If X then Y" conclusions. The basic parameters of the setting seem to rule out all but five combinations (using ! to mean 'not'):

WinLotto, !Disaster, !Amputee, Live: All Good

WinLotto, Disaster, !Amputee, Live: Buy survival

!WinLotto, !Disaster, !Amputee, Live: Nothing happens

!WinLotto, Disaster, Amputee, Live: Unpleasant survival

!WinLotto, Disaster, !Amputee, !Live: Dead.

At this very moment, I'm trying to figure out what happens if quantum immortality means the 'dead' line doesn't exist...

... But I'm as likely as not to miss some consequence of this. Anyone care to take a shot at how to set things up so that any Bayesian calculations on the matter have at least a shot at reflecting reality?
