Yep different mental model. I like Venn diagrams because in simple cases (<4 items) I can quickly see all the cases and how the probabilities add together. But everyone's mind works differently. For more than 3 I need to start binary counting to ensure I have all cases and it's less intuitive to me how probabilities are related to each other. But as I said, Pr is my least skilled section of maths.

Anyway, glad it helped.
