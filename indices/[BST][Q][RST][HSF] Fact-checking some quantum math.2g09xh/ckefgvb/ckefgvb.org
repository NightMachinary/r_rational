I think you have to include quantum immortality to get to your final point. I can't see how dying after buying a losing ticket should change the likelihood of winning/losing otherwise. But, if you literally cannot experience death, then more and more classically unlikely things should happen in order to prevent this (like winning the lottery so that you have enough money, or being the one person whose cryopreservation isn't knocked out by the asteroid that destroyed all other human life etc.) and in this case, unlikely things happening lends evidence that something dangerous is coming up. Looking back, your life becomes more like a story, Chekhov's gun becomes more and more true.

But it's late and I can't think this all the way through, so there may be other problems.
