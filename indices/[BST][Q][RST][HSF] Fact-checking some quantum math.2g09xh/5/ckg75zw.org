Okay, so I have been thinking this through some more, and I have a few points.

In order for this to make sense, the goal has to be for a small sub set of your future time lines to gain immunity from unforseen and certain classical (in the physics sense) dooms.

Future problems you see coming will have more effective answers than a small chance of having a warchest available.

Unlikely disasters - black swans and so on can be ignored for the simple reason that they just wont happen to most of your time lines, so you are already "Safe" from them.

So what you are trying to protect yourself from here is the inevitable sledgehammer of an event which a: You don't see coming. b: is already in motion. c: Will kill you with significantly greater certainty than 999999/1000000 if not prepared for. - because if it is a less certain doom than this, then more of your future selves will survive via luck and cunning than via lottery-funded preparations, so no need to bother.

Basically, what we are talking about here are things like yellowstone blowing, a radiation front from a cosmological event, or north korea releasing 9 pandemics on the day their top-secret vaccination program completes.

There is one problem with just about every single one of this kind of scenario I can think of, and it is this: Cash or a fat bank account will do you no good whatsoever.

You need.. a dooms-day shelter. Or to be on the other side of the planet. So in order for this to work, you need to not only play the lottery, you need to pre-commit to spending any jackpot in a completely insane way, rather than on cocaine, cars and charity.

And it would be an insane way to spend winnings, mind! Because winning carries no information about whether there is in fact a doom inbound - the lottery isn't an oracle, it has no, and produces no information about why you decided to play.

So in order for this to work, you need come up with something which is both a sensible doomsday shelter /and/ a not-ridiculous investment in order to make sure the winning subset carries through. Plan a geothermal power plant built with on-site living quarters?
