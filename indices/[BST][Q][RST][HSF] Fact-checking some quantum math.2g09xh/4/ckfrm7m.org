This can be framed without requiring confusing QM or antropics:

The possible futures in which you do win the lottery are very few. If there won't be a disaster, the ones where you don't dominate so much it's not a noticeable loss precomiting to do something stupid in case you do is no big loss. If there WILL be a disaster, the ones where you don't win the lottery are screwed no matter what they do, so precommiting to do something stupid in them dosn't matter and you can subtract them. Having done this, the remaining utility is all in the ones where you win.

Therefore, you should preommit to act as if lottery-wining and impending disaster are correlated, regardless of if they actually are or not.

Edit: Note that this doesn't say anything abut if "you" exist or should anticipate anything, only abut whether there's still something you care about in that universe. It works even if you are guaranteed to personally survive the disaster or sacrifice yourself to stop it, for example. It's a /fully general/ argument about observing something extremely unlikely meaning you should condition upon it mattering.
