Duffmancd has helpfully worked out the reasoning I was groping for in the post at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g09xh/bstqrsthsf_factchecking_some_quantum_math/ckex8ul]] , in which the existence of a winning ticket provides probably-weak but non-zero Bayesian evidence of a forthcoming disaster.

I'm willing to take EY's implied word that of the two main anthropic theories, SSA is incompatible with the above. (He's EY, after all.) Does that then imply that the 'Disaster-Detecting Lottery Ticket' is an argument for SIA?
