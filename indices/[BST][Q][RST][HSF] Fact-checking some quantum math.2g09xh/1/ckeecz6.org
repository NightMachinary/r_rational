The issue with the lottery ticket example is that the winning or losing quality of a ticket is not a quantum state. If you buy a losing ticket in one possible universe, then it will be losing in all posible universes. You'd need to find a way to vary which ticket you buy by universe, and gaurentee that at least one ticket you could possibly buy is actually a winning ticket, and I'm not sure either is generally possible.
