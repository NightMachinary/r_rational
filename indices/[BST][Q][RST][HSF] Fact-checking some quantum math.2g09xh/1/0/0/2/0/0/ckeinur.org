As an aside, the Lotto 6/49 has an average return somewhere around 45%; for every billion dollars you spend on tickets, you get back around half a billion, instead of merely the fifty million you suggested. It's still not a good investment for average utility, but the average utility is around ten times what you suggested, which may affect someone's intuition.
