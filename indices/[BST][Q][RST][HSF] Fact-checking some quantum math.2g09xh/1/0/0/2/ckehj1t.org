The lottery I'm most familiar with is a Canadian one, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49][Lotto 6/49]], in which every player is free to pick their numbers.

Re stock market: Because getting into a situation where you can buy even a single share of a single stock requires more money and knowledge than buying a lottery ticket.

As for the negative expected utility - yep, I agree with you, that in general, it's not worth it. (Though ) It requires extremely non-general, unusual circumstances, in which having a large amount of accumulated wealth is of a qualitative benefit rather than just a quantitative one, to make it potentially useful; which is why I brought in the survive-or-die scenario.
