The New York Lotto allows you to choose your numbers. However, the winning number is chosen after all tickets for that lottery have been sold. It's possible that they select whether or not to have a winner in a given week and then rig the selection to ensure there is a winner. I don't know. Three may be a regulatory body that would know.
