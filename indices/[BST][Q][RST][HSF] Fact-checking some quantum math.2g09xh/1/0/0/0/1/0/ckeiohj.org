I don't believe so. I'm sort of rubbish at quantum physics, but I have to imagine that all your many-worlds clones are living right alongside you up until they're not. So until the calamity occurs, your many-worlds spread looks just like it would if there's no calamity in the future.

Of course, /after/ the calamity happens, if you only survived because you bought a lottery ticket the week before, you might be able to surmise that winning the ticket was the only thing that kept you alive, but I don't think that winning the ticket gives you much in the way of information about the future.
