Yes, that could work IFF you could chose your ticket at all. I suppose some might, but I've personally never seen a lottery where you get more choice than the store you buy at and the time you buy. This could work in a game where you can pick correctly, such as in a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_game][numbers game]], or the stock market.

As far as noise, it seems rather tenuous. To quote Farnsworth; "Quantum physics means that anything can happen, at any time, for no reason...". It basically becomes a form of magic, and the math becomes too complicated to be meaningful, and it's just not interesting. Why not create an [[http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive?useskin=oasis&cb=9685][infinite improbability drive]] at that point.

Also, on the note of "is it worth it", it seems like it isn't, even in the many worlds scenario. Let's say you win the lotto in 1billionth of all possible universes, for a total of 50 million dollars, at a cost of 1 dollar per ticket. By your logic "you" won 50 million dolars across a billion average universes, but spent a total of 1 billion dollars across the same sample, creating a total debt of 950 million. That may not matter since each individual you only lost an average of 1 dollar, but the winnings matter even less by the same token, meaning it's not worth it.
