Would arranging for a source of quantum-random bits (ala present-day's random.org) to select the lottery ticket be a possible solution to this?

Or, alternately, having a long enough time between the purchase of the ticket and the drawing of the numbers for enough "noise" to be generated that the numbers drawn /do/ vary across multiple worlds?
