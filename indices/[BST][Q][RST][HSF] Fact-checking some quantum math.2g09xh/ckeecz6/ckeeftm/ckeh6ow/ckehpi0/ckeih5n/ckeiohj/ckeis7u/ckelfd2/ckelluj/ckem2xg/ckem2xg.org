You could try pinging [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]], who is very knowledgable on the subject. I've been trying to run through [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/r6/an_intuitive_explanation_of_quantum_mechanics/][An Intuitive Explanation of Quantum Mechanics]], but it hasn't been helping me as much as I think it should. You could also try hitting up the Less Wrong open discussion thread to get more input.
