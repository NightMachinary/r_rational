To send a personal message, click their username, which will take you to their user page. On the righthand side will be a link that has an envelope and says "send message", which will let you send them a private message. (Ping is not the proper term for this on reddit - it's a PM - but I use "ping" to refer to any quick method of contact over the internet.)

Also, if the user has reddit gold (and hasn't turned off this feature), mentioning their username, as I just did in my previous comment, will send them a message to their inbox. With that said, Yudkowsky is very busy, so it's possible that you won't get a response - depending on how soon you need to know a better answer, I'd suggest Less Wrong, or possibly somewhere like [[/r/AskPhysics]] or [[/r/askscience]], so long as you can rigidly define your question for them.
