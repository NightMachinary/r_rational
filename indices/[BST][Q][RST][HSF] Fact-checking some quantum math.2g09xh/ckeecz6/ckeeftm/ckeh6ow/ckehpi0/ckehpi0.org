  Also, on the note of "is it worth it", it seems like it isn't, even in the many worlds scenario. Let's say you win the lotto in 1billionth of all possible universes, for a total of 50 million dollars, at a cost of 1 dollar per ticket. By your logic "you" won 50 million dolars across a billion average universes, but spent a total of 1 billion dollars across the same sample, creating a total debt of 950 million. That may not matter since each individual you only lost an average of 1 dollar, but the winnings matter even less by the same token, meaning it's not worth it.

Hypothetically, let's say you have special knowledge that at 5pm next Wednesday the evil future government is going to deactivate the cortical implants of the poorest 80% of the population, killing them all swiftly and painlessly. In that circumstance, there would be positive expected utility, because you wouldn't be alive if you lost. (The many-worlds thing doesn't even really factor into it.)
