I would give you more than one upvote if I could. :)

I want to discuss the implications that quantum immortality has on P(L), but I'm afraid that I currently need either caffeine or sleep, and can't quite figure out how to formulate my question. Something about how quantum probability differs from Bayesian confidence, and that quantum immortality means that you can have a Bayesian near-certainty that you will continue living in /some/ future timelines... hopefully, I'll be able to either express myself better after some sleep, or I'll realize that my proto-question can't be turned into a proper one.
