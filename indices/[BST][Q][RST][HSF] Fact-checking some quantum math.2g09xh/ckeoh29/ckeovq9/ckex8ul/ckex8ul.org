Ok, so I've had some sleep so I'll give this a shot. DataPacRat feel free to try your hand at it too.

If we take the strongest possible view of quantum immortality, then Pr(L) = 1. Then if the only way to survive the disaster is through winning the lottery i.e. Pr(L| ~T,D) = 0. [I'm going to use a Venn diagram here, cause it helps me think, there are definitely other ways to put this.] So we have three events/circles D(isaster), T(icket that wins), and L(ives). We know Pr(~L)=0 so fill in those spots, and we also know Pr(L∩D∩~T)=0 so fill that in. Now you can see that the only way a disaster can occur is if we buy a winning ticket, Pr(D|~T)=0. Now, so long as Pr(T)<1, buying a winning ticket increases the chances of the disaster.

Pr(D|T) = Pr(T∩D)/Pr(T) = Pr(D)/Pr(T)

If we relax our conditions (Pr(L)<1, and Pr(L|~T∩D)>0), so long as we head towards the "standard" independent case presented by IX-103 above we still get some information from T. (Where this could fall down is if winning increases your chance to die some other way like mugging etc.) I think. I'm also fairly certain this could be shown but probabilities are my weakest area of maths, so I'll stick to the simpler case.

So in theory, taking the spherical cow approximation it works, it may not work as well with relaxed constraints but I think it still works.
