Antropic reasoning cant give you information about the future - up until the point where the zombie vikings preform the bloodeagle on all of your selves that don't have the money to buy them off, both winners and loosers experience existence. In order for this strategy to work you need to see the disaster coming far enough in advance to play. Or you could pre-commit to playing the lottery every six months and not spending any winnings except in dire emergency for a period of six months.
