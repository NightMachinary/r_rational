I picked up my shotgun when someone mentioned optimization problems in the presence of ponies.

And then I realized the actual problem was the incoming meteorite. And /then/ I hit the time-loop.

My only criticism is that with an actual sky-goddess around it really shouldn't be /that/ hard to deflect a bloody meteorite.
