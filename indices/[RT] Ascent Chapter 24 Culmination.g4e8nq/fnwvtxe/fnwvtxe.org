And that's a wrap - I have another short story, sequel to [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/08/30/seeker/][Seeker]], finished today as well - [[https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2020/04/19/frameshift/][Frameshift]]. I'd love to know what you all think now that it's finally finished. More short stories to come, stay tuned!
