I think there might have been 1 or 2 places where the chapters were out of order, but mostly it was just the short stories. I ended up reading like 3 of them before realizing that they weren't chapters. There was also at some point a link to "Update" which I assume was some blog post about writing progress.

I thought the story was an interesting take on alien invasion. I liked that you addressed the similar tech levels. I liked that the ending was rather dark. The plot was tight which was good. We didn't get to see a lot of what the society under ARCO was like I guess, though that wasn't really the point of the story. It also wasn't super clear why there were so few pre-invasion survivors left. Aurelie was obviously unexplained but that was clearly intentional.
