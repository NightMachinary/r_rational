I just finished watching the dubbed version of the romcom anime Gamers!, and while I liked it quite a bit I wonder if I missed something. [[https://youtu.be/NNS9UcKMa5U][Mother's Basement gave it a glowing recommendation halfway through the season]] that I finally followed up on last week, and it turned out to be just as funny and surprisingly relatable as he said it would be...until the conclusion of each romantic arc.

I was totally invested up to that point, laughing and (almost) crying at the clever references to nerd culture and ever more absurd misunderstanding and machinations resulting from the characters' insecurities and overthinking, but once the two main couples overcoming the obstacles between them I found myself underwhelmed. Shouldn't I have been more satisfied to see them get together and episodes after that more?

To be clear, I still highly recommend this show as a comedy about both gamers and teenagers in love. The conflict and humor is based around miscommunication, but it's /done right/ in a way I've never seen before. You really do connect with the characters' doubts about whether their crush likes them back and how that fear turns them stupid, while also being really funny to watch. I just want to know if there was something just as good about the last third of the season I failed to notice?
