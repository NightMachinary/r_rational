Are these based on the same polls that gave him a negligible chance of winning? Because 54% to win the primary seems way too low. Given that Trump has kept his administration very closely in line with his campaign promises, I think the sides for and against him haven't shifted very much. The same people who strongly supported him originally and voted for him are happy with what he's been doing and will vote for him again, and the people who strongly opposed him originally and voted against him still oppose him and will vote against him again.

I think a number of moderates will shift in his favor as the media fearmongering loses its grasp and they see he's not Hitler, or racist/sexist/homophobic.

Rather than looking at it in a vacuum, look at it in comparison to the previous election. He had all sorts of opposition from the left and the media and won anyway, nothing has changed to make his position weaker, so whatever forces caused him to win before will carry him again.

The general election is a slightly different story. If the democrats put up someone less awful than Hillary Clinton then they'll have more support, as many Trump voters voted for him as the lesser of two evils rather than that they actually liked him. But as long as no disasters occur during the next three years that can be attributed to Trump, his chances will be higher than they were the first time around.
