Nanowrimo's coming up. I'm considering doing it, providing I can think of a good enough novel idea. Does anyone who's done it before have any tips? I have some experience writing on a set schedule (the fic in my signature was updated weekly pretty consistently until I finished it) but I'll need to spit out roughly 600% more writing per week.
