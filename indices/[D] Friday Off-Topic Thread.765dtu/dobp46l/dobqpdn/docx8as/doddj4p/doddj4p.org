I generally think it's not a great way to structure a book from an artistic standpoint, but it can make the writing easier, and I would assume that its popularity with pulp authors indicates that it /works/, even if the audience doesn't particularly like it. It's crass manipulation, but sometimes that's enough.

I mostly say it /here/ because I think it can be good for writers who want to focus on output, and leaving yourself obvious hooks to write from can help with that.
