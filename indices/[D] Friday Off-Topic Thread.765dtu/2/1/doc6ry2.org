I'd like to point out that MIRI, EY, and AI alignment in general are three separate things, and that it's entirely possible to have opinions on (and discussions about) any of the three on their own, independently of each other. I don't think bundling questions about all three into a single Reddit comment is a good way to go about doing that, however.
