  It can be good to end the chapters on a cliffhanger and then switch point of view, which gives you some time off from that thread to think about things.

Not commenting on the other points, but I always hated when books did this. It feels like the resolution is being dangled in front of your nose, and by the time you do reach the chapter in which it's being revealed, you often don't even care about the whole thing that much any more.

And that's when this technique is used mildly. When it's downright abused, you just stop caring about the whole story altogether because it'll just exploit your invested interest if you do.

That's my personal experience with that, at least.
