- Write every day.

- Don't stop when you've hit your word goal for the day, stop when you are out of time to write. You need high output days to make up for low output days.

- Editing is for December.

- Research and planning is for October.

- If you are bored while writing, maybe that thing didn't need to be written.

- It can be good to end the chapters on a cliffhanger and then switch point of view, which gives you some time off from that thread to think about things.

- If you don't have time to write, you might still have time to write things out in your head (e.g. during a long commute).
