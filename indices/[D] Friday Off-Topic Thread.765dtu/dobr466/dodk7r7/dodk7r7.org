I think MIRI is an organization worth supporting, and have seen nothing from EY that makes me dislike or distrust or consider him unfit for his jobs or hobbies. I've donated to them in the past but don't actively donate on any set schedule.

AI friendliness is a real concern that I am glad people are working on. I don't know if it's the top concern in the world, but it's certainly top 3 for things that are likely to make life not worth living on the planet by our modern standards, and the /only/ concern that might end up wiping out life on earth (or beyond) for good.
