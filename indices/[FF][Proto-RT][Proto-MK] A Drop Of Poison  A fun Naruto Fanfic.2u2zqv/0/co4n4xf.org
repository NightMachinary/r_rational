First, thanks to Draconomial [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2tww4h/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch3/co449dc][for the reccomendation]].

This is another fanfic where Naruto uses shadow clones to prank people in progressively more amusing ways. I put "proto" in front of the RT and MK tags, because while he does munchkin and use the scientific method the fic pulls tons of random stuff out of its hat (mainly to give Naruto things to play with). Enough that it doesn't actually explore the space of things Naruto could be doing better or more intelligently with the original constraints.

It feels like an [RT][MK] Naruto, but really it's a different optimization problem altogether. I found it a ton of fun but there are some issues. Namely there's a notable lack of copy editing, and relatively little effort put into characterization of secondary and tertiary characters. When Naruto has a cool idea, others seem to go along with it with surprisingly little resistance.
