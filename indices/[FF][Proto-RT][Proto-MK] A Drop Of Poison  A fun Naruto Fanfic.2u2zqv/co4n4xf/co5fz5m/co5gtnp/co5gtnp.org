Same feeling I had; it has a very slight touch of Mary-Sue where everything feels just a biiiiiiit too conveniently easy. There's a particularly glaring bit a few chapters past where your examples end and I had to take a break and read something else for a while, but like you said, a fun read overall.

Interestingly, I've read one of the author's other works, and now that I think about it had just a little bit of the same problem.
