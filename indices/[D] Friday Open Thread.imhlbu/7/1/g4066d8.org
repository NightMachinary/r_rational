Assassinations are an option here, especially since influential figures could always be secretly evil in ways the dark lord can plausibly deny knowledge of.

A loud smash-and-grab mission (or quiet theft of an essential macguffin) to disrupt a large festival/market/religious gathering, which foils some other evildoers plot to release a plague or some such.

Stealing a large shipment of medicine or other supplies headed somewhere remote exposes guild corruption/embezzlement/skimming that would have sent off tainted/faulty supplies and killed a bunch of people.

Goons act as enforcers in a protection racket/extortion scheme that causes the small businesses you're pressuring to push back, forming a guild/union to try to protect each other. Application of sufficient force by the dark lord might leave the union still paying tribute to the dark lord, but they are also able to negotiate from a stronger position with local nobles, easing excessive tax burdens and improving quality of life for the small folk of the city.
