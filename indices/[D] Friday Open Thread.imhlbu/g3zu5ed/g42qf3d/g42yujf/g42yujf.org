I didn't cover these in my answer and I wanted to quote-emphasize them. This is very good advice.

  be sure to munchkin it!

Also very good advice, and I don't think it's only applicable to robotics.

My high school robotics team's best-performing year was when the seniors' carefully designed robot broke at the competition, and I and one of the other freshmen quickly put together a robot that consistently scored something like 9 positive points and 3 negative points by sweeping a large chunk of the board into our score space without checking whether it was the positive or negative color. It also did this violently enough that some of the strewn about pieces disrupted other robots' plans. The raw consistency made it eventually outperform better bots over the course of the double elimination tournament.

The winner that year also was a bunch of filthy munchkins, but with better engineering and a plan from before the day of the competition. Their robot hooked a winch over the side of the board for extra power, which it used to run forward and grab the heavy containers containing many of the scoring pieces, then using both its main drive and the winch together to pull the entire thing backwards into its scoring area.
