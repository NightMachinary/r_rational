Googling around to double check my intuition, it looks like MIT admits around 20 transfer students/year out of an undergraduate class of ~1000/year. So the /vast/ majority of people attend MIT directly out of high school.

My intuition was that for a general degree you can attend community college to clear requirements and decrease the time spent in the (more expensive) bachelor's program. However, for top tier schools most students attend directly from HS and all the way through.

I'll second RPI as being a well respected institution, particularly in programming/comp sci.
