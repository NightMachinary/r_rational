I didn't post this one as its own thread since it's not exactly /rational/, but I have a new Star Wars fanfic up. Two chapters out of three, third one goes up on Sunday. It's basically a crackfic about Anakin in Episode 3 not instantly becoming a child murderer just because Palpatine said so, and instead desperately trying to get out of the gigantic pile of shit he's immersed neck-deep in, all the while still saving Padm√©'s life. Fair warning, coarse language and some sex jokes make it not perfectly SFW.
