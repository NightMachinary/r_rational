That is neat. SWIM should write it, it would be really cool.

Unfortunately the big thing with all fanfic is that ideas come cheap and execution doesn't. Which is a pity as it would be pretty neat.

I still haven't finished reading the original Harry Potter series (I'm about 10% of the way through OotF), so I can't volunteer.
