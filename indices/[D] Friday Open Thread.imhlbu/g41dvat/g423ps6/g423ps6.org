That's actually a really fun idea. I can only imagine how entertaining his interactions with Mad Eye Moody would be. He would probably be the only other person to actually take this theory entirely seriously. Dumbledore may or may not believe it; Snape, McGonagall and everyone else with some common sense would believe it to be obviously bunk.

I don't see many difficulties. Voldy truly died at Godric's Hollow that night; the only bit that's necessary to explain is /why/. Other than that, the Philosopher's Stone gives you immortality and wealth, there's going to be plenty of potential thieves; Slitherin's Heir could well be a genuine blood purist; Sirius Black is actually truly a murderer, and he escaped from prison; the Triwizard Tournament is just rigged to hell and back since they all want to win, possibly by someone who knows how to exploit Harry's obsession; Harry starts dragging other students in his madness, training them in dangerous arts in secret while reasonable teachers try everything to stop him; Harry fixates on one classmate, thinking he's dead set on carrying out a nefarious plan, and ends up almost killing him; finally, Harry simply runs from school, completely taken in his delusions, and starts living like a homeless madman in the woods, fearing even just speaking the name of his enemy since he's under the ridiculous delusion that doing so would summon it to his position.
