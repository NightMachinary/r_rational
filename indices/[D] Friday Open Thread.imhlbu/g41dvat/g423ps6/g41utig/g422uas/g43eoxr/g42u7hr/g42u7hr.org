I actually started re-reading the original Harry Potter series about a month ago.

I'm about 60% of the way through the first book.

I think at this point I might just cut my losses and skip straight to Prisoner of Azkaban. I feel like I remember Rowling's writing improving around PoA/GoF.

Idk if it's Rowling's writing or if it's the fact that PS/SS covers the same year as HPMOR or if it's the chi... - I don't necessarily want to use the word /childishness/, but the earlier books were definitely targeted at a younger audience and are more like children's books than the rest of the series - but /something/ is making it feel incredibly tedious to try to push through this first book.

Having recently read these books yourself, what do you think? Should I give CoS a chance, or just skip ahead to PoA (or even GoF)?

Or did you not notice a problem with the earlier books and it's probably just that I'm dead inside and can't feel the magic anymore? (Or a less cynical alternative, that HPMOR has ruined PS/SS for me?)
