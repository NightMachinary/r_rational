I'm reading them in French, but I've definitely noticed them picking up in terms of quality/pacing - though I can't attest to changes in JKR's writing style because it's the translator's writing I'm reading. The first time through, when they were new books, I stopped at about the point I'm at now (10% in OotF).

I was never terribly into them, TBH, and still am not, it's just a very straightforward language learning exercise and it's very rewarding because I find myself understanding words that frequently come up that I learned for the series (since it's following a single writing style the whole way through).
