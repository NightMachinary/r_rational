Yeah, a series of vignettes would be doable and pretty good!

As for the ending: I mean... can't Ron and Hermione defeat the Death Eaters with/despite Harry? Clearly the obvious thing to do would be to have them do whatever big confrontation happens at the end (I don't know how it ends except that the children all have terrible names), and Harry was prepared for Voldemort but it was just Snape IDK, and then even tho R+H do all the work, Harry, being a "famous hero", gets all the credit? He then becomes the next DatDA teacher, and is insufferable and up himself like the guy from his first book whose name I have completely forgotten.
