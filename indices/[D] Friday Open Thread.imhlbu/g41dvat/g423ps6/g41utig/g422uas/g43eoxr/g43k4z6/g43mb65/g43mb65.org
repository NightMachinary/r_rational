You can play it in a lot of different ways. For me if the joke is "Harry is a paranoid conspiracy theorist" then his ideas have to be widely mocked and disbelieved, which runs counter him being considered a famous hero. Rather, he should be a washout, that one kid that did ONE impressive thing once but now he's sort of an embarrassment.

It's both funny to make him stumble around solving a real problem with his completely skewed perspective, or make him right all along in some way.

I had a thought - instead of arguing the details, why not make this a contest? We could literally just create a "everyone write their own version of this concept" thread and then compare interpretations. I can imagine dozens of angles from which it could be either funny or insightful. [[/u/WalterTFD][u/WalterTFD]], any thoughts about this? Are you okay with your idea being used by others?

EDIT: funnily enough, I had completely forgot I actually wrote a very short opening for a story seemingly based on a similar premise that I have saved in a folder under the title "Constant Vigilance". Here's an extract:

  The Auror team landed next to them. It was headed by some grim-looking guy built like a wardrobe, the sort of type you'd just imagine to curse first and ask question later. So, this was the sort who would handle the situation now. Now that she'd /failed/.

  "I am Auror Knuckledge," he introduced himself. "Can you explain the situation to me?"

  Professor McGonagall gestured towards Dumbledore, and the Headmaster took charge. "We have a student with a... troubled history," he explained. "He's suffering from some sort of delusion. He has forced us all to evacuate the castle, ranting about some sort of Dark Lord that would be threatening us."

  The Auror raised an eyebrow. "You evacuated the school because of some student's ranting?"

  "No," intervened Severus Snape, the Potionmaster, answering the sarcastic question with a cold voice. "We evacuated the school because of the three hundred litres of Blowfire Potion that this student has apparently managed to prepare and disseminate in every nook and cranny without alerting our surveillance once."

  Knuckledge whistled lightly. "That's /some/ feat. If this guy could be recovered, I'd like to recruit him."

  "Seriously!," McGonagall answered, scandalised.

  The Auror grinned fiendishly. "No problem, missus. I'm just kidding. Real talk, this sort of nutcase is due for St. Mungo's or Azkaban. Depends how the judge feels on that day."
