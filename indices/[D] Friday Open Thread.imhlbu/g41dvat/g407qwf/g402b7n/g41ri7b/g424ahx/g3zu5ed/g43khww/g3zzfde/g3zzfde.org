I'm planning a campaign for D&D 5e Forgotten Realms and I was wondering if [[/r/rational]] could help me plan a few more scenarios. The setup is...convoluted, and requires me to model my characters at a high-level, so I'd appreciate some suggestions and input.

Here's the premise, as succinctly as possible:

-3 goons are working for an evil overlord

-said overlord is attempting to capture the Three Champions Of The Light, who he intends to use in some evil ritual to to incite 1000 years of darkness etc

-through a chain of events, the souls of The Three Champions Of The Light end up in the goons

-since the goons are evil henchman, however, they dont count as Champions Of The Light

-for that to happen, and for the evil overlord to accomplish his goals, the goons will have to perform GOOD acts, and once they are sufficiently Good, they will become the Three Champions Of The Light again, and the overlord can proceed with his plans

So thats the setup, now here's the tension and hard part: The darklork needs to get his goons to do Good things, but if he makes them do something overtly Good they will catch on to his plan to manipulate them. As such, he needs to get them to do SEEMINGLY Evil things, as would befit servants of a darklord, while having them actually accomplish Good Acts (non consequentialists dont @ me)

So what are some plausible scenarios wherein these goons (who will be controlled by the players) might do Good while attempting to do follow evil orders?

(FWIW, the intent is that EVENTUALLY the goons will figure out that they're being manipulated, and the campaign will change based on their decisions at that time, but I'd like to postpone that realization as long as possible)
