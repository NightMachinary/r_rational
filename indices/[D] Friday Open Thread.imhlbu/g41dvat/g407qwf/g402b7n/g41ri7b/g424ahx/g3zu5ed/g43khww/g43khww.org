I should probably post my next chapter of The Baby-Sitters Startup so I stop having to worry about it since that's all I've written and all I plan to write.

I don't know American computer programming college culture though so can some people please fill in these placeholder names for me?

COLLEGE IN NEW YORK [where one could study engineering and also computer programming]

MID TIER PROGRAMMING COLLEGE

Actually: if you went to MIT to study engineering - I don't understand the American system, do you first go to [college in new york] and then go to MIT? Or do you got to MIT straight out of high school?
