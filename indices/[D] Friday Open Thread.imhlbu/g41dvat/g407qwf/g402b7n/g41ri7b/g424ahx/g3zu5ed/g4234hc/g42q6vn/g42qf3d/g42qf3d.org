Generally: Organize and refine far more than you think necessary, then delegate even more than you are comfortable with. Delegating is hard and feels bad for most people initially, don't worry you will have more than your share of work. Have your project needs mapped and presented out as much as possible, with your team if possible, then break the project into solid measurables and sub goals. Utilize as much of your team as reasonable for every step of execution, but make sure you always have a good grasp of what is going on.

Break down the big tasks into smaller ones that can be completed within practical time periods, ideally none longer than a workweek. As more parts get done be sure to combine and troubleshoot as much as you can right away, while that task completion is fresh.

Edit: Seeing more background info: The hardest part of volunteer work is getting things actually completed, try to encourage people to prototype as fast as possible before refining/using the better materials.

My biggest robotics challenge tips are to look for past and adjacent designs as much as possible, use your team talents, and get something working asap. If it's piloted encourage them to practice as much as possible, practice can beat better/clever designs. Also try to get everyone to have fun! Do team hangouts, order food, and goof around (away from the dangerous/expensive stuff). Sure it's for resume building and there's going to be frustrating parts but in general the more fun everyone has the better you will do. Good luck!

Final Edit: Also be sure to munchkin it! Particularly look closely at penalty costs vs benefits, damage/malfunction allowances, and 1 time events such as the end of a challenge. I saw some disgusting munchkin moves in high school robotics such as dropping parts and one way movements for finale challenges.
