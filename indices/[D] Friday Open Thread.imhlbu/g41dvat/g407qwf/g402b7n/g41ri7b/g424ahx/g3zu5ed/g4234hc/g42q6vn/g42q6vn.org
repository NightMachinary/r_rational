For long-term planning, breaking it up into constituent parts (and breaking those up, recursively) allows you to make more accurate time estimates. Write down how you broke your top-level goal up to end up with your shorter-term goals, so if one of those subgoals ends up being much harder than you intended, you can check why you're doing it in the first place and see how to route around the unexpected problem. Within the individual goals and subgoals and whatnot, you can use SMART to define them. Also estimate time using the most similar thing you've done in the past, not how long the bits you can think of feel like they should take.

For group planning, it's important to know what your team wants to do, what motivates, them, and what they think is important. There are a lot of different ways to break up a long-term plan, and they're mostly equally valid. Instead of focusing on what makes it easiest for you personally to wrap your head around, focus on making sure it's broken up so the structure reflects the parts of the project that various members of the team thinks are important. Usually the person who's weirdly emphasizing a specific part of the project has a good reason. And making it easier for team members to relate their contributions to the part of the project that motivates them really helps with motivation and flexibility.
