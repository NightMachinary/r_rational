There's a character in the Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb which epitomizes "good for the sake of evil" that I think you're going for. He's a ruthless pirate captain who has an obsession with raping young boys and boyish women, and he inadvertently becomes the instigator of a slave revolt by raiding trade ships and freeing the galley slaves who row the ships (solely because he wouldn't be able to sell them even if he wanted to). Regardless, he comes to be idolized by his crew and the newly freed slaves who often become pirates themselves, and he uses that to enrich himself and to acquire victims to sate his appetite.

Eventually he's (iirc)killed by one of his rape victims and his crimes are revealed somewhat, but quickly covered up by other leaders so that he can remain a hero and self-less ur-founder of a nation of escaped slaves, on the level of George Washington.

Hope that helps as inspo.
