I mean, the only advice I really have is SMART, which you've probably heard if you're a team lead on a project. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely, in case you or someone else reading doesn't know - there's hundreds of articles about this on the internet so go read one of them)

Do you have a boss/mentor/"equal"? I'd ask them, since they have definitely done projects more similar to yours than randos from the internet and will be able to give you advice appropriate to your and your organisation's culture and business.
