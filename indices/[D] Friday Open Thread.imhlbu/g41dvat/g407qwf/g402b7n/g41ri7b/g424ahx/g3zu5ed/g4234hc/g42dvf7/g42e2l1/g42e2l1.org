Ah, okay. I think it's harder then because having led teams in university volunteer orgs and such, people aren't terribly motivated for these sorts of things which means your goal should probably be "get something, anything, done".

But at the level of school/college robotics team you're probably good to just have a google around and see what you can find. Remember, you're there' to learn as much as anything!
