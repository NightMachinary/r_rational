Super Bunnyhop made [[https://youtu.be/3y3yYmfINrY?t=706][a video review]] of /Troy: Total War/, but half-way through (timestamped) he switches from gameplay discussion to how the game chooses to approach the question of history vs literature vs what people at the time might have actually believed. From an [[/r/rational]] perspective I found it quite interesting.

(There's a brief discussion of Julian Jaynes' /The Origin Of Consciousness/ which can't be let go unchallenged - [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/][here's a good SlateStarCodex article on the topic]].)
