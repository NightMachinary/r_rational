I recommend people watch this video: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk62itTxwuk][Life of a Hanseatic Merchant : Hanseatic League the Medieval Fraternity]]

It's a very entertaining history video about the (hypothetical) life of an Hanseatic League merchant, from joining the league as a young boy to achieving masterhood. There's all sorts of interesting details, like Hanseatic traditions, the transnational structure and even some economics. I found it fascinating.
