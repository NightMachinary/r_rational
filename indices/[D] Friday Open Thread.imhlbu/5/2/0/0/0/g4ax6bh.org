I actually hadn't considered the navigation advantage!

Their strategy didn't involve any navigation at all - the robot could only move backwards and forwards. No steering. It just unfolded its claws, ran forward, crabbed a majority of the scoring pieces, dragged the opponent's pieces halfway back to its goal, and dragged its own all the way back.

[[http://roboti.cs.siue.edu/outreach/botball/2003/][Here's the ruleset]]. Those PVC trays in the center hold a bunch of scoring pieces. We tried pushing them with the strongest gearing ratio available (Botball has a fixed collection of lego pieces), found that we couldn't, and then only considered strategies involving plucking the pieces out of the trays.
