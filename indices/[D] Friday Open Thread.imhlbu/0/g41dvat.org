Random thought:

So, everyone knows about Garfield Without Garfield, right? The idea is that you remove a thing from a work and the work becomes different, weirder and debatably better.

I got to thinking whether or not that was a thing that could be done elsewhere, just because of how neat it is when the concept shaped hole actually improves the thing.

I think it's also true of Harry Potter and Voldemort.

This grew out of a conversation I was having with someone about conspiracy theorists, and the person I was talking to made the point that HP, in the canon story, is basically a VAnon believer who turns out to be totally correct. Absolutely everything is about him and it is all driven by sekrit terrorists behind the scenes who just hate goodness and freedom.

Looked at from another way, then, how feasible is it to get rid of Big V? Like, what powers does he have that no one else can replicate? And it seems like, for the most part, he's just, like, a very skilled wizard, yeah? The Death Eaters' success stems from the intimidation factor more than from him personally doing work.

I tried to visualize what this would look like, and I think it hangs together surprisingly well. Each year something is going wrong for basic reasons of human avarice and weakness. Dude is just trying to steal the mcguffin on his own, student unleashing snake is just cracking under the insane system, etc. Harry mistakes ordinary malfeasance for a new point on his Voldemort red string diagram and we are off to the races.

Harry is basically Luna Lovegood, at this point, in that his unflagging belief that the problems with his world are the work of Dead Wizard Hitler is completely incorrect, but it in no way interferes with his day to day life, and, more pointedly, his heroics. Hermione & Ron understands that, you know, sometimes our weirdly fascist gov decides to murder innocent animals and we, being powerless kids, just have to accept that, but their maniacal bff has other ideas.

You contrast them being like 'look, bud, jail is just guarded by mind rape hell beasts, that's obviously the only way it could be', and dude is like 'don't you understand that the second a dead man comes back to life they would naturally join up with him!?'.

The idea is ultimately a recapitulation of SSC's Moloch principle, where the system can't be fixed by anyone within it, with a lunatic subbing in for the Czar as the outside system POV.

Anyway, I think it would be neat, thanks for coming to my TED talk.
