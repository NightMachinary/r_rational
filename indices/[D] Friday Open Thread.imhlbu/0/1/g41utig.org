Garfield without Garfield only works because Jon can't hear what the animals are thinking and Jim Davis(and many comic strip artists) rarely draws movement or action, so instead it happens before the strip begins or between panels, leaving Jon as a non-interactive punchline vehicle.

Removing Garfield in that kind of scenario works, but I can't think of many things outside the daily comic strips medium that can receive the same treatment and still make sense. Maybe Mr Magoo? Or the roadrunner and sylvester cartoons?
