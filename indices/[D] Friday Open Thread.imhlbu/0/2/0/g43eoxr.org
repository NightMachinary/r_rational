Personally I'd write it in the form of a pretty long one-shot. Just a series of vignettes and scenes that unfold as the years pass. The big question becomes just:

a) how to justify the events in Godric's Hollow, which scream "special chosen boy"

b) what to do with the ending

B) depends on the general tone. If you go for comedic, a proper ending would probably be "turns out that Voldemort REALLY was still alive all along". Bonus: Voldemort is still alive /and in hiding because he's super paranoid about Harry Potter, despite all the reassurances of his Death Eaters that he's just a child and can't hurt him/.

If you go for more serious, then maybe Harry simply gets institutionalised, or withdraws in his completely delusional world which is implied to be the one we're all familiar with.
