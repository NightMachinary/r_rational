The obvious answer is to give them missions that are obviously and openly good but just lie about the ultimate reason.

Instead of saying that its about them doing good things so they can be ritually sacrificed say its so they can be used to spy on the forces of good and eventually backstab them at some distant point in the futture. Since of course the evil overlord is going to place spies and traitors there isn't any reason for them to be suspicious at all.
