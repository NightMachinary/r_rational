Presumably there was a tweet that Stross was replying to there, and if you could fight Twitter's user interface, you might be able to find that.

In the absence of that, I assume that Stross is saying something to the effect that you need more than one good idea to make a book, and based on that, I would also assume that @SwiftOnSecurity was saying something to the effect that they had a great idea for a scifi novel.

Some example ideas:

- Humanity makes first-contact with a hive-mind species and they misunderstand each other
- A modern-tech civilization on an Alderson Disk works on the technical problem of trying to get a probe to escape their solar system
- A hyper-aggressive botnet with several zero-day exploits holds the internet hostage.

The point being, sure, these are ideas, but you need several ideas to build a novel, and compelling characters to populate it too.
