What would the downsides be of using solely convicts-in-exile as the population for the first generation of settlers on a planet? This would be in the Australian model of shipping off the convicts to dominate a new land, but with the ship entirely crewed by convicts, left to build their own society and to learn the necessary trades in order to survive. And for sake of simplicity, let's say that the convicts shipped off to the new planet will arrive in their lifetime; this is not a generation ship.
