Okay, that takes care of the case where the ship lands on earth and lets the prisoners out alive, quite thoroughly. What about the vengeful case, where the prisoners don't care about getting back alive but rather simply want to use their capsule as a kinetic missile against a major city or population centre? They might be able to find a way to slingshot around Mars (possibly slingshot around a few other things - they'll starve long before they get back but they don't care) and get back to Earth with a substantial incoming velocity. Lasers can roast the ship but won't stop it, and if their incoming velocity is high enough then missiles won't be able to catch it...
