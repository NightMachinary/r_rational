These are all wonderful suggestions about what could go wrong with a live crew. And most are inapplicable to the setting I'm thinking of. (Which I should have enumerated in the original comment.)

First, this is an interstellar colonization run using a slower-than-light ship. Whatever its initial acceleration method is, it is still carrying the necessary fuel for braking burns at its destination, and that is a risk. The ship's operating agency has a "blow up the ship" option in the event that the ship returns to the home stellar system. Figure that, whatever technology is, it is sufficient to redirect asteroids away from a planet.

The convicts are not active during the flight; indeed they are barely even embodied. Their personalities have been ripped from their skulls and embedded in androids, which shall not be activated until arrival at the destination planet.

Upon arrival at the destination, the convict-androids will be awoken. They'll get whatever educational opportunities they need; they'll have whatever tech they need to choose a target destination within the destination system and colonize it. And included in that tech is a bunch of frozen human embryos, and the necessary bioreactors to grow the embryos.
