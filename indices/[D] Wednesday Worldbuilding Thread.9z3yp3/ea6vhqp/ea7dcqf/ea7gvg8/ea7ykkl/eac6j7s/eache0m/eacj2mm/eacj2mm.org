I'm assuming the ship is designed for re-entry into the Martian atmosphere, meaning relatively lower pressures and less re-entry heating than with Earth. Earth's middle and lower atmosphere would almost certainly destroy it and turn it into little pieces like the Challenger disaster. Some of the debris might still be in large enough chunks to cause injury or damage, but if the Challenger disaster is any indication, it probably won't be a serious threat.
