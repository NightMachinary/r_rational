Good point, but most of it will probably be converted into heat and a sonic boom. I suspect the ship itself would largely be designed in a pancake shape for rapid deceleration in the Martian atmosphere. I suspect it would use lightweight components like inflatable kevlar and plastic for the exterior walls, along with an aluminum tubing and/or plastic superstructure. There would probably be an ablative heat shield made of plastic resin at the front. The only parts that would necessarily need to be large, solid chunks of metal would be the engines, but they can be made into several small engines rather than one big one. While it might work just fine in the thin Martian atmosphere, it should be completely ripped to pieces in the mid-to-upper atmosphere of Earth.

If we suppose this is maybe a total of 3x heavier than the challenger (~6m kg), and coming in at perhaps 12,000 m/s, it would have a kinetic energy of 438 terajoules, or about 1/2 to 1/4 of the energy released by the Chelyabinsk meteor. It might break some windows depending on much it gets slowed down before detonation, and depending on how high up it is when it detonates, but again, it's not likely to cause any serious harm.
