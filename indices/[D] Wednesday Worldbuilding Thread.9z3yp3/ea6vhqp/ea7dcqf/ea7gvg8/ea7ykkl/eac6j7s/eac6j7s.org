That shouldn't be a terribly large concern. Just use ships with only enough food and oxygen for a one-way trip, and the absolute minimum amount of fuel needed to land. For example, suppose we're sending the convicts to Mars. You'd need to be ready to destroy them until they leave low-Earth orbit (LEO). After leaving LEO, they'll be moving away at a minimum of around 2,900 km/s, assuming you're using the biannual launch window to keep costs down.

At that point, the convicts will have six months to do whatever they want before their ship lands them on Mars. The ships could be designed to perform an initial deep aerobraking maneuver to lose 900 m/s to end up in a capture orbit and then repeatedly make small adjustments at apoapsis to raise their periapsis for increasingly shallow aerobraking maneuvers until they're ready for re-entry from low Mars orbit. That might give them a delta-V budget of around 200 m/s. Landing might add another 200 m/s of delta-V, or more like 0 m/s if they're landing on a planet with an Earth-like atmosphere.

So, assuming the convicts want to avoid going to Mars and they manage to rewire and hijack the ship within six months, they might have a delta-V budget of 400 m/s. Trying to turn around before getting Mars would be guaranteed suicide due to the lack of delta-V (400 m/s available, 2,900+ m/s needed). They could theoretically perform a slingshot maneuver around Mars and try to get flung back towards Earth, but if they've only got a 10-month supply of food, water, and oxygen, they'll die before they can make it. The only option in which they have a chance to survive is if they land as expected and have additional sources of food, water, and oxygen at the destination.

Of course, the convicts could kill each other in order to reduce the number of people using air, water, and oxygen, and could eject mass to improve their effective delta-V. Oxygen for the life-support system and dried food could also potentially be converted into a hybrid-propellant rocket for even more delta-V. This might allow them to stretch their resources longer and achieve significantly greater delta-V, possibly enough to make an attempted return to Earth after the gravity assist.

However, it would be relatively easy to place Martian satellites to observe for incoming ships. If a ship performs a gravity assist maneuver instead of aerobraking, it shouldn't be too hard to focus satellites on the ship to track it and provide guidance to missiles or lasers to destroy it if it comes anywhere near Earth or any other protected area.
