Blades that are impossibly durable and sharp, passed down as heirlooms or pulled out of ancient ruins, are a staple of fantasy fiction.

Modern drugs are basically potions. Sleep potion, wakefulness potion, strength potion, a healing potion for almost every disease and medical condition ... superglue can close wounds, in addition to being the original [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sovereign%20Glue#content][Sovereign Glue]]. Powerful corrosives and explosives function as great potions, too.

  Instantly there was a flash of blue light and a wave of heat across Slotin's skin; the core had become supercritical, releasing an intense burst of neutron radiation estimated to have lasted about a half second.[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#cite_note-McLaughlin-6][[6]]] Slotin quickly twisted his wrist, flipping the top shell to the floor. The heating of the core and shells stopped the criticality within seconds of its initiation,[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#cite_note-schreiber-15][[15]]] while Slotin's reaction prevented a recurrence and ended the accident. The position of Slotin's body over the apparatus also shielded the others from much of the neutron radiation, but he received a lethal dose of 1,000 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rad_(unit][rad]]) (10 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit][Gy]])) neutron and 114 rad (1.14 Gy) gamma radiation in under a second and died nine days later from acute radiation poisoning. The nearest person to Slotin, Graves, who was watching over Slotin's shoulder and was thus partially shielded by him, received a high but non-lethal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_dose][radiation dose]]. Graves was hospitalized for several weeks with severe radiation poisoning and developed chronic neurological and vision problems as a result of the exposure.[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#cite_note-hempelman-8][[8]]]
