Well, let's say that tech had advanced a bit before the apocalypse happened. You could have 'Golemancers', who translate ancient sigils used in the souls of dead metallic beings to reawaken them, with the most advanced Golemancers even being able to bend the hulking statues to their will in ways the original creators did not intend. This, of course, is actually referring to reactivating dead industrial and military robots, and perhaps recoding them if the opportunity is available.

Another possible option would be... Well, imagine that military drones with facial recognition were floating about, running off solar power, and rendezvousing at repair stations (or, if technology was really advanced, perhaps self-repairing). 'Summoners' could develop techniques to make desired targets look like those that the drones were aiming to destroy before the apocalypse, thus bringing down a rain of explosions upon their foes. Techniques could include stuff like carrying portable mannequins with a specific mask to set up near enemy infrastructure, or teaming up with powerful Golemancers to program the drones to target simpler images that could be painted on card.

This is actually kinda difficult, but I hope these ideas helped!
