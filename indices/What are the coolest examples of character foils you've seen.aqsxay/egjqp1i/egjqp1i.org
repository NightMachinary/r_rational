World weary v. excited for the future (usually with old v. young respectively. I don't remember an inversion of this offhand.)

Skilled/experienced in self defense/armed v. pacifist. (Haven't seen, but it seems a reasonable contrast. Similar: Military v. civilian.)

People who focus on physical strength v. acquiring knowledge/honing 'mental' skills. (Common enough to be subverted occasionally.)

I'm also curious about sets of 3 or more v. just 2.
