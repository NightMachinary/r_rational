I adore it when traits of the main character can be found in either the main character's friends, or their enemies.

Full spoilers for Worm and Ward: Goddess was an awesome foil for Victoria. They are described very similarily: Powerful women, with several superpowers, among others flight, strong defenses, and an emotion-affecting power that pre-disposes other people towards liking them. They both like to take charge of situations, and act as leaders. However, while Victoria mostly thinks of herself as a Coach or a guide for the younger heroes, Bianca explicitly wants (needs) to be in charge. Years of people bending to her will have left her unable to stand any criticism. It's possible Wildbow wanted to explore how a more authoritarian version of Vicky could have looked like, minus the trauma from Amy of course.

Spoilers for Twig: Sylvester's foil is Jamie/Jessie. They are the only member of the Lambs Sy has trouble emulating, predicting, or manipulating. Sylvester is fluid, impermanent, unable to retain memories for long; J literally doesn't forget anything. J is always the voice of reason, reining in Sy's exuberance and his more self-destructive traits. Sylvester relishes in causing pain and terror; Jamie even felt sorry for Sub Rosa when they had to kill her. And despite these oppositional traits, their friendship is basically the best thing Sy has in his entire life.
