One way to generate these is to pick a personality system, then pick 2 of the types within that system, and identify something basic that they disagree on.

For example, Hogwarts houses.

Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff: decisive moments vs. gradualism. Great things come out of a key heroic moment vs. out of a gradual accumulation of efforts.

Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw: action vs. thinking. You get good results by doing the things that matter vs. by thinking about what to do.

Gryffindor vs. Slytherin: virtue ethics vs. consequentialism. You get good results by embodying what's right and good vs. by scheming about what actions will lead to something good.

You could try coming up with contrasts between all the pairs of houses (not necessarily limited to one contrast per house pair), and you could try with other personality systems.
