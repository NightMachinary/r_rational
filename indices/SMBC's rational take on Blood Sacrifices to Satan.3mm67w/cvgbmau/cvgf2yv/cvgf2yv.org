Hell is subject to market forces-- evidently there's some sort of demand for goat blood (perhaps it's a delicacy?) that they can't meet themselves.

As a self-contained work, it's fairly rational-- Hell has use for goat blood, and uses their ability to generate "stuff" to get it (munchining their ability to generate "Stuff".) Heaven has some use for worship, and uses their own abilities to get them. Humans want stuff, and employ their ability to generate goat blood and worship. It sounds like everyone is benefiting.
