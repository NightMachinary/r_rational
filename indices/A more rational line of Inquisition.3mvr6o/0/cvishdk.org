This might be an interesting post if you gave any sort of context for it. In addition, even when referencing an outside work, it's best to give an overview of the more critical elements like the setting and characters involved. With a canon to reference and sufficient background to describe our character's ends and means, we have enough to work with. The post as it is is like throwing a two-week-old kitten into a pool and saying "Have fun!" with roughly the same tone as the end of your post.
