If you're familiar with the setting, the post makes sense. If you're not, I can't see you getting much out of it in any case. v0v

That said, you should definitely check out DA:I if you haven't already. You're missing out, friends.

Edit: that said, I should still probably flesh out the OP more. Serves me right for posting before breakfast. :p Edits inbound!
