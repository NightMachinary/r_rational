Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's third in a trilogy, but I ~think~ it holds up well enough on its own. Naturally I can't be entirely sure on that.

As for buying it, it's often on sale on Amazon. Legit sorry this turned out so weirdly, I had assumed (incorrectly) that people here would have played it. Still going to expand the OP when I find time.
