Assume I'm wrong and temporarily crazy, and go about my days--because that's *much* more likely than a bunch of internet nerds catching on to the secret of the biggest change to the history of /life itself/ since the development of the cerebral cortex.

Maybe also quit dairy and wheat, see if that helps.

If I /still/ think insane things, time to see a shrink.

Okay, fine.

Statistically speaking, for the context and audience? Find a skilled liar amongst the ranks. Get them to claim to be female and interested in the supe', not just their powers.

/Ooooh no, sexist!/ Not so. Get your fucking finger away from that downvote button. Yeah, I see you.

Look. Doesn't matter the target's gender, or the manipulator's real one. Most people posting online are lonely (and often narcissistic). Lonely (narcissistic) men want to talk to nice, intelligent, interested women online (about themselves). Same thing for lonely (narcissistic) women, oddly enough.

That's basically what the long-established /Ashley Madison/Pinterest/ continuum tells us, anyway.

Once contact is made and lures are set, /IndieGoGo/ funds together to hire an attractive actress on a simple pretense, give the actress the chat logs to study, lure the supe' out, drug them, and drag them back to my...I mean, /a hypothetical person's/ secret bio-hacking lab just off the California coast in a converted oil tanker, to discover what makes them tick.

Also, assume they're lying about the scope and nature of their powers. Prepare for the worst (short of a one-person insta-Apocalypse). Full flying brick, teleportation, mental control, the whole deal. Avoid compulsions and (simple) memetic hazards. Have OpenCV apps on monitors interpreting and reprocessing raw data, TTS instead of your voice, and a Dwarf Fortress-style pool of lava under them connected to a lever close at hand when they wake up. SCP's /Foundation/ should have nothing on your setup.

It would help if you could scare the supe' a little right after drugging them in public, just to see what they try to do, but I'd lean towards going full /Prisoner/ on them first. GPS tracking collar, lonely location, lots of cameras, etc.

Harsh? Maybe. But consider.

This is potentially the chance to figure out how to give the entire human race an ability as important as speech (more, maybe), /regardless/ of the actual stated power, as well as rewrite the laws of physics (most likely). Letting such a person wander around where they could, any day and at random, get hit by a bus or run for congress, and thus waste their potential to change humanity forever, is not an acceptable risk.
