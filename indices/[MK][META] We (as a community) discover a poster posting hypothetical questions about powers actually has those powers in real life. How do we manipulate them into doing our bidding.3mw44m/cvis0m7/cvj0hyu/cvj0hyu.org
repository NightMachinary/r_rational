Doesn't that depend on the emotions you exude? If you don't feel any guilt or shame for manipulating him he shouldn't notice there being much off. At most maybe that you are warming up to him slower than expected and that you behave friendlier than you feel? That could have all kinds of non-sinister reasons. Bottom line, if you are a good liar with little scruples that isn't above befriending his targets/manipulating his friends you shouldn't have too much difficulty because of his powers.
