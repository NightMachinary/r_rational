Easy become friends with them. Then ask for favors. See if I could have him somehow transfer or awaken any powers in me.

As for how to exploit a person with that ability fuck if I know. To be honest a person that could sense emotional states would never be manipulated by anyone with less than perfect emotional control. Best idea is just to be that persons friend.

Assuming I could get him to do what I said there's not really much I could do with empathy (which is the power you are proposing). The person with the power could probably rise really high in politics and with practice could be unnaturally charismatic. I could help him rise to power which would benefit me quite a bit. Assuming of course I wanted to push him in the political power direction, which I would avoid at all costs, politicians that cannot effectively read minds are scary enough as is.

I'd probably just tell him to become a motivational speaker or something. I'd have a friend that gives great advice and could get women in bed easier than James Bond. I could tag along and get all the hot women I want with minimal effort. And in the end that's all that really matters right?
