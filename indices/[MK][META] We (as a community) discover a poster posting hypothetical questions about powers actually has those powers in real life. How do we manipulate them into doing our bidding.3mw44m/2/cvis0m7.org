The type of people that post to this sub are less than likely to be manipulable by people they hardly know. In this scenario, the individual in question probably has very good ideas about what they want to happen and how they can learn to go about doing it in an effective manner. Our community has a foundation in inoculating people against manipulation, by others and themselves.

Also, the "attendant sub-power" is more useful than the primary power. However, that primary power would allow the individual to see straight through the type of bullshit you'd be pulling if you ever were identifiably in-range.
