In all seriousness, I've considered making an "in-charachter" account where I roleplay as someone that that has supernatural powers and is asking for advice, and then write out stories of what they do with them. Like a series of quest threads, but a bit more immersive. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd care to spend that much time on it :(

I'd probably have to introduce some arbitrary limitations to explain why I'd keep the character contained to an arbitrarily small geographic location as well. Maybe something where the end result of the quest is finding some sort of power-granting item, and sending it in for analysis?
