Most suggestions for that sort of question-and-answer on this forum rely not just on having the stated superpower but also in being an incredibly driven person willing to extensively research and learn new skills for the sake of manipulating their superpower. Although these sorts of details can easily be hand-waved away in fiction I expect in practice a person will not be able to successfully carry out most of these plans. In addition, if the plan involves the superhero covertly getting a lot of influence and power, and this community will inevitably break up into factions on the best end to use this power.

I suggest to rat the guy out. To the police or domestic intelligence, through a secure channel, if they're too dangerous, to the media if they're not. If they're the kind of person who posts here they should be more than willing to be subjected to scientific research (assuming they're assured it's safe for them), which can have a broad benefit to humankind. A potential problem is if we can't find the real-world identity of this person or can't convince anybody else their powers are real (though if we can't convince anybody else the guy's superpowers are real, we have to start wondering why we're so convinced ourselves).
