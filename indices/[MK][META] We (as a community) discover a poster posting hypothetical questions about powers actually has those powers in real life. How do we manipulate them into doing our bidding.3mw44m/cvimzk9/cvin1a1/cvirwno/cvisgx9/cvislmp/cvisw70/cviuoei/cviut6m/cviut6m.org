The idea would be to only respond to posts treating it like it's in-character and providing "evidence" (read: bad photoshops) that is accepted by people who choose to join the roleplay. For example, back in the planetside 2 subreddit we had a alt called "NS Corra Dald" that roleplayed as a Nanite Systems customer relations spokesperson, and exclusively replied in-character. Everyone knew it was clearly a joke (including, obviously, the person who ran the alt), but people still replied as if the alt represented a real person because it was amusing.
