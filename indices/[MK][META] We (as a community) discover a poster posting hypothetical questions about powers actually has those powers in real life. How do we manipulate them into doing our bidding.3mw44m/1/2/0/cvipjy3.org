You can't really be a guys friend through a computer terminal. At least not the type of friend that they would really help.

Also the longer he has the power the more he would come to rely on it. I know for one thing that if I had this power that I'd never trust anyone unless I could sense their emotions. In the end manipulation always comes down to trust. The chances of getting a person with that power to trust you despite not seeing you is next to none.
