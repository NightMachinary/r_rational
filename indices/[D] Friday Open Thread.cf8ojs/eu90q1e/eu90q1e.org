Ive been pretty successful at my job! Which is cool. But I have no clue where to start in terms of building some stability financially in terms of: 401K Stocks Financial management Is owning a home a good use of money? Etc

I'd love any suggestions or ideas. If you can just give me a starting point that would be great. I do not expect people to do research for me, just maybe give me a couple of ideas of what they've found personally or statistically financially good.

Thanks, ian
