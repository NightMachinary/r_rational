If you're having trouble finding motivation doing other stuff because it might be meaningless, what are you doing to enjoy your time in general? To take the general Existentialist position, that just because things don't matter in general that you probably have something that you personally enjoy doing even if it's not necessarily something that, uh affects the general human progression. Conversely if as you say the only thing that matters is AI research, and you can't or are unwilling to try anything about it then within that frame nothing that you do will matter, and why worry about it if your actions already don't matter?
