I swear one of the bloggers in the rationalsphere had a blog post about people who aren't AI researchers can make a difference in the world by essentially becoming maids for AI researchers, so that way the AI researchers don't have to cook or clean. I don't like this as it implies that the "elite" have a right to free work from the non-elite, but hey, probably also worth pointing out that you could do something like that if you really want to contribute.
