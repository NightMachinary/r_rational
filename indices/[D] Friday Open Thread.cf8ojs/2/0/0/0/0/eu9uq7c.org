Yeah, I guess focusing on more short-term pre-AI values does kinda make sense, it would be nice to make something that would be useful for a decade or two.

It still kinda sucks. It's like being a guy who lived next to Tesla or Einstein or Aristotle, had a good life, spent his time making shoes or cooking or whatever, but didn't end up doing anything that matters now.

Or even worse, being a less successful younger brother of that ape who ended up being the ancestor of all the humans =) Imagine spending your life having a good time, finding a mate, collecting berries, generally being a great and nice monkey, while some guy next to you will end up creating a human race)

I'm joking around, but it's kinda hard to be excited about shorter-term narrower values, when right next to you something big and important is happening, and no matter what you do, it'll make your work irrelevant.

I can make a website or an app or an indie game, have fun doing that, make some money, and bring a bit of value to other people, but I can't convince myself that it's really important/meaningful anymore. And that makes it difficult to push through the hard/boring parts of any project. It's much easier to do hard work when you believe it's "worth" it.
