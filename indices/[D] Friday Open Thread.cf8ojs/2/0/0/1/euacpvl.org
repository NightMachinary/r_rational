Having studied a bit about AI development, AGI is a pipe dream from the 80's and it became pretty clear that it's an unrealistic ambition very early on.

AI is only better than human intelligence when specialized to a very specific task. (Such as playing chess as long as it doesn't also have to be able to recognize a chess piece). AI doing more than one thing is actually multiple highly specialized AI, each of which had to be programmed separately (knowing how to play chess on a physical board takes at least 3 separate AIs and some non-AI industrial automation besides).

So why focus on other things? Because you'll actually have a chance to acheive them.
