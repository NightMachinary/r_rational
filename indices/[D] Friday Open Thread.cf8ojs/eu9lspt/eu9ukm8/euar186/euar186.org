  The answer to this, I think, is not to try and form a theory under which all animals or all conscious things are valuable, but to accept that we value members of our own species because they're our species and it's normal for animals to love their own kind. Each blastocyst is a unique biological instance of our own species

I'm not a fan of inconsistencies in my moral values, but my own way to resolve this one is to say that no, infants don't have a ton of inherent worth either, and don't fare too well in comparison with an octopus.

If there's someone who loves them and would be sad about their death, then sure, /that/ gives them value - and that's such a common case that it's pretty safe to use it as one's default.
