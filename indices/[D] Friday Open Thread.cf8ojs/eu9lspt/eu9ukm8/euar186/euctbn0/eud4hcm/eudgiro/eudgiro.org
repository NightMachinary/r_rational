I worry people will value their children less if assessing their objective moral value becomes common. These aren't independent issues, except in the abstract, because the same norms determine behavior in both cases.

My own stance is that

1. Our position on abortion constrains what stances we can consistently hold on animal rights, and vice versa.

2. On net, we "should" value adults more than fetuses or infants, to the extent that values are or should be subordinate to facts.

3. Many people value infants and fetuses more than they "should", and this has desirable prosocial consequences. To whatever extent values are not or should not be subordinate to facts but are justifications in themselves, we should sympathize with this arbitrary, unjustified love of primordial protohumans, particularly if we're vulnerable to the same sentiment ourselves. Finding babies cute or fetuses sympathetic and allocating them scarce resources on such a flimsy basis is okay, perhaps even praiseworthy, where others are not too severely harmed by that choice.

4. The best compromise is to admit the taboo tradeoff - to be fine with first term abortions, wary of second term abortions, and opposed to third term abortions. But, we should not forget the costs of this compromise, from either direction, or condemn beyond the circle of empathy any who'd sympathize with one side more than the other.

5. This should not only be taken as a matter of personal freedom if we wish to live in a society where people care about the well-being of children who aren't their own.
