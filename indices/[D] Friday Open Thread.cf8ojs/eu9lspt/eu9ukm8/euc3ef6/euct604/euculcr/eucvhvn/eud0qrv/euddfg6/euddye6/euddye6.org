The point is that even if the medical procedure was entered into voluntarily initially, the person providing life support isn't obligated to keep supplying it indefinitely if it turns out to be more than they bargained for or if additional complications come up that make it more dangerous for them.

Another key point is that pregnancy isn't necessarily consensual or desired. Just because someone has sex doesn't mean they should be condemned to nine months of supporting another life along with a significant risk of death or injury. On top of that there's also the issue of pregnancies resulting from rape.
