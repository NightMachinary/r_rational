It is not obvious to me that backing out of the life support role after pursuing it is morally permissible. That's a claim, but you should support claims with argumentation.

Can I take it you are opposed to obliging fathers to pay child support or care for their biological children? In general, are you okay with not holding people responsible for choices that they made under ignorance or disregard for consequences?

Why would we take pregnancies from rape as modal for the purpose of arguments about the morality of abortion?
