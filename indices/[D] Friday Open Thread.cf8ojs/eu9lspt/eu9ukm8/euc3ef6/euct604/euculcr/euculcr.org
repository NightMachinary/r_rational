Yeah, but pregnancy generally isn't. If you're not capable of becoming pregnant it strikes me as the height of hypocrisy to just tell the people who can to suck it up and deal. Anyone that actually gives a shit about reducing abortions rather than just controlling women's sexuality should support access to contraceptives and science-based sex education.
