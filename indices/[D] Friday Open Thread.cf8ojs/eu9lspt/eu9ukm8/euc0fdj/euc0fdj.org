I disagree with several parts of this argument both in structure and meaning. Structurally, the thesis comes at the end of the second paragraph, which means that it leaves a lot unanswered and unargued. I'll start with the thesis, and then I have five points where I disagree with the content of your argument.

​

I think the statement /"each blastocyst is a unique biological instance of our own species and therefore worthy of our protection and support regardless of present capacity"/ is very definitive, but it leads to unpleasant places in the real world because its based on feelings rather than principles. I agree with you that philosophical arguments can take things to extreme hypotheticals, so I'm only going to use real world examples. I'm also trying to be fair, so I'm trying to not ask gotcha questions. These questions do hammer down on a statement that I personally believe is very hard to defend, and I think the bold ones reveal the largest missing areas in your argument.

- First off, why should we protect each blastocyst? Because they're human seems to be your argument.

  - *Why should we protect fellow human beings?*
  - When you see a human life not being protected, what is your individual responsibility? Is it justified to kill abortion doctors? Why or why not?
  - Do you support taking comatose patients off breathing apparatus to die? They too are biologically unique individuals. What about comatose babies?
  - When a couple uses IVF and several embryos are frozen, does the couple have the responsibility to carry them to term?
  - War also involves the destruction of human lives, particularly civilian lives. Should any war where the party entering was not directly attacked be avoided?
  - Second, to what legal extent do blostocysts deserve protection?

    - *Do people who knowingly have an abortion deserve to be treated like any other murderer. If not, why is there are a difference?*

- You seem to argue, and in large part I agree, that saving human life should be compulsory. However, there's a huge difference between saying it's right to do something and it should be forced on a person.

  - *Should people be forced to put themselves in danger to save another person?* Obviously pregnancy is a dangerous condition. What degree of risk should people be forced to take to save another human life?

    - Should kidney donation be compulsory? It's worth pointing out that for a Black American woman maternal mortality 24/100k is not that far off from kidney donation mortality, 30/100k.

  - Should people be forced to give up resources to save another person?

    - Should we be forced to pay taxes to lower maternal death rate?
    - Should pollution be illegal since it has a direct and measurable harm to human life? Cars most definitely are included in this.
    - Should all countries have taxes so that no one in the world starves or dies from lack of access to medical care?

​

Onto the content, first and foremost, there's an incredible logical contradiction in your argument. If there are no universal principles, why should other people who have different genetic codes be forced to follow your views which you feel are based on evolution? Because it's arbitrary and sometimes tyrannical to force people to do what you say because it's how you feel.

​

Second, I think that finding universal principles to understand ethics and everything else is not only socially beneficial, it's also necessary for effective legislature. Ad hoc laws lead to contradictions which frequently lead to injustices.

​

Third, human beings /do/ value sophistication. We value it in our creative enterprises. We value a 300 year old oak tree more than we value an acorn. We value crows more than mosquitos and mosquitos more than bacteria, even though all could be considered pests. Right now, there's a debate on the ethics of purposefully killing mosquitos; we do not have the same debate about eliminating diseases. In the most extreme example, we are legally allowed to let people die once they are brain dead. To live by this principal, I feed crows, don't eat octopi and would be fine banning its consumption, and only support euthanizing animals if they're sick or aggressive.

​

Fourth, just because we have natural instincts, that doesn't mean that following them is good for the individual or society. Following instincts is how a petty fight turns into a blood-feud, or how a fight gets started in the first place. Our hunter-gatherer instincts do not necessarily promote the most beneficial outcomes in an urbanized post-industrial world.

​

Fifth (and final, sorry for the novel), is that you argue that it's ok to treat our own species better than others. If you define our species by genetic code, then different animals are a significant fraction of a human being. The problem with using Gorillas recognizably so without a microscope.
