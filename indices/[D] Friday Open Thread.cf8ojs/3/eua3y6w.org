In the fanfiction /Luminosity/, Bella uses a journaling technique for analysis of her previous thoughts.

#+begin_example
        I pinned my thoughts onto paper, 
        they couldn't escape later. Without 
        that kind of enforcement, they 
        were liable to morph into versions 
        of themselves that were more 
        idealized, more consistent - and 
        not what they were originally, and 
        therefore false. Or they'd be 
        forgotten altogether, which was 
        even worse (those thoughts 
        were mine, and I wanted them).

Does anyone have experience with this method? Did you find it at all effective? Are their any guides to this I could read, any recommendations you could offer?
