Can someone talk to me about the process of getting your story on ffn and ao3? I see a lot of stories here that use them, despite a certain lack of notification/subscription features compared to the norm on the sites some authors set up themselves (which is saying something). Is it just that much easier to use from the writer's side of things than other services (even rr has rss)
