Past studies showed a significant advantage for Dvorak over QWERTY only because they compared trained Dvorak typists with untrained QWERTY typists.

When you train both groups for the same amount of time Dvorak only gets something like an extra 5% WPM . Which isn't worth it for pretty much anyone. Only if you enter typist competitions you will actually get to have an advantage.
