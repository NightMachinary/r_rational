The process is pretty easy, you just... put it in a text box and hit submit, basically. I was shocked it didn't have RSS - I wanted to set up RSS with IFTT and Beeminder to make me accountable to publishing chapters of my story, but I was able to hack it together with a free RSS service of some sort pointed at one of the AO3 pages.

I think it's kind of like facebook in that FFN has everyone there, so it's worth putting up with their crap for the audience. AO3 also seems to have a similarly high user group.

That said I personally used AO3 because it had a slightly better copyright policy than FFN and also because everyone else was doing it and also because it looks pretty nice (FFN hasn't changed in appearance since... 2002 afaik?).
