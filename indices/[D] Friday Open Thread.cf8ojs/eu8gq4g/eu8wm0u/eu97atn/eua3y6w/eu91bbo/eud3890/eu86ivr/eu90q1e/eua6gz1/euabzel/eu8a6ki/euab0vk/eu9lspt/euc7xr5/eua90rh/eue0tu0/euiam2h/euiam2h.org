The model of a pro-lifer upon which that post was based was "an individual who wishes to reduce the rate of abortions". There aren't many other assumptions about pro-lifers made, nor is the basis for their views relevant to the discussion at hand. Specifically (and you aren't the only one who seems to have done this, which may indicate a failure to communicate clearly on my part), do not misconstrue "statements of /my/ positions" to be "my statements /on pro-lifer's positions/". Further, do not misconstrue "a pro-lifer's positions" to be equivalent to "the positions a pro-lifer should base their [persuasive] arguments upon [when those arguments are targeted at non-pro-lifers]".
