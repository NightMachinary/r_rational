1a) I am not suggesting that you personally need to become veg*nism. To reduce abortion rates, it is not your own mind on that subject you would need to change, but others'. To that end, if (/if/) the proliferation of veg*nism philosophy lead to increased compassion and thereby to reduced abortion, the spreading of veg*nism would be instrumental.

1b) Veg*nism compatibility with your personal philosophy does not matter, except insofar as it allows you to predict others. A persuasive argument must be based upon the target's values and philosophies or it is irrelevant. You speak of other philosophies that you disagree with: valuing AI or alien minds, or valuing animal life. But you don't need to agree with those values to use them as a basis for persuasive argument when addressing those that do hold those values.

2a) To me, worth does depend significantly upon sophistication. On one end, you have a human. (One could posit a more sophisticated being than a human, but it's difficult for me to conceive of intrinsically valuing such an entity /more/ than a human.) But on the other end, something lifeless, inanimate, uninteresting.

2b) A human blastocyst is a potential person, but not an actual person. At such an early stage, it is easy for me to say, where is the actual person? Where is the thing of value? Extrinsic value, yes, I would expect to find that. But I don't grant a human blastocyst intrinsic value. That is an alien thought.

2c) Is a human infant worth more than an adult crow? I feel, yes. I suspect a non-negligible part of that is in the extrinsic value of that baby (emotional attachment, investment). However, I do place much more intrinsic value on the baby than the bird. Is that inconsistent? I think it demonstrates a strong strain of human-person-preference much like the human-preference you describe and note grows as an embryo becomes increasingly baby- and human-like. From my perspective there is no internal inconsistency. The difference between our views is, conceptually, not that great: mine is the same line as yours, but fuzzier, and in a different place, but still dividing "worth protecting" from "not", with a significant pro-human bias. And of course I fuzzily include more "other" than I guess you would -- the aliens, AI, uploaded minds, clones, engineered beings, modified humans, etc.

3) In light of 2b and 2c, I would guess long-term suffusion in veg*nism philosophy to, at best, shift my "unacceptably late" abortion line earlier by one week to a couple months. Nation-wide, supposing a significant impact like 2-10% less meat? I could barely speculate on the impact across the several hundred thousand reported US abortions per year.
