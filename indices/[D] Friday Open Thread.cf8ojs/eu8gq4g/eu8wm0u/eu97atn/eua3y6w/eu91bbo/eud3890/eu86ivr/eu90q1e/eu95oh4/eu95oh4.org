[[/r/personalfinance]] has a standard flowchart in their wiki for establishing financial stability, I recommend looking that up.

If you're young, then that means dumping as much as possible into a 401(k), then Roth IRA, then an index fund such as Vanguard.

Everyone likes to use rules like "houses are a waste of money" or "renting is throwing money away", but the fact of the matter is it depends on the house and the people living in it. Having a house that you own that is paid off grants you a level of stability that's hard to beat, and lets you take risks in other areas. On the other hand, if you have a mortgage that has 3% interest and you expect to make 4% in an index fund, then the money used to pay that off could have instead been making more money. On the third hand, if you expect to move frequently or want the flexibility to do so, then you're gonna get shredded on closing costs over and over, so it's best to just rent until you know where you ultimately want to put down permanent roots.

One term to Google is FIRE, which stands for Financial Independence/Retiring Early, and is based around accumulating enough money to live off of the proceeds. In a nutshell, you can expect an index fund to return around 4% per year, so if you save up 25x your annual spending (not income!), you have effectively won the rat race and can stop working (or not, thus "independence"). Either way, it involves keeping track of what exactly you need to spend, trimming your life to suit, and then saving as much as is comfortable. See [[/r/financialindependence]] and the Mr Money Moustache blog for more.
