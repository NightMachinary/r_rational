Anyone watching anime Dr Stone. I watched the dub of episode 1. It was really good. I don't know if it will keep up, but the first episode had lots of rationalist agesent competence!porn, with slowly working through real world science to build tech from the ground up. For example, they made Nital and walked through the process of making and distilling alcohol.
