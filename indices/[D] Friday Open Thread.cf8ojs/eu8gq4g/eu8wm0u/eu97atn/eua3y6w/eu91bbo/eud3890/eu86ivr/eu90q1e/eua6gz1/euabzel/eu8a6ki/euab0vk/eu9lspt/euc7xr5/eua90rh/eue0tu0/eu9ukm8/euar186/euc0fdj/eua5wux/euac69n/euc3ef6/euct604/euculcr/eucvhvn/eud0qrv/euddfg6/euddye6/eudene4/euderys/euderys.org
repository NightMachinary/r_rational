You aren't actually addressing my points. Stop projecting and actually respond to my arguments.

Caring for someone financially isn't equivalent to having to support them with your own flesh and blood against your will.

Edit: Also you're not the only person that can sneakily edit in extra points. For context the comment I was originally responding to only said "Can I take it you are opposed to obliging fathers to pay child support or care for their biological children?"
