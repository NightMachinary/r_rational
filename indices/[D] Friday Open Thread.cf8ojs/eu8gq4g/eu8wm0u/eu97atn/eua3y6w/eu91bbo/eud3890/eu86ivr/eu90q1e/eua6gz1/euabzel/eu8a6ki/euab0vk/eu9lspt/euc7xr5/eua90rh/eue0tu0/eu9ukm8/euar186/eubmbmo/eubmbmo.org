I could perhaps see how you might consider an octopus mind to be greater than an infant's mind at the given moment. But are you saying that in a contrived save/sacrifice situation, you would feed the baby to the octopus? Even with certainty that there is no other way, no family, no one would ever know, etc, I'd guess such a position would put you below the 5th percentile of the "I value humans more than other animals" spectrum.
