Huh, okay. My guy was definitely old school. 70 if he was a day, and the only tool he seemed to employ (aside from a big-ass needle to deliver novocaine to my mouth) was a set of pliers.

At one point, he grunted to himself and said, "big guy, big teeth, guess I'm gonna need the big pliers." He turned and pulled out this comically large implement from a drawer and just started wrenching my head back and forth as he worked the tooth loose. Since I was basically a big happy buzzing ball of nothing from my lower eyelids to my Adam's apple, I didn't mind.

I was just pissed that I ended up missing NYC ComicCon that year since my face-holes were leaking blood and spit and foulness longer than I'd expected.
