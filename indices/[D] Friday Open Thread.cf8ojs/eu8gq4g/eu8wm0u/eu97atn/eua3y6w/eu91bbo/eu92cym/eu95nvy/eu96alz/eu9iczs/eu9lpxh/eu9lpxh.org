I had all 4 out and was on novocaine and laughing gas. I'm very sure that using laughing gas or not is very dependent on the teeth orientation. Although mine grew in just fine. They were just widely spaced from my other teeth and a breeding ground for cavities.

My doctor was also fairly young and probably more willing to use laughing gas as needed.

I wasn't exactly high like I was implying. I was just very Zen and detached from my surroundings which was definitely from the laughing gas and not the novocaine. Albeit with a very insistent need to cuddle with my mother for a little bit.
