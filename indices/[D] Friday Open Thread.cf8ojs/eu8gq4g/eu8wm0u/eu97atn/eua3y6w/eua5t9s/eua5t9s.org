I regularly keep a journal and it is fascinating how different our emotional states can be from one moment to the next. It's soothing to be to write down all these things that happened and gives me an opportunity to think about them from different angles. I'm careful not to plunge myself into maladaptive self reflection though (like power or victim fantasies about a negative social interaction) and keep things constructive. Putting my thoughts into words are so useful to keep track of them this way.

I used to write them out, but now it's just more convenient to type them out - I can search through older entries easier this way. I'd recommend using something like evernote so you can jot down things on the go too. Every six months I archive them into an epub.
