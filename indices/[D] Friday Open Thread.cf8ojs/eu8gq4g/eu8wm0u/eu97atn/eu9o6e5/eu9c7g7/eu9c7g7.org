Some people make cases for other existential risks. AI can't be invented by radioactive corpses. But I don't imagine you're the perfect fit in those fields either.

The truth is that most people don't have the abilities to make a useful contribution to the cause through direct work.

So, take a page from effective altruists. Find a well-paying job you're suited to, and donate part of your income to [[https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/ai-risk#Organizations_working_in_this_space][AI alignment research organisations]]. They'll use it to hire someone to do what you cannot.

They're all small enough that an individual donation is not a drop in the ocean, if that matters to you.

 

10% of one's income is the commonly used figure, because it's nice and round and it stops overly-conscientious people from burning out.

 

(This answer applies to most people who feel an ethical burden, even if they're not on board the AGI train. Whatever your pet cause is, unless you're unusually talented in that specific field, your money typically does more good than your actions.)
