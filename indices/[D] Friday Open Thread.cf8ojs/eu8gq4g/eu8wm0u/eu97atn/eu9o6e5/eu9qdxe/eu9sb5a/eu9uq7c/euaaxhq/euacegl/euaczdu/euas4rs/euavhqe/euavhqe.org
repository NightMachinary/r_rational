Yeah, I do recall it specifically talking about cooking and/or cleaning. It was either by or about one of the Big Names in the community.

In the end, I'm personally just being irrational and not trying to optimise my life around helping Friendly AI happen. My current job/career path is (hopefully) having a positive Effect on the World (like... I'm not "making shoes" but I'm not "literally Einstein" either - but let's not forget Einstein helped develop the technology for WMDs as well as revolutionising modern physics, so at least being a master shoemaker you can be pretty sure you're not going to be an intrinsic part of the causal chain that results in 400,000 people being killed?)
