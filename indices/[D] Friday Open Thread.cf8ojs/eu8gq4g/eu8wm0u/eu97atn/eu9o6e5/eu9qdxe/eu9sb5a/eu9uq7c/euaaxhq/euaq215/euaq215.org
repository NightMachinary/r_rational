When you look at the past you can see the tens of thousands of people that had lasting recognition, but what you don't see is the tens of billions who didn't. The spotlight can't stay shining on all but a tiny fraction of people---there's just not enough attention to go around to serve billions of ideas. Even if AI were not a thing, the pace of progress is moving so fast, that right next to you something big and important would still be happening, and only those with the expertise or circumstance needed to advance it will truly be a lasting part of that.

I guess what I'm trying to pick at is that if you can see the value that you can bring about today, that can more easily than ever effect literally millions of people, and still can't muster any hope for it, the challenge seems less about the specifics of the outside world and more about your brain chemistry. I don't know how to fix the latter, else I'd be a more motivated person myself, but I do tend to trust that solutions are easiest when you look in the right direction.

I will say, though, if you're looking for impact... think bigger than ‘an indie game'. There is so much low hanging fruit here; computer science is intensely young and naïve, and you really can impact the state of the industry for a mere large number of people. If you've thought for a week---or better, [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nCvvhFBaayaXyuBiD/shut-up-and-do-the-impossible][five minutes of extraordinary effort]], by the clock, with a timer---and really can't see where to start, PM me and I'll share a few ideas rattling around in my head.
