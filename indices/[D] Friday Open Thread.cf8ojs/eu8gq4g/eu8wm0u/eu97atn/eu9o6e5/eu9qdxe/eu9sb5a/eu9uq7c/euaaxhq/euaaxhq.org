I don't know. The great minds of the past need shoes: Ruth Bader Ginsberg no doubt had a legal clerk who helped her do legal research, helped her draft briefs. She no doubt had a favourite coffee shop where she got a nice cup of coffee that helped make her stressful life livable. She also ate food that a farmer grew. And, she wore shoes that a shoemaker made (or a shoemaking factory, but you get it)! And without those things, she would have been a less successful lawyer and judge. Maybe marginally so, but the success of every visionary in the world is owed to the scaffold of society that they were able to grow up in. If Ruth Bader Gingsberg was born in New Zealand in the year 1300, she probably would have been a great - I don't know, poi dancer? - but she was fortunate enough to be born where she could make more of a difference to the world.

So you make a difference. Maybe a barista reads one of your fanfic and it puts them in a good mood so they are extra nice to their customers and one of their customers is a secretary at a company that works with an AI institute and that secretary is all chipper after the nice barista, and so he has the energy to go the extra mile to organise some nicer flights to an AI conference for the people at his institute, and with those nicer flights the researchers are able to arrive in time for a networking event at the conference and they meet the other people who ultimately make friendly AI.

The idea of all these connections may seem absolutely fantastical (well, it is), but think about your life. There's no doubt a few things that only happened because of a bunch of little coincidences. (Like, I stayed up late watching fireworks on Sunday night which meant I was still tired on Tuesday night so I didn't go to my normal board game night and instead went to the Wednesday one where I met a really cool seeming guy who I hopefully will become best friends with: if I hadn't stayed up late on Sunday or if I'd slept better SUnday or Monday night I might not be about to make a new friend, and friends have such a big effect on our life).

So as long as you're not literally sitting in a cave, consuming but contributing ZERO to society, you're probably doing alright.
