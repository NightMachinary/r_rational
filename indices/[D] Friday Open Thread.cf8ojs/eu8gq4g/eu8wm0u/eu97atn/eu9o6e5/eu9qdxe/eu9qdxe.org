Yeah, but I'm no doctor.

I can be good at 3D graphics, web development, /maybe/ writing. None of this saves lives, and all of this will be done better by AI (and, to be honest, by more talented people), no matter what I create. I can use these skills to make some money, but that's the extent of it - nothing I make will have lasting value.
