If you really believe that we will see AGI within our lifetime (to me it seems at least likely), it kinda devalues literally everything else a person can do in the meantime. Like, logically, isn't working on AI(or trying to get in a position where you can influence it's development) the only meaningful thing left to do?

Do you agree? If yes, then how do you reconcile this with doing other stuff with your life? Personally, I don't have enough aptitude/intelligence to contribute to the field(I won't be making original discoveries any time soon, if ever), but I'm also having trouble finding motivation to do other stuff, that's not related to AI, because it seems meaningless.
