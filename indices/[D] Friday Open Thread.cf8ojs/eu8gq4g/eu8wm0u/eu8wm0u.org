You are the half-brother of Mungaro, dictator of Venebabwe. Venebabwe is a third world country of largely subsistence farmers, whose economy is buoyed by massive oil reserves. Since the locals do not have the technical skills to exploit them, your half-brother signed extremely generous extraction right deals with various foreign companies.

Mungaro was immature, reckless, and economically ignorant. Over the years he wasted fortunes on luxuries, bribes, and ill-fated public projects, until he was routinely relying on printing money to pay the bills. The result was spiralling inflation.

Mungaro soon grew angry at all those conniving foreigners who profited off Venebabwe's oil and debt interest and refused to accept repayment in trillion-dollar Venebabwean bills. Eventually, Mungaro defaulted on foreign loans, kicked all foreigners out of the country, and appropriated their companies - much of which were dismantled for quick cash.

Two years later, the country was in such abject poverty and chaos that the military rallied around you, murdered Mungaro, and put you in his place.

*How do you put your country on the path to recovery?*

On paper, Venebabwe is a very wealthy country. But you have neither the infrastructure, nor the skilled labour to extract the oil yourself. Nor the treasury to buy your own machinery and hire foreign experts (if any could be convinced to come).

Normally, the solution would be to find investors. But after this debacle, nobody would be crazy enough to invest in Venebabwe without taking a HUGE cut. And that's a vicious circle of sorts: the more outrageous the cut, the more worried they'll be that one day you'll snap and declare the contracts invalid because unfair, like your half-brother did. To price in this risk, they'll need a bigger cut, and so on.
