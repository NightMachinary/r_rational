Depends on your priorities.

If you value your citizens' well-being higher than Venebabwe's autonomy or your other political/philosophical ideals, just bend the knee to a more powerful country. Tell the United Provinces of Columbiana that you'll give them exclusive drilling rights to a few million acres of prime oil field in exchange for disaster relief. They'll probably make you a figurehead who dances to their tune, but they'll also install a heavy military presence (useful since obviously your current military isn't particularly loyal, and you have to be careful of any lingering cells of Mungaro loyalists) and rebuild your roads, hospitals and schools. If you don't trust them, try to broker a deal where you auction off slices of oil field to Allemany, Gaul and Bretony in exchange for oversight and their own contributions to restoring infrastructure.

You're also going to want to make it really attractive for foreigners to buy property and run businesses, so offer huge tax breaks. Not a huge loss since most of your big money will be coming from state coffers anyway, you mostly want the foreigners there to pump money into local economies and fuel job creation.
