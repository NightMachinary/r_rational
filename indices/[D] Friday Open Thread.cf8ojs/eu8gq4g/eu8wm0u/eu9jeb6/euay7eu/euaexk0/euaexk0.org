Maintain your sovereign currency, manage it correctly, and use it internally, but conduct trade in USD and keep a reserve of USD. Do not sell rights to natural resources to foreign investors; make money with exports.

Attract talent by offering generous deals to skilled laborers willing to immigrate. You'll have a hard time to start with because your country's currency doesn't buy much, but you can always offer land. You may have to attract farm specialists first (more likely to be motivated by land) before you can get to experts who can start more exciting industries. Whoever you get will improve your exports (so you can get USD that other countries will accept) and the availability of goods in your own economy (so your currency is worth something, so you can more successfully bribe skilled laborers to relocate).

Once you have enough money to start extracting oil (hiring foreign contractors to set up the infrastructure if needed, buying materials and machinery you can't produce in your country), do that. Your country has complete ownership of its own oil extraction, so you get the maximum possible cut. Export the oil and use the proceeds to improve infrastructure.

Your improved infrastructure might be more oil fields (so you can export more oil, repeat). You might also decide to kickstart other industries, so your local currency is worth more, so paying skilled immigrants in your own currency is more convincing, so you don't need to pay for foreign contractors. Keep doing the math on that each iteration, because it depends on scale and the oil market.
