In practice no. I doubt there would be many such transplants. This 'plan' is mostly a legal runaround. In Roe v. Wade the SCOTUS gave the right to have an abortion up until fetal viability. That is the point where, with extensive medical help, a baby could survive out of the womb. As long as you can drop that viability down in theory it doesn't matter if people do it in practice.

(Of course, I doubt the plan would be that simple in practice. Judges who support abortion will just refine the test, while those who oppose it don't really need fresh excuses to act).
