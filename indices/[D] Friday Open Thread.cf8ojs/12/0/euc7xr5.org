Among pro-lifers there seems to be a commonly-held (almost universally-held) that there is something inherently and uniquely sacred about human life. (Poll pro-lifers about whether they believe in the existence of a "human soul," then compare that to the general population.) I think most pro-lifers would: 1) be offended by comparing the termination of human pregnancy with the termination of livestock, and 2) feel that conflating the two would undermine their goals because it flies counter to their core belief that human life is uniquely sacred which is the reason that any unborn child (an "person" in the sense of having human DNA) must be protected; for your hardcore "not even first-term abortion" types, it's not about their current level of brain function or whatever, its about their inherent and immutable human-ness.

Meat devalues sanctity-of-animal-life. I think most pro-lifers would argue that conflating santity-of-animal-life with sanctity-of-human-life devalues sanctity-of-human-life.

  I think of an unborn child (to some approximation) as a "non-person" animal

That would probably be why you are not pro-life. (If I'm wrong, please correct me.)
