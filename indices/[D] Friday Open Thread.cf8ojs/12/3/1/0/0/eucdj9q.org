Are you aware that more than 50% of all human pregnancies end in miscarriage? The majority of women who miscarry don't know they've miscarried. This is a fact.

If, just for the sake of argument, we grant the premise that your god is real, that means that this god designed human reproduction in such a way that fully /half/ of all pregnancies spontaneously abort themselves. This god certainly doesn't value potential future humans as much as you think it does.

I mean, really /think/ about that. God loves abortion so much that +he+ it aborts literally half of all pregnancies.
