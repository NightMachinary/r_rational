Yes.

Although the mother's right to her own body and health matters more. Without agreeing that the foetus has its /own/ rights, then it's an issue of personal freedom vs outsider happiness.

I lean heavily towards freedom. And, not being able to get pregnant myself, I'm extra wary of taking a position about someone else's freedom.

But if there was a way to minimise that cost (like the artificial wombs of the other subthread - assuming foetus extraction is little worse for the mother than foetus destruction), I could see it as a viable compromise.
