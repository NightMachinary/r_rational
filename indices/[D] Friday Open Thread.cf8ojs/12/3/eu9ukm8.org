This particular anti-abortionist's answer: not really. I find the pro-choice position untenable in part because it's contingent (at least in its most common form that I've encountered) on believing that our worth depends on developing a certain level of sophistication; that is, prior to some stage of development, the blastcyst/embryo/fetus/whatever doesn't count as a person. But if we are only considering an entity's abilities at that precise moment, a lot of our attitudes towards animals in general become nonsensically inconsistent. I've got a baby in the house right now, and as of this precise moment he demonstrates nothing that can be plausibly described as reasoning ability. He has no capabilities beyond a few flailing motions, smiling, yelling, sucking, and excreting. A common crow, an octopus, or a border collie easily outstrips him. But I'm fine with those animals being shot by farmers, eaten in restaurants, or euthanized in shelters respectively, and most people wouldn't hesitate to kill ten of each to save a single random human infant. And I don't think those people are wrong. But I would (in theory) expect a consistent pro-choice ethic to support vegetarianism or veganism, and in fact many pro-choice people do.

We don't value our kids because of their aptitudes. We value them because we're programmed to protect small, fat, helpless things with big eyes (which is basically the only reason pandas aren't extinct as well). As it happens, the point at which most people become uncomfortable with abortion is the point at which the fetus starts looking like a baby. We'd feel stupid trying to argue that literally, so we turn to sciencey-sounding but equally arbitrary yardsticks like heartbeats or brainwaves. The answer to this, I think, is not to try and form a theory under which all animals or all conscious things are valuable, but to accept that we value members of our own species because they're our species and it's normal for animals to love their own kind. Each blastocyst is a unique biological instance of our own species and therefore worthy of our protection and support regardless of present capacity (generally speaking; please don't lead this conversation down blind alleys involving clones or what-have-you). Our failure to generalize the protective instinct that far is only a sign of our limited empathy; evolution couldn't plan for this contingency.

If we ever meet intelligent aliens, we will probably like or dislike them to the extent that their thoughts and behaviors resemble a human's, and I have no objection to pulling the plug on any number of artificial intelligences provided they are not necessary for our own species's flourishing. We present both as sympathetic in science fiction by having them act basically human, which makes them more of a metaphor for racism or other forms of intra-human bigotry. In short, while I don't condone cruelty to animals, I am resolutely "humanist" in this sense, and I think the inordinate love of animals is also unhealthy.
