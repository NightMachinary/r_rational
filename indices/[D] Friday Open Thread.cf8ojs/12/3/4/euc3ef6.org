To everyone who finds this argument convincing, I bid you to consider the following [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2PAajlHbnU][video]]. It's from a channel called Philosophy Tube, and it presents the most compelling argument against abortion I've seen yet. Essentially even if fetuses are assumed to have the same moral worth as an adult human being, abortion should still be legal due to issues of bodily autonomy. He presents a metaphor of a dying violinist, kept just barely alive by being hooked up to another man for life support. That man didn't consent to the procedure, and would dearly like to be disconnected from him and go home. If you think it's a moral obligation for pregnant women to carry babies to term, you are just as obligated to give up your life and conveniences in order to save others.
