I would deem someone immoral if they took actions to wire a violinist into their own biology and then pleaded personal autonomy as a reason to let them sever the violinist as the cost of its life. In general, I think most people would assign blame for letting die where the decision to let die only arose as the result of the decider's choices.

All the "arguments" in your response to me do not engage with the violinist metaphor. It's frustrating that you'd talk up how insightful it is and then immediately abandon it for personal attacks and non-sequiturs when pressed.

I haven't moralized at all in this exchange, that's been exclusively your role. I'm not necessarily opposed to abortion, as you might have learned sooner had you been slower to jump to conclusions. I'm certainly opposed to your presenting bad arguments on abortion's behalf and then painting others as judgmental or cruel misogynists for daring to consider the merits of the beliefs you claim are decisive to your position, though.
