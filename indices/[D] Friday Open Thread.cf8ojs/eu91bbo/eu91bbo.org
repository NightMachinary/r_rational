Whelp due to an unacceptably high risk of getting cavities and after 3 of them, I got my wisdom teeth out today.

I opted to be awake for the procedure and decided to scribble down what I felt while high as a kite in the car ride back. Already a few hours afterward I have forgotten what it felt like to be in that altered state but it's really interesting to reread what I wrote.

Does anyone have any questions about wisdom teeth removal or want me to share my drugged up notes?
