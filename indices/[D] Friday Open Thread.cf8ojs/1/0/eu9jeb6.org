  Normally, the solution would be to find investors. But after this debacle, nobody would be crazy enough to invest in Venebabwe without taking a HUGE cut. And that's a vicious circle of sorts: the more outrageous the cut, the more worried they'll be that one day you'll snap and declare the contracts invalid because unfair, like your half-brother did. To price in this risk, they'll need a bigger cut, and so on.

Contracts that start out obscenely generous and slowly reduce to merely reasonable over time seem like a solution to this.
