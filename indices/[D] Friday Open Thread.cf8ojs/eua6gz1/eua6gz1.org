[[https://store.steampowered.com/app/447120/Where_the_Water_Tastes_Like_Wine/][Where the Water Tastes Like Wine]] is looking really great. I can't wait to get started on it today.. This has everything I could wish for - a cast of diverse characters with gameplay focused on interaction with them, the beautiful, beautiful artwork.. A fascinating historical period. I just love the bohemian feel of it all.
