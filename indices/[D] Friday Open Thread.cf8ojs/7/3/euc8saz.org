Due to the non-liquidity of houses, houses are only really good as an "investment" if you plan to keep them for 7* or more years (the non-liquidity means that the transaction costs of selling the house will often outweigh the benefits of saving a few years' rent).

So, when you buy a house, you are 1. committing to to live in the same city for the next many years, 2. committing to live in the same /neighborhood/ for the next many years, 3. committing to live in the same size dwelling for the next many years. (Maybe you're currently single, but in 5 years time might find yourself marrying, having kids, and moving into a house based on criteria like having a suitable number of rooms, being in the right school district, etc.)

If you are a freelance contractor, buying a house sounds like an even dicier proposition.

* This is the national average last I checked (which was a few years ago), but that info may have changed in the intervening time and it may vary depending on where you live. You may live in a city that is economically ascendant, in which case you may want to buy a house there if you feel that they are currently underpriced, or you may live in a city that you judge to be in a bubble, in which case you should avoid ownership like the plague.
