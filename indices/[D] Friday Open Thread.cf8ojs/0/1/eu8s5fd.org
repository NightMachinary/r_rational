I currently use colemak and I regret it. Its been about two years since my switch and I'm now pretty much stuck. My qwerty WPM is soemwhere around 30 and whenever I use other keyboards I have to look at the keys, not to mention my constant struggle against random applications that refuse to accept the alternate layout.

However, my usual speed is back to normal and has increased marginally(~85 with qwerty to ~90 with colemak).
