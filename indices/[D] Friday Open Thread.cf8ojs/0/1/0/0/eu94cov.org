During my mechanical keyboard phase I had a summer job where I did very little on a laptop all day. I type a lot for school so I figured I'd take preventative measures against RSI. I chose colemak specifically because zxcvqw are all in the same place, which meant no problems with commands. I stuck with it because by the time I'd realized the issues with it I was honestly too lazy to switch back.
