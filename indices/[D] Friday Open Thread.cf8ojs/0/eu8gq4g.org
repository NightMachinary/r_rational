I've spent the last month and a half teaching myself to use the Dvorak keyboard. This has been one of my worst decisions in recent memory. My QWERTY speed was 120+ wpm burst and 100+ sustained. After 80+ hours of typing I reached 90+ wpm peak and 70wpm sustained with Dvorak at which point I decided to switch back to QWERTY.

I feel like I've wasted a significant portion of the last six weeks. Dvorak is marginally more comfortable to type with but I've never had issues with RSIs and the advantages aren't enough to overcome the enormous barrier to entry. The initial learning process felt awful. Being unable to comfortably interface with a computer made me feel literally handicapped. That, combined with the difficulty of overwriting a lifetime of muscle memory, and the inability to easily use any computer that isn't mine are what drove me back to QWERTY.

I'm currently cruising along at 60wpm after 1 day back to QWERTY. Feels bad man.
