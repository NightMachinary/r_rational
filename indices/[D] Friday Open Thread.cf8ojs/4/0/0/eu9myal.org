Here's my notes as I was scribbling down my impressions within 20 minutes of getting up afterwards. I deliberately left in the messed up punctuation:

  Surgery was very weird and interesting

  Started breathing laughing gas which smelled like rubber and mint

  Started tingling, was nervous but then realized that it's expected.

  Then the tingles spread until it was all I could feel. I could feel pressure and the coldness of the metal under armrests. And that was it.

  Felt happy that it was keeping from having to feel anything. Felt like the tingles ate me away.

  Later after drifting, I eventually saw a light and then saw two people. Thought I was feeling the medicine to feel less concerned about the surgery even though I was shifting around in my seat. Went from grabbing the armrests to the bottom of my shirt.

  Thought the medicine made me sleep deeply for a few minutes and then I wake up to have the surgery right now.

  Didn't feel like I woke up. Felt like I was thinking very hard but jumping from one thought to another without meaning to while my sight was bleeding back in with more and more details at a time.

  Felt like a hollow space behind my right side teeth.

  Felt like I was repeating my thoughts about the surgery again even as I had an increasing pressure on my bottom left teeth.

  Drifted off again as the tingles and numbness ate my vision away.

  Same thing happened again as I drifted off when I was thinking more thoughts about the surgery and then my senses slowly bleed back in again.

  First I see the rectangular square light then the doctors and slowly more of the room. Anything else wasn't black exactly but more like it was colored nothing. I simply didn't see the rest of the room and all there was in my field of vision was the light and the doctors as if they were the most important things in my eyes. They became less important as I slowly perceived more such as the tears leaking out of my eyes my hands still gripping the bottom of my shirt the ceiling tiles the rubber covering of the laughing gas hose and the hollow spaces behind both of my teeth.

  I felt like I could have gotten up but was too comfortable to get up.

  Couldn't tell if there was something keeping my mouth open or if I couldn't feel my teeth touching (later realized it was the gauze).

  My mouth feels dry, slobbering saliva, propped open, tasting both bloody and like burnt rubber.

  I didn't feel like I was light headed but disconnected from the world but definitely with it and impaired at the same time. Could logic through things but not really paying attention.

  Asked about keeping teeth. They came out intact but it was thrown out already.

  Wanted to center myself and shaking hands with the doctors and hugging mom felt like I was more connected to my surroundings. Kinda like I needed a little physical contact to keeping from flying away.

  It was such a weird experience that I wanted to type this out in the car ride back home.

  My mouth tastes like blood and ashes and numb as hell. But I feel pretty well afterwards. Not sleepy but don't really want to get up and move around. Just need to lie down and hope that recovery goes well.

  Suspect that I was awake for the whole thing but the memories never made it to long term storage so it just feels like I slept through it all.

So yeah, I didn't have very strong emotional reactions other than the desire to hug someone. But I was incredibly fascinated by how I could clearly feel my perceptions (vision and touch mainly) being so distorted and was in a constant loop of thinking about my sensory inputs, thinking about my thoughts about my senses, and thinking about thinking about thinking about my senses.

I was just filled with a strong desire to immediately write down my thoughts afterwards so I could read them again in a few hours when I wasn't so detached or loopy.

The part that's really interesting is that I had novocaine and laughing gas which shouldn't have knocked me out. But I slept through most of the surgery. I wonder if I was actually awake for it all, but just forgot it and then forgot that I forgot. I wished that I asked the doctor, but forgot to check.

Recovery's been going incredibly well with minimal pain, no swelling, and the bleeding's stopped already.

I kinda want to try the laughing gas again. It was really interesting reflecting on my reflection in a seemingly endless loop.
