Before anything else, I announce that the legal currency of my government will be the dollar.

Now, since my nation has english as an official, albeit not majority language due to its history as a colony of Albion, I petition the Federated Provinces of Columbia for annexation. It's extremely unlikely to work, but it makes for an excellent political stunt cleanly separating me from my anti-globalist brother.

From there, my fallback plan is to make myself essentially a military puppet, but not an economic puppet of the FPC as I present my nation as a staging ground for their military bases in the area. This in turn lets me reduce the size of the doubtlessly bloated and too-powerful military without fear of a coup because I'll be propped up by the FPC soldiers I've invited into my nation. This lets me invest money into humanitarian relief, development programs, and beginning the process of restarting local and regional elections.

Now, while international observers will attest to the fact that these elections are indeed free and fair, there will be doubts over my willingness to hold free and fair elections that have the potential to replace me. To that end, I'll propose that Venebabwa become a constitutional monarchy. "What the fuck?" The rest of the world responds. But as I explain further, they see my plan. Venebabwe's new constitution will substantially resemble the FPC's system with a three-branch government including a supreme court, bicameral legislature, and first citizen. My /only/ power as the Archduke of the newly proclaimed Grand Duchy of Venebabwe will be to demand the resignation of the First Citizen and subsequently an election for a new First Citizen. (To make sure this isn't a power I hold only in name, I'll make sure that, ceremonially at least, First Citizens hitting the end of their term are always "dismissed" by me, so the populace grows used to me using this power.)

This essentially guarantees pro-western leaders will stay in power for the near future, greatly increasing confidence in my country.

And if somehow this convoluted plan works, everything after that is just rebuilding the economy with obvious, but laborious methods.
