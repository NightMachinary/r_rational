Dollarizing isn't a terrible step, but switching the whole country to crypto might be an even better step - my main qualm is transaction volumes of existing currencies and that it'd make it harder to do NGDPLT, the main benefit is that investors have superior liquidity for moving funds in and out of your country.

If you can liberalize business laws very quickly without being overthrown, it's not an unconvincing signal of future reliability. Most banana dictatorships do /not/ quickly adopt very good business laws on paper.

Aside from that, if you have one good advisor, cooperating heavily with the UN development folks except where the advisor says otherwise will go a very long way. Scott Sumner would be an obvious pick for advisor and I know various other folks who could probably do the same.
