I accidentally typed 5 PM instead of 7 PM on my warning post. So as a very poor apology, I'm posting this 20 minutes early even though to you guys, it's an hour and 40 minutes late.

This was also a very hard chapter to write about because I don't actually know enough about biology to write anything more than what Hofstadter says or how to summarize it properly.

Also this was one of the longest chapter in the book which was the main reason for why I had so much trouble finishing this post. Well that and a brand-new full time job researching for the summer.

I'll shoot for next Sunday to post the next chapter, but I'm not promising anything which is why there are no dates on the schedule for the remaining chapters.
