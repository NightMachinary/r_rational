Why are you assuming that Quirrel is still going for the Stone? It doesn't make sense to me that if he wanted the Stone, he would use Harry. It's better to use other students as the unwitting minion. Of course they could fail and Harry would be more likely to succeed, but it doesn't feel right to me.

I think Quirrel is going for a confrontation with Harry for something relating to the Horcruxes. Remember that all of Harry's information on the Horcruxes came from Quirrel and there could be an unknown benefit such as Quirrel is capable of moving his brain-state from his current body into Harry's or something like that.
