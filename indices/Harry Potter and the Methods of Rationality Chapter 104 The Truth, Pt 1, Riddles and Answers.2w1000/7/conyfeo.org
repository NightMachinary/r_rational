Maybe Harry should just not cooperate, let V die without stone and kill anyone he wants to. Harry can then get the stone and resurrect everyone. It looks obvious to me, that Harry absolutely wants to use the stone, so maybe it's protected in a different way from canon.

Daaaaamn, actually if it's just transfiguration V wants, Harry could just say V should use some unicorn blood in the process, as he knows someone who has been transformed permanently... Eternal polyjuice?

Do you make the stone with unicorn blood? Does the stone produce unicorn blood? Is the stone the heart of a unicorn, or the alicorn princess? :D
