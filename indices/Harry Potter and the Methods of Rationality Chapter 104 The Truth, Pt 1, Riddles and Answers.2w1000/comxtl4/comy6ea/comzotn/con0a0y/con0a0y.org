The sorting hat denied that there was a ghost residing in Harry's scar, which I interpret to mean that Harry's scar has no agency of its own.

Still, it's probably more accurate for me to say that Volde believes Harry to be Tom Riddle, in some sense. Even more accurate to say that Volde wants Harry to believe this.
