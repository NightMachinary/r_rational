That's why I have passwords to give people that inform me that whoever is using them is hostile and should be killed immediately.

Also I would generally regard any written message from the future as suspicious but if I expected to have to do so I'd have a few context dependent codenames.

If someone can travel back in time it is probably better to have some way to send a message with them.
