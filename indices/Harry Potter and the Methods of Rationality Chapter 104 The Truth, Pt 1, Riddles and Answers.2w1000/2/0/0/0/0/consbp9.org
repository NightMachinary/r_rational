Just don't flip the coin too many times... after all, the universe threw a fit at factoring a six digit number.

You won't even get to 15 coin flips before "timelines where weird stuff happens" outweigh "timelines where authentication succeeds", assuming the factoring problem is representative of how much optimization power you can exert. (Finding a 15-bit hash collision requires on the order of a 100 tries, similar to the number of primes less than 1000.)
