but an /in/competent attack dictionary would only have "password"- that's the point: given the choice between shitty security, and no security, shitty security wins.

remember hadran's wall? if you've seen it, it's really only knee-high. but having enemy troops forced to step over even such a small obstacle is a tactical advantage.

I'd hazard that your understanding of security is flawed- security isn't there to protect against an attack, it's there to buy you time to respond to an attack. no matter how tight your security is, it can be bypassed, given infinite time.

imagine harry did use a password. imagine quirrel knew he used a password. quirrel now has to delay to find out what it is. if that delay pushes him back, say, a week he instantly loses, as by that time, harry's on the train back home. if he tries without it, he loses, as harry knows it's not future!harry communicating with him. even if he knows the original potato code, if he uses that, he runs the risk of losing due to harry changing it after learning occulomancy, so to be safe, he'd have to delay to verify that he didn't.
