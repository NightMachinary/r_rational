Certain magical actions in Hogwarts, which are beyond a certain level of harm, trigger the Hogwarts wards to alert the Headmaster to the time and place of their use. Professors however are whitelisted in the wards, and will not trigger them, presumably because the headmaster would otherwise have alarms going off during regular classes.

As such, if we accept that a student was Memory Charmed - presumably a prohibited action - then the caster must have been a professor.

So, to memory charm a student without alarm, Imperius a professor.
