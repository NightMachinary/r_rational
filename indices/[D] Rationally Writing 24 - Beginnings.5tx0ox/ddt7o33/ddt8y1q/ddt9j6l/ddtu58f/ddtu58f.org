I looked around for more studies and found one by Johnson and Rosenbaum ([[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093650214564051][pdf]]) performed in the southeastern US that had the opposite result. They define enjoyment a little differently, more rigorously, and across all categories unspoiled report a little more enjoyment (but for one that's tied). They don't expand on how they gathered their subjects, but the sample was just over 400, similarly gender-biased, also racially biased (it's a historically black school).

The paper also references a second Leavitt and Christenfeld study that explored the reason for the result in their earlier one, which found that it would have to come from processing fluency - that it's easier to understand what's happening.

But as for having to be stupid to avoid spoilers if they enrich enjoyment, I have no trouble believing people would fail to notice that difference in enjoyment where they have been socialized to dislike spoilers or hold a belief that they ruin stories. Even having opposed results, both of these studies show only a modest change between the spoiled and unspoiled.
