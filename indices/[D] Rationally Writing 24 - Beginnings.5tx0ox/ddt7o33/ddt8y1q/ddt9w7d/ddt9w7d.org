  I always just interpreted this to mean that people who enjoy spoiled shows outnumber people who don't, not that people who believe they enjoy non-spoiled movies actually secretly enjoy spoiled movies more.

Fair. It'd be nice to have a study controlled for spoiler-caring.

My take on Chekhov's Gun places it alongside other notions about respect for the reader's ability to make predictions about a story, like Sanderson's First Law of Magic, making them a matter of having context for the occurrences in the work. I'd say a lack of context for what happens in the climax is the primary jarring factor of the deus ex machina.

But to take it further, recommendations, reviews, and ads give the reader information about what to expect in a work as without any info nobody will take time to check it out. This jumps back to your comment about going in blind: how blind do you want to be? We develop and maintain tropes for a lot of reasons, among them providing context and expectations through patterns and norms. So I think there's a minimum acceptable amount of knowledge of a work and ability to anticipate its actions the audience must have to be able to enjoy something. In this way, spoiler sensitivity is a matter of where a corresponding maximum lies for a person, and what that information can and can't be (my first guess would be to look at that in terms of plot).
