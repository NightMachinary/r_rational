Thanks for the comment! We do get relatively few Likes/Upvotes/Reviews (I think we still haven't been reviewed enoguh on iTunes to even have a rating show up), so they definitely stand out and are appreciated :)

  I should expect you two reread and rewatch things.
#+end_quote

This is something I get asked often when I discuss my aversion to spoilers, since I do indeed reread things often. However, I would say that there is a premium on the first read or watch of something that is qualitatively different. A spoiled movie or show is rarely completely worthless if you know where it's going and how it ends, but you can re-experience and enjoy them over and over again at any point in the future. The only time you can specifically enjoy going in blind is the first time.

  And there's Leavitt and Christenfeld's research showing spoiled audiences report greater enjoyment than unspoiled ones.

I always just interpreted this to mean that people who enjoy spoiled shows outnumber people who don't, not that people who believe they enjoy non-spoiled movies actually secretly enjoy spoiled movies more.

  There must be something here, as with the principles underlying Chekhov's Gun, where more context and stronger expectations allows for greater satisfaction.
#+end_quote

So my understanding of Chekhov's Gun is more that it's a Rule of Writing to prevent deus-ex-machina. It definitely acts as a build up of suspense in some cases, and can be executed very well sometimes, but most of the time it's fairly obvious and ham-handed, and I understand that "this is being brought up because they want to make it important later, and they can't just have it suddenly appear with no warning." It's rather immersion breaking, most of the time, but even when done poorly, is still a necessary evil to avoid even greater immersion breaking, if that makes sense.

  Funny you brought up Gurren Lagann, as it opens with a very brief "this is where we're headed" prologue glimpse of the future that nobody remembers - including the show's creators. It's a pretty common device in anime and I never remember they exist. I'd think the serial format would be a factor, perhaps compounding with whatever goes on for movies.

Yeah, I think I often forget such spoiler opens because they just don't have any emotional attachment to them early on. Like we're seeing them as completely contextless, random bits of sound and noise, and we know it's supposed to be important later, but it just doesn't register as important.
