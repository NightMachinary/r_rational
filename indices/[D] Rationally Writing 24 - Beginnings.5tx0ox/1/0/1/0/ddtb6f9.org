  how blind do you want to be?
#+end_quote

Most of my favorite experiences when watching media have been from going in absolutely and completely blind. Not a single trailer, not a single idea of what the movie is about, or even the setting if possible.

(To be fair, a couple of my worst experiences watching movies were like this too, including one that I [[http://daystareld.com/review-under-the-skin/][recently ranted about.]] )

Note that this isn't to say that the media itself is "elevated" by going in blind, necessarily. I knew what The Fellowship of the Ring was about going into the theater, and think it was objectively more amazing a film and story than, say, Arrival was. But the enjoyment I got out of Arrival was almost exclusively from not knowing what was coming next, or what to expect. And maybe I would have had that, PLUS the original value of Fellowship if I had gone into that blind, but I know that I would have enjoyed Arrival far less if I had gone into it knowing what to expect (and if I /fully/ knew what to expect, including the twist, I wouldn't even have bothered, because it kind of ruined the movie for me, but I on the whole don't regret watching it thanks to the pre-twist experience).

I do think that I'm a general exception to this, however, and that the vast majority have not just different tolerances for spoilers, but different preferences. I do not think I would make a useful case study for marketers trying to figure out how to better entice people to watch their films.
