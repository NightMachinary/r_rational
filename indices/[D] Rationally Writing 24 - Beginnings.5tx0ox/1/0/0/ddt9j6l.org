  I always just interpreted this to mean that people who enjoy spoiled shows outnumber people who don't, not that people who believe they enjoy non-spoiled movies actually secretly enjoy spoiled movies more.

I agree. You can't apply the conclusions to the enthusiast population. People who enjoy reading mysteries and the like would have to be stupid to avoid spoilers if it turns out they actually like them, but the general population might just not enjoy mysteries all that much.

From the paper:

  Participants (176 male, 643 female) were recruited from the psychology subject pool at the University of California, San Diego.

If I understand this correctly, it means that these are (a) all psychology students, and (b) volunteered for a general research pool, not for the specific study.

Thus the selection process for the study (i.e. you study psychology) doesn't necessarily correlate with the selection process for, say, a crime fiction novel (i.e. you want to read crime fiction novels).

This means that, while the conclusion is (probably) true for aggregate groups of psychology students (78.5% female; not that it's likely that matters, but it does illustrate the biased sample), it might not generalise to enthusiasts. People who seek out content that is susceptible to spoilers may well not enjoy spoilers, but comprise a smaller portion of the sample population (especially the bubble that is a student body in a tertiary education institution).
