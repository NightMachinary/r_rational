Another good episode. Not sure how much /n/ listeners and /x/ likes means on your end, so I feel motivated to comment here just to get that message across.

I've been considering a few books and movies for that "beginning at the end" bit and what about them makes them work despite the trouble. Most are biographical, which often puts us first-person as you had noted helps and - in nonfiction - always means the writer can suppose the audience is aware of the basic facts of the subject (in fictional biography, the writer can affect that tone anyway). Still spinning on what makes it work out in Brief Encounter, one of my very favorite films.\\
I guess I share this to say that your show engages me and I think through your conversation throughout my day, rather than out of a sense of having some insight to offer anyone else.

It's interesting that you both find knowing what's coming to be problematic when reading or watching something. I should expect you two reread and rewatch things. I've never minded spoilers, feeling that it's the merit of storytelling that bids me to read on rather than a sense of not knowing what will happen. And there's [[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611417007][Leavitt and Christenfeld's research]] showing spoiled audiences report greater enjoyment than unspoiled ones.\\
Then again, knowing the next few beats does make me prone to impatience if there's a bad chapter. Hmm.

There must be something here, as with the principles underlying Chekhov's Gun, where more context and stronger expectations allows for greater satisfaction. Spoilers offer a lot of that. Perhaps with too many and too accurate expectations things begin to decline, as with reading a book so many times as to be able to recite it.

Funny you brought up Gurren Lagann, as it opens with a very brief "this is where we're headed" prologue glimpse of the future that nobody remembers - including the show's creators. It's a pretty common device in anime and I never remember they exist. I'd think the serial format would be a factor, perhaps compounding with whatever goes on for movies.
