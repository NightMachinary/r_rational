Hey everyone, this week I'm recommending [[http://amzn.to/2lJawuN][The Laughing Corpse]], by Laurell K. Hamilton. It's the second book in the Anita Blake series, and I'm recommending it because even with all the vampires and werewolves and zombies running around, it's a crime novel, and you can't talk about book beginnings without mentioning crime novels.

Whether it's the classic writers like Arthur Conan Doyle, the contemporary masters like Grisham and Connelly, or even the supernatural genres like the Dresden Files or Anita Blake, most crime stories have a formulaic beginning: the first chapter is almost always the main character at a crime scene, or if they're a private detective, sometimes meeting a client with hidden motives.

This has become a formula because it works. It immediately starts the action and plot of the book, and gives the author the opportunity to show, rather than tell, the character's skills and attitude toward their work. In the case of the crime scene it also gives the readers a hook, either an extra grisly murder scene to raise the stakes, an unusual or improbable killing to raise intrigue, or both. Or, in the case of the client meeting, it gives the readers a chance to feel, along with the main character, whatever unease or suspicion they might have about the client.

A lot of books have both kinds of openings as their first two chapters, and The Laughing Corpse is one of them that I think does them to great effect. It's also just a great book on its own, and the Anita Blake book that really hooked me into the series. It gets weird later on, but I enjoyed the first dozen or so books quite a bit, and they have many great qualities.
