It can't be some sort of pure energy storage pattern thing -- you can't plug in wires and run a city off a pokeball that has a creature in it, right? As I understand it, it's a sort of singleton pattern-thing that's in there. You can think of the balls as spaceships. Sure, you can go into a spaceship and then come back out, you can even be transferred into a different ship, but there's no way to get you into a new ship while maintaining you in the old ship because there's only one you. The terms that scientists use in the Pokemon canon are just massaged for the tender age and general idiocy of the trainer population (in kind terms, since they basically have no schooling or knowledge of physics). Time doesn't pass in the balls, right? So I think a frozen bit of space/time is the right way to look at it. Just because we managed to capture/shrink "you" doesn't mean that we necessarily have the technology to duplicate "you". Unless the Pokemon canon has shown that there is some sort of duplication ability somewhere, perhaps with a broken ball or something, and then duplication is literally in the cards.
