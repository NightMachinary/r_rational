Thanks for the breakdown!

  But if Pokemon are reduced to information, then it still doesn't make that much sense that you can't duplicate them at will. Maybe it would just be better to say "We're taking this entire slice of space-time and sticking it in a ball" which would get you around the problem of heat/electricity/etc.

This is something I plan on addressing, sort of: Porygon is actually the first completely artificial pokemon that the people of the pokemon world are trying to create by reverse-engineering the matter-to-data technology. It's so hard to perfectly get every aspect of a living being right though, that the test subject is a very crude life form indeed, though they're not quite able to make him work perfectly just yet.
