Theory 1. You might need to get into the idea of "souls" (behind the scenes anyway). The amount of heat in an object being consistent could be easy, just have the transference energy be supplied by the poke ball (or container).

But why can we not clone pokemon? If we break them into energy and information then supplying more energy would simply allow us to use the same information twice, then there are two charmanders. Souls could be an answer to this, for whatever reason the "power" behind a pokemon can't be copied, and without that power the pokemon dies in a matter of seconds. Pros: no cloning, works with your story so far, provides an interesting problem to work on over time. Cons: why did Laura have to cook? Couldn't they simply take the "information" from a previous dinner and copy it with sufficient power? Guns(including net guns) would work entirely off of batteries. It breaks economy (take the "energy" from a log and use the "information" for a stack of hundred dollar bills.) energy becomes currency, and this would modify the entire world way to much to be feasible.

Theory 2. A new type of energy. This energy has a wavelength, "voltage", etc. and is basically a new type of matter. This energy is complex and mostly unknown to us. It is mildly dangerous(hence the need for containers).contact with it will cause mild burns, made worse by the "attraction" it has with itself causing intense focused burns. By luck someone learned to break matter down to this energy, it took quite a while for someone to make the matter again. The energy clusters together and allows it to remake itself, but two sets of this energy will pull together causing a mixture of the two(one Pokemon per ball at a time). We cannot modify this energy, but we can read tiny taking measurements in certain ways.

Pros:works with most of your story so far. Most of the handwaving happens at an almost quantum level, leaving it less obvious. Could allow for interesting ideas, such as metronome simply doing this same thing but actually /making/ energy that is psuedo randomly assigned a form based on other pokemon.

Cons: your "training inside a pokeball" implies a two way communication, meaning that the energy is by nature readable and writable . Weaponizing it would be a major theme again.
