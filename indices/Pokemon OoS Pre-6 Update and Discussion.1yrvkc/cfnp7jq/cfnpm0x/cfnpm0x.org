It always seemed like such bullshit in Star Trek that they were able to put people into a pattern buffer and then pull them out again later but they were somehow /not/ able to clone people with that same technology. I know the technobabble behind it, but they violate that technobabble on at least two occasions, which always made it seem like the Federation was involved in some massive conspiracy.
