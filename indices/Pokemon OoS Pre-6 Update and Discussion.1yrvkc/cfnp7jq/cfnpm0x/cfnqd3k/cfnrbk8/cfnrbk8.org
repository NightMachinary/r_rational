It's almost identical. A transporter converts a person into an energy pattern, beams the energy pattern to a location, and then reconstructs a person from that pattern. Early versions of the technology required a "landing pad" for reconstruction, while in later version you could transport yourself around the ship without being anywhere near the transporter room. The recording is done down to the quantum level, with Heisenberg compensators removing any uncertainty.

And that's all well and good. However, Star Trek would /also/ have you believe that while the computer can make a steaming hot cup of tea out of arbitrary matter (with their replicators), or revert a person to the stored memory file after an accident (done in more than one episode), or even split a person into two identical copies (done in the episode "Second Chances"), their technology */somehow/* doesn't allow you to create duplicates of people.

From what I know about Pokemon, which isn't much beyond what's in the games and anime, the process is virtually the same, except instead of dematerializing, beaming, and rematerializing, it goes dematerializing, storing, and rematerializing.

But what the hell an energy pattern is never really gets explained (in either canon), and by mass-energy equivalence you'd think that a twenty pound Pokemon being converted into pure energy would mean that a Pokeball malfunction would make Hiroshima look like a firecracker as the equivalent of two hundred megatons of TNT get released.

--------------

If you were writing the story from scratch, I'd say that the dematerialization/rematerialization is a two-way destructive process that's not all that well-understood. You'd probably want to use an analogy with audio - just because we can listen to a song doesn't mean that we have the capability of recording it. But if Pokemon are reduced to information, then it still doesn't make that much sense that you can't duplicate them at will. Maybe it would just be better to say "We're taking this entire slice of space-time and sticking it in a ball" which would get you around the problem of heat/electricity/etc.
