Theory 3:(look around if they are out of order, sorry) shrinking. Kinda random, but size changing is common in Pokemon, maybe squirtle has shrunken pressurized water in his stomach? Charmanders would have to eat quite a bit of food, maybe they are expanding the oil? There is a whole host of problems with this though. Including storing Pokemon at one computer and retrieving at another. Why would being shrunken mentally disable humans? And why do alakhazams not suffer the same way?

Theory 4: alternate dimensions. I honestly can't see any way to make it work with the mental damage, pokemon restrictions, "dream like state", etc.
