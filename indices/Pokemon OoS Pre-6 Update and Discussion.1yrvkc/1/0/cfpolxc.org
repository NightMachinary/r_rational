I just read Pedestal. It was a great story, I really enjoyed it, but definitely not rationalist fiction -- all the major characters are driven solely by emotion and tend to jump into things without thinking. In fact, they tend to actually denigrate thinking and getting more information. How many times did the main character say something like, "I don't want to know, I have too much to worry about already"? However, that's part of the point of the story, how emotions tend to drive us and what that means and the consequences that arise from that. It was a really good story, a fun read, but not rationalist fiction.
