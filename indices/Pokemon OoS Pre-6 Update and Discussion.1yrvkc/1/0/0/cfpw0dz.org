I agree, Pedestal does not count as a rationalist story. So much of the grief and tragedy of it all could been averted before everything spiraled even more out of hand.. It's one of the best earliest deconstructionist Pokemon fiction though. The author didn't generally touch the technical aspects of things - but the little things like gym leaders secretly throwing matches, consequences when Pokemon fight all out, the more nitty gritty stuff.. It's just so fascinating to see takes on things with some realism added to it. And that's where Pedestal really shines, right?
