Ooh, how did I miss catching this? Link to first chapter please!

Already like the direction in which this seems to be heading.. Sounds like you're going to deconstruct the heck out of the pokemon world. ^ ^ I cannot stress how there can't ever be enough DC pokefics.

I think your best bet would probably be explaining away pokeballs with tech developed from an application of Teleport, to pocket dimensions or something. I don't envy you wrangling it up into a proper explanation in the story though..

If you need ideas, I found a few rational-ish Pokemon reads that are worth looking into.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5300280/1/The-Natural-History-of-Pokemon][The Natural History of Pokemon]]. Like a scientific journal with detailed entries explaining the physiology, behaviour, conservation status, etc. The author put up the evolved pokemons as related species; young to adult lifestages too though in some cases. I loved how he strived to put up realistic, biological explanations everywhere.

Very similar to him, [[http://arvalis.deviantart.com/gallery/39915677][this Paleoart enthusiast on Deviantart]]. I was blown away by his [[http://arvalis.deviantart.com/art/Dragonite-330244373][Dragonite]] (tadpole to frog!) and [[http://arvalis.deviantart.com/art/Gengar-334476729][Gengar]] (camouflaged bat) interpretations.

/“..looking at Gastly, I cracked it, his eyes could be bat ears; then the rest just fell into place design wise. None of the Gastly family are actually ghosts, but have just been claimed to be. Gastly and Haunter on live in caves and empty towers, appearing only at night. Their forms are very hard to make out as they have deceptive camouflage; Gastlies appear to be little more than a head at first glace, though in actuality are a very large poisonous bat. Each member of this family possesses a helium bladder, giving them the ability to float and taking on a ghostly appearance. Gengars do not occur in the wild, they are the result of a trainer taking their haunter to a new region, this results is a radical shift physique. Though Gengars do possess the ability to levitate, they are much heavier than their kin and can only levitate to avoid attacks. Each of them can produce a poisonous cloud by ruffling their fur, releasing dried toxic saliva into the air; though Gastlies seem to do this most commonly. They are hyper carnivores, preying on anything they can find, most commonly their relatives, Zubats. “/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4871317/1/Pedestal][Pedestal]]. A longer series with a decidedly darker edge where we see a lot of very real world scenarios thrust upon the pokemon world. It starts out innocently though, deceptively similar to other stories. Only to turn everything you've known about the game on its head. Hands down the best Pokemon fiction I have ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7752133/1/Almost-Like-Flying][This ones]] kind of related to your pokeball dilemma. A short read exploring pokeball brain washing, from the rather horrific perspective of a captured pokemon.

[[http://joe-wright.deviantart.com/art/Tall-Grass-387904643][And finally this]]. Satire, poking fun at letting ten-year olds go on expeditions unsupervised.
