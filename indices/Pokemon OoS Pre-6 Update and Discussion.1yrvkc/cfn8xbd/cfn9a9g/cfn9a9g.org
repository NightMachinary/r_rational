  The entire concept of a rational technology based just seems brain-breaking to me - that people would develop mass-energy conversion tech and use it to make it more convenient to drag other sentients around for gladiatorial games.

It really is painful to contemplate :P But by Arceus, I've got to try and do my honest best: I know I can't make Pokemon be "realistic," but I can at least make it make sense.

  I think it would be sort of hilarious if the pokemon trainers started talking about STAB-theory and EV-theories in regards to his analysis.

  Charmander started with Ember? I thought he came out at level 5? Oh well, adjusting canonical levels and movesets so forth is probably a good idea unless you really want to try to rationally explain why Squirtle can't growl while Charmander can't tail-whip (I later noticed him tail-whipping in your fic).

Most of the game conceits like "levels" and "EVs" and "STAB bonus" are being dropped, as I'm trying to go for a more serious fiction than a simple deconstructive parody :) I do plan on addressing more central concepts like super-effectiveness of course, but it's not going to simply be "Squirtle's water gun makes an Onyx faint because it's 4x as damaging for mystical reasons." There could be a number of reasons why a water pokemon would have an advantage against a rock or ground pokemon.

For example the reason water types have an advantage against certain ground types could be that they can turn dirt and soil into mud, which is much harder for Ground type pokemon to navigate through or manipulate, giving them a distinct disadvantage in the usual combat that ensues.

  I look forward to your trying to explain HMs, TMs, or anything like that because explaining how there can exist a single use item that can teach a clefairy how to generate effects as varied as flames with it's fists or bolts of electricity.
#+end_quote

Well TMs are infinite use now thankfully (since generation 5, Pokemon Black and White) so that particular idiotic game conceit doesn't even apply anymore :) Also there's no particular reason for HMs to exist as a separate thing in my world: the idea that there are only certain moves that can be used out of combat is another game conceit that survives from the traditional RPG background of pokemon, and it's one that's getting closer and closer to vanishing.

All that said, TMs will be handled fairly simply: I've already set up the Pokedex as the machine by which trainers can interact with and effect their pokemon while they're in their pokeballs. A TM is simply a software program that allows trainers to run a specific virtual training regimen that teaches specific species specific moves.

  Perhaps it will tie into how some pokemon are capable of generating any effective attack in the entire world at total random without requiring any of the physiology the other pokemon would use to do the attack (Metronome) and the ability to generate any attack in the world provided someone else just used it on you (Mirror Move).
#+end_quote

Yes, some pokemon are able to manipulate energy in such a way that they can generate electricity even if they're not an "electric type," or fire if they're not "fire type." As for more obscure moves like Metronome, not sure if I'm going to keep that concept pure :P It might just be a situation of "how is that pokemon able to do so many random things?! What if it can do ANYthing another pokemon can do?" Similarly, Mirror Move would only be learn-able by pokemon who have an excuse to be able to copy the effects of what's used on them, if not scrapped altogether.

  Have you been following [Twitch Plays Pokemon](reddit.com[[/r/twitchplayspokemon]]) at all? As annoying as it is to watch on a moment-to-monent basis, it is still hilarious and interesting at times, and has created more amazing fan-art than most other things I have ever seen.
#+end_quote

I have indeed! I don't participate as often anymore, but I still check in now and then and follow what's been happening. I'm so happy to see such an amazing social experiment spreading in awareness as far as places like [[http://xkcd.com/1333/][xkcd]]. My personal favorite bit of art: [[http://tsaoshin.deviantart.com/art/Twitch-Plays-Pokemon-435767159]]
