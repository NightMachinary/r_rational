I personally don't think that there will ever be a really solid physics behind Pokemon and quick energy to matter and back conversions that preserve information and don't allow you to power your civilization's electric grid off of a Pidgey every century (and instead seem to have a power plant full of Electric pokemon for some reason??) that is consistent with e=mc^{2} and classical 'physics as we know them in reality'. Not sticking to Earth physics will probably make things like Teleporters and the Teleport Skill, the Dig Skill, and the entire concept of an Escape Rope easier to explain I guess, maybe?

The entire concept of a rational pokemon technology based just seems brain-breaking to me - that people would develop mass-energy conversion tech and use it to make it more convenient to drag other sentients around for gladiatorial games.

I've been reading your fic for a bit now. An interesting premise.

I think it would be sort of hilarious if the pokemon trainers started talking about STAB-theory and EV-theories in regards to his analysis.

Charmander started with Ember? I thought he came out at level 5? Oh well, adjusting canonical levels and movesets so forth is probably a good idea unless you really want to try to rationally explain why Squirtle can't growl while Charmander can't tail-whip (I later noticed him tail-whipping in your fic).

I look forward to your trying to explain HMs, TMs, or anything like that- how there can exist a single use item that can teach a clefairy how to generate effects as varied as flames with it's fists or bolts of electricity. Perhaps it will tie into how some pokemon are capable of generating any effective attack in the entire world at total random without requiring any of the physiology the other pokemon would use to do the attack (Metronome) and the ability to generate any attack in the world /provided someone else just used it on you/ (Mirror Move).

At this point, I think anyone analyzing the pokemon world's internal consistency would be fully justified in coming to the conclusion that they are probably in some sort of virtual reality that is being simulated on some higher-level and more consistent system.

Have you been following [[http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon][Twitch Plays Pokemon]] at all? As annoying as it is to watch on a moment-to-monent basis, it is still hilarious and interesting at times, and has created more amazing fan-art than most other things I have ever seen.
