You probably need to think about what you want to do with smarter-than-human Pokemon. In particular Mewtwo is a Artificial Pokemon which seems to be vastly smarter that any human. In particular it seems to be better at making Artificial Pokemon than the humans that made it (The only viable clone the researchers were able to make was Mewtwo which was only possible because Mew is special, however Mewtwo is capable of cloning any Pokemon). Mewtwo will probably be able to improve on its design over what the researchers did and once improved it may be able to do so again, and again ....
