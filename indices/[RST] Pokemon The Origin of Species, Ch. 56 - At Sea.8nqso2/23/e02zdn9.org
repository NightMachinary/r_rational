Huh, so that auto-catching-robo-arm thing was probably what you were alluding to in the last thread. Wonder if Bill was involved in this too, if not for the programming then at least for the financing. For that remaining blind spot of underground pokemon, it can probably get the pokemon under its own command to use Earthquake for massive damage - but that's probably too prone to collateral damage to actually be a viable idea, outside of extreme situations. Hm.

The way you ended that chapter was very poetic, how Leaf's own comment on splitting up unknowingly echoed Red's own decision and dilemma. I've come to notice these kinds of things more, where I doubt I would have even five years ago, and I always find myself admiring the way authors can weave what would otherwise be a throwaway line into a higher-level theme so fittingly. Nicely done.
