like everybody else, i am unreasonably excited about this ship on a ship

although I have a sad feeling this ship isn't gonna sail... we've been in Leaf's point of view a bunch of times and I can't recall her ever having a feeling like this towards Red. Whereas in Red's point-of-view the hints have been there almost since the beginning.
