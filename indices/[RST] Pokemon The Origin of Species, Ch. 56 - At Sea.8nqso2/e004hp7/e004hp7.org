"Eventually he checks his phone and sees that it's near noon...so he should probably get up soon. Instead he browses on his phone for a bit..." It seems like even the protag's are not immune to the dreaded phone-by-the-bed-time-sink.

Also "'Oh, yeah. Is Silph going to be presenting something too?' 'No, this year we're strictly on the hunt.' He smiles." Isn't ominous sounding at all (I bet Silph hired all those psychics and is about to go Team Rocket Executive Proton on this boat isn't he?)
