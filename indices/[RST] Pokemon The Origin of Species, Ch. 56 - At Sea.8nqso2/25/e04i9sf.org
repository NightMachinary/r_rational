I wanted to ask:

The story implies that the native language of Kanto is Japanese.

So why does everyone speak English exclusively?

Older generations are shown as still using some Japanese (Koga "about to lapse completely into Japanese" in that interlude; or Red's dad commanding his Mightyena in Japanese).

The younger generation also seems to know Japanese (Blue's "sakki" and Red understanding his dad when he talked in Japanese).

So why does everyone use English? Plot purposes? It'd be sad if native languages of the regions died out...
