Oh boy.

Back in the Grand Old Days of fandom on Yahoo Groups, livejournal, private archives, and finally Fanfiction.net, in the late 90s and early 2000s, the term "lemon" was used to describe a fanfic with explicit sexual content, because for whatever reason people were allergic to saying "explicit sexual content," "porn," or similar things. This was mostly a thing in the anime fandom communities, though it spread by cultural diffusion into others.

The fact that people no longer know what I'm talking about when I refer to it 1) makes me glad that fandom has grown up enough to use real words 2) makes me feel like an Old Man of the Internet.
