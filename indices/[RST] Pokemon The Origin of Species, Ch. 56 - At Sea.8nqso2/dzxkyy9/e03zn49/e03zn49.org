#+begin_quote
  The main dining hall is packed for the welcome speech, which is itself fairly uninteresting, to Red.
#+end_quote

Remove the second comma. (And consider revising if it's still confusing).

As is, the second comma makes it read so that "which is itself fairly uninteresting" is parenthetical. That's fine, except it makes the main part of the sentence read as "The main dining hall is packed for the welcome speech ... to Red".
