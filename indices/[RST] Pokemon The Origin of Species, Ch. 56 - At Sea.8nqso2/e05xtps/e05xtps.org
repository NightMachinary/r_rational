Not exactly related to this story, but to a rational interpretation of pokemon in general.

I'm writing a story that isn't exactly a rational fiction, but uses a rational setting (consistent rules, realistic). As part of the this, I've been reworking all the mechanics of the games into something that makes more sense. One thing I'm not sure about is how to do a rational explanation or alternative to pokemon evolution by trading.

I have two ideas at this point. 1. In the wild, evolution by trade is actually a result of migration 2. Results from moving between different "packs" of that species, like when a male lion leaves the pride it was born into to make or take another.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you.
