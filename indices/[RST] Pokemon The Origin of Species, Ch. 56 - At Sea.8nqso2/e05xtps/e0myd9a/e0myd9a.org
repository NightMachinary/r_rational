I do remember that originally the plan for golem and machamp was that they had to be traded with each other a la escavalier, but it got dropped.

Since trades are executed digitally, and both golem and machamp are very rare among trainers in rby, there could be a data corruption concept. note that machoke gains a pair of arms and graveller loses it.

For Alakazam/gengar, I could see an interpretation that mediums and psychics are studying different aspects of the same phenomenon and only by being exposed to both types of trainers can a kadabra or haunter reach its full potential.
