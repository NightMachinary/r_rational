I like both those ideas, and considered similar things before giving up on the idea altogether as too game-specific. If I tried rationalizing that then what about holding items while being traded? Or evolving with another pokemon in the same party? (It's not like they're actually next to each other when they evolve, one is in its pokeball), or holding your 3DS upside down?
