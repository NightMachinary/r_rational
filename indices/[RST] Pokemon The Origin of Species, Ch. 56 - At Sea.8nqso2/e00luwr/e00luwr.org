Oh boy, here we go. I was feeling down since I'm on my final exams, but this is already making me feel better. Well, better start already. I will be writing down my first impressions, later I will make a more organised comment.

So, leaf is looking beatiful. My inner reaf fanboy is screaming already. Is that dress a reference to manga blue? Anyway, Red is totally me here. Not that Aiko doesn't have waifu potential tho.

The boat sounds great. Will we have some "having a nice time" scenes? I hope so. When I like the characters, those are always my favourite parts.

  Sir, this is a FREAKING BOAT. We can not allow DEATH MONSTERS
#+end_quote

poor stafman, I'm having a lot of fun imagining this scene

#+begin_quote
  It's a date
#+end_quote

STOP TEASING MY INNER FANBOY

#+begin_quote
  Nothing like what he's feeling
#+end_quote

I should learn to shut up

#+begin_quote
  She takes it with a grin, and his pulse kicks up
#+end_quote

JUST... breathe

#+begin_quote
  right now he's absurdly happy that the coming week will just be him and Leaf.
#+end_quote

Yes

#+begin_quote
   what we've been dreaming of: peace of mind.
#+end_quote

Now I wonder how living in this world feels like. Even if we can die by chance just if a driver messes up, you don't think about it. There, people know that at any moment a rampage can happen. You are never safe. I don't know if everybody lives with fear, but there is probably a generalized subsconcious alert state.

#+end_quote

TIL what HUD means. Neat

#+begin_quote
  It's a live calculation
#+end_quote

You are telling me that you also adapted THAT into the story, and that it makes sense. Been a rational fic, I bow my hat

#+begin_quote
  Psychic power found to correlate with amount of gut bacteria?!
#+end_quote

Oh, sweet references to real life journalism. I need to get my videogame journalist friend into reading this, he would love it. Sadly, he has so few free time...

#+begin_quote
  we'll have a decent amount of space to run laps in...
#+end_quote

How big is that room???

#+begin_quote
  Viridian Fire
#+end_quote

Random thought, if we were to adapt this to the Spanish audiencie, it would literaly translate as the "green fire". Sounds silly tbh

#+begin_quote
  and form a new region
#+end_quote

Orange Archipelago or sevii islands reference?

#+begin_quote
  The frontiers around it have been slowly expanding
#+end_quote

So pokemon force civilization to not expand completely. I like this concept, makes the world mysterious

#+begin_quote
  Thundurus hit one of the cities
#+end_quote

I would love an interlude about something like this. Yo have already shown you are able to make regular rampaging pokemon to be terrifying, this would be breathtaking nightmare fuel

#+begin_quote
  in his grandparents' days
#+end_quote

And know I want an interlude of this. I would love to see your approach to that kind of world

#+begin_quote
  His hand hovers over the wine, curious, but then he grabs some juice
#+end_quote

So my fanboy mind. Just needs to switch this. To create the fanfanfic

#+begin_quote
  I'm trying to be realistic!
#+end_quote

I'm identifying myself so much with Red in this conversation. I don't want animals to suffer, but I don't care that much to stop eating. ...wait, I am feeling a lot like Red in general. Does that make me guilty when I root for the reaf ship?

#+begin_quote
  Yay!” She wraps an arm around him and hugs him, causing heat to flush through his body and up his face. “You know it's not actually grown in pokeballs, though, right? It's just using the same tech.” “Ah. Makes sense,” he mutters as she releases him, quickly raising his bottle for another drink.
#+end_quote

They are just too cute together

#+begin_quote
  The warmth stays with him for the rest of the night.
#+end_quote

/pauses reading so he can enjoy the peace of the moment/ Thank you daystar

#+begin_quote
  No, seven... nine... twelve... in all directions...
#+end_quote

What. Oh wait, other readers are waiting for plot to happen. Here it comes, I assume. Not that I'm not getting excited too

#+begin_quote
  pidgey nuggets
#+end_quote

Concept makes perfect sense, still sounds funny

#+begin_quote
  and not because he doesn't know anyone here and would feel awkward sitting beside them
#+end_quote

So Red is not totally me. I would admit it shamelessly

#+begin_quote
  the president, founder, and CEO of Silph Corporation holy shit
#+end_quote

HOLY SHIT INDEED

#+begin_quote
  It... tastes like pidgey
#+end_quote

Proof of The Matrix existence

#+begin_quote
  price of food will soon get much lower
#+end_quote

Talking about that, how does energy to mass conversion work here? IRL it would be WAY more expensive to produce the required amounts to meet the em2 equation

I'm really liking Mr. Silph

#+begin_quote
  Well, that's it, then. He'll tell Sabrina that he'll become her student.
#+end_quote

Waiting here for the "that would mean not seen leaf" moment. Personally, I think a strong personal relationship can be the most valuable factor

#+begin_quote
  That's not all I'd be giving up.
#+end_quote

Called it

Well, look how late it is here. I guess I will have to leave my extensive comment for another day. As always an amazing read, really enjoyed it. I hope we reaf fans get more love like this, and red makes the right choice.

Btw, I'm begining to think that I should make a list of questions I want to ask you, I keep thinking more and forgetting them. Here is the newer one: how do you deal with special berries, like the ones that help you resist a specific attack type? Are there any legends about power granting berries, like the liechi berry tree at Mirage Island?
