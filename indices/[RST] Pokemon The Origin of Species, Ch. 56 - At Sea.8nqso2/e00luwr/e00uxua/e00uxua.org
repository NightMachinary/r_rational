Glad I could improve your mood a bit :) Reading your comment was fun for me too!

Special berries exist in some forms, but many of them don't function the same way as in the games, since they're so tied to specific and arbitrary game mechanics. But one berry has already been mentioned as something Red fed his Pichu to make his electricity less risky to train with, so things like that are generally what I have in mind.
