Planning for the future is well and good, but I think we're all about to learn a more important lesson: opportunities happen before you're "ready" for them.

My guess is that Red's current emotional conflict will be resolved when the plot swoops in and forces Leaf and him to save the ship (for some unknown value of "save"). Additionally, just to make the choice for Red more clear, I wouldn't be surprised if Sabrina ends up implicated (/we do know she is working for Giovanni/).
