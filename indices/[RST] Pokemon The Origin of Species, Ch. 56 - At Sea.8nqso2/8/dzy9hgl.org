Now I'm really conflicted. The obvious thing for Reds personal growth and career ambitions would be to stop being a trainer, yes. I thought as much back when he talked with Sabrina. On the other hand, that would be crap for the story. Splitting the party temporarily is one thing, but a permanent split wouldn't make sense.

Here's my prediction: Red will decide to stay with the group for a while longer, a few months or so. He will justify it to himself by saying "a few months won't make a big difference over the span of my life" and because he doesn't want to leave his friends. It will also be because of his crush, but he won't admit that to himself.
