Given the indication that Red's going to ask his mom about Silph (and we all know the mess involved with that), I feel like the story's nearing a tipping point, the start of Act 2 if you will.

Red's got a once in a lifetime opportunity to get just about the best psychic training possible, Blue's gathering a following and exercising his leadership skills independent of the group. Leaf has the foundations laid and basic lessons learned to start pursuing stories on her own and earning acclaim as a journalist.

I figure that these competing pressures will soon come to a head and have the group split up temporarily - a few months, maybe a year or two - before they reunite in Act 3 once whatever Team Rocket's doing comes into full force and the heroes need to save the day.
