I also planing to write a rational pokemon fic .(well a pokemon mystery dungeon quest inspired by this and mfd more specifically) and have been trying to justify some really gamey bits of canon, but I think I haven't though of trade evolution yet. I think you should just ignore the trading part, and just think of it as an abstraction of more specific evolution mechanics. Maybe metal coat for example just represents the Pokemon eating a lot of metal , or maybe its an item that the Pokemon has to be in contact whith for along time . Kadabra could need the psychic contact of multiple psychic Pokemon and trainers or something like that .
