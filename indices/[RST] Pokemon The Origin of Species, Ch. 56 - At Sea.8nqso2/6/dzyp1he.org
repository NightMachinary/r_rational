/I got this feeling at like three AM while watching Netflix~/

Okay but more seriously, great chapter. It's really nice to get back to Red and Leaf after a pretty long time with just Blue's group, Red meeting president Silph was pretty cool, Red's caught the preparations for the attack on the S.S. Anne but doesn't realize it yet, and... um...

...Oh, who am I kidding. As awesome as this chapter is, too much of my processing power is taken up by an infinitely-looping squeal at the cuteness of Red's crush for me to make any sort of rational commentary. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be listening to /I Ship It/ for a month.
