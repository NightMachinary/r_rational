Honestly I see this dilemma as a non-issue. Red should just continue journeying with his friends until Blue and Aiko finish off collecting their gym badges. That would only take a year or two max with their skill levels, I imagine. Meanwhile, he can continue growing his talents for training and catching new Pok√©mon to help him with his research, as well as working on his psychic abilities himself and chipping away at new research work.

It honestly seems like Red is acting like he has less time than he actually does when realistically, unless he meets an untimely end, he has plenty of time.
