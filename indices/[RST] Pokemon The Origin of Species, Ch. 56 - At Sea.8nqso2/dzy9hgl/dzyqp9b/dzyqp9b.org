I honestly think a 6 to 18 month separation for the group would be pretty good for where the story is right now. Blue is coming down off a harrowing encounter that cost him his strongest Pokemon, and nearly got them all killed. At the same time, he seems to be responding really well to the environment of Vermilion Gym, and so I can really easily see him just throwing himself into that fully for a while, especially when the next gym is Erika. After the boat stuff, there's definitely enough weird stuff going on to potentially keep Leaf busy piecing together loose threads, and that could easily lead her to branch off into Red's mom's story line to actually progress the plot. Meanwhile, Red can take some levels in Wiz, flesh out the Mewtwo storyline a little with Sabrina, and maybe publish a paper or two.

Plus, there's all sorts of stuff that naturally would bring the party back together in the near-ish future. Blue is definitely going to want to train his Abra for Erika and Koga, and will probably need Red's help. Leaf would probably be the one who first stumbles upon the whole Lavender town mess, and will probably want some reinforcements to help save Mr. Fuji, which just snowballs into invading Silph co, the radio tower, and then the Rocket lair.
