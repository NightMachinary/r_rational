Roll credits? A fitting chapter for the joke, I think, as it kinda conveys that melancholy/longing/loss you feel when a book or an arc ends even though it's not really applicable here, the end in nowhere near (?) and the upcoming change in circumstances is not that fundamental, we've been going in and out of separated POVs for a long time now.
