  Random thought, if we were to adapt this to the Spanish audiencie, it would literaly translate as the "green fire".

It already means that in English too, viridian is just a fancy word for green. Honestly, I think Viridian Forest is kind of a silly name to begin with, but then again, most pokemon city names are like that (I think all generation I names are colours).
