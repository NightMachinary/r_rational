You do realize that Leaf is like eleven right? I know it can be easy to forget sometimes, what with her having the mental maturity of someone at least five or six years older than her in our world due to cultural and evolutionary pressures in the Pokemon world, but PHYSICALLY she's still a preteen! Same thing with Aiko. What do you mean she's your waifu?
