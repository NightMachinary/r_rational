On Tuesday, we're back to Simon Martin, and then we get to dive into some /really/ fun stuff. I'm working on this story in sequences of thirteen chapters, so we're juuuuuuust about to the middle of the first sequence.

If something has worked for you, then please let me know; that goes double if something isn't working for you! >:]

*Synopsis*

Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?
