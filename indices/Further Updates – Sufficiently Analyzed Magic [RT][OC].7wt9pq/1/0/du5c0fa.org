My issue is that it's not continuity errors whilst writing the sequel, it's continuity errors in the first story. Pacing issues aside, which I was trying to avoid, I'd really like to nail down a cohesive timeline both pre and during story. Like I said in the note. There's issues with the plot that I thought I had figured out, and then it sort of went off the rails. Now I feel that my own story has grown out of it's original plot, and I frankly don't know how to fix that without rewriting several parts that I've posted and that I'm currently working on. And I don't want to totally rewrite current entries and then be like oh yeah. Sorry. Changed that. To me that is just bad form. I really want to avoid something like Pact where the beginning and ending where solid while the middle (ie Vancouver and etc) were meandering.
