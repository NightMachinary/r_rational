It sucks that you feel the need to pull all the old content down. I'd prefer edits that were inline and did not break-the-world. (I thought we all learned pause the world gc's were bad!)

Meta commentary: I am always a bit confused the writing community doesn't have good standards or ideas on how to handle rewriting content. Plenty of authors get in binds where sequels have to deal with mistakes and continuity errors - mistakes accumulate like radioactive waste in longer sequels. This does not need to be so! Mistakes could easily be dealt with if the original works were revised and re-released. Yet this is rarely, if ever done, and when the rare author /does/ issue a re-release, it's a low-status signal of a /bad/ author. Shouldn't the opposite be true - re-releasing is a sign of high conscientiousness and quality? Shouldn't there be acceptable, standard ways to rewrite a story? (I'm not talking about Editions here, those are /de facto/ methods of updating grammar/spelling/syntax and not semantic content).
