#+begin_quote
  directing his pokemon down one hoop,*o* then up through another two.
#+end_quote

Extra "o".

#+begin_quote
  Some of them cheer on their favorites, while others exchange bets or just *watching and chatting*.
#+end_quote

Tense mismatch.

#+begin_quote
  Harton was a member of the regulatory board *whose had emails* leaked showing him
#+end_quote

Either "whose emails had" or "who had emails".

#+begin_quote
  Even if it makes him /nauseous/ and *feel* a
#+end_quote

The "makes him <adjective> and feel" construction feels weird to me (strangely, "makes him <verb> and feel" doesn't, as in "makes him smile and feel happy"). Separating the two things would flow better I think.

Not really a typo, but the formal definition of "nauseous" is "something that causes nausea". "Nauseated" means "affected by nausea". Obviously the common definition is different ("nauseating" is "causes", "nauseous" is "has"), so it's mainly a stylistic choice.

There's also a few usages of "incase", which I think should be "in case".
