Typo in 36: "It'll probably whatever that thing is" should be "It'll probably be whatever that thing is".

Also I'm not quite clear on whether the tense was correct when you say in this chapter "Blue bought four Clefairy"... Might it be better as "Blue had bought four Clefairy"? I'm not as accustomed to writing in present tense, but it sounded wrong to me.
