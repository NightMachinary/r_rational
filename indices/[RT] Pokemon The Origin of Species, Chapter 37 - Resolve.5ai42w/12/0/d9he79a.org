#+begin_quote
  Sometimes a week feels like a lifetime. This one, Red knew, would be the blink of an eye.
#+end_quote

Weird that this is in past tense imo.

#+begin_quote
  As he waits for a response, he tries meditation again.
#+end_quote

Mild preference for "he tries meditating again".

#+begin_quote
  He also uses his time to look over the map of Bill's property the inventor had sent him.
#+end_quote

Reads as sort of awkward to me.

#+begin_quote
  After calculating how far the sound of the Wigglytuff's singing would travel,
#+end_quote

Would be better as "will", I think.

#+begin_quote
  Preferably he'd want to do it as close to the Ranger Outpost or Bill's house as possible, and he quickly narrows his options down to three possibilities.
#+end_quote

"Preferably he'd want to..." strikes me as a bit redundant, but it's not unusual to say/write.

#+begin_quote
  That night he finds a private workroom in the Trainer House and stares at his phone, working up his courage. This *would* be painful, and manipulative. But he has to tell her sooner or later, and this is when he can make the most good come of it.
#+end_quote

"Would" should be "will", or maybe just rephrase.

#+begin_quote
  Blue was having trouble getting Maturin to stay underwater for long enough to be a reasonable threat to water-breathing pokemon. This class is supposed to help him ease the squirtle into staying down longer and longer, but he finds the pace frustrating. He used a simulation program to try and train Maturin to stay underwater longer, but it only helped a little.
#+end_quote

The first sentence here should maybe be present tense.

#+begin_quote
  "I think I have an idea, actually. And I'm ready to order whenever the waiter arrives." Leaf gives the menu a perfunctory look through, then puts it aside. She's glad she can get a good salad fairly easily in most places in the city, but today she's in the mood for something else. Especially since she offered to pay.
#+end_quote

The "she" in the last sentence is sort of ambiguous since Leaf is "she" in the preceding sentence.

#+begin_quote
  and about a 10% jump for magneton, electabuzz, and raichu after a trainer used his to put on a laser-light show with with eerily accurate electric bolts to pre-arranged equipment around the stage, accompanied by music and coordinated with a conductor's baton.
#+end_quote

"With with"

#+begin_quote
  He breathes in deep as he settles into place.
#+end_quote

Deeply.

#+begin_quote
  Red grins and does so breath coming out in a whoosh as his mind and body relax.
#+end_quote

Comma after "so".

#+begin_quote
  "Well, why not just teach me enough reception to project your own mind in another state, so I can copy that?"
#+end_quote

Weird sentence imo.

#+begin_quote
  I believe there are one or two that you could handle from that, yes.
#+end_quote

"You could handle from that" sounds weird to me.

#+begin_quote
  The water is cool without being cold, and Blue breathes out through his nose, bubbles rising to the surface as he sinks lower.
#+end_quote

It's stuck out to me that the stuff that comes after the "and" doesn't really have much of a connection to what comes before, even though the syntax suggests a causal-ish link to me.

#+begin_quote
  Blue's pulse is steady as he breaths in through his mask and out through his nose, watching, waiting.
#+end_quote

breathes

#+begin_quote
  They're approaching a wall of the pool soon, and Blue knows he can't let them reach it and limit Maturin's mobility.
#+end_quote

"approaching a wall soon" is normal I guess, but sounds weird to me, and "and limit Maturin's mobility" might be better as something like "as that would". That might be worse though actually... I don't know.

#+begin_quote
  If he feels sure of his pokemon's lung capacity, he has the advantage...
#+end_quote

Would be better as "if he felt sure..., he would..." (this would be the subjunctive, not the past tense)

#+begin_quote
  "Fantastic. Then on to your part of the bargain."
#+end_quote

Out of context I would have interpreted this as meaning the opposite of what it actually does.

#+begin_quote
  I have their notes in here.
#+end_quote

Maybe "the" notes

#+begin_quote
  Well, I'll probably still do some digging just inc ase.
#+end_quote

in case

#+begin_quote
  Not unless you asked about it specifically, though I would admit to being very shocked if you did.
#+end_quote

Maybe "I admit I would be very shocked if you did/had"

#+begin_quote
  "Ok, you have me interested."
#+end_quote

Maybe "Ok, I'm interested" or "Ok, you have my interest"

#+begin_quote
  Red's sits in lotus position with his eyes closed on the floor of the work room he used with Psychic Ayane
#+end_quote

You use "workroom" earlier in the chapter for what is probably the same sort of room.

#+begin_quote
  The way her mind seemed to split themselves
#+end_quote

Itself.

#+begin_quote
  still smiling as he breathes deep and waits for his pulse to slow
#+end_quote

deeply

#+begin_quote
  No, I just wanted to use whatever time I had before we met uninterrupted.
#+end_quote

Would be better without "uninterrupted", imo.
