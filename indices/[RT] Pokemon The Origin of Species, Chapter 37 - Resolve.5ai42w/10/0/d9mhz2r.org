  To me, psychics are one of the most underused aspects of the Pokemon fandom.

Agreed. It boggles my mind how rarely it's touched on in other pokemon media.

  Is training psychic pokemon to a high level so much easier for Psychics, that some abilities (such as teleportation) are really only utilised by human psychics in conjuction with their pokemon?

It's definitely easier, and opens up more possibilities. A normal trainer can train an abra to teleport them to a specific location by rote. A psychic can communicate with their abra to teleport them to a different place on command.
