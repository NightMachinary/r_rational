Some trinkets could have reasonably rational explanations, e.g. hot burning things for fire pokemon to boost their attacks, fertiliser for plant types, capcitors/batteries for electric, and maybe protective padding and or sharpened fang/claw attachments for the varous physical attackers. The ones with more complex effects like the choice items would be much harder to justify without bringing in literal magic.

Given how competent and optimising the people of this world are, its surprising that we don't see pokemon with more complicated equipment. E.g. have a pokemon wear armor or other protective gear. It might not be considered okay for competitive battling but could be invaluable in situations like the viridian fire, e.g. give a pokemon a fire retardant suit. You could also have metal spikes attached to them, pokemon holding spears in their mouths, bird pokemon dropping projectiles etc.

You could justify this in universe by saying that its very difficult to train pokemon to use tools, so only extremely well trained specialists can use them. So you could have fire brigades in protective gear but not have people pop one on every time they fight a fire type.
