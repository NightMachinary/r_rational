Some minor attachments is an interesting idea, and can make sense for items like Razor Claw, but in terms of armor, they would create a problem for pokeballs. Generally speaking, it's much more valuable to be able to withdraw and summon them at will, though some trainers might use armor for special pokemon that they keep out a lot, and in the olden times I'm sure it was done often.
