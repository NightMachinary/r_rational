  1: the fact that it is MUCH easier to understand something after the fact or with an already existing example or proof than it is to devise it from nothing. (examples: it's much easier to learn the concepts of relativity than it was for Einstein to devise them. We can understand the process of technological process and see how the changes in our society came from the technological changes we've experienced, but no one could predict this in advance.)

Hm. I think you're misunderstanding the power of an AI intelligence explosion: it's not that it will come up with things that we literally cannot grasp (not right away, anyway: maybe eventually). It's that it will learn and find patterns so much faster than we can, so fast that it will change the world.

You seem to be thinking of it as a "software issue," and saying that the nature of knowledge is the same regardless of who thinks it up. But humans are very much limited by our "hardware," or "wetware," rather: our brains are the most complex and powerful learning organ in the universe, as far as we're aware, but they have limits that cannot be easily improved. Machines are already faster and better in some ways than our brains. Not every way, but the list is growing, and there's really no reason yet to think it will stop.

  2: theoretical models can only work well when combined with actual experimentation. You can't design something and have it work the first time without testing it and modifying it based on what happens in the tests.

This is true, but again, speed of thought and pattern matching is /important/ in coming up with better predictions/hypotheses to test. Humans may still have to manually perform the experiments the AI comes up with to find better antibiotics or synthesize the materials needed, but as an example, AI are already better than humans at diagnosis and treatment recommendations in medicine just from sheer ability to look through thousands of data points a second and hold them all in their "head" at once to find correlations. Humans can't do that. Unenhanced humans will NEVER be able to do that, no matter how easy it is to learn what the machine finds out.
