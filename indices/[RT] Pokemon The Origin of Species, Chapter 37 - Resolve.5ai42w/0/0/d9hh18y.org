Yay to all the positive feedback! Glad you enjoyed it so much :)

For the issue of Red's priorities, he's not completely convinced by Bill's cynicism of the importance of figuring out where pokemon come from and how they work the way they do. I'll see if I can communicate that a bit better, but basically while he does find Bill's work important, "learning things about how the world works" is still his main interest, "learning things about how pokemon work" is still his main focus, and "learning things about how psychic powers work" is still his current stepping stone to the above. If he can leverage any of that knowledge into positive benefits to the other stuff Bill has been working on he will, but for now at the very least learning about how psychic powers work is something Bill and he both agree on, Bill because it could potentially help with AI alignment.

Enjoy the meditation!
