I actually felt it was just right. Given the scope of the characters' goals, a chapter like this every now and then is needed to keep the story advancing. Think of this chapter like a bunch of pieces of a montage training scene in a movie. That said, too many chapters like this would make things feel rushed, but I thinking alternating between slower chapters that build on every detail and bit of dialogue and chapters like this one, that rapidly builds towards the overall arcs and goals of the story would be good.
