  I had to reread the previous chapter, since I was confused by the "everyone's going to probably die in a generation or two?". Do they mean a not aligned AGI or a meteor/antibiotic resistant pandemic?

More the former :)

  Also I am bewildered that they didn't clean the bucket before sitting to plan.

Eh, it's not a lot, and he hasn't eaten yet, so it's mostly just bile. Does that make it better? Probably not, but in my head they don't care as much.

  I think just wanting to beat the League is too two dimensional now that the others had an upgrade on their motivations.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's kind of why I made sure he had a /reason/ to want to beat the League and become champion. It's definitely not a motivation that on its own I find interesting, even if it's done really well in some stories like Game of Champions.

  I don't know if you had already answered this but I'm really interested: how many of Red's mental techniques do you personally use, and what are your resources for good writing that you use for Leaf?
#+end_quote

Some. I already made a flowchart of the one he followed back in Body and Mind, and I've been thinking of doing more blog posts lately, some of which would be about the techniques Red uses. I'll see if I can make the time for them sometime this month.

As for the writing resources, mostly a combination of personal experience and online research. If you google around for it you can find some good websites for journalistic writing advice or just general rules to persuasive writing.
