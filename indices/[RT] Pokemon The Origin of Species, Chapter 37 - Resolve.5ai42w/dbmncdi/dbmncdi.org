Blue's “at least we won” moment is unsettling, makes him seem a lot more callous. We haven't had an oppurtunuity to see how much he is willing to do to win, but I'd be surprised if he let any moral restraint stop him when he wanted to. That ruthlessness is either a very good or very bad trait depending what his long term goals are. He seems to be pursuing fame and power for its own sake at the moment.

Journalism plotline is looking interesting. Nice to see you treating it as a profession of competent people. Seen too many strawmen of public facing professions in ratfic in the past.
