First of all. I realy enjoy P:TOoS. I woud like to ask; What about trinkets? In game, pokemons can hold items like berries or fangs. Will trainers give theirs pokemons something? Maybe a skarf around their neck? I woud like to ready that Red, Blue and Leaf build some bonds with their pokemons. Maybe that Blue paint his handprint on Matauris shell and it stays on even when she evolve? Thanx for responding. Big fan. :)
