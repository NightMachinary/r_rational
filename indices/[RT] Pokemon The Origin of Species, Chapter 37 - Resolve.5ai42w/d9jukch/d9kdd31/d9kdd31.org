I'm definitely using the "berry around the neck" thing, I think it might have already come up at some point in the story, but for the additional trinkets that have more "magic" powers, I'm not sure how I'll handle those yet. There's really no explanation of them given at all in the games or anime or comics that I'm aware of, so it just makes me think it's a clear example of a gaming conceit that shouldn't be taken seriously. If I think of a way to implement it rationally though, I will :)

And I like your idea of the handprint and similar things to bond them with their pokemon more visually! I'll think it over and see what fits best for the characters.

Thanks for reading!
