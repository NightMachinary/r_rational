If I had to make a rough guess, it would be a total of about 120 chapters in total. That's a rather daunting number considering the pace in which these come out, so hopefully chapters like this help to keep things moving a bit faster. Or maybe I luck out in my various ventures someday and am able to write as a full time job :)
