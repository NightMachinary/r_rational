I tend to enjoy the slower chapters for more selfish reasons, personally: As long as the author doesn't lose interest (significantly more of a problem with other fanfic authors), it makes a longer story, and I really enjoy reading things serially. I enjoy your writing regardless, so really, I'm looking out for future-me here. ;D
