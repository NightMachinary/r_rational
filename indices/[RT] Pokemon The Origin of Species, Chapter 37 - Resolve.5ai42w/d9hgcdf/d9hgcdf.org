Wonderful chapter: I was definitely satisfied by the pace of things. I'm not sure what the ratio should be, but this sort of chapter will do well to keep things moving, even if a lot of the chapters focus almost entirely on things that take only a small amount of time, like a conversation with Bill or the execution of the Abra-catching plan.

I'm especially glad to see Red getting serious. It's nice to see him take off the handicaps, and the practice he does in this chapter demonstrates the determination and capability I've been wanting from him without seeming like an unnatural shift in his characterization. I was never really convinced by his mother's argument against buying and selling clefairy, but his conversations with her and the line about disappointing her really sold the mental shift that the decision reveals, and the price he's paying to move towards his goals.

Finally he's putting real time and effort into his psychic training, and it is very satisfying to see that pay off. His progress is fast but doesn't seem too magical or game-breaking, and it's a natural extrapolation of what we already know about him. It shouldn't be too hard to quickly level him up with respect to his psychic abilities enough to open up new areas of scientific inquiry without making it seem too easy or making him powerful in the short-term relative to experienced psychics. I'd love to see him do novel things with his powers, but it would seem fairly cheep for him to end up overpowered as a result of having held a weird mental partition for years, but insofar as he is particularly skilled it seems to come from his work-ethic, introspective skill, and knowledge pool, which is awesome.

Still, I am a bit unhappy with what looks a lot like a complete dismissal of everything he learned from Bill. He leveraged it into renewed focus and grit, but is he really going to just continue as he has been just because he's passionate about the field? I'm not really clear on where he ended up at the end of his conversation with Leaf, but is he not going to even /try/ learning about computers (or minds maybe, as a psychic) and seeing whether he has an aptitude? It makes sense for Leaf to continue along her current path as she is building a skill and a platform that are applicable to any cause, but this isn't true for Red, so it'll be kind of bizarre if he learns a bunch of stuff about how the world might end and it doesn't really change his priorities at all.

As for Leaf, I'm becoming more and more of a fan (like Red!). She is great in her conversation with Red, and then great with her lead-finding strategy, and then great in her conversations with Zoey Palmer. I'm really looking forward to whatever happens once she starts looking into the execution of the Renegade.

In a sense not much happened with Blue this chapter, but what we did see struck me as kind of ominous. He manages to act kindly and take the desires/perceptions of strangers into consideration, but it seems rather calculated, and he doesn't seem worried at all about having hurt her pokemon, to the extent that I'm unsure as a reader whether what happened was normal. This is super great! And it's cool to have the added uncertainty about whether some of his personality might be rubbing off on his pokemon, and whether they may end up as more vicious than those of others. If so, I wonder whether Red and Leaf will notice, and how they'll react.

I'm curious to hear what others think of Blue's darkness. Does it seem to you all that he can just continue down the path he's walking without anything happening? My reading, is that he'll come to some sort of real conflict with Red or especially Leaf, or that he'll do something that gets him awful PR (or even a Renegade branding eventually?) but I may be overestimating his "darkness" relative to the world he's in.

Oh, and this chapter was super inspiring so I'm going to go meditate :)
