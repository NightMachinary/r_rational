As someone who disagrees with the majority view of the Rational community about the nature and implications of AI, I like how he's continuing to do what he's doing, and was kind of annoyed that he was led to believe that computers would make nothing else matter.

The whole 'AGI is a huge threat' thing bugs me too but that's a more general bone I have to pick with the rational community.
