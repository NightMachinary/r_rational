Wonderful. Ever since the ability was first teased, I've been waiting for Red to start realising his psychic potential. To me, psychics are one of the most underused aspects of the Pokemon fandom.

What is it like, being a psychic in the world of Pokemon. What is day to day life like when you can sense the minds of not just other humans, but the whole spectrum of Pokemon intellects? How is your ability to battle Pokemon affected, when you can actually feel the suffering of the animal you're giving orders to? Are you allowed to even go into casinos? If not, what else can you not do?

How do Pokemon react to you? Now that Red has begun training his passive reception, are the Abra going to prefer him over the others? I imagine they would; as psychic Pokemon, wouldn't another psychic mind seem the most familiar to them? Or perhaps not; apart from dark types, I imagine that some of the most successful competitors / predators an Abra could face would be other psychics. Perhaps they'll see him as a greater threat instead?

And finally, as we saw in Misty's chapter, being able to feel the emotions of other people doesn't seem to be an ability you can turn off. Once Red learns passive reception and fully opens his psychic 'ears', so to speak, how is that going to affect how he interacts with other people?

EDIT: Something I just saw rereading Misty's chapter. One guys talks about how he knew 'only psychics with a teleporter and trainers with flyers' could respond quickly enough to the Pokemon migration. Is training psychic pokemon to a high level so much easier for Psychics, that some abilities (such as teleportation) are really only utilised by human psychics in conjuction with their pokemon?
