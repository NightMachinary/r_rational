Red, no! That's the path to the dark side! Trust other intelligent people to be swayed by the evidence that swayed you, or else to have objections worth hearing!

Blue, no! That's another path to the dark side! Mary's and the instructor's concerns are completely reasonable, even if they portray you negatively! Also, it's good to have empathy more than just for show!

Leaf- okay, that's sort of Slytherin, but not really dark. Carry on.

I think the pace of the chapter worked well for a chapter like this, but I wouldn't want it all the time. It felt like it was getting the peices into place for future events. Not to say that it's unimportant, since significant things did happen, but it was a good montage between the bigger, slower story beats before and, presumably, after.
