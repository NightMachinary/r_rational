Too bad there's no Star Wars in their world to teach valuable moral heuristics on quick-and-easy paths to power :) Or maybe there was an episode of PokeForce on it or something and they're too caught up in their own heads now. If Red starts telekinetically choking people for not giving him research funding, the others will probably stage an intervention.

Hmm. I should probably do an omake chapter at some point...
