I had to reread the previous chapter, since I was confused by the "everyone's going to probably die in a generation or two?". Do they mean a not aligned AGI or a meteor/antibiotic resistant pandemic?

Also I am bewildered that they didn't clean the bucket before sitting to plan.

Said that, I enjoyed immensely the chapter. It's nice to see Red and Leaf pursuing their objectives and scale up while remaining human. Usually I was really taken in Blue's battles, but this seemed almost boring. I think just wanting to beat the League is too two dimensional now that the others had an upgrade on their motivations.

I don't know if you had already answered this but I'm really interested: how many of Red's mental techniques do you personally use, and what are your resources for good writing that you use for Leaf?

Thanks for writing!
