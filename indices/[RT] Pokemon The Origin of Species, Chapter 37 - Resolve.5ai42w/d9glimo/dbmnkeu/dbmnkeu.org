  Second, this chapter is my first attempt at consciously compressing the story to be more focused. It's the longest one yet at over 12k words, but each of the character perspectives in this one could easily have been their own chapter. I wanted to make a show of good faith to those who have been impatient with the speed of the plot progression, to acknowledge that I do hear the criticism and am trying to keep it in mind.

The compression seems to have worked well. I didn't feel like there was anytrhing being left out of the chapters. An advantage of compression is that it allows you to hint at interesting thmes and elements of the characters without spelling them out explicitly.

This compresed style makes an interesting contrast to the Bill chapter. While I didn't have as much issues with teh content as other people it did seem to slow down a lot. Would it work to have them have mltiple meetings and conversations with Bill iterspersed through the week? So you could alternate between them and the training montage to give it lulls
