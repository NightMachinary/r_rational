Hey all, welcome back! A few things of note:

First, I got a lot of great feedback for last chapter, so thank you everyone who commented! Overall, a lot of people who were new to the concepts explained in the chapter seemed to have enjoyed it, while those who were already familiar made good points about it being too anvilicious. I made some edits to try to reduce that, and even took the whole segment about the pokeball stasis out, so if it pops up again in the future, that's the reason why.

Second, this chapter is my first attempt at consciously compressing the story to be more focused. It's the longest one yet at over 12k words, but each of the character perspectives in this one could easily have been their own chapter. I wanted to make a show of good faith to those who have been impatient with the speed of the plot progression, to acknowledge that I do hear the criticism and am trying to keep it in mind.

As a result, I'm particularly interested in feedback again, as I'd like to know if anyone thinks a part of the chapter isn't paced properly or feels as if it's lacking detail or context. It might take some time for me to strike the right balance, but I hope the chapter is still enjoyable for everyone.

Thanks for reading!
