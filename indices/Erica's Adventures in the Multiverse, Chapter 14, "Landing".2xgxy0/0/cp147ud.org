I don't really have a sense of where this is going. I can tell the story's building up to a climax, but I don't think I understand the stakes. Why is it this moment that's important, giving a book to a young Turing? Other than "we're from the future, causality says the attack is now", why do they intervene at this moment and not, say, during Erica's parents' first date?

Is Erica expected to a galaxy-spanning AI on her own, with nothing but her precognitive (paracognitive?) abilities to lean on? Seeing the future is powerful, but it's not a weapon, and nor is the Termizion - short of jumping to a universe where the Antibody is already defeated, I don't see how she can win this. Does that count? I don't think that counts.
