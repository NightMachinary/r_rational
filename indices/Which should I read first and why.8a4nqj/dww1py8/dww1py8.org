I haven't read TGS, so can't give a recommendation for or against.

Of the other two, I've read both, and while they're both enjoyable, I find that PGtE holds up a lot better when you reflect back upon it. It's a lot more self-conscious about the message it's trying to convey to the reader. When the main character does something morally dubious, that character reflects upon the dubiousness of the action.

WtC, on the other hand, has a similar amount of morally dubious stuff going down, with a lot less self-awareness. I found it more fun on the initial read-through, but kind of troubling as I reflect back upon it.

So, of WtC and PGtE, I'd recommend the latter, since I think it has more to say, and that's the kind of story I like.
