TGS reliably updates once a week, and is at ~40 chapters? Catching up is very doable.

WTC is amazeballs, updates 2-4 times a month, usually 2-3 chapters per update? We're at ~80 chapters. Catching up would work, but you'll spend some time behind.

PGTE is up to 3+ chapters a week, and there's A LOT already written. We're right near the end of a hiatus. It will be hard to catch up without some serious binging.
