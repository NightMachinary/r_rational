Practical guide to evil has a lot of length to it already, but it's my favourite as it has a large cast of very interesting characters. It feels very worm esque in that every character is the main character of their story and the narrative arc with the Fae is one of my favourite fantasy books ever.

Worth the candle is also fantastic,but doesn't quite have the body of work yet to put it over practical guide, though it's likely to get to that vicinity.

The good student is probably the least obvious book of the three, in that it really goes all around the shop with its themes and ideas, but it has a very very unique take on fantasy creatures and the idea of the story being supreme.

I'd say worth the candle since it's not that far into it, so you'll be caught up soon enough to participate in discussions. Practical guide since I think it's a must read but the time sink might be a bit much.
