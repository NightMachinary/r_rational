Is there any way to use the chrome version of AO3 so that it's dark themed? AO3 is generally unreliable, for awhile there it kept disappearing off of my home screen (but still I my list of apps, I had to keep re-adding it)

I also find the stories to be generally quite disturbing (lot of weird shit there) so I only use it to find stories recommended to me/ones I already read on other sites.
