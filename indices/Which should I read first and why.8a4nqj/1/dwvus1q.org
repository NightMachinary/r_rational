I think it depends on what you're in the mood for.

Worth the Candle is a really good LitRPG (one of the best), whereas the interesting draw (imo) for the other two is that they look at narrative logic informing reality (though they do so in very different ways). For me, the latter is a much fresher thing, and I'd go with those if it's the same for you.

Choosing between the two, I'd say the Good Student is more lighthearted and short, whereas PGtE is long and a bit grimdark. I think PGtE is better, though, and that'd be my recommendation.

e: i do need to make a shout out to TGS though, for having perhaps the most...interesting romance ive ever seen. its teetering on the edge of absurdism. i love it.
