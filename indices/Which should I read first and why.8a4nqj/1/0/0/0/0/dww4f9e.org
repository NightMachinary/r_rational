fwiw, [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][shadows of the limelight]] is another great story that explores that trope in yet another way, and it's actually finished (i think were waiting for an epilogue that'll never come, but its finished enough).

its more superhero-y than these other 3 which are more fantasy-y, but maybe in 6 months when youre caught up on all of the others its worth a go :P
