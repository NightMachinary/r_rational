Dissenting voice about PGtE: its really rather lightly written, eg. relatively low quality literature. Think of it as a sweet cereal breakfeast; good for a quick fix but not for long term sustenance, too much of it will give you trouble of the karies/diabetis kind. Same is true for good student.

Whereas WtC is pretty much a healthly and balanced breakfeast.
