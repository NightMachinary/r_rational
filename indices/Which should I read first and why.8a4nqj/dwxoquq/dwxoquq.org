The Good Student doesn't have the level of raw writing craft behind it that A Practical Guide to Evil does. Haven't read Worth the Candle, but Practical Guide is phenomenal.

(I'd go so far as to say that The Good Student doesn't justify a top 5 slot in web serials, even not counting WtC, as I haven't read that, AND counting all of Wildbow's works together. But that might be just a degree of personal preference that wouldn't apply to others.)
