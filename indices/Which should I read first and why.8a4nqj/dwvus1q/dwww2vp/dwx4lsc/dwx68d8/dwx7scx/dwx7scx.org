If you have a login for AO3, you can go to "preferences" -> "skins" and choose from a variety of user-made skins for the site. The public site skins include at least one (Reversi) that is dark-themed with light text. I honestly haven't tried using skins much but they do exist and seem to work, more or less.

If you don't have a username for AO3, you can start on that [[https://archiveofourown.org/invite_requests][here]] - it's about a 12-day wait right now.

Alternatively, if you find this sort of thing highly desirable on lots of sites beyond just AO3 and you're willing to get a little more complicated, one thing you can do is use Android Firefox for the Firefox addon [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/][Stylish]] - which lets you download and use user-made themes for various websites, including e.g. [[https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=ao3][AO3]] but also a lot of other sites.
