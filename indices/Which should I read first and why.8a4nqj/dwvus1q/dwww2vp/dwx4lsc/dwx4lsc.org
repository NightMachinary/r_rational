Worth The Candle is AO3 only, and is unfinished but still updating. Last update was a week ago, author updates sporadically but fairly often and usually with long multi-chapter updates.

You can download .epub or .mobi format ebook files for AO3 stories, and also a standalone HTML format. Worth The Candle uses some formatting and stuff in tables / some mouseover text, some of which is stripped entirely and others of which are merely ugly - but if AO3 itself is a total dealbreaker, these might be better for you. I personally view AO3 on mobile just using Android's Chrome rather than any specific app and it works well for me, but your mileage may vary due to differing phones etc.
