Worth the candle is one of the best things I've read in years, possibly ever. As soon as I was caught up, I started right over. Unless constant talk of tabletop gaming is a turn-off, that's where I'd start.

Practical Guide to Evil is filled with moments of awesome. Heroes and villans alike are epic and enjoyable characters. The dialogue with orcs and goblins is immensely satisfying. Magic system explicitly runs on narrative, so the best way to be a good munchkin is to be a fun character.

The Good Student has hilarious dialogue. Personally, I find the plot a bit hard to follow, but it's clear there are layers of mysteries that will probably be solvable before they are answered on-screen.
