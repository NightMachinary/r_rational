Out of the three I think A Practical Guide to Evil and Worth the Candle are about tied.

A Practical Guide to Evil has great worldbuilding, banter, and speculation about what will happen next. The meta-story isn't so much a mystery as it is a clue; a lot of battles and duels come down to who has more weight of narrative behind them, so shaping a story is almost as important as shaping a battle plan. It's currently on hiatus, as the third book just ended - starting it now means you'll be caught up when book 4 starts. There are five books planned for the main series.

Worth the Candle has a lot of meta-story qualities and an overarching mystery behind what's happening, who's doing it, and why. Honestly that aspect is my favorite part, and it does meta even better than APGTE (in my opinion). The dialogue is pretty good, though not as snappy as APGTE. The characters are neat and interesting, and it deconstructs a number of tropes (Juniper is prodded toward having a harem of princesses follow him, but refuses to buy into the notion). The world building is unique, but... disjointed. It's like each location is almost it's own separate world, not really connected to the others. I mean, they /are,/ but it just doesn't feel like it compared to APGTE. I would say this is a more mature and philosophical story than APGTE, but only by a bit.

TGS is a fun read and hits a lot of these same points, but to a bit of a lesser extent. It's worth reading, but I'd take the other two first.
