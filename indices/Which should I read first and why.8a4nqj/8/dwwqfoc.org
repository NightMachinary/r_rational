My favorite web fiction from a non-NYT best selling author is PGtE. A close second is HPMOR but that really wouldn't have worked for me if I weren't already a HP fan.

I can't wait for April 8, when the new PGtE arc begins. It's super reliable, which I appreciate. If you're a straight up fantasy fan, this is the best.

If you are more about tabletop RPGs or even MMORPGs - WTC is the best SI I've ever read. It's easy to catch up to the end point, so if I were you, I'd catch up based on time (weekend= PGtE, overnight=WTC, but your MMV).

In both cases, give yourself a dozen chapters before you give up on it. PGtE's writing gets better.

I've never been able to get into TGS, but it is funny in stretches.
