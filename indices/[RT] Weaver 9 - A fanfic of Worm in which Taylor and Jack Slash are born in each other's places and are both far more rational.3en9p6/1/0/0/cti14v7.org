It's a term from table-top gaming. Many groups in games like Dungeons and Dragons devolve down to a wandering band of adventurers killing everything they come across in their fervent search for more loot/magical items/lulz. So, they're homeless and wander. Like hobos. And all they do is murder everything that looks like it's worth more than 2 gold. So they're murderhobos.

In Worm, the Slaughterhouse 9 are a band of nomadic, omnicidal psychopaths, so the term gets used on them too.
