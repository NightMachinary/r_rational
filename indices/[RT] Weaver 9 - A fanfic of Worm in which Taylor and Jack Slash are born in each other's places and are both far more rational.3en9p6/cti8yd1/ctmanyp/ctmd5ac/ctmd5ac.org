When I saw she has help from Cauldron I mean:

1. Given that natural!trigger Parahumans in canon don't work well together in large groups
2. Given that the large groups of capes we see in canon are all supported by Cauldron through Cauldron!capes or carefully timed avoidance of accidents through Contessa magic
3. And that Weaver's Society is huge and involves a ton of Parahumans -->Cauldron is either helping a ton or Weaver is using a ton of top-notch, subtle, Master/Stranger powers to keep control of her group.
