I love this fic, espeically compared to other Worm Fanfics, but I have issues with some stuff in this work. Mostly:

1. The Leviathan fight's over-the-top Endbringer escalation, especially the bypassing of the Manton effect and the ridiculous ending of that fight.

2. Weaver is too successful in recruting parahumans for her organization. Parahumans are notoriously terrible at working in big groups-- unless she has enormous help from Cauldron or a couple of strong/subtle/wide Master powers helping to keep Parahuman neuroses at bay, she shouldn't be so successful in her society.
