I am interested. I should say that my type of editing is fairly intense, and I won't really hold back on my own opinions. However, I generate my opinions with the knowledge that you can take them or leave them. I, unfortunately, do not have a lot of time to write myself, but if you want to see some of the stuff I've written, and see if the tone, theme, and maybe literary power match what you think might be good for yourself, well, you can check some of my stuff here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2485237/iSaint]]

I definitely recommend being very careful with whom you give the title of "editor" or "beta-reader" to.
