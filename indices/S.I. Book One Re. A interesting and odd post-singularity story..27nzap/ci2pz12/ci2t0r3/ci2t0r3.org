So, one thing I wasn't clear on but pieced together later and want to confirm if true: The imaginary-friend-turned-into-rabbit body was designed by the AI, and the future-humans /find/ it along with the cryo-frozen corpse, and decide to place the brain inside it BUT the AI designed the body with its own goals in mind so they can't trust it. Yes?

(I'm only part way thru so sorry if this was clarified later)
