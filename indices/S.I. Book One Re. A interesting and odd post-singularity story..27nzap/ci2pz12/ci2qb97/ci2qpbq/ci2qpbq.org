  Oh, the author himself appears.

It was a comment in this subreddit that I should "Just start writing" that prompted me to do just that; I've been keeping a close eye on this place since then.

If I may ask, where did you learn of S.I.? SpaceBattles? LessWrong Discussion? Elsewhere?

  The character and setting descriptions are just begging to be drawn.

I'm certainly a fan of comics, including having learned some important lessons about story-telling from Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" and sequels; and I try to keep the visuals firmly in mind as I write. I know a few artists who'd probably be happy to create some images, but the going rate is around $20+ for a full-body figure with no background, and while I've got time to think about plots and write things down, it's a bit harder for me to convert my time into spare cash. That said, I have noted down a few visual references that come reasonably close: [[https://sfw.sofurry.com/view/602824]] , [[https://sfw.furaffinity.net/view/12351256/]] , and on NeutronAlchemist on DeviantArt has some NSFW photomorphs that have reasonably representative anatomy.
