Oh, the author himself appears. You should know that I was not expecting such a captivating story come out of nowhere like this. I'm really enjoying it so far.

An interesting note: I think the story's format matches well with a serial comic. I keep imagining the cell layouts and dialogue boxes as I read. The character and setting descriptions are just /begging/ to be drawn.
