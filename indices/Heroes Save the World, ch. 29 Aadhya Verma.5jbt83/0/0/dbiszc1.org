Thank you!

Right now I'm feeling hopeful. There isn't a huge amount of attention on HSTW right now, but the month isn't even over and I've already gotten more hits than in previous months. I'm getting a better rate of posts read per visitor and a similar improvement in views per post, too, which I think are good signs.
