Not as such. I think you could sign up to watch changes to the Antimemetics Hub page, though I'm not sure where the notifications would go, and you probably need an account on the SCP wiki for this.

An alternative solution is to subscribe to [[/r/qntm][r/qntm]]. Links to new stories would usually be submitted here, and it doesn't get much traffic these days, which should limit the amount of noise/false positives.

The laziest solution is to do nothing, as I or someone else is likely to submit any new stories in this series to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in short order once they're released anyway.
