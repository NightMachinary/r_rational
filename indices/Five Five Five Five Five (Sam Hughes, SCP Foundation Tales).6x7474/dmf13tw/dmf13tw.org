My thoughts as I read:

#+begin_quote
  Marion Wheeler lives deep in coniferous forest
#+end_quote

Wait, what? She met an unpleasant fate! I saw it happen! What's going on here?

#+begin_quote
  "There is a monster which [SPOILERS]," the man says.
#+end_quote

Wait, is /that/ what happened? I suppose that could save her from the fate we last saw for her. Still seems a little "deus ex machina"-ish, though.

#+begin_quote
  "Adam," he says. "Adam Wheeler."
#+end_quote

Wasn't that the name we heard back in Case Colourless Green?\\
*checks*\\
It is. Huh. Then... wait. But she lost him! Then she forgot about him!

I'm thoroughly confused. We have two people who, by all rights, should not be here. What's next, Kim shows up?

#+begin_quote
  Adam is getting nervy, and won't let go of his eye
#+end_quote

*Oh no.*

#+begin_quote
  [the ending]
#+end_quote

Well, that explains a few things.
