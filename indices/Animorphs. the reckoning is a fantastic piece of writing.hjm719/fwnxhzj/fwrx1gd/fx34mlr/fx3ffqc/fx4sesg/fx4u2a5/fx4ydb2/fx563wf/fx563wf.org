The problem is not your command of English. You are denying me the right to an opinion, and when I object to your infringement upon my rights, you attack me. Obviously I was wrong to engage with someone like you in the first place.

Actually, now I am wondering if that is an alt-account for the author. It amazes me that someone who is trying to write rational fiction cannot handle someone expressing an opinion of dislike for the story, and responds trying to say my opinion is false. And now you are doing the same thing.
