It honestly makes me feel much better when people who are trying to tear the fic down have to fill their complaint with falsehoods. Like, "ugh, this just doesn't work for me" is WAY scarier to hear by itself, and makes me feel much more like I've failed as a writer, than a bunch of complaints that just aren't true.

Anyways, you might be interested in [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3041712412?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1][this review]] on Goodreads, which seems to me like a pretty close match for your style.
