  I don't think the burden of proof should be on disproving falsehoods.

You are not "disproving falsehood" as if the discussion is on physics or something related to the real world. You are disagreeing with a review of your own work of fiction and seem completely unable to articulate why. For an author of "rational fiction" I consider this is a really bad sign. Not sure if you want more readers or not, but your reaction to criticism is at least enough for me to remove your work from my "to read" list and find other authors to read.
