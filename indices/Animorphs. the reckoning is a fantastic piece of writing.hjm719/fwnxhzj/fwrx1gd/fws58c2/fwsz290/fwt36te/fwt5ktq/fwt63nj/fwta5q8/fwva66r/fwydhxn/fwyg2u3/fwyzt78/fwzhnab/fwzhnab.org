You know the thing where Costco was like “You can't shop here unless you wear a mask,” and some people were all “We refuse to wear masks; if you insist on them then we won't shop at Costco” and Costco was like “Yes, thank you, that is correct; glad we're all on the same page”?

You saying you won't read r!Animorphs is like that. My response is “Yes, thank you, that is correct; glad we're all on the same page.”
