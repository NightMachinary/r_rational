Listen, I think both you and [[/u/TK17Studios]] need to hear this: When [[/u/morgf]] complained about there being too much angst in this story, he was expressing his /opinion/. This opinion cannot be a falsehood for the simple reason that *there is no objective measurement of how much angst is too much angst.* The same holds true for all his other points as well (too much complaining, too much whining, skips over too much of the action, too frequent POV changes, etc.). The only "factual" statement he made was that characters begin every second sentence with "I mean..." (which is probably not /literally/ true, at least I hope not for TK17Studios' sake), but anyone trying to respond to this by saying that it's "false" has completely missed the point (and clearly fail at reading comprehension).
