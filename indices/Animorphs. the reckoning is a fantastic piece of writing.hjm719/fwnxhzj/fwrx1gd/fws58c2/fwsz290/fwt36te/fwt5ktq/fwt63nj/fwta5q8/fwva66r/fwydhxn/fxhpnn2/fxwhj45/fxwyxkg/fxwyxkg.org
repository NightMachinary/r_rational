You did not name me but since I also claimed stuff about 'false statements', I'll reply.

I think I see your point. But if I agree to these rules any exchange becomes hell:

​

I could always say that there is no objective measurement of how much [whatever] is enough [whatever], and since in my opinion your comment contained too little [whatever], it failed to convince me.

I could even say that in my opinion someone is too much of an idiot, and since I am only stating an opinion they would automatically be in the wrong if they disagreed.

​

Not a very constructive route, right?

So I can't agree with your opinion on how to handle one's opinion.
