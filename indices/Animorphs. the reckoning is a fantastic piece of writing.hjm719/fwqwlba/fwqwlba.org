This fic feels more canon than canon to me. The Animorphs are actually trying to save their species rather than dick around for three years. The Andalites are as contemptuous of us as the Protoss are of the Terrans. Visser Three, as an extremely ambitious Yeerk in the brain of an Andalite military genius, is where the fic really shines. He's an utterly terrifying villain, a lone wolf and utility monster with several civilizations' worth of tech backing him up, rather than a bumbling doofus who gets duped by teenagers into dyeing his fur purple.
