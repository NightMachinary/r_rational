Minor/major spoilers for the series ahead, but in the final chapters of the book series, the Animorphs recruit dozens of disabled kids and end up using them as glorified cannon fodder. It is arguably not the worst thing they do, and they're miserable, exhausted, and hideously on-edge throughout.

​

The series is, if anything, a purposeful deconstruction of exactly that sentiment --- albeit somewhat buried by scholastic ghostwriters. Morphing is fun sometimes but is mostly creepy body horror or worse.

​

To echo a previous comment, [[https://www.reddit.com/user/TK17Studios/][u/TK17Studios]] has managed to do the 'HPMoR thing' of taking apart an existing canon of inconsistent quality and using the pieces to build something bigger and better. My SO is/was a big Harry Potter fan, but I have to remind her that Daphne Greengrass doesn't 'exist', as far as the original canon is concerned. Nevermind Azkaban and the dementors.

​

I don't know if not knowing anything about Animorphs makes the reckoning hard to follow, but I do know that the original characters are every bit as good. It sucks that the fic doesn't get the front-page WtC treatment here, but it absolutely should.

PS: [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]], I appreciate the shout-out earlier on, and even though ACAB, I completely forgive you for making me a cop.
