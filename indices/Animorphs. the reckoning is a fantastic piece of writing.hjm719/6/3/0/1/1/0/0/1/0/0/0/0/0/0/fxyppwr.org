My comment most definitely was my opinion. Nothing I wrote was a falsifiable claim or "assertion". "Rarely" is clearly my opinion. "Every other sentence" was a clear use of hyperbole, meaning my opinion is that it is used too frequently. Ditto for characters too frequently not finishing their sentences.

Seriously, you claim that me saying that there are frequent POV switches is NOT my opinion?

I'm done with you. You are clearly arguing disingenuously, or perhaps you are delusional.
