Your analogy implies that we have the same reason for both preferring that I don't read your story. As I've already told you, I don't want to read your story since you refuse to provide an argument for your opinion on it. The conclusion should then be obvious (even to you). If you wanted to imply something else, then maybe you should have come up with a better analogy.
