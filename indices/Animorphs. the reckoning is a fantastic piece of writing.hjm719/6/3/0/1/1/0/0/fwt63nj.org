I'm experiencing no angst, currently (and recently) have had no hurt feelings, and didn't think I was arguing, exactly, so much as making a single point (that is valid and relevant to public discussion).

I would say something like "I think you're projecting onto other people the feelings that you yourself are experiencing," but actually I have no idea what's going on for you and don't feel qualified to presume. A tentative hypothesis at best, since drawing global conclusions about someone based off a single brief reddit comment is generally unwise.
