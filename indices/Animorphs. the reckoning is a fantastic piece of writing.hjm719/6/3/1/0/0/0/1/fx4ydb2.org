I don't think that it's what I'm saying, no. Sorry if I was not articulate enough (again, not a native speaker)'

What I was trying to say is : 1) your analysis contained opinions and descriptions. 2) I think that these descriptions are inaccurate, even taking hyperbole into account.

Also, I feel like yelling "Opinion!", strawmaning and questioning my motives is obviously not the best course of action if you are trying to convince me, so maybe that's not what you're doing rn?
