There seems to be a misunderstanding about the word "description".

To me, when one says "I like that this tree is big", they say two things :

- That they like the tree, which is what I would call 'opinion', and that assure you I'm not denying you.

- That the tree is big, which is what I would call description, and those can be disputed if inacurrate.

Also I'm not tk17, though 1) I have no way of proving it. 2) I admit that it's a reasonable assumption. 3) I would be really ok with the fact of being them.
