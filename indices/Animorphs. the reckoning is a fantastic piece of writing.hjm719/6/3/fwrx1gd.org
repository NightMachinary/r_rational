Here's one data point for you. I am not familiar with the original Animorphs, but I tried to read this rational version, and I found it sheer torture. I kept skimming ahead hoping it would get better, but it never did.

The angst, as you call it, and the writing style grate on me. All the complaining and arguing that rarely turns into taking action. Characters beginning every other sentence with "I mean..." whether it makes sense or not, and characters not finishing half of their sentences. Frequent POV switches, and the switches usually happen when the action is about to start so that we skip over the action and get to more whining and complaining and endless arguing and worrying about feelings instead of getting down to business and taking action.
