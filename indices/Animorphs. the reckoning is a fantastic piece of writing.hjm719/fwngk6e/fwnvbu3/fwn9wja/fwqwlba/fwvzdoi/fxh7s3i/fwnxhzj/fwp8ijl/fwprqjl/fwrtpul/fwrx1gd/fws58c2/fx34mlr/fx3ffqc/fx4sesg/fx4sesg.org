I am not disputing your having an opinion here.

However you also said stuff about "whining and complaining and endless arguing and worrying about feelings instead of getting down to business and taking action." Unless I misunderstood you (which is in fact possible as I'm not a native speaker) you were attempting to describe things here. And some descriptions can be more accurate than others, right?

You did not say "I would prefer if there was more thoughtless action and less thinking in this rational fiction", which would have been a weird but ok opinion to state. Instead it feels like you said there was no action taking, which I think is provably false (but still ok to state as long as you allow others to contradict you ^{^{)}}
