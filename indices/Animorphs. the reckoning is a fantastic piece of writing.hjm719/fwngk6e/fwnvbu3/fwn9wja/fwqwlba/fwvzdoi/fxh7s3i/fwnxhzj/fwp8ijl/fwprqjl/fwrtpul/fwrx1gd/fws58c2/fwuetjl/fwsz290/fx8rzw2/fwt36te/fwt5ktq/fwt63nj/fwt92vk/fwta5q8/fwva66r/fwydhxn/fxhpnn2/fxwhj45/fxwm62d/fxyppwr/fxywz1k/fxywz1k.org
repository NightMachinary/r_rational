"Frequent" as compared to what? Books that don't have PoV changes? With just a few recent and notable exceptions, PoV changes in Reckoning only occur when a new chapter starts... and the chapters in this story are often /20-30k words long/. For reference most novels are 60-100k words /in total/.

I'm not insulting you. I'm not calling you delusional or arguing disingenuously. I'm simply pointing out that your lived experience is informed by your expectation, and there are object level facts that do not match your recalled, lived experience.

If you choose not to confront that possibility, and instead believe that I'm just being mean or crazy, then I'll stop tagging you in comments, with apologies. But at least take a moment to examine why you feel the way you do.
