  You are not "disproving falsehood" as if the discussion is on physics or something related to the real world. You are disagreeing with a review of your own work of fiction and seem completely unable to articulate why.

To be clear, a work of fiction is part of the real world, and there are objective claims that can be made about it. [[/u/TK17Studios]] is pointing out that the original review is the one that made objective claims about the story (not just shared the reader's personal take on it) and did not substantiate those claims. Subjective opinions of whether the story worked for them or not are not at issue here.

If your position is still that, upon seeing a post that makes claims you believe are objectively false, the burden of proof should be on you to refute them, that's great, but it shouldn't be the standard expectation, because it's /exhausting/ and also leads to conversations where someone who hasn't actually put effort into demonstrating their claims can effortlessly waste the time of those who do.

You can disagree with the tone of how he initially responded to the reviewer, but he's right in what he's saying here.
