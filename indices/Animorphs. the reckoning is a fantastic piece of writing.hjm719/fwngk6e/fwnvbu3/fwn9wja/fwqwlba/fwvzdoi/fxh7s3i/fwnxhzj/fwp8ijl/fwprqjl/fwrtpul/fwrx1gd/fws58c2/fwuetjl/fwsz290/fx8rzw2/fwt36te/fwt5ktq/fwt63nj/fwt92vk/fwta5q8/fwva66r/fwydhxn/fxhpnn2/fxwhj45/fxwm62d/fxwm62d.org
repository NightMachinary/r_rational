You may not know this, but I once did a detailed reread of HPMOR that cataloged in a spreadsheet every instance of Harry "winning," "losing," or coming out basically neutral in his interactions with others or the actions he took. I did it because I was baffled by people making assertions about HPMOR that did not match my experience of the story, and treating their take on the story as based in fact.

All of which is to say, I'm pretty sensitive to when people are /just/ giving their opinion on something, and when they're sneaking in an assertion of fact. I'm not claiming to be perfect on it or anything, but with careful attention it's certainly doable.

"Harry is treated as a perfect character" is an assertion.

"Harry is too arrogant" is an opinion.

"Harry wins too often" is an opinion, but it has an implied assertion hidden in it.

So let's look at the initial comment itself in detail:

#+begin_quote
  I tried to read this rational version, and I found it sheer torture.
#+end_quote

Opinion.

#+begin_quote
  I kept skimming ahead hoping it would get better, but it never did.
#+end_quote

Opinion.

#+begin_quote
  The angst, as you call it, and the writing style grate on me.
#+end_quote

Opinion.

#+begin_quote
  All the complaining and arguing that rarely turns into taking action.
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  Characters beginning every other sentence with "I mean..." whether it makes sense or not,
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  and characters not finishing half of their sentences.
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  Frequent POV switches
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  and the switches usually happen when the action is about to start
#+end_quote

Assertion.

#+begin_quote
  so that we skip over the action and get to more whining and complaining and endless arguing and worrying about feelings instead of getting down to business and taking action.
#+end_quote

Assertion assertion assertion assertion.

I'm not trying to dump on [[/u/morgf]] , I don't think he was intentionally or maliciously trying to present his opinions as indisputable facts. I also think [[/u/TK17Studios]] came out the gate a bit strong in his initial response to the comment, in that it could reasonably be read to be implying bad faith on the part of [[/u/morgf]].

But the comment itself certainly was not just an expression of opinion. It made falsifiable claims about the story that were, at best, exaggerated, and at worst, made up wholecloth.

Again, I think [[/u/morgf]] 's genuine, lived experience of reading the story made what he wrote feel real to him. But that doesn't make what he said, the way he said it, defensible in a subreddit where people should be at least /trying/ to be precise and reasonable in their criticisms of things.
