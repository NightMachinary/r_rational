I started reading it based on a previous recommendation here. It's got a lot going for it, but I got dragged down by the angst... okay, yes, war is horrible, it's good that you kids recognize that. Great that you think violence isn't the answer, even when you're dealing with an existential threat from an alien source that barely recognizes your species as intelligent. Your parents raised you well.

and, gosh, yes, there are a lot of ethical issues involved with cloning and mind control, aren't there?

but, like, I thought I was going to get to read an adventure story about kids with superpowers kicking ass and discovering how much more there is to life in the galaxy than we ever dreamed. Instead I get kids wallowing over ethical dilemmas while amoral aliens continue the murdering.

I don't expect it to be a carefree romp all the time, but does it ever pull out of this funk and become /fun/ to read?
