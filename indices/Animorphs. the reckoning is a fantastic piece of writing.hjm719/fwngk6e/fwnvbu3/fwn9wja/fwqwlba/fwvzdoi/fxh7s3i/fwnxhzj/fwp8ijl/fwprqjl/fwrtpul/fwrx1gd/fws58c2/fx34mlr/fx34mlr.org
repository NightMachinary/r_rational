Well this is rational fiction. Some degree of thinking and introspection was to be expected.

I admit that sometimes when I watch action-based works of fiction I complain - not about the presence of action obviously, but about the characters' lack of thinking. So you might still have had a point.

But it is very easy to prove that there is in fact a lot of action-taking happening in this fic, so I too wonder why you felt the need to use false statements in your data point.
