I probably won't convince you but I'll say it again: I'm not TK17. Believe it or not, when more than one account disagree with you it can also mean that more than one person disagree with you.

I also notice that you are using more and more personal attacks, and that you did not even try to adress what I wrote in my previous comment.

So if we are done talking about misconceptions on A:tR or on what 'opinion' means, then I'm not really interested in arguing with you :/
