My comment was not directed to you at all. The part where I started my comment with "keturn:" should have been a clue.

It is interesting that me writing a comment sharing my opinion with another person who was asking for opinions results in a comment from the author talking about feelings, impugning my motives, and saying that my opinion is false.

Let's see. Angst, hurt feelings, pointless arguing. Could almost be a passage in the story. Ha!

Here's a theory for you. I guess many ESFP, ESFJ, ENFP will be likely to enjoy the story, while many INTJ, INTP, ISTJ will tend to dislike the story.
