I didn't ask a question.

EDIT: I didn't ask a question that would be need to be tested. The question of "what do you think would happen" is completely divorced from any proposed experiment. I basically asked "what do you think the result of the experiment would be if it were run" and you answered with "that's unknowable because the experiment wasn't run." Doesn't follow, non sequitur.
