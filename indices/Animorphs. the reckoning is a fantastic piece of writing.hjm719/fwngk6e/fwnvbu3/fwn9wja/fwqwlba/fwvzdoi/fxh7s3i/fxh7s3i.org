So, I just binge read this fanfic and it is very interesting and well done. I appreciate the way that the author, [[/u/TK17Studios]], was able to deepen the histories and cultures of many of the alien species. Being able to show the whole way that an Andalite mind might think parallel thoughts at the same time was mindblowing, and I liked the alieness of it. It was like having to learn a new language almost. Similarly the Arn also have a very interesting way of speaking. And of course the fleshing out of the yeerk coalescion and how that works was fascinating. I also do like that the animorphs are actually trying to win and so do less stupid things in general. The fact that everything escalates so quickly just makes sense when you push this story forward, out of the 90s and into our age with quicker and easier access to technology. The changes to the morphing tech and the explanations about its creation help to make some elements make more sense.

I only have a few critiques. One is that that sometimes it feels like the characters in the main group all sound like Marco. I like Marco. I love the deepening of his voice and thinking process here. But, I've always thought Marco's ability to point out the issues in scenarios made him somewhat unique and when everyone does it all the time, it kind of lessens that. Is it strange to want some of the other characters to /think less/? Also, the characters of Ax and Tobias especially just don't feel like the Ax and Tobias from the books. Their unique relationship has especially been diminished. With Tobias in particular I get the strong sense that he is a totally different character who just happens to have the same name. The introduction of Garrett as his friend weakens that sense of loneliness from really having no-one and being separate from everyone. The changes to the nothlit rules, which don't allow him to be stuck in hawk morph and thus be an outsider of sorts even within the animorphs group, also changes that. I'm /ok/ with this new Tobias, but he will always be distinct from the canon Tobias to me. The effect is that in this version he's no longer my favorite character.

I'm not sure if I would have liked this fanfiction (or maybe /appreciated/) it as much if I had read it in elementary school like I did with the originals. Where the books have a certain levity and pervasive humor and silliness to them with a background of serious themes and issues, this fanfic brings all of that to the forefront. As a result, it does lose some of that energy, but it is excellent as a thoughtful read. I'm excited about the next chapters and the final arc.

Edit: Also, I have a theory about Cassie, but I'm afraid to post it cause I don't want it to be changed if I'm right.
