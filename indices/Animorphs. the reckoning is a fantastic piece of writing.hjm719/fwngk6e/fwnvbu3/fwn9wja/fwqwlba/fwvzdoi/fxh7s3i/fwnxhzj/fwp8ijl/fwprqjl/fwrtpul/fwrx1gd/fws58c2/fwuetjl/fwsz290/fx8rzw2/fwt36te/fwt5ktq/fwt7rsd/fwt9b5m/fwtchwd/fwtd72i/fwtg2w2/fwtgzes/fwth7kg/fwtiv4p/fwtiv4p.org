You really do not like to test your theories, huh? You asked what I think would happen if we tried the experiment, and I said we will not know the answer without trying the experiment. That is not even close to a non sequitur. If anything, it is the opposite. Some answers are unknowable, but the one you asked is quite knowable. One just has to be willing to put their knowledge to the test.
