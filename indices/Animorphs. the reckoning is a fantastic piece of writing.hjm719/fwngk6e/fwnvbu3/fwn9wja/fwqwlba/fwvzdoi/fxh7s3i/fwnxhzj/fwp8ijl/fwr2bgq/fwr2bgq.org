Yeah, I remember after the series was over the author wrote a statement to the effect of, "Did you not like how this war ended with characters you loved dead or traumatized? Remember that when you're old enough to vote." It was never /supposed/ to be about our heroes casually kicking ass. Even the ethics of morphing and its parallels with what the Yeerks do was directly addressed in the original series.
