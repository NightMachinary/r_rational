Yeah, I'm most of the way through it and although it's very fun, there's just /so much/ happening that it's getting harder and harder to keep track.

One thing I'm really struggling with (spoilers) is the "backups". The story is highly character-focused and character-driven, which I love, but it's hard to keep a handle on the character development when it keeps getting reset by days, weeks, months, and I have to keep track of which of their critical paradigm-shifting moments each character does and doesn't remember. Sometimes that creates frustrating situations--like, how Jake felt about Marco's confession (and how Marco felt about how /Jake/ felt) was left unresolved for chapters upon chapters, and then Jake got reset to /before/ that happened and they had to redo it anyway. I had the impression early on that the main cast planned on making new backups frequently, but I guess that was just Marco.
