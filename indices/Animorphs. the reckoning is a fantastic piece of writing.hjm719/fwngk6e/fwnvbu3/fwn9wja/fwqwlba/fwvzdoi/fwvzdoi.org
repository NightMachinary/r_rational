I definitely like the book and it tries so many things, that I haven't seen anywhere else, so I do respect the effort. And it's a very thrilling ride, thru and thru.

But it has uhm.... data presentation issues.

[warning, many spoilers ahead]

There's clones, morphed humans, Yeerks, mini-Yeerks, distributed Yeerks, Andalites, Thoughtspeak, birdperson, Eids, Hiracs (which one was that, anyway?), dains, residual Toms, Esplin and Alloran, the many presidents of the United States, clones, decoy clones, sentient ships, coalescions, War Prince Jake's guilty conscience about totally wanting to bang Marco's mom (that's how I read it, anyway), Aximillilili and Elfangor, War Prince Jake's black box, fifty shades of Marco....... kinda all blurs together, sometimes.

I don't read a book with pen in hand and with full concentration, I read for leisure, so I don't want to do tedious mental bookkepping to keep things straight.Part of it, is the many numbers. I do enjoy that they are there. Numbers make the story more rational and nail down the context.

But....I know it is a literary convention to write out numbers as words. Only because it's a convention, doesn't mean it's not a terrible idea.Honestly, if that convention didn't exist, I think the average book would be more rational, simply because it would be easier to present hard data.On a math test, they don't write out numbers either, since you're supposed to quickly think and be able to manipulate the numbers. Why is reading a war story any different?Of course, in some sense, the characters also have to do that mental translation step, so it's "only fair", but they have the advantage of being in the story and thus having more intimate context.Reading "sixtenhundred thousand" is a lot harder to parse than 160.000. And there's a lot of numbers.

Especially a problem, if you're a native speaker of a language, where numbers have a different Endianness for two-digit numbers. (like German or French)Since two digit numbers are often in the leading position of a larger number, this language interference issue comes up a lot.

A lot of the multifacted characters are pose a challenge to present coherently write. Parentheses, hyphens and so on are used. Also cursive, but I think authors always vastly overestimate how visible and salient cursive actually is (not very, when one reads quickly).

The lines of thoughts are referred to as "one glow, one bright, one shade, one dark" in the first Ax-chapter. That..... are some difficult to distinguish properties, since shade and dark and bright and glow seem to resemble each other.

Though when Ax speaks in Parentheses-threads, I don't get the feeling that this is different from how I think.Like:(We shall have cheeseburgers! There is a McDonald's over there.)((But McDonald's cheeseburgers are lackluster.))(((But there's a Burger King over here!)))((((Burger King cheeseburgers are indeed better, but that Burger King's card reader is broken and we don't have cash on hand))))(((((We shall not eat cheeseburger, then!)))))

Look, five threads, is my intellect thus superior to even an Andalite?No, that's just sequential thinking. One thought after another.The ()-constructions never seem to run in parallel, so they don't read as any kind of special Andalite superthought.

Also I wish we would get color coding for all those threads.Also I wish we would get color coding for Esplin and Alloran.

I mean.... thought-speak being confusing is a running gag, but can't we as the readers get colors?

Also the "in media res"-nature of many chapters is extremely jarring sometimes.The chapter starts and one of the Marco's shouts "Heimdall!". And I think immediately two Marcos get themselves killed, because they wander off? I still don't know who the hell "Heimdall" is. The Marcos have some kind of id-system where they come up with 12 digit random numbers, but I'm not gonna follow that, because I'm not a Marco and a Marco certainly isn't writing the numbers as words, when he thinks of them.

The plot also just kinda skips over details. Like one of the Marclones must have witnessed everyone in SÃ£o Paulo dying around him of radiation poisoning, but this isn't explored or even mentioned.
