Disagree. I would argue that Unsong is rational within a wholly unusual setting. True, there is a lot that would not make sense outside of that setting, but that is because that world is... very, very different than ours.

I will warn OP that Unsong, besides being a wonderful read, is a bit... odd. Rare is the book that can successfully make humor based off of Jewish Kaballah and computer programming simultaneously, and have multiple levels of jokes in each. And it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if it is... it's wonderful
