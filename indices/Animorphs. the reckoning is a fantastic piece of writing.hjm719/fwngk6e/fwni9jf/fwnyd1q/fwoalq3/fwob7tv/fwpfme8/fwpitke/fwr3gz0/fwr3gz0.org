I think it includes all of (pasting from sidebar)

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows +known, consistent rules, as a consequence of+ rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

/Some/ of the worldbuilding is top-quality rational stuff, with other parts that are entertaining but not so well-grounded in consistent rules
