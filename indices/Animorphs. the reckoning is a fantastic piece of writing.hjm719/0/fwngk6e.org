It's still a WIP, right?

Not to be /That Guy/, but I just don't have the memory to keep track of a zillion different concurrent stories in my head, and there's so much great stuff that's complete I can afford to be picky.

Unrelated, but Mother of Learning and HP: Methods of Rationality are the only complete [[/r/rational]] web serials I've read. Worm is in my queue... Any other complete series I should be binging?
