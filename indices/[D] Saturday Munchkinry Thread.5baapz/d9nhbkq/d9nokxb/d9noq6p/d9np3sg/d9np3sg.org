Like, /50 percent/!? That makes this oracle an outcome pump, as your choice of words probably implied?

Are you sure this doesn't instead pump probability to scenarios where I never try that experiment? That'd give me a reset button if I ever find myself in a timeline that I feel went wrong - though it'd be a bummer if the timeline I pump to starts at the big bang again and this machine is the Great Filter. Edit: No that wouldn't work /some/ civilization would be good enough at cooperation to refrain from using such machines.
