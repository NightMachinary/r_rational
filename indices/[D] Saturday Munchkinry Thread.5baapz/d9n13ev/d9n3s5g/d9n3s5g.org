- Keep very good track of genealogy, so that power levels can be predicted before children are even born. Test all power levels, though, in case of infidelity or other genealogical error. Go into full panic alert mode if any genealogical error springs up and try to figure out what caused it. This will require strongly socially conservative values on sexuality - strong social sanctions against infidelity and so on.
- As is normal in ancient human societies with a focus on breeding high-quality offspring: institute polygamy wherein high-status men have multiple wives and low-status men are used as disposable cannon fodder. Status in men and women is dependent on power level.
- Criminalize the marriage of men to women of a higher power level/status. Criminalize the marriage of men to women who will produce children with a lower power level/status than the woman. If these two laws are obeyed, all children will have power levels one higher than their mother. Strongly socially encourage men to marry at least one woman with their same power level, thereby producing children with a power level greater even than themselves - for example, give these stronger children a significantly larger share of the inheritance wherever they exist.
- Strongly socially encourage men to have very large numbers of children - not just in total, but with each of their wives. Conquer nearby nations for boosters of genetic material, but this may not even be needed if you set a strong social value on fertility and genealogy early on.

EDIT: I think it might be advantageous to make it fashionable to marry close relatives of close relatives' spouses. This creates stronger family bonds without increasing the amount of ancestral repetition.
