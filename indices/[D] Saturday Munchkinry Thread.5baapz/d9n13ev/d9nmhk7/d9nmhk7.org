This seems very important and exploitable.

If you give up our current social values (which is practically a given), you can have a ~4:1 generational speed mismatch between genders.

If you have men bear children at age 60 and women at age 15, you could have 4 generations in 60 years with only 8 ancestors instead of 30 in that time. Growth of the breadth of your family tree would still be exponential compared to its height, but it would be ~x^{1.25} instead of ~x^{2} (I did some math wrong, as I can't figure out the exact ratio).
