I expect there to be huge problems with childraising/teenagers/alcohol, depending on when T first starts and if society has means to disable it (drug, lobotomy etc). A T7 baby will already be bad news for the parents. A T12 /must/ be raised in isolation far away from towns, and even then has high likelyhood to kill itself/parents trough accident.

So we face a bottleneck of "how many strong Telepaths do survive until adolescence" - breeding for quiet babies and subvervient behaviour seem good choices. Also helps against random T12s or higher trying to ursurp the throne. Seems like the most obvious ruler pattern, the strongest Telepath on the throne.

So I'd want a tradition of drugs(inhibitory/sedatative) to deal with unruly Telepaths, in the form of research/chemistry/alchemists guild. It might be necessary to be able to sedate a raging todler at a moments notice, and a strong police/military/ninja/warrior-caste to deal with rampaging Telepaths.

Then a japanese-like culture of giving up individuality for the greater good of society, monastery-like culture of retreat, restraint, abstinence from alkohol etc.

Then we'd want to fund expeditions to far-off countries. Some whacko centuries old report tells of a land far to the east? Send the highspeed telepath-powered airship there to get breeders and their rare genes here, if necessary by force/slavery.

Or maybe nothing so dark, but I'd expect a strong tradition to seek/exchange mates from either very very far away, (like "they look visibly different than me") or from somewhere where they have good records.

Put extremely harsh punishments on altering/lying/falsifiying gen records.
