*Society-level munchkinry*

Everyone in the world is telekinetic, able to exert force at a distance of up to two meters. Telekinetic power comes at different levels, each five times as powerful as the last. A T-2 can exert 1 N of force (enough to press a key on a keyboard), while a T-7 can exert 3125 N of force (as powerful as a kickboxer's punch), and a T-12 can exert 9.7 x 10^{6} N, which is about the thrust of a Space Shuttle booster rocket at launch. This power is continuous and unlimited so long as the individual wants to use it, and can be turned on and off at will.

Power level is based on how many generations an individual can go back before they have a repeated ancestor. If your parents were half-siblings, then you would be able to go back two generations (and be a T-2) because your grandmother or grandfather would appear on the family tree twice. If your parents were first cousins, you could go back three generations, making you a T-3. If your parents were fifth cousins, you could go back seven generations, making you a T-7. (In the case of generational mismatch, as if your parents were first cousins once removed, you would take the higher of distance to consanguinity.)

You're the king of a kingdom with a million people. You want to maximize the telekinetic powers of your kingdom, not just within the next twenty years that you expect to rule, but for the foreseeable future, centuries down the line. *How do you maximize telekinetic powers?* What laws do you institute, how do you attempt to change your culture, and what institutions do you found?
