"Let's play a game," he said.

"Spare me the SAW bullshit." His girlfriend rolled her eyes.

"Naw, c'mon. It'll be fun."

Tess frowned, then shrugged. "Sure, why not."

She put down her novel. "So, what are we going to play, chess? Uno."

"Nah, I got something new from one of my friends. You know the one." Saying this, Bob set a small cardboard box down onto the table.

It was unadorned, except for the shipping information.

"Some sort of prototype?" Tess asked.

"Yep, he asked me to test it."

"Huh. Alright, I'm sort of interested now. What are the rules?"

"Hold on a sec."

The tape on the box refused to be ripped off, so he pulled out his pocket knife and cut through it. Opening the box, he pulled out it's contents.

There were three wooden blocks and a glossy sheet of paper. The wooden blocks had rounded edges and laser-cut engravings on each side, but otherwise were rather crude. One block had ones engraved into in each corner, another had twos, and the third had threes.

Bob skimmed over it quickly, while Tess weighed a wooden block in one hand, bobbing it up and down.

"The rules look pretty simple. One person rolls these blocks like dice while the other looks away, and then they'll make a sentence. The first block starts an analogy, the second block is the subject, and the third block is what they're compared to. Then the roller has to read out the sentence they make, and the other person has to not laugh. I guess it's some test of comedic delivery, or something."

"Really? That's it? Usually the stuff he makes is better than this."

Bob matched Tess's frown. "Yeah, to be honest, I'm not impressed."

"By the way, these blocks feel kind of weird; like there's metal inside of them or something."

"Wait, really? Maybe there's some secret to them."

Tess blinked. "Do you think so?"

"I don't know. But I don't think he'd ship something from New York to California if he didn't have a reason. I guess they're worth a few rolls."

"Alright, here goes nothing."

The blocks were a little unweildy to properly roll, so Tess threw them up in the air. They came down onto the table, bouncing a few times.

She read off the blocks to Bob.

"Love is like... [[/u/GaBeRockKing]]? Temporarily omnipotent."

"Wait, what?"
