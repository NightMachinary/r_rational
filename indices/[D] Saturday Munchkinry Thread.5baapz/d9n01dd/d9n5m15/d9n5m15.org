I immediately jumped to how one might somehow find a way to turn the creation of a FAI, into some sort of analogy about love.\\
Oh wait it said it /had/ to be a /bad/ analogy, well that certainly makes munchkining easier. Given a GAI can copy itself and it's not magic, it ought to be immune to reality returning to normal; which makes it the best choice I can think of that's not too ridiculous a stretch.

Now the question remains; what minimum requirements are there for a analogy to be just the right amount of bad for the effect to work. If the threshold for a analogy is low then you could do any number of comparisons about how FAI and love are both extremely desirable things.

You'know now that I think about it, the best answer to at /least a third/ of these kinds of scenarios involves the creation of GAI.
