Moving humans around in space is really expensive compared to moving robots around. Without even considering wages. All those gasses, chemicals, recycling, food production, etc.

This means it's going to take a great deal of infrastructure to build space industry facilities / communities large enough to justify a human labor force doing physically dangerous work in space. By the time that infrastructure is built, there will likely be government entities controlling things.

The dystopian-prison-colony-in-the-asteroid-belt idea isn't impossible, but I don't think it's very likely either.
