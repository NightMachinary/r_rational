... Make it about labor relations. The most /likely/ reason to have massive space infrastructure is ecological footprint. Heavy industry kicked upstairs because noone really gives a crap if you deal with massively toxic by-products of your processes by loading them into a mass driver and launching them at a designated lunar crater, and if your nanotech develops bugs in the code and start doing bad things.. Well, you just evac the facility and point mirrors at it until it hits thermal equilibrium with the surface of the sun.

Of course, one more reason to do industry in space might be to avoid earth side laws relating to the safety, dignity and compensation of labor.

There you go: Now you have a reason for the developing world to have lots of bodies already up there and angry as all heck, because they frequently being casually murdered in the name of profits. (Corporations only care about safety when forced to. Extraterritorially based industry?..)

Which could also lead to really ironic demands on behalf of the forces doing the takeover. Such as filing for full statehood with every first world nation arranged in anything resembling a federal structure at the same time.
