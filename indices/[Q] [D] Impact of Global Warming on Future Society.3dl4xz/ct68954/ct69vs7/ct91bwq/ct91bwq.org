/Does anyone have a good primary source with some math that would work on this topic? I'm trying to convince myself the global warming/climate change concern isn't a popular myth on the same magnitude as people using 2% of there brains.

If anyone with a good grounding in physics and statistics has a primary source or well referenced secondary source please link it.
