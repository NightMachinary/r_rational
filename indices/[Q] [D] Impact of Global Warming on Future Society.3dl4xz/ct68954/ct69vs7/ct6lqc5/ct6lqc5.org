  I was under the impression that the only preventative action would be reducing emissions, and that even if we stopped emissions now, the world would still be headed for disaster.

Preventing emissions is one side of the coin. The other side is carbon sequestration. Emissions reduction is currently the best option for slowing or preventing climate change, but that's not necessarily going to be the case forever. /If/ climate change were stopped, I would suspect that it would be through reactive methods rather than preventative methods, just because of how humans tend to set their priorities. If humanity can't do large-scale geoengineering to fix the planet ... well, I guess my narrative preference is that humanity /did/ try to fix the planet through geoengineering, and that this just went wrong in some way. But if you've got wicked-good genetic engineering and general nano-assemblers, I have to start wondering why those weren't tried as solutions to the problem (possibly they just developed far too late?).
