Well, we do have the technology to reduce CO2 content of the atmosphere. (burying trees, storing it in liquid form, making diamonds out of it, engineering cyanobacteria to deposit graphite, turning them into hydracarbos again) etc the possibilites are endless. Only trouble is its much to expensive right now, its a lot cheaper (by about 2-3 orders of magnitude IIRC) to reduce emissions.

BUT: if the price of energy goes down to nearly zero (right now we have prices of 0.05â‚¬ per kwh), some of the methods get a lot cheaper. If we have mature industrial semi-autonomous industrial robots, they get cheaper again etc.

Sure, you would not immediately get the pre-industrial climate back, esp if some of the tipping points have already gone over, but you /sure/ can mitigate GW.
