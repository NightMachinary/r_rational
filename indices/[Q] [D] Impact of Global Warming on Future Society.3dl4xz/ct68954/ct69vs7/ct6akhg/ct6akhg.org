For just the global warming v space...

The first kind of nano-assemblers was for graphene cord, and maybe only worked well in microgravity - so, perfect for space elevators (grab asteroid, spin the cord as you travel back home), but little else. Cheap, got the job done, so by the time shit started to really hit the fan and the Sleeping Giant of the US population woke up, the options were: a) bunch of hard stuff* dealing with shitty problems** or b) motherfuckin' space.

[1] Damming the Golden Gate. Massive levies. Water production. Etc. Not that space isn't hard... it's just also sexy.

[2] To deal with these problem, you have to face the human misery involved... misery you know you're part of the cause of.

Also, although someone better at math can look at this - What happens if we start mining iceteroids for freshwater on Earth? Can the produce enough water for sea level rise?
