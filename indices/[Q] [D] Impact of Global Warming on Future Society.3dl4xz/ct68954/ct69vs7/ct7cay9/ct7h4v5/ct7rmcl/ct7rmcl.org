  First-world nations did not properly plan for provision of adaptive resources in their foreign aid plans, and since they aren't able to produce a good surplus of food or water in the tough times, the third world is left to their own devices.

That's what the third world would say. The first world apologists would say that they had provisioned for the third world /just fine/, and the reason it wasn't adequate came down to profit-seeking behaviors, government corruption, etc.
