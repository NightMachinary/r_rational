Maybe. I don't want to really focus on GW impacts directly, but it could provide an extra source of resentment from third-world to first-world nations... Maybe the climate should be already solved around the story's setting, and the space colonization is in reaction to the third-world population beginning to skyrocket again.

After about 80 years, effective atmospheric carbon sequestration could be invented, and 50 years later, the climate is put back on track (aeroforming controls on sequestration plants would allow a planetary thermostat, essentially). In that time, however, the third world has already been devastated with droughts, floods, famines, storms, and the resulting instability. First-world nations did not properly plan for provision of adaptive resources in their foreign aid plans, and since they aren't able to produce a good surplus of food or water in the tough times, the third world is left to their own devices.

After 130 years, around the 2140s, things are rebuilding. Cheap spaceflight is a priority item in first-world nations, as the prolonged impacts of global warming inspired mistrust in the stability of environment and life on Earth. The social focus of technology is now fully focused on control of the natural state, including habitats and the human body. An ongoing project for the development of an orbital ring ramps up, and with nanotech developments in solar, NASA starts launching statites out of the ecliptic plane for a nonintrusive Dyson bubble. Insights on general nanoassembly are starting to come together, and genetic engineering for the human body becomes a big focus of research, particularly by the military.

I want the US/NATO/G7(?) military to be a very big force, with somewhat fascistic control, at the very least in the decades before the story starts. The main characters are a military project, training to act as military police officers for the proposed colonies. This is a way for both the originating countries and the military itself to exert control over the colonies, so we don't have anything like the Martian Revolution in B5. Neurology is also a very advanced field now, particularly with the addition of neural interfacing and simulation, which is how the military is able to fuck the soldiers' heads into giving complete loyalty. There is a second generation of officers, androids with the uploaded minds of the original generation's top performers, and that's where things get interesting.

Sound good?
