Or a thin-film mirror in solar orbit between the Sun and Earth, blocking a few percentage points of incoming solar energy, and using the heat that is not reflected to power an industrial complex.

Or maybe the Sun enters a cooler cycle, or the oceanic carbon cycles adjust slightly to compensate.

I don't dismiss global warming, but I'm not entirely convinced that it's something we're responsible for. I'm sure humans aren't helping, but the world's been a lot warmer before.

Even if humans are causing global warming, if the sun enters a cooling phase and we get another global ice age, that'll kibosh any global warming we generate.
