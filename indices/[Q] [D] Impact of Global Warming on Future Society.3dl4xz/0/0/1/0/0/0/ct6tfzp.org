To me, the question seemed to be a question of possibility, not plausibility. I answered it's possibility, you answered it's plausibility with pseudo-current technology.

If we start talking about a real asteroid-belt-based industry using automation and devoting significant infrastructure to additional infrastructure growth, plausibility and possibility begin to approach one another over time.
