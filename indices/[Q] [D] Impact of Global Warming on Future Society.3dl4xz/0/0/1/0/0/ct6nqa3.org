I have found the number of 360 km³ of water will raise the oceans 1 mm. Thats 360 gigatons of water. If we have a look at a select few of our main industrial materials:

- steel: 1,600,000,000 tonnes
- concrete: 4,000,000,000 tonnes
- wood: 2,800,000,000 tonnes
- oil: 10,194,000,000 tonnes

That comes out to a mass of 18 gigatonnes. So all the industrial capacity on earth right now is probably smaller than 50 gigatonnes.

Remember, for asteroid ice mining to raise ocean levels by 1mm² you need 360gigatonnes! By the time you have that industrial capacity, global warming is not a problem anymore. Just built dams hundreds of meters high and pumps that pump seawater etc. In terms of moved and refined materials thats still cheaper.
