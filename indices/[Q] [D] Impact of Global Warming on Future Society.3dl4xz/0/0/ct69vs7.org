  why global warming wasn't stopped
#+end_quote

I was under the impression that the only preventative action would be reducing emissions, and that even if we stopped emissions now, the world would still be headed for disaster.

  general nano-assemblers while it should have been devoting resources to keeping major population centers from drowning.
#+end_quote

Well, I didn't actually say that first-world nations wouldn't be enacting adaptive measures, quite the opposite. That doesn't preclude nanotechnology research though, especially considering that nanotechnology itself offers a lot in the way of removing the problem with aeroforming as well as preventing the problem from happening again with better energy technologies. I also want to give the impression that the real breakthroughs happened in the last half-century or so, and is just starting to become ubiquitous in the first-world.

  why space colonization was deemed better or more efficient than just stopping the global problems
#+end_quote

It's not really meant to come across as "escaping the planet," like in Firefly, but more about reducing the burden of population on the Earth's ecology. Maybe they're planning to ship off the population of developing nations. Is Venus a good aeroforming target? Hell, they could be planning to use the same technologies to fix Earth on Venus.

  The third world is probably screwed.

I'm just wondering how much. If they are so screwed, then maybe the story should be set where impacts are fixed enough that the third world can get their shit together again? Would government collapse be imminent?
