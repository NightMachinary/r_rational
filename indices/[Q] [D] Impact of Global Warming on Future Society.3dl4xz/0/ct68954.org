Suggested reading is /The Windup Girl/ by Paolo Bacigalupi, which has a lot of neat stuff in it. Quite a bit of it is about global warming; it's set in 23rd century Thailand, in a city that's below sea level.

Second, Charles Stross has a few articles on building the near future that you might want to read, [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/05/shaping_the_future.html]["Shaping the Future"]] and [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/01/world-building-404-the-unknown.html]["World Building 404: The Unknown Unknowns"]].

Okay, so with your homework out of the way, the really big problem -- the huge, massive, can't avoid it problem -- is that you can't just consider global warming. You need to consider global warming /and all the other stuff/. The biggest mistake that science fiction makes when it tries to predict the future is that it just narrows in on one single thing. This is great if you're going for allegory or political commentary, but it doesn't paint the future like it will actually look. So you need to think about global warming, genetic engineering, increased automation, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, robotics, etc. all at once, which is really, really ridiculously tough (and this is why I like writing fantasy more than scifi).

So the very first question you have to answer is why global warming wasn't stopped. You need a vaguely plausible timeline for how the United States go to general nano-assemblers while it should have been devoting resources to keeping major population centers from drowning. You need to justify why space colonization was deemed better or more efficient than just stopping the global problems -- or how the first world developed local solutions to global problems. You need to deal with the knock-on effects of global warming, like ocean acidification and extreme weather conditions.

Right now, it's pretty clear that first world countries are in a better position with regards to climate change than third world countries. This isn't just because they have more money; they have better infrastructure and institutions which will be able to deal with it. There's an index that I looked at a while back that tried to quantify which nations would be most affected by climate change given their disposition and resources, and it wasn't terribly surprising to see that the first world was in pretty good shape. Hell, 17% of the Netherlands is below sea level already; it's possible that the developed world is just going to get a lot of dikes and polders.

The third world is probably screwed. Dysfunctional governments aren't going to be able to build the infrastructures necessary to keep their cities safe; money that's earmarked for levees will go missing, projects will come in over budget and behind schedule with skimming off the top, and the cut corners are going to come back to bite /someone/ in the ass (though there's a decent chance of any of that happening the first world too). Climate change is going to mean migration, which puts stress on infrastructure, which probably leads to death and disease. This means calls for aid from the first world, which might not be answered due to them having their own problems.
