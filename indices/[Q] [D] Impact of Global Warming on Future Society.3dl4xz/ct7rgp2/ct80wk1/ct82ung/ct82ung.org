Tradition is to make the plot a thinly veiled reenactment of the american war of independence - but any plausible space presence is going to be much to economically tied into earth for that to make sense. So instead, I figure that it might make a lot of sense for the strikers/rebels/whatever holding the proverbial clogs over the very expensive machinery to demand that their habitats get recognized as a member state of an existing federal structure with the attendant rights and obligations- and since they are hopelessly multinational, they can propose this to everyone worth joining. Heck, as a negotiating tactic, this has merits, because.. well, while taking over what would amount to a "special economic zone" gone very awry would entail a lot of hassle, it would also entail economic upsides.
