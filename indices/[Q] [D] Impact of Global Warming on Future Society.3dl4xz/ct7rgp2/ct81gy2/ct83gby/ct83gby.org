Well, I was not aiming for maximum likelihood in all respects - that would most likely be "Lots of telepresence". I was trying to set up conflict. That said, this setting does need a cheap way to supply the off-earth presence. Either we are talking an actual space elevator, or someone invented a very cheap way to send up consumables. Railgun->Capture by rotating tether dipping into upper atmosphere or something similar. People cant go up and down that way, but that night be a desirable problem from a story standpoint.
