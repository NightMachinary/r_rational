Ideally, yes. Flicker is good at patient experimentation at her speed--but not at human speeds. She loses patience when incrementalism isn't yielding new data and jumps scope. This can work well, but has also gotten her in trouble before. Watching her father skip steps in emergencies and still get results led to some 'do as I say, not as I do' arguments when she was growing up. It's probably her worst flaw as an experimentalist.
