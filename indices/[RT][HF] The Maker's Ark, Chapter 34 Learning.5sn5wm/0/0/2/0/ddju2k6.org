8-) I've long been a fan of Derek Lowe and the 'Things I won't work with' category of his blog in particular. Anyone who wants to put scientific explanation in their stories would do well to pay attention to how he writes. One of my favorite bits is still from a post on using animal testing when you /really/ don't understand the underlying biology of a drug mechanism you want to try:

"If you give it to a rat and he goes off and flops down, is that because he's dizzy, because his legs don't feel right, because he feels sick to his stomach, because he's suddenly sleepy, or because he's overcome with waves of rodent ennui? You can untangle some of those, but it isn't easy."
