Small-t trickster is a personality trait and handy descriptor rather than anything mythological. And here is a bit from chapter 24 to think about:

--------------

Every theory used by the Grs'thnk portal explorers had been wrong. They'd wondered why so few of their probes had come back. Doc wondered why any of them had. The odds were trillions to one or worse against it happening by chance.

The only people who ever managed new portals on Earth were magicians, who could cheat the odds. And Golden Valkyrie, who could see what future would result, if she opened a particular portal--and only open it if she approved. Which was another way to cheat.

Doc snorted to himself. Maybe all the old Grs'thnk portal explorers had been magicians; they were notorious enough for being unstable and drifting off into mysticism that it was a Grs'thnk cliche, like the 'absent minded scientist' was for humans.
