  To be clear, I am not the author. I just found a fic that I thought would fit the subreddit, and linked it.

  *Hermione:* While you were a shadow in Albania, we developed magically assisted technology to virtually eliminate the possibility of death for those who do not wish to die, and implemented it world-wide. We are also working on plans to postpone indefinitely the heat death of the Universe. Your path to immortality is obsolete.

This is surely far more amusing than i pictured it :D . Do you happen to know crack fics that follow this line of thought? They would amuse me to no end.

  I think it depends on how abstract Transfiguration lets one be. Hermione may have known about atomic structures of wood and metal, but if she'd never seen a metal needle in her life, would it have worked at all?

True , but it depends if the thing needed is *knowledge* or actual *experience* , if it were the latter you would be right. But i doubt the girl that transigured the radioactive hearrings had an actual experience of whatever radioactive element caused the glow, maybe she was the daughter of a nuclear physicist or had otherwise found some of it , if it was radon it wouldm make sense , since as far as i understood the incident happened arround the '50s but i don't see it so likely.

edit : some minor and some major corrections
