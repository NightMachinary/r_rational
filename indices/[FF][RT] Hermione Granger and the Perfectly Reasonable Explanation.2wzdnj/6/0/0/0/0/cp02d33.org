  For example, do you want to conjure a nanofactory? At least see one first-hand first. Or, if you want to be nasty, sarin? How is magic supposed to tell the difference between it and millions of other odorless, colorless, volatile liquids if you don't first expose yourself to enough of it to feel its effects?

I completly see your point , i agree. I missed a bit the context of the story and got caught in a flight of fancy. [stasis charm + matter-antimatter transfiguration = fun ?]

Anyway in the HP universe transfiguration is not my biggest "issue" (abusability wise) but rather AGIs , hell they have paintings that can pass a turing test without any kind of problem...

I've NEVER seen a fiction that tackles the problem of computation with magic. Imho the fact is that it is way too broken. An hard-take off AI would be far too easy and i don't see how the canon laws would prevent it , exept using the soul-cliche (you must be a living biological being to have creative thoughts), the fact is that it wouldn't excuse IA (intelligence augmentation) .

That's one of the reasons i've never started the endeavour to make a FF of my own , the other being that my english grammar and sentence structuring are bloody awful.

Anyone of us in this subreddit if put in the canon HP universe would just break it. Maybe for dumber subjects like myself it would take some years but yeah... And i think that's why we don't see so many Rational!HP stories , magic and science mix so well , way too well ; avoiding Peggy Sues is too hard [note : in the HPMoR universe is less so because the rulers are stricter than canon]

About Singularity based stories i know some that follow a "Power" (post-singularity all-powerfull entiry) that hops from an HP universe to another. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4846135/1/Ex-Machina][Ex Machina]] It's not only one , he did 4 of them plus a HPMoR crossover.
