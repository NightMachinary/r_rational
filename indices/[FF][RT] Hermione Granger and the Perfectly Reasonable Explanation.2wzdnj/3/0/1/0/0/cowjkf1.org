  I'd bet PRE!Hermione wouldn't either

Yeah, [[#s][]] are not mentioned amongst Hermione's extra reading, so she probably doesn't know the story.

And anyway, this interpretation is interesting because it references canon, but I'd consider this answer "unfair", it's too allegorical for a presumably logical riddle. Although, IIRC in canon the riddles were more like /philosophical questions/, rather than logical riddles.

Your "mundane" answer makes much more sense in this regard. I considered something along this lines, but I didn't remember the ratios, I thought it was less than [[#s][]], and I didn't bother looking it up.
