I had a similar sense.

My headcanon about the early-canon Hermione is that she was unaware that she was antagonizing people with her behavior: the reason she broke down when Ron called her a "nightmare" was that she had thought that she and Harry and Ron were, after all their shared experiences, friends. Suddenly, she discovers that she's been antagonizing them all along, and she doesn't quite understand what's wrong with her and how to fix it. /That's/ why she spent the afternoon crying, not because she is particularly fragile nor because Ron is a bully.

In this fic, she /can/ tell that some of her classmates resent her help (but does it anyway), and she understands and interprets her classmates' (both Ravenclaws' and Slytherins') reactions when she covers up her notes, and games out the possibilities. (For example, she asks herself how they might react if she tells them that it's the teacher's orders.) That already makes her more emotionally intelligent than her canon counterpart, IMO.
