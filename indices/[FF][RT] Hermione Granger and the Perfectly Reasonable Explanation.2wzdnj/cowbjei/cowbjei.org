This is a lot of fun, I'm looking forward to more updates.

I know it was intentional on the author's part, so this isn't a criticism of the work itself, but Hermione's attempt to explain radioactivity was cringe-worthingly bad. There are rocks that glow and make you very sick if you spend too long near them. The reason they make you sick is very different from any usual reason, so there was a long gap between knowing about the rocks and knowing that they were dangerous.
