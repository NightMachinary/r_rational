That's pretty good too. My original take on it was going to actually explain some of the science, but I realized that it wasn't necessary to convey the meaning.

"Muggles have discovered that matter is made of tiny building blocks we call atoms. There are about 100 types of atoms, which we call elements. The higher-numbered elements are generally much rarer, and many of them are unstable. The unstable ones gradually fling away pieces of themselves; gradually but still violently. Some of those pieces are safe and look like glowing, and others are invisible and really dangerous if they hit humans."
