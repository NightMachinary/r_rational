Put those back in the jar before you damage them!

But, I agree with the sentiment. Frankly, I've always thought about HPMOR that if you want a rational! protagonist in the HPverse, Harry requires a near-complete rewrite of his personality and natural talents, whereas Hermione requires but a few tweaks. (I do understand why LessWrong went with Harry. He had didactic goals that took priority over everything else, and the audience for Harry as the lead will always be bigger than the audience for Hermione as the lead, at least outside stories that are primarily romance.)
