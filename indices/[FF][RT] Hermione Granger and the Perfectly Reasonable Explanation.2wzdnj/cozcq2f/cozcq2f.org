Ever heard of Nanotech ? (obviously yes , this subreddit is not for nothing) With transfiguration and some ability in computer programming (you ship this problem since the magical world seem to have arleadly some basic AGIs [artificial general intelligences] ) it would take maximum hmm 2 years? Five? to reach the singularity Would be a cool way to get rid of Voldemort for sure.

I'm not saying that making nanobots will be easy for her obviously , but it would be way easyer than i can comprehend.
