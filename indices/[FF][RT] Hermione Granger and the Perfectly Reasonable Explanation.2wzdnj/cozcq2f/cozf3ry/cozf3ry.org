  If that was canon compliant Hermione would be kidnapped by the Unspeakeables in arround one week.

In canon, the Unspeakables don't do much of anything, really. :P Besides, they'd be all, like, "Transfiguration? That's boring! We're studying LOVE!"

  I hope you have your plot figured out , this concept is so hugely abuseable that it makes me pale.

To be clear, I am /not/ the author. I just found a fic that I thought would fit the subreddit, and linked it.

  Ever heard of Nanotech ? (obviously yes , this subreddit is not for nothing) With transfiguration and some ability in computer programming (you ship this problem since the magical world seem to have arleadly some basic AGIs [artificial general intelligences] ) it would take maximum hmm 2 years? Five? to reach the singularity Would be a cool way to get rid of Voldemort for sure.

*Voldemort:* [stepping out of the cauldron] Behold! I have defeated death!

*Hermione:* While you were a shadow in Albania, we developed magically assisted technology to virtually eliminate the possibility of death for those who do not wish to die, and implemented it world-wide. We are also working on plans to postpone indefinitely the heat death of the Universe. Your path to immortality is obsolete.

  I'm not saying that making nanobots will be easy for her obviously , but it would be way easyer than i can comprehend.

I think it depends on how abstract Transfiguration lets one be. Hermione may have known about atomic structures of wood and metal, but if she'd never seen a metal needle in her life, would it have worked at all?
