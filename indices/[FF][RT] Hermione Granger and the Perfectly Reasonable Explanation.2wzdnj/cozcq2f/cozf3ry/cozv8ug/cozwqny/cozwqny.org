I know of some magitech fics, but not any that go full Singularity.

I don't know if that's what the author of the fic has in mind, but what makes sense to me is that experience of "the destination" is necessary, while knowledge involved in "the journey" is helpful.

Moira, in particular, could have easily experienced radioactive elements, if she had a watch that used radium paint for watch dials and hands that glowed in the dark. This was done as late as the 60s. *Edit:* Actually, that's mentioned in Hermione's internal dialogue in the fic.

I view this as a good limitation of Transfiguration. For example, do you want to conjure a nanofactory? At least see one first-hand first. Or, if you want to be nasty, sarin? How is magic supposed to tell the difference between it and millions of other odorless, colorless, volatile liquids if you don't first expose yourself to enough of it to feel its effects?
