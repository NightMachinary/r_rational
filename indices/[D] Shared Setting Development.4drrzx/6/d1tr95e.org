I've worked on one team that did this with slack and a wikia wiki. I'm not terribly enthused with the final results of their stuff so far but I did what I could. It can get dicey when people are super invested in their pet creations and getting all the parts to mesh well is a HUGE challenge because especially with amateur creatives diminishing or challenging a concept looks like attacking them personally.

On a side note of interest to this, I personally created a Creative Common Species explicitly designed to be portable to multiple settings and nominally rational.

I also made a kind of soft collaborative story to show some of the potential of them in a story you can read about [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DeepRise][here]].

I know there is not necessarily a scarcity of horror boogie-boos on the internet in the creative commons but I felt like there IS a paucity of open source =alien= aliens in fiction or otherwise.

If anyone wants some other 'things to populate an open setting with' on the broad strokes world building/species side I have literally 20 years of archived critter/species/empire building ranging from sci-fi to fantasy I could mine or refurbish.

This stuff is pretty old but as an example I'm willing to put a lot of it up for the creative commons use.

If anyone wants to use that stuff or other things I've made let me know and if there is legal concerns I can go and get them actually registered in the CC.

The world needs more visually and conceptually interesting baseline tropes and I don't personally use art as an income source so I'd rather donate to the cause as it were.
