Okay, so this isn't quite what you're looking for, but... I ran a Kickstarter a few months ago for a worldbuilding resource called [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/825176040/strange-nations][Strange Nations]]. Every culture in the book is free to use. The only requirement is that if you use something from the book then you have to let other people riff off of whatever you did with it too (e.g. if you apply some modifications to the Traveler Clans, then those modifications are Creative Commons material, though the rest of your universe might not be).

I can let people know once it's available (it'll be pay-what-you-want), if you think it might help.
