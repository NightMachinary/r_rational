I would say the mechanics of the loops is very much brain candy delicious.

However at the same time I think for barrier to entry you REALLY need some core understanding of the 'canon' of things before you get as much enjoyment from it.

I'm not all that big a fan of kingdom hearts for example, so when I see loop crossovers with it I don't get the same kind of 'INVESTMENT YAY' gut reflex that I do with other things.

That said if some one wrote stories about alien hive minds, character reincarnations or species re-assignment, insectile or giger-esque morphology and so on and put it just about ANYWHERE in ANY genre I probably would gobble it up joyfully.

So I suspect maybe there is a hint of a thing there.
