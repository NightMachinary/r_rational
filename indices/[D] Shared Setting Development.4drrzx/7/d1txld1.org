I know that [[/r/hfy]] has created quite an extensive shared universe ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse][the Jenkinsverse]]), named for the main character of the first story. I'm not sure it would be an appropriate setting for the sort of thing this sub would tend to produce (it just wouldn't be enough of a challenge), but it is an excellent example of a shared setting working smoothly between several writers for quite a long time. I'm not an writer myself, but if I were and if I intended to try creating that kind of shared universe, then hambone3110 would be the first person I'd ask for advice, because he's already done it.
