[[http://www.writeups.org/index.php][Here's one project]] I've recently stumbled upon.

#+begin_quote
  Asides from the writeups expressly labelled as being home-grown and portraying original characters, all of the featured characters and distinctive likenesses are the intellectual property of someone else (comic book publishers or authors, writers, movie rights holders, etc.). All trademarks and copyrights are owned by their respective owners. Each and every entry is clearly labelled as to its source - usually the comic book universe/publisher, the name and author of the book, the title of the movie, etc.

Mostly the articles it has can't be used for what you're looking for, but the format itself can.

A [[https://creativecommons.org/][CC]] wiki could be created based on a similar idea with an enforced rule that all donated IP must be the provider's original work. After that, articles could be classified into “Characters”, “Monsters”, “Locations”, “Items”, “Laws of Universe”, etc.
