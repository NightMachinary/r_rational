So, this isn't quite what you're describing, but the [[http://www.orionsarm.com][Orion's Arm]] world-buildling project might provide some insight. It's a very large database, started in 2000 and still somewhat active, which describes some 10,000 years of a hard to semi-hard sci-fi setting, full of posthumanism, singularities, and strange aliens.

It's created by volunteers who retain the rights to what they contribute, but have worked together in the past to publish fan-fiction anthologies in the setting. So, a far cry from a fully CC-licensed setting, but that does give it the advantage of having a curated canon- and, in theory, anyone can join the community and contribute to what it publishes.
