Fanfics don't have a dispute resolution system, do they?

The SCP wiki seems a lot like what you're looking for. The site has high community standards, with strict moderators and an expectation that anything receiving consistent downvotes will be remove.

There's no central canon at all, unless you count the single creepypasta that started it. But a rich set of shared fanfic-like conventions and assumptions has nonetheless grown up, to the point where there is unquestionably a shared SCP setting. People vote based on their "headcanons" of the SCP universe as well as quality.

Based on this, a well-designed website along the same lines and a single well-written "seed" fic could do the job.
