The weird thing is that a lot of fanfiction communities have a baseline so far removed from the actual source material that the only thing keeping them from being Creative Commons is the fact that they aren't. It seems like the Schelling point is in a really inconvenient place, but I can't for the like of me work out how to move it.

To get back to your point, I suppose that what we need is to make a Really Cool Thing, and then declare it Creative Commons. The trouble is, creating a Really Cool Thing is actually pretty fricken hard.
