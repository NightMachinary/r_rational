Personally my favorite shared universe is that of the forgotten realm books. They have a huge world that many authors have written various heros into. However this only works because the original author and creator of the world decides how dramatic the actions of characters in these worlds can be.

Otherwise nothing can stop an author from creating a character that takes over the universe making it impossible for anyone else to logically have a story in the universe with a super powered hero. A true shared universe requires someone to decide what makes the cut as cannon or you simply end up with lots of stories that are basically just fanfiction.

Someone could make a good starting universe that can be used in a million different ways. Recently I've been thinking of making something based roughly on Rick Riordan's or Jim Butcher's worlds which could theoretically make a good universe. But this wouldn't truly make a combined multiverse without someone deciding what is canon and what is not or the multiverse would make no sense.
