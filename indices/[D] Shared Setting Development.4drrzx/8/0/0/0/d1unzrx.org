I think that we could be very basic in what we make universal. Consider Magic: the Gathering, which has how many different planes, each one with its own flavor?

Brief braindump:

- You have the multiverse. Hundreds or billions of different universes or planes or what-have-you.
- You have what we'll call "shards" for the time being. Shards are like collections of universes, and mirror each other. You could have one shard that contains Earth's plane, Olympus, and Tenefritzya, and then another shard that contains those planes, but some or all of them are slightly or wildly different.
- Not every universe/plane is represented in every shard.
- Some shards are really similar to each other, to the point that they might differ so slightly that only hardcore fans can tell the difference. Others are really different.
- People can have doppelgangers, or echoes, in shards that are really divergent from each other. Their echoes don't even have to be in the same universe from shard to shard.
- This last bit basically means that we can have all of the weirdest AUs, and it's all still "canon" from a fully removed point of view. Luis Walker might be a wizard of Tenefritzya in most shards (i.e. that's how Luis' original author first wrote him), but in this shard he's a barista because I want to write a Coffeeshop AU, and in that shard he's the avatar of an alien god, because, I don't know, he just is.
