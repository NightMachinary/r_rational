I like the idea of multiversal shards. Each author can pick and choose which other stories are canon for that author's shard, etc., sort of like how various authors will pick and choose from the same mythology (but with a metaphysical backing for this).

That said, I think that the thing that we're really trying to avoid here is fanfiction in the "nobody can make money off of it" sense, rather than in the "not part of the original author's canon" sense.
