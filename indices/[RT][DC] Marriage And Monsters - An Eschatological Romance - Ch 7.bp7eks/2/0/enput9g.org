I tentatively volunteer. For proof of skill I made the Animorphs: the Reckoning cover art, a Pichu fanart piece for POoS, and a few other drawings posted to reddit that you can find via my post history. I am in the process of graduating and moving though, so I'm not sure how soon I can get a drawing done.

Anyway, I'm really enjoying the story! It's interesting, well written, and posts very frequently! If you turn out to be another alt of Alexander Wales, I'm going to be so upset! (I really want more Glimwarden!)
