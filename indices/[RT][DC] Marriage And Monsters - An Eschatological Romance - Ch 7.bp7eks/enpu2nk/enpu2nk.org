Man, I was so hyped for Cecilia being the endgame villain. We would slowly build up to making something out of the city, Haley would level up but only just a little bit, Cecilia would go deeper and deeper into madness, and then BAM, the arc finale!

It was all squeezed into one chapter though. Not that I mind the pacing, it just felt super different from what ruffwriter does, for example, or even erratic.

Loving the twists so far. Keep 'em up! MOAH!
