The wonderland thing working like that implies serious stuff for the rest of the world. There are much worse settings people can imagine into being. So let's hope it's mostly contained in this city and even if the effects are global there's only a few more people warping reality(and none of them is a warhammer40k fan for example) . Otherwise the world is going to become an apocaliptic kitchen sink very fast.
