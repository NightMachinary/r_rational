You seem to be saying that you want the general wisdom of society (as expressed in the Aesops in the fiction that people write) to increase noticeably within your own lifetime as opposed to the multi-generational timescale on which such progress actually occurs. /You/ (and indeed, probably everyone on this subreddit) have seen all the Stock Aesops a hundred times, so you're eager to move on to the next thing, but a lot of /other/ people aren't. You should keep in mind that the list of Stock Aesops is constantly changing: new ones are added when they've been used enough times to become common knowledge, and old ones that have been revealed to be flawed (e.g. bigoted) are removed. It just happens slowly.

There's an analogy that I often find useful, and that I've never seen anyone else use: humanity can be thought of as a group of people on a long journey together with pre-industrial-revolution technology. Some have put their heads together and built a kind of wagon, and now there are people riding in the wagon, others pushing it, others walking beside it, and still others trying to chop the axles in half because they don't want to go any further (despite the fact that local geography has been getting consistently nicer and nicer for as long as anyone can remember).

You (in the analogy) are bored of the terrain around here, and wish we would crest the next hill already. Or perhaps, you (IRL) are looking for a story whose main character /recognizes/ this trend in history, and is (in the analogy) running ahead to the top of that hill.
