The overarching thing you're talking about is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop][The Aesop]], and the ones that writers like to explore are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops][Stock Aesops]]. I don't believe that there's one specifically for what you're talking about - an Aesop that applies to well-adjusted people who don't have obvious faults.

I think I'd like a template for what you're talking about?

HPMOR is the ur-example of the genre/style, and Harry's not at all well-adjusted. He's deliberately (and obviously) flawed from the start of the story. Many of the lessons that he learns /are/ Stock Aesops, or refined versions of them. The closing thought of the book is basically "The Power of Friendship".

I think I understand what you're talking about - Bob is outwardly sane and normal, with no clear faults, and learns some Aesop that you wouldn't have seen coming which leads to character growth, but I can't recall ever seeing that.
