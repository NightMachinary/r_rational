  I think I'd like a template for what you're talking about?

A fictional equivalent for something that happens in real life: A reasonably well-adjusted sciency nerd, who knows about skepticism and tolerance and all that good stuff... discovers the Sequences on LessWrong, and goes "Oh."

Another description: A lot of stories with Aesops aim them at children, or at young adults, and the Stock Aesops they teach are ones that are useful for people of those stages of development to learn. I want to find stories with grad-school-level Aesops, lessons that you need to have already learned those earlier lessons to be able to work with.

A piece of fiction being rationalist seems like a necessary precondition for this 'next level', but I'm not sure if it's sufficient by itself.
