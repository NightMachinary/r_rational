It sounds like you're trying to imagine a story, /about/ a hypothetical, possibly archetypal story, that teaches a lesson that /humanity itself/ hasn't yet learned. Like some kind of "Virtual Aesop", wrt [[/u/alexanderwales]]' comment.

I /think/ I understand where you're going with this, or at least we're gesturing in the same general direction, but I'm not sure how much further it is possible (or worthwhile) to take the concept.
