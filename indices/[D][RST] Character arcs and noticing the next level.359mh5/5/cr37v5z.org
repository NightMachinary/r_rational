That would be cool but I don't know of any examples.

edit: Beware the Mary Sue. The Mary Sue isn't the same as a character with no flaws. A Mary Sue has flaws the author doesn't notice, usually arrogance. Tom Baker's Doctor Who was very arrogant, but the writers and the characters acknowledged this, so it was ok. James Bond is a perfect guy / power fantasy, so he's not a Mary Sue either. I'd name positive examples but I don't want to anger fans. I'm sure you've encountered them.
