If this unrelated I'll delete it and post it Friday. I was thinking about how to go from reading a book and taking notes to a wiki type format. At some point I started to think about a tagging system for an ebook. As you read something you tag relevant snippets to key words. Such as Location or technique/skill/spell. The tags could be further divided into description and, uses/events there.

Have y'all heard of a program that provides this function or a similar function while browsing a text?
