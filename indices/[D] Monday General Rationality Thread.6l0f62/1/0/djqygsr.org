Chess is kind of a silly way to measure general intelligence. After all, computers can play chess better than humans, and they don't have general intelligence (that we know of).

In practice, chess doesn't capture a major part of human vs human battles: deception. Chess has no real deception, the board is completely honest to both sides, both players can see every piece on the board and their locations. Which means things like reading the enemy, or skills to prevent yourself from being read? Not used in chess. (I mean, yes, you can hide your intentions for each move, but your intentions don't really mean anything. A skilled opponent would read the board for all possible ways for each move to benefit you, not just the ones you intended.)

So in real life, where most modern battles (even economic battles) rely on misinformation and subterfuge? Chess is a really poor choice for "leveling up" your strategy skills.
