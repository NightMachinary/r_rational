In LitRPGs, and some video games, Chess often features as a convenient way to level up intelligence or a strategy skill. [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][The Wandering Inn]] features this prominently and to good effect. However, I wonder how far the real life analogy goes? Do chessmasters tend to achieve more in science and mathematics as the result of their training? Do they become better entrepreneurs who can outmaneuver their opponents? Or is it just one of many niche skills of primarily entertainment value?
