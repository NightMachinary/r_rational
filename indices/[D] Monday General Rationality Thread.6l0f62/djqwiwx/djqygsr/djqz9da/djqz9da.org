Good point. While I doubt that chess improves intelligence or strategic skills, it's near certain that there will be notable differences in intellectual ability between people who are able and people who are /unable/ to play chess. It's easy to see how people could have historically mistaken cause and effect, believing that simply playing chess makes a significant impact in cognitive abilities.

More than anything else, I think the greatest potential for improvements in cognitive function would come from applied realistic multi-disciplinary problem-solving. That would guide learners towards generalized and real-world applicable problem-solving skills.
