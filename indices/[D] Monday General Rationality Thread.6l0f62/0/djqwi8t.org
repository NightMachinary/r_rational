In case anyone was eagerly awaiting the release of my rational vampire romance novel, although the first volume is 95% finished, I won't be posting it for several months at least.

My coauthor, who needs to sprinkle the last 5%'s worth of fairy dust on it, is swamped for time so she's not going to be able to do the final pass of editing for a while. And without that extra 5% I don't feel like the story is ready for general consumption.

Due to the spotlight effect, I have a completely unfounded impression that people are wondering what's taking so long for me to release the story that has been the subject of many a worldbuilding post, and that's putting a tiny mote of stress on me, so I'm going to "come clean" and that way I won't feel that tiny mote of stress.

If anyone was truly chomping at the bit to read my gay supernatural romance story and are willing to give feedback, feel free to PM me and I'll link you the 95%-complete first volume (approx 50k words).

In other news, I'm beginning to sketch out the second volume. I know how it begins and how it ends, but the getting there is going to be fun to work out.
