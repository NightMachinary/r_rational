Thanks, I only remember it being mentioned in passing (happens when I read too fast sometimes) and became extremely confused after it didn't go away. I started to wonder if I was the one who was losing it lol

On your OOC point, that's something I'd wondered about before even reading this rational take on the universe. The fact that people can not only become any other human, but can also turn into animals or inanimate objects blew my mind, especially given the original canon almost never uses this. They turn Naruto into a friggin shuriken for god's sake. Why not just have a coat full of ninja pebbles ready to burst forth into an army?! And so on.
