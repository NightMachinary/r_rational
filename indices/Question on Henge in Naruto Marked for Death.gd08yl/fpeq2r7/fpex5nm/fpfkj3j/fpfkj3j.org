Hm. Is there any reason why Henge couldn't just be some kind of Genjutsu technique without breaking the setting over its knees? Supplanting your place in everyone else's sensorium with a different object or person makes asymmetric ninja warfare even more broken (even if the technique isn't infallible), and it does away with the whole "throw Naruto like a shuriken" bit in canon, but I don't know if that's too aggressive an AU element when the universe is already getting retconned.
