I'm well past the return to Leaf. My question was whether the Akane/Tsunade interaction is ever (a) resolved onscreen, or (b) explained to the returning members of team uplift. I am binge reading late at night so I'm sure I've missed several crucial details but I didn't notice Hazo mention it to Tsunade in the hospital scene. Did Akane tell him about it?
