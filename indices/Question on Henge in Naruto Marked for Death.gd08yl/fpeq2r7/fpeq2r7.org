Obvious spoilers up to Ch 190ish:

Henge was done away with via sealing failure related phenomenon that Kagome terms a "shift" in-universe right after Event 4 of the Chunin Exams. You'll notice that people start talking about "disguise kits" henceforth. No one save Kagome remembers such shifts.

This phenomenon gets revisited in two future chapters as far as I recall, and there are multiple references in future chapters.

From an OOC perspective, Henge was probably a solid candidate for "the most broken thing to ever exist in setting" (and I say this while we're at Ch350ish and us players have all manner of horrifying toys to play around with). There is virtually no way to work it out without having your local physicist come by and give you a small migraine over how XYZ can be exploited to win the everything, while preserving all of its shown abilities. [[/u/eaglejarl]] can probably expand quite a bit, but thats my take on it.
