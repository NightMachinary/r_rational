  My question was whether the Akane/Tsunade interaction is ever (a) resolved onscreen

Not quite, as far as I remember. The implication is that she stopped short of punching her and instead was impressed enough by her guts and ability to stand up for something she believes in to take her on as a psuedo-apprentice. You can see Akane refers to Tsunade as "Tsunade-sensei" in certain spots and mentions taijutsu practice with her offhand (IIRC).
