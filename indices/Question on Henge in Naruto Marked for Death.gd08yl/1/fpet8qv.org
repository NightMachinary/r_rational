You're misattributing it. Kagome isn't responsible for Henge falling out of the setting, he's just the only character (so far) who remains aware of techniques/inventions/creatures after they've been 'eaten by the Grue'/fallen into The Out.

The losses aren't always permanent. Wind Country's Gliders were lost, for example, but Hazo isn't running into any memetic barriers in trying to create them from scratch.

Henge is gone for good, though. It vanished during the Chuunin Exams, and isn't coming back. It's just too broken to work without bending the rest of the setting around it.
