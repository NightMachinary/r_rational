I've replaced my lunch with Joylent. I had to stop it for a month or two because I couldn't afford the upfront cost, but I must say I'm missing it. It makes lunch a lot easier and faster. The main problem is that I often forget to make it the evening before, but my girlfriend helps me remember.

The taste is actually pretty decent, at least the vanilla. I miss it now that I don't have it.

I wouldn't go 100% on the stuff, as I enjoy eating occasionally, but I wouldn't mind replacing a couple more meals with it.
