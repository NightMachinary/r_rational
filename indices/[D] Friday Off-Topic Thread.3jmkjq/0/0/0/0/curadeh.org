You certainly can, it's just more effort for less food.

If you make a full bottle of Soylent, you pour in the whole bag of Soylent powder, pour in water, shake, pour in more water, shake, and you're done (you can also let it settle for a while, which helps mix it even more). This has the benefit of the Soylent being thoroughly mixed and in the proper ratio of powder to water (if you use the Soylent brand bottle, which you should).

Making just a cup of Soylent requires you to have a measuring device, measure out two units of water for every unit of powder (this makes it slightly more thick than the full bottle version), then stir. Stir a /lot/. Then stir some more, because it's still going to be clumpy, unless you can use some sort of miniature whisk. Then, ideally, you'd let it diffuse for an hour or two, then stir it again, and it would be good, but if you're making the effort to make a glass right then, you probably want it right then. It's a little frustrating, and more work than a "convenient future food" feels like it should be.
