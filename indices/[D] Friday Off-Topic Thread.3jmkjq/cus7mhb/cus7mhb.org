I have recently enjoyed some stories from Charles Stross' Laundry series, which puts Lovecraft, bureaucracy, spies, and information technology in a blender. Not rationalist or really rational, but still smart and fun. Start with 'Down on the Farm', available for free [[http://www.tor.com/2008/07/20/down-on-the-farm/][here]].
