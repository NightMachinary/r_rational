I'm reading a novel called /Wired/ (by Douglas Richards), and it's...horrible.

The antagonist is a woman. Every time she's introduced to a character, they have to comment (in dialogue or in narration) on her appearance in relationship to their willingness to have sex with her. This is pretty annoying.

The thing that's unusual about this book is, there's working intelligence augmentation. Absurd levels of it, in fact, far beyond what should be possible, plus the effect is temporary. (The author didn't do the research for pretty much any topic the book talks about.) But, as is explained in a four-page author rant, this intelligence augmentation is inextricably linked to increased selfishness, decreased concern about others, and an uncaring attitude toward social consequences. That author filibuster was overly cynical and had a lot of prose that smacks of the sort of person who hangs about in [[/r/atheism]]: people got smarter and more independent over time, so religion came in to stop us from killing each other, diminishing our effective intelligence.

Anyway. The antagonist can control herself well enough not to go on murder sprees as long as she stays in a sensory deprivation chamber while under the drug's effects, and that's with iteration #78, where the previous iterations are weaker in both psychological effects and intelligence augmentation. There is an obvious solution to the problem. Use the maximum safe level of augmentation to find another drug that will compensate for the lack of goodwill toward your fellow humans. Set up situations where you will be rewarded for helping others. Engender in yourself a sense of ownership toward the world so it's a point of pride to eradicate malaria, clean up the oceanic garbage patches, and ensure that everyone has clean drinking water.

Everything else in the story is wrong and annoyingly so, but this...it's just such a huge miss that I can't stand it, and the author seems heavily invested in the insuperability of the problem.
