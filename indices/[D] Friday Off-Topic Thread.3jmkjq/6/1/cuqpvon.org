Make an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile][aeolipile]]! Efficiency is going to be a problem, and you'll have to find a way to keep it topped off with the water that you're losing due to steam (because I think a condenser is probably one of those things that's beyond the tech level). I almost suggested using a decanter of endless water to fill up the tank, but if you've got one of those then you have easier ways of getting energy.

I have no idea how much torque you could get out of such a device, but that's my opening offer for someone else to beat.
