Now the skeleton power, this is a little more complex. Burning Skeletons do 1d6 points of fire damage to all adjacent creatures each round, comparing to the table for extreme heat conditions in 3.5's Sandstorm book that suggests the temperature in those squares to be about 90°C.

The amount of energy required to take air from room temperature to 90°C is Q. Q = mCΔT

m = (volume of 8+9+9 5' cubes which surround a medium creature in m^{3} is 92) 92x1.0755 (density of air between 20 and 100 degrees Celsius) = 99kg

C = 1 or thereabouts

ΔT = 70

Q = 70x99x1 = 6930J

please correct me if I have done something stupid but considering this only costs about 25gp I think the flaming skeletons beat out the decanter.
