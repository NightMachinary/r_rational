Ah, water power equations. Haven't used those in a while. Fun fact, you can make H=to whatever you damn well please, which makes V shoot up as well. Normally people didn't do this in the past because there was only a small difference in height in most streams, but you can just stick the decanter on top of a building/mountain/necromancer tower you cleared and attach a pipe to it. That gives you a head of 20-300m depending on local architecture and availability of cliffs.

Funny story, let the pipe fill all the way to the top the stick a nozzle on the bottom and you can get some impressive speed and power going. That's basically how hydroelectric damns work. The problem is using the energy when you don't have the tech to make or use electricity. I mean, it's just a magnet spinning fast in a coil of wire but you'd have to explain how your character knows that.
