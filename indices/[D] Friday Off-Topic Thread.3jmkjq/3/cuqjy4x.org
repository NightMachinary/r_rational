So, because I spent the month of August living by myself, I've actually spent the last few days worrying about

#+begin_quote
  The cost of living in Portugal?
#+end_quote

Now that I have a sort of planned end date for my Master's (assuming nothing goes wrong with my thesis), and by extension this allows me to plan a future date for financial and living independence from family members, I'm even more fearful about the next year's evolution of the local prices.

Specially because with the upcoming elections I'm seeing every political party in opposition to the current far-right, austerity measures being woefully incompetent, with the only hope of mine for a more rational opposition being personified by a 29-year old woman which seemingly up until now is the only rational and positive agent in a political system which thrives on meaningless catchphrases and outside support instead of proper results. Of course if she won we might suffer the same thing that happened to Syriza+Greece, and that is not an enjoyable perspective for the future.

On the other hand, I'm thinking about perhaps writing a small fanfic of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_%282015_animated_film%29][Home]] movie which at the same time plays it straight with the silly aliens and cars made which work on juice, but with a legitimate alien intelligence as the "occupiers".
