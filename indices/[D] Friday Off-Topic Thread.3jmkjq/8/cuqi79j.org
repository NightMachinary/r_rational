Fear the Walking Dead. I understand that they have no concept of zombies in their universe, fine. I understand that it's more of a soap opera than a survival guide, that's also fine. Why can't we get the perspective of a person who is more competent? Not a doomsday prepper, but say, someone that perhaps witnesses an attack, doesn't immediately launch into head-in-the-sand mode, and is like "holy shit, that just happened, this PLAGUE spells doom, I have no contingencies for a situation like this, I need to get moving RIGHT NOW"

That would be greeeeeaaaaaattttttt.
