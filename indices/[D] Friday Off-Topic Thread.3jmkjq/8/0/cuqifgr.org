I have two main problems with zombies as they normally are presented in fiction.

1. Zombies don't run farms. Given their hyperviolence they're going to starve to death in two weeks, max. A zombie virus could certainly end civilization in a few connected continents, but humanity will survive unless someone is intentionally infecting people on every major continent or the virus has a long gestation period.

2. Zombies are predisposed to violence so they're going to be twice as likely to fight each other as uninfected humans. This is the point they never bother explaining and I have a hard time suspending disbelief on this.
