I recommend Sanderson's work specifically The Stormlight Archives (warning 2/3 books released) and Warbreaker and Elantris. If you google Sanderson's comments on the importance of limiting or outlining the magic system you'll see why.

Rothfus'es Kingkiller chronicles are probably the most rational, rationalist fantasy novel I've read. It trumps Mistborn by a lot, though fair warning (also warning 2/3 published) if you don't want to read them twice+ [[#s][something you'll eventually figure out about the narrator]]
