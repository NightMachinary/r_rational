So this is a random interesting thing I'm just going to tag along on...

I've got the outlines of a setting bouncing around in the back of my head. High-fantasy space-faring, originally whipped up to be an RPG setting. One of the things it's got is an elemental magic system.

Now when you've go got an elemental magic system you've got to have them interact with each outer. One thing I feel like I see a lot is the "Pok√©mon maneuver" - when your electric user and your water user blast the same thing at the same time, breaking down water into component matter, and then a fire user chips in and gets a much bigger fireball than normal for that much power expenditure. I specifically don't want that in this setting (it's got interplanetary islands and magic and no humans, after all), but then I'm not sure what to do.

I like the setting, and I would be down with fiction being written/writing fiction in it, so I thought about making a main post here. But I'm not sure if anything I wrote would be "rational"/"rationalist".

So if anyone's got ideas or thinks they can help probe, that'd be awesome. Or I can also share more of asked.
