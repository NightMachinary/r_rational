Brandon Sanderson's stuff in general is good; he knows his magic systems.

/The Merchant Princes/ series by Charles Stross has a pretty dead-simple magic system, but the emergent social/economic stuff might be up your alley (this series often gets mixed reviews; if at all possible, get the reissue that shrinks it from six short books into three fat ones).

/The Powder Mage/ trilogy by Brian McClellan also has interesting magic systems, though one of the primary ones is of the "ineffable workings" variety (though it still works). McClellan was a student of Sanderson's and the influence is pretty obvious.
