I've been reading a bit about US history with the Sioux Nation.

The US government signed a treaty with the Sioux Nation (the Treaty at Fort Laramie of 1851) establishing that the Black Hills were theirs and paying $50,000 per year for 50 years for limited land use rights. The US violated this treaty, ceasing payments after ten years. Several years after the US broke their treaty, the Sioux opened hostilities (because the US was still using their land, which had no legal basis any longer thanks to non-payment).

This second treaty (the Treaty at Fort Laramie of 1868) guaranteed certain lands to the Sioux Nation, and additionally specified that the US government would ensure that the relevant groups would have at least 160 acres of farmland per person. Additionally, they were allowed to hunt outside their sovereign territory. We should have stuck with the original treaty, but if we couldn't do that, this was at least halfway decent.

But then the US discovered gold in the Black Hills and forced the people living there to move, using the military. Thus they violated their second treaty. This didn't break into open warfare for several years, though, when the US military attacked in Montana, which had been promised to First Nations people for their exclusive use.

Unfortunately, might makes right, or if not right, then at least a large measure of control over what happens. The Sioux were dependent on imported food, so the US threatened to cut off supplies until they agreed to a new treaty. Since the land had already been surveyed and prospected, this new treaty was able to restrict them to unprofitable lands. The treaty claims that the ceded territories were purchased, but there's no record of a proper, legal exchange. The US Supreme Court has ruled that the treaty was illegal, and the US has paid for the land, but the Sioux are attempting to refuse the transaction. If successful (a prospect that has approximately a whelk's chance in a supernova), several hundred thousand white people would be faced with a choice of moving or living under a Sioux government, and the Sioux would have to choose whether to grant them citizenship. I would like to see this, mostly because it's largely the right thing to do and partly because I like seeing more nations on the map. (Still waiting for Styria to declare independence. Or at least Cornwall.)

The original treaty covered about 40% of South Dakota.
