Why does the post have so few upvotes? By my count, a dozen people have commented, but only four of them have given upvotes to AutoModerator's post. Is there some reason for which you're so stingy with your upvotes?

(I'm reasonably sure that the "vote-fuzzing" kicks in only at much higher numbers.)
