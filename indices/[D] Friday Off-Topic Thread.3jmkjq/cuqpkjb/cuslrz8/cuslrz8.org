I've mostly been treating reddit as a big forum so maybe i am missing something because of it, but is there any particular point to upvoting other than increasing the visibility in situations where lots of content exist?

If so why would it be needed to upvote these posts particularly seeing as the number of posts in general, and votes for those posts in particular is so low?

Also this is an offtopic thread, nothing to bad, but not something particularly valuable(i.e. you will want people looking at the top topics in a few months\years to find it).
