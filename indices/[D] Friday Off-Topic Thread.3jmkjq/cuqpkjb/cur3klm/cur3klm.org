No point in upvoting automoderator posts. This subreddit moves slowly enough that any new post will end up in the top 5, and it's likely that most regular readers will see every post no matter how few upvotes it has, so the normal function of upvotes as "bringing good content to the front page" doesn't work.

I upvote posts to make their author feel rewarded.
