MealSquares are fine, but very chalky and bland. Imagine a boring breakfast muffin that someone tried to make with the consistency of a scone but accidentally used wood dust instead of butter. Because they're aggressively boring, they're not actually BAD, just supremely not-pleasing to eat.

Very dense, but otherwise would make an acceptable breakfast food to eat with a cup of coffee or something. I couldn't imagine eating these more than once per day. As it is, I only eat them rarely.
