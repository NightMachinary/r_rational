Having tried MealSquares and Soylent for Months and Weeks respectively, here are my thoughts:

- Soylent, for all its ease, still takes too much time and energy to make and clean up afterwards. It also goes bad in one or two days after you make it, so uneaten soylent is a problem, and I found myself not finishing a full bottle more often than not. Soylent is addressing these issues with a pre-made, disposable bottle version (which is slightly more expensive).
- Related to the above point, I find that Soylent works better as a a small supplement to your daily food (15-20%) rather than a food replacement. It is also significantly better with some sort of sweetener. This combination makes it more like a milkshake you have once a day, rather than bland goop you have all day, or replacing all your food with milkshakes *shudder*.
- When I tried MealSquares, they were too dry, and neither savory, nor sweet enough. And, unlike with Soylent, I couldn't easily add more water or sweetener. They're palatable with some sort of sweet beverage, such as tea or soda, but I feel like they are also best used sparingly, like a replacement for a breakfast muffin, rather than replacing food entirely.
