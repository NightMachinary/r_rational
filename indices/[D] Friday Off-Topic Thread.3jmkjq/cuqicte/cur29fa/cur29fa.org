I got an order of Joylent, which is the danish equivalent. It was pretty good. Then me and a friend made a home made version which we called Super Drink. It was also pretty good. Not amazing, not terrible. Cheap though, because it is primarily oats and protein powder. After a while you can develop a taste/craving for them, which I assume is my body craving whichever vitamins/minerals I'm missing which it provides.

I tend to drink them late at night, at times when I can't be bothered to cook or when I'm in a rush and going to the climbing gym. I have always had a hard time gaining weight and I credit a decent amount of my recent 4-5 kg increase to being able to drink soylent late at night when I would otherwise not bother eating.

As a dedicated cook who enjoys trying new things it would never replace everything or even most things, but it is certainly a good alternative for when I can't be fucked to cook and would just eat freezer pizza normally.
