Are there any books that explore the consequences of widespread prediction markets?

Scott Alexander touched on them a little in the description of his conworld [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/08/raikoth-corruption-priesthood/][Raikoth]], but I'd love to read something some near-term speculative fiction set in a society that implemented e.g. Robin Hanson's [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Futarchy][Futarchy]].

Seen anything like that?
