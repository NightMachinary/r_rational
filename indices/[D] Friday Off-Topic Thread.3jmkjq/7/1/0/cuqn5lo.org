There are a lot of ways to do elemental magic. The rock/paper/scissors approach is pretty standard, but there's nothing that says you have to go with that. What you have to ask is what you want out of the magic system; how do you want people to use it and how do you want it to impact the world. Personally, I start with some basics and then work my way forward, so that if there /is/ a cool maneuver that you can do with some combination of things, it comes more naturally as a result of what you've established about how these things work.

I would personally suggest posting to [[/r/magicbuilding]] instead of [[/r/rational]], since they're experts in the subject of magic systems. [[/r/rational]] most often tends to try to break things that are presented to them.
