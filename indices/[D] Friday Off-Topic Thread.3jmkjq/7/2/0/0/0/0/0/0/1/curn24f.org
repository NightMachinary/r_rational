I don't know how I would count the extra Mistborn books in this context. He still has the same plan for the three Mistborn Trilogies (original, medium future, further future), and "accidentally" wrote 2/3 of the Wax and Wayne books while working on other stuff. He only had a plan for writing the second book.

Also, I think Mistborn is up to 13 now. 3 originals (Final Empire, Well of Ascension, Hero of Ages), + 4 Wax and Wayne (Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, Bands of Mourning, The Last Metal), + 3 1940's/1980's trilogy, + 3 space trilogy.
