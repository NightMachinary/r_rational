I don't know, way too many of Trek stories are "Crew encounters a god-like entity that has no rules." I've been slowly watching all of TOS and they do that way too often. I mean, if you give them warp drives it's still just an ungrounded series. DS9 did "grounded" the best, if you just grant them their assumptions.

But for all I know the books (etc) are all well done.
