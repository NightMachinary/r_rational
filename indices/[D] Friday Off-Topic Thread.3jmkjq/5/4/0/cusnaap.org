  Is there any particular point to upvoting other than increasing the visibility in situations where lots of content exist?

No, that's really the only function of upvotes ("karma"). However, if a person's personal Reddit front page is filled with a zillion different submissions (most of them from subreddits other than this one), a post from this subreddit may need some extra upvotes to appear on that person's personal Reddit front page--especially if he hasn't activated the "Don't show me links that I've upvoted/downvoted" option.
