  I'm not sure how you could be unaware of it. By "personal Reddit front page", I mean "the page that you see when you go to Reddit while signed in to your Reddit account".

Well, as i said i use reddit as a bunch of seperate forums which just happen to share a notifications\msgs inbox. i.e. when i visit reddit I go to a specific subreddit, mostly [[/r/rational]] to be honest, and look around.

  In any event, I don't claim to know exactly how a Reddit user's personal front page works. I do, however, think that it adjusts for the size of each subreddit--in my own front page, for example, I sometimes see posts with zero upvotes from small subreddits such as [[/r/NarutoFanfiction][r/NarutoFanfiction]] or [[/r/GamesNews][r/GamesNews]]--so I guess the number of upvotes given to a post in a small subreddit doesn't matter quite as much.

from your description it sounds like it probably doesnt matter so much what is the absolute number of upvotes so much as the relative number or somesuch algo. in any case having more votes will probably get adjusted after a while so no point to particularly try and upvote more as it just means that at the worse case when you stop the visibility will go down for a while..
