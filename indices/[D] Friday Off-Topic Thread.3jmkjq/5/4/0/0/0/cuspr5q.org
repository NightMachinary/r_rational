  Hmm wasn't aware of that usecase

I'm not sure how you could be unaware of it. By "personal Reddit front page", I mean "the page that you see when you go to [[http://www.reddit.com][Reddit]] while signed in to your Reddit account".

In any event, I don't claim to know exactly how a Reddit user's personal front page works. I do, however, think that it adjusts for the size of each subreddit--in my own front page, for example, I sometimes see posts with /zero/ upvotes from small subreddits such as [[/r/NarutoFanfiction][r/NarutoFanfiction]] or [[/r/GamesNews][r/GamesNews]]--so I guess the number of upvotes given to a post in a small subreddit doesn't matter /quite/ as much.
