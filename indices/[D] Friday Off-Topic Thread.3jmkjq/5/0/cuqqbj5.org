People don't vote. This is endemic to reddit. The reason for it is that voting takes both effort and attention, which people have been trained not to spare. We have ~3,500 readers on this subreddit and the most upvoted thing of all time has ~160 upvotes.

So it's not necessarily that people are stingy with their upvotes, it's that they just don't think about voting too much. Part of this is that voting up or down has very little personal utility. It's something you're doing for other people, not for yourself. This is especially true for AutoModerator, since the upvotes don't do her any good, so it's not like you're giving a reward, which is how some people think of it.

And yes, vote fuzzing doesn't kick in until much later. Soft-capping is the other factor, and that doesn't kick in until the mid thousands.
