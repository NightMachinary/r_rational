I've just finished reading /Jam/ by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw. (The author also does a series of web videos called /Zero Punctuation/, you may have heard of him from there.)

It's a black comedy about a jam apocalypse, which is superficially similar to a zombie apocalypse except with man-eating jam instead of zombies. The joke is that nobody is prepared for the apocalypse and what groups of survivors remain are making it up as they go along. This includes the genre-savvy everyman who has always dreamed of being a world hero, the survivalists, the pragmatists, the hipsters, the organisation that works on existential risk, and a variety of groups who think they're the sole remaining bastion of civilisation. The characters are definitely not rational - 99% of everyone they know is dead, and the remainder is quite understandably going mad if they weren't already.

I think it's quite a funny deconstruction of rational fiction.
