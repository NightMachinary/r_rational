I almost think that [[http://kayin.moe/iwbtg/][I Wanna Be The Guy]] fits. It farts in the face of conventional game design philosophy, the graphics are terrible, the story (to the extent there is one) is incoherent, the only way to tell what's going to happen in most levels is rote memorization, it's tough as balls ... yet people still like it and feel compelled to play it.
