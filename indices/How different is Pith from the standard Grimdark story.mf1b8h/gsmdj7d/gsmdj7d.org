It's a dark story, but I think a key thing that differentiates it from Worm is that Pith doesn't escalate by pulling new threats out of nowhere. There's no Endbringer or S9 equivalent where something comes entirely out of left field to make things worse for everyone. Not to say that things never get worse, but all the key players and pieces are generally visible (to some degree) from the outset, so it's usually not a big surprise when the situation deteriorates.

That's true of the first volume anyway, the second volume seems to be throwing in some mystery elements and cryptic threats so I don't know where things are going there.
