It doesn't get much better from the part you left off at (boat party). I dropped worm and I ended up dropping pith too. The problem I have with both of them is that the heroes progress extremely slowly, and keep getting into fights they barely manage to survive.

For some I'm sure this is fine but after a while it got kind of depressing for me.
