I haven't read worm, so I can't compare the two. I assume that the protagonists will win in the end or at the end of each book. However, it's a faint light at the end of a long dark tunnel.

I found the first book of pith to be a real slog to get through. So much misery. And not just the protagonists. Every villain and side character also gets horribly traumatized along the way. There are multiple chapters in a concentration camp, for example, as backstory. Fun stuff.
