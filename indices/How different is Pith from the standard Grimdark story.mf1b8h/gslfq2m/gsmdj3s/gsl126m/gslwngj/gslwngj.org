Its definitely grim but its not like it completely lacks hope. None of the grimness felt undeserved given the setting to me. The resource restrictions, recent wars and concentration of power (magical or political); all create a world filled with both deep societal problems and personal trauma on a massive scale. Yet despite this you can still see that there exists good people and that characters are improving themselves on an individual scale. Maybe less so for the older characters, but another big theme of Pith is the long lasting effects of war on people. Personally i think it does a brilliant job of contrasting the standard fantasy school trope of sending kids into conflict and expecting them to come out of it better humans than they went in.

To summarise, most of everything is messed up - as it should be given the background - but there's still good people in the world, who can hopefully enact positive change.

That said i'd say its worse than worm in terms of depressing content.
