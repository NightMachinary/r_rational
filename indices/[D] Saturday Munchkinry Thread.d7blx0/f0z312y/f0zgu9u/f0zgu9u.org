  A sword that becomes heavier when most convenient
#+end_quote

Sounds like the sword that the main character uses in Gene Wolfe's /Book of the New Sun/ series, which has a hollow channel in the middle in which a blob of mercury runs, so that the blade's balance shifts in a way that facilitates beheadings. "When most convenient" would facilitate most downward cut attacks, and also would act as a Mjolnir-style guard against theft.
