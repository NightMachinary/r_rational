Wait and hide. If not possible or if that's too boring than search and rescue in forests, mountains, oceans, deserts. Basically anywhere where they'll have a good chance of spotting someone coming after them but still being able to do some good through helping lost people.

Though I really think that if their presence may attract someone that's hunting them and that has the power to create berserk monsters, they'll do more good waiting out the butterfly wings instead of endangering lives while not having a superpowered way of fighting.

The scale dust seems really good though. Fly over the powered hunter and kill them like that or if killing is against their morals or against the super community's written or unwritten rules... do the wings come with pokemon powers? As in stun spore and sleep spore? Or are they normal giant butterfly wings?

Stun spore and sleep powder would be real useful. Maybe gust, air slash and whirlwind too.
