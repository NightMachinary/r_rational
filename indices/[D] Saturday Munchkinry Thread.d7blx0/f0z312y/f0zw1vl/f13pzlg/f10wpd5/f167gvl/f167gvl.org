Wizard lv 17 Sorcerer lv 3. Use Heighten Spell metamagic, cast Feeblemind on BBG. Use Etherealness to get in close and escape with multiple casts of Fly, Polymorph and Invisibility. Rinse and repeat until Feeblemind takes hold.

Before hand figure out the BBG plan (or just ask them) possibly join them for the lols.
