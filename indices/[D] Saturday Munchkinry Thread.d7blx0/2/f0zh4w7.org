My superhero has butterfly wings, scaled up to maintain the same body-to-wing ratio a butterfly has, and are strong enough to lift himself and one passenger, but are fragile. He's used to powers that lend themselves to melee. What can he do with the wings besides flutter gently? (He's already taking on a worrisome penchant for skydiving).
