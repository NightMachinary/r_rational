#+begin_quote
  Besides providing the primary function of flight, wings also have secondary functions of self-defense, camouflage, and thermoregulation.

Wings powerful enough to lift a human are probably stronger than any kick or punch that humans can create.

Wings have some camouflage abilities that probably don't scale up easily. But if you get fuzzy with the rules you could still give him some camouflage.

Thermoregulation, means that maybe your superhero could handle hot temperatures better than most. Maybe some weapon or skill that heats up his whole body.

Some species of moth (related to butterflies) have the ability to produce sounds from their wings to fool bats. Your superhero could have some kind of sonic blast.
