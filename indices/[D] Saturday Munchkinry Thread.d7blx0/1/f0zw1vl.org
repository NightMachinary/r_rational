- How would you fight a Big Bad who can take possession of large crowds of people? Possessed people are easily identifiable by their glowing eyes. You have access to a portable mind shielding device which creates an anti possession sphere with a 120' radius and are able to temporarily inoculate small numbers of people against his influence. You are in 5e Forgotten Realms setting and have a motivated population willing to help high level adventurers to deal with this existential threat.
