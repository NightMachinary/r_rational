I've been writing some post-apocalypse fantasy recently. My explanation for technology not being widely redeveloped is as follows:

1. Bunch of nukes detonate in upper atmosphere, basically EMP striking the entire planet.
2. Rogue AI is blamed for nuke strikes so everyone that lives has an inherent mistrust of existing computer technology thinking it might be infected with rogue AI.
3. The Sun starts acting up, so solar storms also EMP the planet every decade or so.
4. This happens a couple decades from now, so many devices that can be run mechanically, use a lot internal electronics anyways to run more efficiently. This makes reverse engineering existing technology much more difficult then it would be today (like the difference between reverse engineering Grahm Bell's phone vs a landline phone vs a modern cell phone).

I'd be interested to see some people poke holes in this explanation, or let me know how long they think it would take before we get back to our modern level of technology.
