Also, I've been ignoring Sideways in Hyperspace whenever it pops up for...reasons that I'm not entirely sure about. I've read your synopsis now on wordpress, and I'm wondering what aliens are like in your story (I tend to read stories more for the world than for the plot). Could I get the lowdown on aliens and the setting in general? Thanks.
