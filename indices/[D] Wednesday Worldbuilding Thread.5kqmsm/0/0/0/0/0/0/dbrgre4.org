Okay, Mysterious Memories encoded by Mysterious Means, fair enough.

Next question. How do they relate to each other? Jim knows (or should know) that he can learn everything Bob knows if he eats Bob.

Or alternatively, Bob may trade Jim a cluster of his pre-education children so that Jim can learn a new skill be eating them (perhaps in exchange for some of Jim's pre-sentient children). If they're fairly new at the whole business of meeting other cultures, they might even offer the humans some of their children to eat in an attempt to teach the humans their language... actually, considering how slow to learn they are, they might do that anyway.

And then there's the question of mutation. These genetic memories must occasionally - slowly - mutate. (Sufficiently redundant genetic encodings can slow the rate of change, but not eliminate it entirely). So, have these skills developed small... /changes/ over time? Does the coffee-making alien now add 2% more water than his ancestors did? Does the Piloting alien do a ritual tap-dance before taking his seat every morning?
