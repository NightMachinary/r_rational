There's only so much I can say without potentially spoiling the plot for others, but here's a bit.

Like the Synopsis said, it's 2219, and humanity invented warp drive 20 years ago. Aside from that warp drive, the setting is a fairly hard sci-fi. There are no teleporters, internal dampeners, artificial gravity, or energy shields. 'True' artificial intelligence is very hard, and whole brain emulation has remained 'several decades away' for the last two hundred years. Death is alive and well, and though biological age can be reversed with access to anti-senescenics, those drugs remain out of economic reach of much of the human race. Cryogenics remains popular, with many people opting to just skip forward past the current few hundred years. Earth, Mars, and the alliance of gas giant worlds known as the Tartarus Accords, have been locked in a three-way cold war since the end of their last hot war a century ago. They all have unnecessarily powerful weapons of mass destruction pointed at each other, held in a MAD equilibrium and just now starting to step back from the arms race following the discovery of warp drive and access to the resources that entailed. It's not a perfect world, it's ragged and gritty on the edges, but its still moving in the right direction. Cancer is pretty much gone, anti-virals have come a long way, and a whole list of diseases have been eradicated.

The aliens...a lot of details about them are relevant to the plot. There's one race I'm willing to talk about, since much of the information regarding them has already been published, or will be soon. The alien race that calls themselves The Ones That Came Before are eight-limbed, radially symmetrical, quadrupeds. They have four lower limbs offset 45 degrees from four slightly longer upper limbs. Their limbs are 'feathered' and come in a variety of colors, each one terminating in a set of clawed, four-fingered digits. They have eight eyes, two every 90 degrees, set one above the other, and a beaklike mouth on the top of their head. They're capable of gliding and limited flight in the atmosphere of their homeworld. They don't have a nervous system, instead, all their memories encode directly into their equivalent of DNA, and not every individual has the same set of genetic memories. They utilize r-pattern selection and have 3-500 children in a litter, which then cannibalize each other until they've gained enough body mass (and thus genetic material) to gain a theory of mind along with the skills for whatever task they are born into. They don't actually learn, they can take in information, but can't really learn from it. They can't encode from working memory into structural genetic memory, they only learn by cannibalizing one of their own and gaining their genetic memories. Each individual is capable of very limited experiential learning, and they can't take in abstract or higher order concepts this way. They wear clothes, have 40-60 year lifespans, and eat their dead. They also travel around the galaxy picking up sentient races for their ark ships, because you really don't want to be here when /those other aliens/ show up.
