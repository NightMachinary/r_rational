I finally decided to sit down and start plotting out the outline on Sideways in Hyperspace on paper, so I wasn't just writing from my memory, and holy hell did that throw up a lot of problems pretty much immediately.

1) (mostly unrelated and mostly solved) I downloaded Space Engine so I could get a good 3d view on where stars are wrt each other in the galaxy, and immediately realized I had put the entire Hyades Cluster on the wrong side of the sky. The problem was I used [[http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/250lys.html][this map]] of space, which makes it look like the Hyades is in front of the Earth wrt the center of the galaxy...nope, it's in fact in almost the exact opposite direction. I came up with a way around it wrt the plot, but it was incredibly grating to realize the error.

2) I'm stuck at this point in the plot where I'm not sure how two governments in a state of cold war and distrust with each other would act in this situation, and its hard to even discuss it without revealing massive spoilers.
