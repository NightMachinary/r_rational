... I just [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][wrote]] a few lines of story about how the existence of '[[/u/EliezerYudkowsky/][Big Yud]]', living in the San Francisco area 20 years from now, has meant that a particular group of plotters have had to step up the quality of their scheming, to /really/ take into account the possibilities of existential risks. This is entirely relevant to the plot, but as entertaining as including the memetic-Mary-Sue version of said individual might be on one level, I don't actually want to have a memetic Mary Sue.

Anyone have any thoughts on how to include something close to the idea of a character who could "have us arrested with a single phone call if our plans measurably increased existential risk, and who just might be able to make better guesses about our future plans than we can", without going over the top? Would simply anonymizing the character instead of naming them after a living individual be enough, or should I throw in more background explanation about what said figure has done to warrant such caution, or take some other approach?

(Current solution: Since the point is to offer a bit of a rationalist lesson, simply lampshade the whole thing, ala "... even if Big Yud himself doesn't live up to the hype, it's an incredibly safe bet to assume that there is someone out there at least as qualified as the memetic-badass version of Big Yud is supposed to be, so we might as well make our plans around him the way some people make survival plans for a zombie apocalypse they know is never going to happen.")
