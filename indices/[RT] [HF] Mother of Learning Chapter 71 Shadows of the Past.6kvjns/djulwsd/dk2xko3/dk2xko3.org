Despite the author saying each arc would be roughly the same in length, I don't believe that will be the case for the third arc unless some of the recent spoils of the adventure prove to be extremely useful.

If you want to wait until it's finished, I'd check in after a year, though I'd wager a year and a half and maybe even two years may be more accurate.
