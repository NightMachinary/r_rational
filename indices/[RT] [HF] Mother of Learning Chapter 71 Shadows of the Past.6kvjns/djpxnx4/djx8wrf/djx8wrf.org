#+begin_quote
  Regardless, he was back and could devote other matters.
#+end_quote

devote other -> devote time to other

#+begin_quote
  No, he had to spend months going thought that hellish soul awareness training...
#+end_quote

thought -> through

Not a typo, but noticeably awkward phrasing in Daimen's dialog (IMO). Consider revising if it isn't supposed to be in character:

#+begin_quote
  "... I'm not entirely sure, but I think she was actually scared of me a little. ..."
#+end_quote

actually scared of me a little -> actually scared of me. | actually a little scared of me. | actually a little frightened of me. | etc.
