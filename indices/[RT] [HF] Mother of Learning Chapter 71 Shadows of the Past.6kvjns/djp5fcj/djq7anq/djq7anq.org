All the chapters are good but yeah I did appreciate there being fewer typos and stuff actually happening and characters developing. Some chapters are consumed by huge battles which don't actually progress the story much because even if something is learned after, obviously most of the results of the actual battle don't carry over to the next chapter. Zorian's relationships with those around him leave an effect on him so it's something that's permanent.
