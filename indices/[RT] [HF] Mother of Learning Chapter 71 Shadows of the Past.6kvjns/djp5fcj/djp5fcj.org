This was the smoothest chapter of the last several. The fewest amount of typos, the prose felt good, the characters were more alive, the tensions were believable. I'm not sure what changed, but I really enjoyed the overall quality of this chapter a lot more than a few previous ones. Is this just me?

If it isn't, what's the reason? Wasn't this chapter delayed a week? Maybe [[/u/nobody103]] should take the extra week of editing more often. Anyway, whatever it was, I hope it continues!
