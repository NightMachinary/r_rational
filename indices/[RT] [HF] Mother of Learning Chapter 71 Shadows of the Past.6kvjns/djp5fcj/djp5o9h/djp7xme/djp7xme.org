Besides the focus on character interaction, it was... oddly nostalgic.

We have Daimen finally meeting his family, having some uncomfortable truths revealed about him, and Zorian admitting that he was wrong about him.

We have Taiven finally returning, and kind of restarting their friendship, resolving old issues between them.

I'd say it was a somewhat special chapter, as it went back in more ways than one.
