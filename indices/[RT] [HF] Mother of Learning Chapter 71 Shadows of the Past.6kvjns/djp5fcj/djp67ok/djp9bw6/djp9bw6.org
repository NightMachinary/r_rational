Huh, I've actually been liking his way of describing fight scenes, so far.

In many other stories I often find myself criticising the style in which fights are being described --- as well as the actual events themselves happening during the fights. Here, the underlying magical system feels well-balanced for powering fight scenes, and the actions [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry][(or inactions)]] of the combatants aren't deliberately made stupid for the sake of plot-railroading, etc.

If you know any stories that manage to present even better fights than MoL does, can you please drop them as recommendations? I really like myself some good fight scenes. ._.
