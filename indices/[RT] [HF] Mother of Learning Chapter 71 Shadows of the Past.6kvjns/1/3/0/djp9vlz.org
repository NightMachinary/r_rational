I mean, I don't think Zorian cares. His expectations for his family is pretty much non-existent. In his mind, Fortov's actions are just confirming Zorian's mental image of him. A crappy mage with his only skill being his ability to socialize. Who has suffered living in Damien's shadow as much or more than Zorian. His hostile response probably made sense in Zorian's mind and he felt no need to pursue it. Zorian doesn't even check to make sure Fortov survives the invasion night, why would he care to check on his mental stability.
