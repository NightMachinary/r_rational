That's a very good point. What I rather mean, however, is that his personality seems consistent. We've seen him act kind of pouty, both in front of Orissa and other Kothans (?) as well as alone with Zorian. If that was an emotional change of vector, I feel she'd have reacted differently and Zorian would have picked up on it.
