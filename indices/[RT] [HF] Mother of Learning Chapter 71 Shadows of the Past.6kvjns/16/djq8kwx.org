  He kind of felt bad for his simulacrum, who would be stuck with them *for the next several days.* Oh well, at least he had Kirma and Torun to talk to - those two were fairly interesting and he suspected he might be able to broker some kind of trade with at least one of them.

No no no! Bad Zorian! Don't leave your simulacrum running for several times longer than advised, and definitely not in a location where it's going to be bored silly and will likely get up to no good!

I seriously keep waiting for this simulacrum situation to blow up somehow...
