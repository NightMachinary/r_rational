Unlikely, for the same reasons as mentioned repeatedly in the story. Zach never experienced a premature restart ending without his death before the early invasion (bar a few occasions where being assassinated is equally likely but unconfirmed), and he has a more complete version of the marker than Zorian has. If Red Robe had the same kind of marker, he could have easily tracked both Zorian and Zach with a similar ritual as the one Zorian learned from Alanic, and he could have immediately confirmed that there was just one new time traveler, and not the dozens of members of the Aranea colony. There would also have been essentially no reason to keep Zach as intact and free as he was, or to even include him in the time loop at all, if he wasn't related. And why would the Noveda hold an Imperial artifact like the Sovereign Gate in their treasury in the first place, if they weren't from the lineage of the First Emperor?

The most likely scenario is the stated one. Zach is the original time traveler, who eventually encountered Red Robe. Red Robe found a way to tag along, and pressed Zach for all the information he knew about the time loop. Red Robe then removed Zach's memory of the early restarts, of all time loop-related information, as well as of any encounters he may have had with Red Robe, and placed sanctions on his mind to distract him from thinking certain things.

Zach would have never been involved in the time loop if he weren't the original time traveler. And the reason the Imperial artifacts respond to him better than Zorian is probably because Zach's lineage traces directly to the First Emperor, which would also explain why he was the one chosen for the time loop.
