One thing we still don't know a ton about is Soul Sight. Remember in Ch46 when Zorian first invaded the Sudomir's northern mansion? When he reached in to flip his marker's reset switch Sudomir /saw him do it/ and asked what he was doing.

Given Red Robe's Soul Kill ability it's extremely likely that he also has Soul Sight. If his ability is strong enough, he may have been able to just /see/ Zach's marker and learn enough from that to be able to join the loop.
