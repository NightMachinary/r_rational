I always found that bit interesting as well, but I'm pretty sure how RR guessed the start of Zorian's inclusion into the loops. Remember how Zach was missing completely in loops 2-8? We've never had an explanation for that, so the only real options I've come up with are either (1) a mechanism of the Marker/Gate to isolate and protect the Controller after suffering soul damage or (2) someone was hiding Zach away, possibly even preventing him from waking up earlier.

Also, RR's "soulkill" ability shouldn't be taken as proof as his prowess with soul magic/as a necromancer, since that was a loop-specific altering spell. On the other hand, his ability to create an apparent simulacra can be taken as evidence to his abilities, and his statement about soul sight (although RR may have been lying and located Zorian through other means.).
