True. But with a google spreadsheet, I can:

1. Automate the copying and extraction of the HTML.
2. Put it in the cloud, which means it's easily searchable from my phone, which is where I usually use reddit.
3. Write formulas to bring together in one place all paragraphs containing the search term. MoL is a large document, so going all around it is more difficult than a document containing containing every paragraph with the word "father", for example.
