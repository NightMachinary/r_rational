But we know that Fortov's pretty terrible at alchemy, and blood magic is rare enough that it's also very unlikely. Rituals are a possibility though, I guess. Doubt it, but it's possible. Also possible that Fortov has similar expertise in alchemy to Zach's, being an expert in a few specific areas but lacking general knowledge and expertise.
