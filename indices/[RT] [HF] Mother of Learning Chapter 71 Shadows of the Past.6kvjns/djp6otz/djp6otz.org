Anyone else really want to know what's up with Fortov now? There's almost certainly something up.

Shot-in-the-dark hypothesis: He's trying to use rituals/potions/blood magic to make himself less of a failure of a mage, causing bouts of rage as a side effect. This resulted in his anger at Daimen (or maybe he interrupted a ritual) and the pushing of whatshername.
