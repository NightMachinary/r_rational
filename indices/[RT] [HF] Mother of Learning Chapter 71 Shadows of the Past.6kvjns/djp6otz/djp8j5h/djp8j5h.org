I feel like there was a minor case of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills][PoorCommunicationKills]] in this chapter in Fortov's regard.

I mean, sure, it's completely in-character for Zorian to not have a slightest clue about Fortov's reaction, but wouldn't he at least ask Damien to describe Fortov's behaviour (the specific things Fortov has said, etc) a bit more?
