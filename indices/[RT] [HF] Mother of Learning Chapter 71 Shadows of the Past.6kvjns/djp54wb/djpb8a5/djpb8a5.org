  Honestly I love these chapters with minimal plot progression, it means that we are only inching towards the end, and while the wait is harrowing, I will not complain about more Mother of Learning.

It's such an incredibly rare thing when that happens. The only other story I remember feeling that for was Spice and Wolf.

It'll be so very bittersweet when MoL ends.
