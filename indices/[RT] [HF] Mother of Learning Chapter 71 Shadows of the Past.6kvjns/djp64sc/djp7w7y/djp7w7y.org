I considered this, however it doesn't seem likely to me that Fortav would push Ibery into a bush every single restart, then ask Zorian for help each time. But maybe it's all a diversion. Has he continued do this even after RR left?

He is perhaps one of the few people at the academy that Zorian has not investigated in-depth.
