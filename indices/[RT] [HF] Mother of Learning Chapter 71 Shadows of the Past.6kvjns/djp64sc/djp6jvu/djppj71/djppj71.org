I don't think Fortov is RR, but ...

I still think the "insta-kill" is more just telling the gate "don't recreate this item on the next restart". There's no reason to suspect that leaving would cause this to happen since we learned from the gate itself that the loop wasn't designed to continue operating after the user leaves. When the user leaves, their soul is copied into their outside world body. There's nothing about that process which tells us whether that would necessarily remove the original soul from the simulation. The simulation isn't expected to keep running so we're already well into areas that the original creators weren't planning for. Frankly it's a testament to the design (and they're just darn lucky) that it's "failing" gracefully enough not to just destroy them.
