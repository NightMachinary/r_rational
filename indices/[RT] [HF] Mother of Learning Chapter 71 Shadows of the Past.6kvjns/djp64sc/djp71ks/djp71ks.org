Holy fuck. Has Fortov bothered Zorian even once since RR left the time loop about the purple creeper salve? Zorian seems to believe that being at Imaya's is enough to discourage Fortov, but it might be because he just no longer looks for Zorian.

Not sure if that's indicative of anything, though. Might be that Zorian's right and Fortov's just being discouraged of looking for him, might be that the changes to Cyoria with the death of the Aranea changes the events enough that Ibery no longer gets pushed down in purple creepers (can't remember if we've heard about it even once since Zorian's been back from Knyazov Dveri). But if it's no longer happening, then it could indicate a change in Fortov.
