hehe This one will definitely have the most tension and possibly the most potential for things to go places. But longer term I really liked Raynee for the love interest. Marrying into a bloodline would be really cool. She's described as really good looking, and I'm both kinda shallow about looks and personally feeling partial to redheads atm.
