If this story was an RPG, this is the chapter where you've finished a dungeon crawl, and you go back to town and catch up on all of your NPCs.

It was good to have some quality time with a few of the side characters.

I've honestly always wondered why Zorian never looked into Fortov's whereabouts across the timeloop.
