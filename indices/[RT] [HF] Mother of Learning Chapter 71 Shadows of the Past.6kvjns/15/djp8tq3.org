Was the whole "teach me to control the orb" thing suspicious as hell to anyone else, or is it just me? It seems that learning to control the orb is similar to learning to replicate the effect of having the marker on your soul.

Combined with Daimen's private time with Fortrov and Kiri (and his perpetual mind blank), the whole chapter appears like it's foreshadowing future shenanigans on his part. Daimen is definitely on my radar.
