For some reason, MoL is now up on [[http://topwebfiction.com/][topwebfiction]]!

I don't know if anyone besides the author is allowed to submit a banner. But I was thinking about making a request in [[http://pocketsizedsleuth.tumblr.com/][pocketsizedsleuth's tumblr]] since [[https://sketchmemo.wordpress.com/tag/mother-of-learning/][his rendition of Zorian]] seemed like a good fit for a fancy banner. Should I go poke him?
