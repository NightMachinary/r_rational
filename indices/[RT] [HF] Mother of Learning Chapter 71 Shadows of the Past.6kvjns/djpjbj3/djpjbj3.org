Loved the new chapter, left review on fictpress though.

Question for [[/u/nobody103]], have you considered putting MoL up on [[http://topwebfiction.com/][topwebfiction]] for more exposure? I've heard it can net a heap of readers.

I just searched and noticed that MoL was quite underrepresented on [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/mother-of-learning/][Web Fiction Guide]] with only TWO!! glowing reviews and such a travesty can't be brooked. I'll go increase it by 50% as soon as I can.
