lol There are clearly dates. I suspect that "won't write romance" mostly just means that any romance which happens won't become a focus of the story, and we won't be forced to read a ton of dialogue where they talk or agonize over how they feel about each other or what the other one thinks of them.

Which I'm super happy about because Twilight sucked. I wouldn't be surprised if there's still /some/ romance in the sense that we see a date or two, and we're just told in a sentence or two about any relationship status updates there are. It'd include romance in the way that PG-13 movies include sex--it just goes to a shot outside the house with just the bedroom light on after a kiss.
