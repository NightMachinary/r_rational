Exactly. The romance is unlikely to go far, because Zorian would probably feel that it'd just be torture to develop feelings for someone and then having that person forget all their time together the next day.

By the end of the Raynie arc, it was pretty much obvious that she'd developed feelings for him, since he'd become so reliable and a source of comfort for her. But it's very unlikely that their relationship will be explored further before the time loop ends, unless Zorian decides to actually meet with her clan.

The romance is in an episodal format, and never becomes a primary focus. And it's perfectly fine that way.
