Well, my theory about this is that potentially the invasion needs something Ibery has, and Fortov throws her into the weeds as a distraction to get something from her. In addition, when Zorian says he pushes her in every time, is this from his previous experience at the beginning of the story or has he actually observed this in every restart? I doubt that Zorian would notice this event without Fortov coming to bug him.
