Interesting idea that the Orb may be reacting to Zach because of who he is, not because of the marker. That would mean he'd be able to do it outside the loop as well.

I agree the non-combat chapters are interesting. I do like it when more happens though. I'm waiting for them to take the Orb to the Gate. Maybe they won't need to bring all 5 keys in one restart. Also strange they didn't ask for Xvim's help with the Orb.
