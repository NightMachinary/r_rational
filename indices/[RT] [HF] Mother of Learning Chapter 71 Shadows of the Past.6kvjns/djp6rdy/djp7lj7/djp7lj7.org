My current red robe theory is that RR is actually a cultist, or at least is affiliated with them. RR is the specialist mage the invasion is using for dimensionalism, and is responsible for creating the ritual to free the primordial. However, at some point he realized that he was in a pocket dimension b/c of something Zach did. Then, he befriends Zach, and gets one of the deranged invader-aligned soul mages (either Sudomir or Quatach-Ichl) to alter his soul and give him the stamp. He wipes zach, leaving the false trails.
