There's nothing in the current chapter that points to this, but there's a theory I've been playing around with since going through a complete reread. I haven't seen this idea floating around, and wanted to discuss it.

Red Robe is the original time traveler, not Zach.

This would explain why the time loop was started a month prior to the solstice, rather than at the solstice when it would be most efficient. If the time loop were started by Red Robe, he would naturally start it early, so that he could optimize the invasion prior to the solstice and the priomordial-unleashing ritual.

This theory isn't perfect by any means. Quatach-Ichl seems unaware of the time loop and dismissive of Red Robe, when we see them near each other in Chapter 26. As an expert on dimensional magic, as evidenced by his design of the Ibasan gate, I would expect him to be involved with the Sovereign Gate. It also requires additional details to explain how Zach became attached to the time loop.
