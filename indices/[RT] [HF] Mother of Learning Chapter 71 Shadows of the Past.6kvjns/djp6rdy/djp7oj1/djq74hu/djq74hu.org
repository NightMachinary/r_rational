For the moment I'm still going with RR being a Veyers who is merged/possessed by a far older entity that actually had knowledge of the Gate prior to the 1 month early activation of the loops. I've been running with "a fire elemental/spirit from the result of the ritual to activate his Boranova bloodline".

But for some reason he himself wasn't capable of gaining the original Controller marker, so had to allow Zach to be the true Controller, but still had some method of faking the marker or entering the loop.

The timing of Veyer's disappearance is too coincidental, and the fact that despite all of Zorian and Zach's efforts, he was impossible to find means that it wasn't simple either. If he was dead or killed or soulkilled, they still probably should have been able to find some evidence unless there was heavy warding done or a pocket dimension involved.

One of the rules the Guardian gave was that 2 Controller markers were impossible. They couldn't be given inside the loop by the normal method, only by whatever stroke of luck Zorian had with the Lich's attack. Outside the loop they could be given by either the Maker or one of its Agents, but that would delete/override the former Controller Marker.
