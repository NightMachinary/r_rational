Most of those depend on the particulars of how the time loop interacts with the marker, which we don't know yet. Regarding the premature restarts, it would depend on how the loop decides that it needs to restart. It could be either "No Marked individuals are alive." or "A Marked individual has died." In the latter case, if Red Robe has a complete marker, either Zach's death or Red Robe's death could restart the loop, but Red Robe had not died prematurely.

Similarly, the tracking ritual may fail due to minor issues as well. It tracks all copies of the reference object, not all copies of the marker. When Zorian's fragmented marker is used as the reference, it finds those fragments as part of the complete marker. When Red Robe's complete marker is used as a reference, it does not find Zorian's fragmented marker, because it is looking for a complete copy. This is completely untested, but would fit with how the ritual is described.

As to why Zach exists, I could imagine him as an intentionally antagonistic creation. That is, Red Robe creating one additional time traveler in order to throw a wrench in plans, in order to test them against unforeseen circumstances. We know that the invaders have additional allies in summoned demons outside the loop, and so a deliberate random element is a useful thing for testing. Alternatively, Red Robe may be a cultist-Zach who created an ensouled protagonist-simulacrum-Zach in order to take care of mundane duties. I'm iffy on why Zach exists if Red Robe is the original, and don't have a good answer for it.

I'm not convinced that ownership of Imperial artifacts has any major information content. Given the Splinter Wars, I would be surprised if major artifacts weren't scattered around.

Thank you for the critique. I am not entirely sold on the idea of Red Robe being the original, so I wanted to get more eyes on it. It explains the timing of the loop with the invasion, but raises other issues.
