But how does one get the original mark? It's intended for there to be only one marked person at a time, but it can be hacked. Maybe it doesn't work by bloodlines, but the Gate was being stored in the Noveda estate until it was sold or given away by the caretaker. That would be a pretty big coincidence if a Noveda just happened to become marked and enter the Gate after it was just taken from his family's storage.
