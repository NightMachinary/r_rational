I don't necessarily disagree with anything you're saying except that I feel it's just as possible for people to take pride in the bloodline idea, and thus ensure an heir like Zach (if he is an heir) gets a marked applied.

The reason why I say Zach may not necessarily be a direct heir (though I do lean in that direction) is because the Gate could have come into his family's possession in any number of ways. To give just one example, perhaps Zach's ancestors were friends with the last heir and before the last heir died, he decided to give the Gate to the Novedas rather than let the government take custody.
