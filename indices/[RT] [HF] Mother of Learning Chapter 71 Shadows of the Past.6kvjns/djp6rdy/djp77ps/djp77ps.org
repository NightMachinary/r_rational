I think Zach is the original but RR may have initiated it. The Gate only works with certain bloodlines, so RR needed to bring Zach into it. But since pre-loop RR is aware of this, he started each loop with the knowledge until he was able to figure out a way to duplicate the marker for himself. Zach also starts each loop in his bed which would be a strange place to start if you initiated the loop intentionally.
