I'd like to think my [[#s][review]] in c69 begging for more time loop character development had some sway! (excerpt in spoiler)

But judging by how fitting Taiven's date acceptance was and knowing the author loves throwing Chekhov's guns everywhere, I'm betting it was planned in advance.

These kinds of chapters are what drew me into MoL in the first place. If I had to explain, it's probably the appeal of using a time loop in a wholesome way to gradually understand people on a level deeper than you could if you only had one chance - who hasn't fantasized about a redo for a chat, a meeting, or even whole years of life? And of course, it's been a pleasure following Zorian the sourpuss as he repairs relationships and achieves some measure of self-actualization.
