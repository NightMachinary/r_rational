Err, no. The usual schedule is, as you said, 3 weeks between chapters. Lets look at the dates.

July 2nd - Chapter 71 (4 weeks since previous chapter, a week of delay)

June 4th - Chapter 70 (4 weeks since previous chapter, a week of delay)

May 7th - Chapter 69 (2 weeks and 4 days since previous chapter, 3 days ahead of 3-week interval making up the Chapter 68 delay)

April 19th - Chapter 68

So as you can see, I was correct in saying the last two chapters were also delayed.
