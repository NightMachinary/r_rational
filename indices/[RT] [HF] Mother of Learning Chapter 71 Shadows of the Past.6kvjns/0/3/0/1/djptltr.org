Well it's a completely different style of fantasy but I think the best fights I've read are the ones in Joe Abercrombie's books. Both the trilogy and the standalones have really fluid fight scenes.

In a more puply vein, I also enjoyed the fight scenes in Will Wight's Traveler's Gate series. THe rest of the writings quality is... debatable.

Mind you none of these are rational in any way shape or form.
