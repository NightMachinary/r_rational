haha yeah I've definitely been looking forward to that too. Soul Magic in general is definitely one area where Zorian has some major levelups left to get and Silverlake was introduced as one of the people who might help with that.

It's pretty clear that the Silverlake arc can't be completed until Zach & Zorian figure out how to cleanly kill the grey hunter, so reading the recent chapter about them fighting it (and still losing) was pretty exciting. I'm kinda surprised they haven't figured it out yet. You'd think a high powered gun or something would let them do it.

Given the difficulty of and general lateness-in-the-story of getting Silverlake's help, my bet is on Silverlake being the one to /finally/ provide Zorian with a way to get Soul Sight that doesn't require waiting 15 years outside the loop. Soul Sight really seems like something that any respectable archmage should get as it unlocks an /entire new branch/ of rare and powerful magic.
