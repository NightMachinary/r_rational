GREAT chapter ! =) Really enjoyed it... was a bit worried because the last few chapter focused so much on the plot progression , and the actual character development seemed to get stuck, but now this chapter changed that again ^{^} please more like it. The way Zorian will interact with old friends and his family after the timeloop is very important so i want to see what he will make with it. The story about Fortov and Ibery, his friendship with the almost forgotten Benisek, Taiven, Akoja (one of the most developed characters but with not much involvement in the plot is actually interesting) ,maybe even a story involving Byrn Ivarin (i doubt it), maybe another story consulting the librarian searching for books (should be very easy to get a high level pass now) etc...
