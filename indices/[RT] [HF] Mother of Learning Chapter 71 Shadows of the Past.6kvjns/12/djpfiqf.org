  Daimen gave Zorian a meaningful look. Though Zorian didn't know for sure what he was trying to tell him, he could guess. While finding a way to operate the orb without a marker was not a priority for him and Zach, it would mean a lot for Daimen. He was probably well aware that Zorian had no intention whatsoever of revealing his abilities to Daimen outside the time loop, which would make those control spells absolutely crucial to his mission. Without them, even removing the orb from its resting place would be impossible, greatly complicating everything.

If Zorian does not reveal his abilities to Daimen outside of the time loop, how or why would he reveal the control spells for the orb to him, and what benefit is there for Daimen-inside-the-loop (the instance which knows about Zorian's abilities, no less) to figure out the control spells?

(I suppose this connects to a more general issue: among the people who accept the time loop at face value, why don't we see at least some instances of apathy or at least some degree of similar behavioural adjustment or suspension of long-term plans as they realise that what they are doing is entirely inconsequential?)
