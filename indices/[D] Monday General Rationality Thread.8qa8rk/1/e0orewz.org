This actually sounds pretty freaky. It's getting close to brain-in-a-jar levels of preservation, enough that there's talk of establishing ethical guidelines for human brains. In fact, I already find pretty disquieting the idea of doing it with animals - I don't think, if the brain got to the stage of being conscious, it would be on par with any of the other ethical standards we apply to animal experiments.
