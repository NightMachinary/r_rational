I am working on some heroes/villains and powers stories and I want my stories to be as rational as possible. However, the more I read the posts in this subreddit, the more I see the concept of Rationality is larger and more multi-faceted than I had realized.

Do any of you have some suggestions on reading material? Stories are ok, but mostly I am hoping for writers/readers talking about what defines Rationality for them.
