  I really think of it like a hobby now more than anything

I absolutely agree. Aspiring to be a rationalist in many ways feels very similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development][personal development]] which is very much a hobby in the sense that it's something that you very much enjoy and put time and effort into doing. I haven't ever interacted with anyone who attempts to be more rational and didn't enjoy the process in some way.
