Hi. I'll mention some points that I don't think get talked about enough on this subreddit:

1) Rational stories require a high degree of /realism/. Without events developing in a realistic way, any solution by the characters will feel like an asspull.\\
2) Rationality is not the same as being smart. In The Need to Become Stronger, the main character's teacher tells his pupils over and over not to be clever, because if you optimize for seeming smart then you're not optimizing for winning. More generally, there is always a tradeof between optimizing for being X and optimizing for seeming X, and society will always optimize for seeming X. So rationality, in a nutshell, is about making the hard choice of sacrificing social status in order to do the right thing.*\\
3) Strategy is not the same as tactics. The most common flaw in 'rational' fanfiction is to take the exact same conflict as in canon, and then make it play out in a more clever way. In order to write a real rational story, you have to ask yourself if that conflict would ever even happen in the first place. You have to throw everything out and let the characters determine the story. And this also applies to rationality itself: You have to be willing to forget everything you think you know, disregard everything society tells you, and rebuild an entire theory of how the world works from scratch.

*HPMOR kind of cheats in this regard, because HJPEV gets so many free goodies at the start of the story that he can basically get away with behaving however he wants without ever paying a price for it.
