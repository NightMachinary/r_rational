Thank you. It sounds like I am already planning exactly this. I want my characters to act intelligently, respond reasonably, and for my system of powers to be intelligently put together.

I've spent the last 10 months just working on the mechanics, background and writing skills. I have put a lot into consistency and logic of the system. Will it be any good? idk, but I am having fun regardless.
