I think you also need to remember, as DaystarEld said, a Rational character is just someone who acts logically according to their stated motivations and background. As the sidebar says, a rational story is where nothing is pulled out just because the plot requires it, the characters don't have "good" and "evil" but reasonable motivations, and the laws of physics/magic/etc in your world are logical and self-consistent. Something like /The Martian/ is a good popular example. That's it. Really simple, basic. No deep subculture behind a rule that amounts to "the story makes logical sense".

Unless you are specifically going for a rational/ist/ story, you don't need to worry about replicating e.g. HJPEV in terms of having your characters do science experiments, talk about cognitive biases, etc. So you don't need to go reading The Sequences or learning cognitive biases unless you're writing a story about the sort of person who'd know about them.

Like, the story I'm writing, I actually wrote out the story from the bad guy's point of view and realised that if I was told the bad guy's story and the good guy's story I'd actually think the bad guy was in the right. That's the sort of thing that's important, having even an antagonist with good motivation, rather than Captain Planet villains who are just polluting the earth for no reason whatsoever.

So yeah, focus more on writing tips than learning inductive reasoning (unless you are genuinely fascinated by inductive reasoning in which case go for it).
