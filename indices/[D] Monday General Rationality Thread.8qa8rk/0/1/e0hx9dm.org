Over time I've come to more concretely define a distinction between /people who are intelligent and rational,/ and /aspiring rationalists./

There's something beyond those two first traits that feels like it's missing in non-rationalists I know (many close friends among them), and it really impacts the conversations and sense of "aliveness" in the relationships when discussing anything relating to science, philosophy, politics, and even less "weighty" things.

It's not quite a difference in epistemology, but more how one acts to improve their epistemology. More than just curiosity, it's that /drive/ to be curious as a verb, and constantly self-improve and test ideas and worldview and perspective. It's not just a doubt of one's own confidence in things, but then being willing to put a number on what their confidence actually is, then deliberately seek info that would change it not just upward or downward, but both.

People are smart as a noun. People are rationalists as a verb.

And I really think of it like a hobby now more than anything, in terms of there being some undefined quality that makes someone a potential aspiring rationalist or doesn't, regardless of how smart they are. It feels a bit denigrated by the association of that word, but... you can't make someone like anime if they don't like anime. No matter how much they might seem like someone who would enjoy anime, all you can do is expose them to different kinds and either they catch fire or they don't.
