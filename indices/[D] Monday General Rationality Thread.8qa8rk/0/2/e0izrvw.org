Yudkowsky's [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][series on writing]] would be a good starting point. There's also the Rationally Writing podcast, which covers what's out there pretty exhaustively... but it has a somewhat low insight-to-total-content ratio, to be honest (eg, you'll be spending a lot of time listening to it, and not get that much out of it).

Otherwise, don't try too hard to fit "rationality" into a "genre". Rational fiction as it's understood on this subreddit is less of a genre with codes and more of a bunch of specific qualities that people like in a story (self-aware characters, coherent worldbuilding, a balancing act between dramatic storytelling and having character display agency and address situations intelligently).

In other words, don't focus too much on being "as rational as possible", especially if it's your first story. Things like building a narrative arc, creating compelling personalities, and having interesting conflicts is more important than having generic american-like characters be very rational about how they use their generic superpowers to fight a generic well-intentioned-but-but-still-evil supervillain.
