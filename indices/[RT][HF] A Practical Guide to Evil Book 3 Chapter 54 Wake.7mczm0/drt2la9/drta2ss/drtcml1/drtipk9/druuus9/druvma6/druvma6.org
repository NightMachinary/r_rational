That is true. But each member of the Calamities has a counterpart in the Woe. Most of the people in the Woe could be considered as direct successors to the Calamities.

Archer embodies many of the traits of the Ranger, and her relationship to Cat has strong parallels with the one between Black and Ranger.

Masego is also a watered down version of Warlock. Before Cat came along Masego had no interest in going adventuring and the chapter where he and Archer staked out the Summer Contingent near Liesse (I think, not sure about the location) showed that he is beginning to develop a strong camaraderie with Cat.

Hakram is to Cat what Captain was to Black. He also doubles as Cat's scribe since Cat shamelessly shoves most paper pushing jobs onto him.

Since we have no onscreen viewing of the relationship between Black and Assassin I can't draw parallels between Viviene and Cat. Suffice to say it should exist if only to complete the mirror.

As I said, the Calamities had their time on the Stage. There is simply no more need for any of them and indeed, Black is actively working to ensure Cat succeeds him because in the Epilogue of Book 2, both he and Malicia confess that they are tired of all of this.

The nail in the coffin is the fact that they are largely a villainous group. Villains don't die of old age, usually. The Dead King is undead so he doesn't count.

Though Ranger may have survived the encounter with the Queen she HAS to be neutralized along with the Calamities because Black's plan requires it. And despite Cat being a veritable demi god she would DIE if the entire Calamities would show up to kill her because she had a hand in Black's death.

Warlock's chapter and Cat's arc where she deals with the other claimants shows that a Name can only be transferred with the Death of the owner at the hands of a claimant/successor. So Cat must end Black's life if she is to claim his Name just like Black did with the previous Black Knight. Black WANTS her to claim his Name so he HAS to die at Cat's hands.

Because for all their practical realism, all of the Calamities have one berserk button: harm to Black.

They have to be dealt with.

That is why Black seems "tilted", he's deliberately exploiting his pain at Captain's loss to Malicia, knowing full well she would tell Cat to sow the seeds of discord and tension that would culminate in Cat killing Black and taking his Name in the process.
