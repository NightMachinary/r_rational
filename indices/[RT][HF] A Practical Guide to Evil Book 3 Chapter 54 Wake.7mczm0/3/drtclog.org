It was good to see some introspection on Cat's part. She's been on a moral high horse since the beginning and her hypocrisy was getting a bit grating though I feel like she went a bit too far in this chapter.

As for Thief, running in alone as a Hero in a sacrificial mission against a much stronger opponent will surely play a role from a narrative point of view. I will eat my hat if she doesn't succeed by the skin of her teeth.

Next chapter will be super interesting. Black can go either way imo, though I'm leaning towards "reasonable but psychopathic". I don't think he'll sabotage himself by getting into conflict with Cat... unless it's part of her succession.
