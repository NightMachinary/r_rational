Oh, I agree he'll remain calculated. The problem is as follows:

Cat's arc throughout this book has been coming to terms with the idea of 'sacrifice for a greater good'. It started with Kilian, went on to others forcing her hand and the loss of men, then Nauk, and now her being personally willing to throw away the lives of her men for an advantage. She's becoming steadily more and more accepting of the necessity.

There's a capstone to that kind of arc, though, where she encounters the /actual/ limits to what she can accept (rather than the instinctive 'icky!' response that led her to breaking up with her lover at the start of the book). She sets her line in the sand and accepts the consequences of not passing that line.

If Black's shut-down-emotions lead him to full-on "HARD MAN MAKING HARD DECISION", he's going to be the one that forces her up against that line. Maybe it'll be blood sacrifice of the Callowans, maybe it'll be something else. But there'll come a point during the upcoming conflict where the two disagree. Forcefully. And since neither will be emotionally capable of backing down at that point, it's likely only one of them is going to walk away from that.
