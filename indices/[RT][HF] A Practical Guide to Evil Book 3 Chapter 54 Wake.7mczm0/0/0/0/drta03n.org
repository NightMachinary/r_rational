Perhaps... However it's not uncommon for the Knights to fight alongside their Squires. And I really doubt Black would not assist Cat here. Remember the longer they dick around with Akua the higher the chance that Cordelia decides to join the fight.

Remember it was Malicia who said that Black is dangerous to be around now to Cat. I take EVERYTHING that woman says with an aircraft carrier worth of the salt.

From what I saw of Black's thought processes at the conclusion of his fight with White, after he learned of Sabah's fate, was that he shoved everything in a box and cast the box into the cold oblivion because such sentimental feelings are useless to him. He's cultivated that personality for a couple of decades at a conservative estimate. He's not likely to "forget" it now.

I assign EXTREMELY low probability mass to the hypothesis that his behaviour is uncalculated.
