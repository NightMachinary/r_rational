Unfortunately I think it's been foreshadowed that Black is going to very soon become another obstacle for Cat to overcome. The way the three legions in this most recent battle pretty much have no loyalty to her and tons for Black, the way Black is "breaking down" or w/e and thus may be willing to sacrifice Callowans in a way that Cat will feel obligated to oppose, and the way Malicia has apparently been trying to replace Black with Cat for a while now all seem to point to an unhappy reunion as being likely.

Good guys get to fight with their dads and take up their mantles when they fall in the final confrontation with evil. Bad guys get dads who don't actually view their apprentices as anything other than a means to an end.
