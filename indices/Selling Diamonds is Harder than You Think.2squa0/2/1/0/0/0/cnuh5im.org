Yes, they are more brittle than steel, but is toughness/brittleness actually the limiting factor on construction? What evidence do we have of that? Concrete and glass are more brittle than steel as well (possibly more so than diamond), yet often play a structural role in large buildings despite this.

Perhaps the ideal way to use diamond supports would be something like a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity][tensegrity]] structure. The primary shock absorbers would be the cables, which could of course be something with ultra-high tensile strength (diamond nanothreads, carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber, etc). The diamond supports might also be separated by a thin layer of steel, aluminum, etc, or maybe even a pneumatic shock absorption system. As long as no sudden shock hits the diamond pieces, the structure is safe.

It would also likely be best to use pure synthetic diamond rather than natural diamond, as brittleness is partly tied to flaws in the structure.
