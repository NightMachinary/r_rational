Diamonds are extremely good thermal conductors. Copper (extremely good for a metal) is 400 W/m.k, whereas diamond is 2200. So you could use it as a heat exchanger in most applications where copper is. Diamond is also corrosion resistant, so you can use it in seawater. It could also be used as a building material, if you have enough of it. Structures could be much taller than steel structures due to the better strength to weight ratio. Shaping it as desired might be difficult, but there are laser based approaches to cutting, welding, sintering, etc.
