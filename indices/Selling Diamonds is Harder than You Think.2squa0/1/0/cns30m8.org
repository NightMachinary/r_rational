Debeers is really an outlier though. Never before or since has a complete and utter monopoly been tied to an almost universally pervasive meme that reinforces the monopoly.

Most new goods now are /designed/ for a consumer market, which involves buying and selling and in some cases planned obsolescence.

But on the other end of Debeers is Aluminum.

Aluminum use to be rarer than platinum. When foreign royalty visited the court of Louis XVI, they were served on plates of aluminum, with platinum being used for mere dukes.

Still, even with the incredible cost, the small amount meant that the total value of the market was limited. Only a few small number of people could afford it, and there was little movement in the trade.

Then it was discovered that you could inexpensively extract aluminum from bauxite ore, and the price crumbled to the point that it is almost disposable now.

But the outrageous growth in supply means that, worldwide, the market for aluminum has actually grown exponentially - even adjusting for inflation it's easily a hundred thousand or a million times larger.

So, a loss of scarcity actually created a larger market, and enabled applications that would never have been considered before.

This is the same thing I expect to happen to gold and platinum when asteroid mining becomes viable and effective. There is more platinum in a single asteroid rich in it then has been mined on earth in the history of mankind. While this would crash the price, it will open up enormous opportunity to exploit the material in ways that never would have been cost effective before.
