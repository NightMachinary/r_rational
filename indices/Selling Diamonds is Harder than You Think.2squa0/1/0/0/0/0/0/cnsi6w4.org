Another example of planned obsolescence? Appliances. My mother owned a 1960 RCA Whirlpool Imperial washing machine. That machine did 3 or more loads of laundry every single day for 42 years. The reason it was eventually sent to the scrap heap? The tub finally got a leak. We actually managed to get a NEW replacement tub in a 40+ year old box, but I couldn't get the retaining nut that was at the top of the tub off, because the thing had welded itself in place. I didn't have a proper heating torch to get it off, nor a shop to play with it.

These days, a washing machine that sees heavy use is likely to last maybe 5-7 years. That way they can sell us another one.

If Appliance engineering had advanced like automobile engineering, we'd get 100 years of service out of a good washer.
