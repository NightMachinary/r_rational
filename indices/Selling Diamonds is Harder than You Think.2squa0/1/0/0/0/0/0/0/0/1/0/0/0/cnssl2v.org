Engineering of a product is more than just designing it once, and then taking it to a fabrication shop and making it happen.

For years, the appliance industry adjusted it's designs based on what was failing. If X failed on a regular basis after a short time, a design alteration was required to address that failure.

These days, it's the opposite. The appliance industry adjusts it's designs based on what is NOT failing. If, after 5-7 years or so, there are very few reports of failure of X, that means that X and/or the components that support X can be engineered to a lower standard because it exceeds the planned life of the appliance.

Starting an appliance business that would immediately become a priority lawsuit and talent-poaching target of every single competitor on the market after they understand the goals of the company is FAR from anything that I'm interested in. There are not very many appliance manufacturers in the world. It's not as far from the OP's example of DeBeers as most people believe.
