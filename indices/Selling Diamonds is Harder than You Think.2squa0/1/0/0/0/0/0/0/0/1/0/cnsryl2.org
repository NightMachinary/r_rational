Ah, in my opinion, it is very close to malicious to intentionally design products to be built to a lower standard. I do recognize that others do not necessarily share this mindset.

If there were a range of appliances offered with large differences in durability and cost, then I could believe that it was consumer choice driving the market. There really aren't though. Very few appliances of any type are designed to last more than a few years. When you go to buy an appliance, you don't have a choice to buy a 50-year model or a 5-year model. Not all customers want cheap appliances, but that's all that is offered.
