Compared to the price of mined gems, no. Compared to glass and carbon composites? They kind of are. Mostly however, the limit on use is currently that we can only make them in very limited sizes and shapes. If you want a scalpel sized blade or an aperture window for a laser, then sure, that can be made in diamond. Lenses for eyeglasses, however? No can do. Heck, "we can't make them large enough" is a major limit on synthetic diamond for use in semi-conductors.
