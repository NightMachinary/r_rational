Absolutely. Although to be fair it seems like there was a small crash in the 80s, DeBeers was just able to reassert control.

Actually, in the comments to that article there was a link to a [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120923200747/http://www.overtcollusion.com/diamonds/][decent piece]] on timeline picking up after the OPs article finishes. Worth a read if that article left you curious about what happened in those 30 years.
