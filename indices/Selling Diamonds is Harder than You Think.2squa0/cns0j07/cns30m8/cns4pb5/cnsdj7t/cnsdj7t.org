Planned obsolescence is a thing that exists. I'm on my phone, so I can't provide links, but look into the lifespan of old-timey lightbulbs compared to modern ones. Of course with LEDs that's maybe not a very relevant example. Cartridge printers are another example you could look into.

Non-jeans clothing found at big stores could also be seen as an example, provided you don't care about fashion.
