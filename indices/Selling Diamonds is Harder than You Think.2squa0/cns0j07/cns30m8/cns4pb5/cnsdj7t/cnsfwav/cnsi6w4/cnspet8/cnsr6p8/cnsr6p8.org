Looking here: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence]] one can see that we are both correct.

What you are referring to is "Programmed Obsolescence" and what I am referring to is "Lifetime-limiting Design." They are both variants of planned obsolescence.

A very good example of programmed obsolescence is throwaway digital cameras. There's no reason that they need to be throwaway. Sure, they would be a tiny bit more expensive if they could be re-used, and their lifetime would be short due to cheapness of design, but you could certainly get more than a few pictures out of one if you were careful. Cellphone cameras currently make this a non-issue in most countries where you might be reading this from, but if you remember back to the dawn of cheap digital photography, there were lots of disposable digital cameras. I would not be surprised if you could find them in first world countries still.
