The monopoly is great at manipulating people. People think natural diamonds are somehow better than lab made, because they are "real". Even when lab made are perfect and purer than "real" diamonds.

I've been thinking I should buy a shitload of lab made diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds at least for counters for board games. And to fill some pouches for cosplays, giveaways and other fancy things.

  not really that rare, but it's common knowledge only among people who have the resources to buy them?

Except that because of internet lots of people know about it. And people who can afford big ones might not know or care. It's a status symbol now regardless of it's value. It's a fucking diamond.

  how would you sell your secret stash of diamonds

I'd fill a bathtub with them, go in myself, and make a viral video of them! "Wanna buy a diamond? Well below the 'market price'." Then I'd rise from the tub and have diamond underwear on for everyone's surprise.

Yeaaa maybe I'd just wanna show off instead of selling them.
