Oooo! I've been having a slightly odd day when it relates to my reading choices. First I was reading some of DataPacRat's works which usually involves some body horror, information compartmentalization, and dealing with alien intelligences. Then I was reading Sam's SCP Antimemetics stories which have the obvious relationships. And now I come to you.

Argh....I'm really interesting in writing a story about this now, but I'm busy trying to write a time-travel story first and to get /that/ done as proof I can write a complete novel.

Now I have ideas buzzing in my head about the mind is perception and perception is the mind, so when you alter either one you necessarily change the other. So if the main character has to stay human when dealing with the monsters he needs to force them to fit his world view (blinding himself is a very good strategy). Another one is very Teggen Toppa in personality for the protagonists to always strive for a better future. The story would be amazing if it follows a Worm-style or Xianxia-style of escalation where the threats and stakes just raise exponentially throughout. First dipping ones toes into the eldritch, then foil a small cult, jump up to dealing with an organization where the ones in charge are one of the oldest living users of eldritch power, face off with an Old One directly, keeping pushing against an entire group to carve out a place for humanity, finally succeed or be utterly crushed by CthuluGod....

It can't be until December, but do you want to try writing a story or just coming up with a more fleshed out plot together about this together? I have /ideas!/ I mostly just would like to keep talking about the mythos some more.
