Steins;Gate doesn't outright explain the protagonist's eccentricity, but I think he is a high functioning schizophrenic. Whenever he's under stress, he pretends he's fighting against an evil conspiracy that he claims is real in the moment to excuse his behavior, but later admits it's imaginary. I have no idea if this is an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia, and he does have other quirks based around him acting like the over the top mad scientist he sees himself as, but I bought into him as a man trying to live a satisfying life outside of his delusions.

My recommendation for the show is only appended by the fact that while I positively adored the characters, some of whom also might have mental disorders, the plot is not very rational and the villains are just evil for the sake of it. It's really a drama about people's relationships with each other and the tough choices they make that effect them, with a sci-fi gadget to get the plot going and a threat to add tension. If you can enjoy a story just from its characters, then I say check it out.
