[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]] involves some altered mental states; Scott Alexander wrote an interesting interpretation of it [[http://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/131724464066/spoiler-warning-tnc-my-interpretation-of-the][based on several characters in the work sharing a particular mental disorder]]. It's a pretty good story IMO.
