I wrote down a lot of notes on this, but recently moved into a different house, and have no clue where they've gotten to. Here are the highlights that I still remember from my two day brainstorming session about a year ago.

If you've read A Study In Emerald by Gaiman, I was implicitly imagining a scenario like that as the setting, though set in modern rather than Victorian times, and with the invasion having just taken place in the past couple years or so, or just starting to take place, or something around that time period. Go read that short story, if you haven't already.

The setting I had in mind was also somewhat more apocalyptic, less tamed. Earth would probably be destroyed in a few years. Geometry had gone to hell in some locations. Time was in flux.

Necessary lengthy digression: the metaphysics of all of this was motivated an odd phobia of mine, that I still have. I experience a kind of strong existential dread at the thought that the Many Worlds Hypothesis as it's popularly understood might be true. Most people imagine the MWH as implying that somewhere there is a universe in which they were born the opposite gender, or with an evil twin, etc. Those are all silly, fanciful ideas. But I imagine the MWH as implying that somewhere there is a universe in which I am being endlessly tortured. Somewhere there is a universe in which my current values are opposite my own. Somewhere there is a universe in which I am just a Boltzmann brain. And I can't guarantee that I'm not about to fall right into that universe. In fact, with one hundred percent probability, one version of myself is going to fall there.

(I know that some people have talked about how the relative density of universes in the multiverse might vary, such that for every universe in which something improbable happens there are many many more in which something probable happens instead. This is not actually reassuring to me. I don't care about the abstract multiversal density of my experiences. If there is a one hundred percent chance that at least one version of me will be tortured, I anticipate that torture just as strongly as if there were going to be 5 trillion of me tortured, because for the individual tortured me, the experience will feel indistinguishably the same. In fairness, I would also have a one hundred percent chance of falling into a universe where I would experience rapturous bliss. But the contrast between those anticipated experiences actually makes the effect worse, not better. If everything that can possibly happen, happens, everything's importance, good or bad, gets washed out into a terrifyingly powerful grey. And personally, I experience loss aversion, so the grey looks a lot closer to black than white.)

I imagine the popscience multiverse of the MWH as a sort of out of control, unconstrained, cancerous abomination of my values and any possible set of values. And if such a multiverse actually existed, I would want to figure out how to destroy it, or at least prune its branches so that meaningful exclusivity of possibilities could be created.

All of that seems to mesh fairly well with Lovecraft's weird universe. Many of his abominations look kind of like uncontrolled, cancerous growths or mutations. Magic could be interpreted as a kind of quantum pruning process that destroys all universes but the ones where the desired effect occurs - I stole this from EY. Power and survival of the fittest are all that seem to matter. Very Moloch. There's a post of Scott's somewhere where he talks about The God Of Life as being a God of Cancer - I had pretty much the exact same concept already sketched out in my notes. At that time, also, I was literally undergoing chemotherapy treatment, so it was more meaningful to me than just a throwaway metaphor.

For the rationalist type gimmicks, a lot of my inspiration came from reading the Call of Cthulhu tabletop RPG rulebook, which can be found easily online. You might look into that. Probably no good GM would allow very many of these tricks to work, of course.

One thing I noticed is that although adventurers are weak against horrors, there are many creatures with abilities that would be very useful against other creatures. And some of these abilities are properties of the creatures biology, that theoretically should persist after death. So, I had the inklings that it might be possible for a character to engage in a kind of trading up in power via tool use, taking the body parts of the first relatively weak creature they kill and using that to kill a slightly stronger creature, and so on. I don't remember many of the creatures' abilities. I think I remember the idea of connecting precommitment and the Hounds of Tindalos.

Another exploit I remember is that although casting spells drives people gradually insane, there's nothing preventing a character from having others do all the dirty work for them, especially as, due to this being an RPG, persuasion is a skill which can yield nearly guaranteed results. Alternatively, someone could use spells to buff their persuasive abilities, then never pick up a spellbook themselves again. There is no need to bite the insanity penalty if you're able to organize a counter cult.

One possible theme of the story would have been information management and uncertainty management, as applied to memetics. It is dangerous for any individual to know too much about the eldritch. But, similar to the above, a group of people working together can learn a lot, provided that information is kept properly compartmentalized.

Another possible theme would have been exploring lack of trust in oneself and future motivations in the face of evidence of cognitive deterioration. The final theme was finding hope and a reason to fight in a doomed universe. Cultists were going to be the majority of people left alive on earth, those who had given up, whether by deciding to serve the monsters in the hopes they would be eaten last, deciding to pursue hedonism, deciding to self-modify into a monster who would be able to fight on the new universe's own terms, or deciding that this was a good thing out of a misunderstood sense of internalized Darwinism.

Another trick I don't remember in detail, but in the book there were a lot of spells dealing with the manipulation of one's own flesh, and they could have had a tremendous amount of synergy if combined intelligently. Some manipulated your size, while others were easier or harder to cast based on your current size. Some made parts of your body immortal. Others allowed you to swap body parts with other people. I played with all sorts of weird overpowered combinations. Again, no good GM would have allowed anyone to obtain all these spells at once, but it was still fun to theorycraft.

The final thing I remember was realizing that, because most monsters impose their SAN penalty upon being seen, a character could potentially just stab out their own eyeballs and engage in almost costless summoning rituals or adventures. And this would actually have been a fairly viable strategy due to synergies with other spells. There was one specific spell that allowed a character to blind someone's eyes on and off at will. There were various healing spells. There was a Listen skill that could imaginably have been buffed beyond belief. All sorts of things like that.

Actually, I'm pretty sure it was doing Google searches related to that concept that lead me to the above excellent work of fanfiction.
