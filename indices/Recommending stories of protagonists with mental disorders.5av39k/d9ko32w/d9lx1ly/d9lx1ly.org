  There's a story where HP has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), written by someone with DID. Very illuminating. All links are to that person's content. [[/u/ToaKraka]] linked it in a recommendation thread.

I read part of that, but then quit abruptly when it started having sexual content that, er, well, it wasn't graphic or anything, but it kinda triggered me. Sexual abuse with part of the abused apparently liking it and going back for more when there was no compulsion to do so and every opportunity to rat on the abuser with extremely high likelihood of bad consequences for said abuser. That, er, kind of does the opposite of floating my boat.
