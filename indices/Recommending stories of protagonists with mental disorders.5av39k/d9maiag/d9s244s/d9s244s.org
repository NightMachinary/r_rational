Sorry for not responding before, but I didn't notice your comment.

For how much Buffy knowledge you need, I would say very little because I've never seen the TV show and it takes place after the end of the series so there are no canon events that occur during the story.

All you need to know is that Buffy is the barbarian warrior of the group, Willow is the wizard, and Xander is the heart of the group or the "normie" who is usually the sidekick. Which is why it's meant to be so horrifying that he is tortured. Note that he loses the eye during the series and that it wasn't lost in the story because of the torture.

There are a lot of references made to the show, and you might get a little confused at what some characters have to do with Xander, but I think it's worth a read anyway since it's so focused on Xander himself.

TL;DR - Not much background knowledge is needed, but you might get confused at how one or two characters know Xander (Spike and Illyria). I recommend just go to the wiki pages for each character name you're interested in and read the first paragraph summary they provide.
