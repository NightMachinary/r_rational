I don't think I said it wasn't publically available, did I? Did a quick scan over my writing to see if I typed that in, but didn't see that phrase. If you could quote what part you're referring to, I'd be able to address it directly.

The OP originally asked why it wasn't common knowledge (something can be public, but not common).

Perception is common knowledge, but grit and tiers are interchanged constantly as they are considered the same thing until tier 6. Last chapter, Henry mentioned that once hitting tier 6 a person could perceive their mana in a new way and would be able to relearn all their spells. How a person feels it varies based on the mancy and niche, so it's unique to everyone.

Like, I picture Shanna doing quick geomancy stuff to strengthen her stuff, but that's literally tied with her niche, so other geomancers can't mimic it.

So when Seti fanboyed over aeromancers, studying a tier 8 isn't going to reveal a wide technique all aeromancers can do to get stronger, as the technique is determined by the individual's ability.
