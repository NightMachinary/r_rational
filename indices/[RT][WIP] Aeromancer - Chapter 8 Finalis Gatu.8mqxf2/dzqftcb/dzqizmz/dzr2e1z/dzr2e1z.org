As counterpoint, I like it a bit sparse. Your writing flows fairly nicely. Maybe you can figure out how to put more worldbuilding threaded into the action, but I wouldn't like a bunch of paragraphs of description unless you can manage to make it /really/ interesting. They slow things down and if not done well, I just skip them (I'm reading a story where I pretty much skip all non-dialogue paragraphs at the beginning of each section because of this).
