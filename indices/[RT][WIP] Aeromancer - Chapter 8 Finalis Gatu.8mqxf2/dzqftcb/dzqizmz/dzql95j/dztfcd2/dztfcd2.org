I don't usually reply to things, but this is such a /gross/ oversimplification that i had to lol

All characters in all books from everywhere can be summed up in short archetypal descriptions (ron: funny friend who doesnt like to do homework / hermione: ugly-ish friend who is super book smart / harry: good natured orphan who isnt afraid to speak out). Not that hard to do.

Now let's take shanna, whos my fav character atm both cuz she reminds me of a manga character, and cuz i picture her as 2b with her blindfolds. she speaks to the point but doesnt let lies stand, is super considerate (where she cared about set's mental wellbeing), and has a thing for henry to the point where i think they're shagging as of the last chapter. And her loyalties arent blind (shes more loyal to some over others).

So overall there's always more to it, but i can understand wanting to know more about each one (with sports or food or whatever)
