  It's like a child growing up; they don't go to the gym, but once they reach an age and do go, that's when they learn about muscle names and proper bodybuilding techniques. It's a loose analogy but I think it kinda works.

But why is this knowledge not publicly available, even if it's not widespread? Someone like Seti who was researching Shepherds and mancer tiers because he was a little obsessed should know about all of that.
