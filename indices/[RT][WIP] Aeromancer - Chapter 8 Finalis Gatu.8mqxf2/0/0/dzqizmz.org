Hey, thanks for reading!

When you say world-building, do you mean descriptions of the surrounding environment? Or actual world building such as govt, land, political standings, etc?

And what do you mean by characterization?

As for the basic distinction of mana-grit-perception, it's not necessary to know until a person hits tier 6 (and rarely 5). It's like a child growing up; they don't go to the gym, but once they reach an age and do go, that's when they learn about muscle names and proper bodybuilding techniques. It's a loose analogy but I think it kinda works.
