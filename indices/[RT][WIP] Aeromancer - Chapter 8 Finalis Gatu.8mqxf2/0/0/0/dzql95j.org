For world-building, I'm mostly talking about the latter - institutions, cultural differences with our world, history, and small aspects that don't impact the story much but add some "flavor" to things. This is mostly just my own preference for stories, while others feel that too much of such things can really bog down the reading process.

For points of comparison, I'd say that this story is currently somewhere around the worldbuilding of most shonen manga in their early phase - My Hero Academia is the one that comes to mind. We've got a decent introduction to all the places and people that Seti interacts with on a regular basis, and the basic cultural pressures that inform Seti's desire to be a stronger aeromancer, but that's about it. On the other extreme is something like the Silmarillion, where there /is/ a coherent story, but every other sentence is a reference to events that would be a self-contained series of novels. The happy medium that I think a lot of stories aspire to is probably Harry Potter, where there are tons of detailed, but ultimately inconsequential items (Every-Flavor Beans, Butterbeer, the Knight Bus) characters (Ollivander, Gilderoy Lockhart, Bill/Charlie Weasley) and events (Quidditch, Yule Ball, almost everything about magical history) that are often used to drop subtle plot hooks and foreshadowing, but which are described with detail far surpassing what's necessary for that purpose. I think it helps to make a world feel alive in and of itself, and not merely a construct which exists merely for the purpose of the story at hand.

With regard to characterization, I'm talking mostly about more of the same. We've established most the relevant character traits that affect how and why the characters interact with Seti, but everything else about them is kinda up in the air. Faulkner is skilled, detached and playful which all affect his teaching style. But, say, what sports does he follow? His favorite foods? Does he do anything weird with his clothes or hair? I think some things might have been mentioned in his introduction (I think he likes hamburgers, maybe?) but if these are all real, constant or evolving parts of their characters, I'd expect them to show up and interject themselves into daily life. As it stands, most of the characters feel kinda flat and robotic, and most of their characters could be summed up in short, archetypal descriptions. Sydria is a bratty but affectionate sister, Dora is naive but extremely powerful, Henry is very knowledgeable and even-tempered, for Shanna her extreme lack of character traits /is/ her most notable character trait.

You've done a great job developing and thinking through the way the powers can be analyzed, developed, and applied - it'd be great to see that same depth is the setting and the characters.
