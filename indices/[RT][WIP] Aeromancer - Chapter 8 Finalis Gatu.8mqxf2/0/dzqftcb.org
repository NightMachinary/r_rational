Nice build up. Introduction of the mana-grit-perception power structure makes it clear why Faulkner would take an interest in Seti despite his low mana. The distinction seems so basic that it's surprising that it's not common knowledge outside of the Families and probably the Shephards.

However, if I'm reading it right then the implication is that grit tends to come naturally with increased mana and practice and that most people's perception is so low that they couldn't train grit even if they wanted. But Seti having god-tier perception means that he can directly train grit, and also use his mana much more efficiently than other mancers. All this, plus omniview and the ability to manipulate emotions. Yeah, I can see why low mana wasn't a dealbreaker for Faulkner.

Edited with later thoughts:

If I can add a criticism, or at least an observation - the storytelling is somewhat rough and to-the-point. This might be a deliberate stylistic choice meant to convey something regarding Seti's personality and what he's paying attention to, but I'd personally appreciate more time spent of world-building and characterization.
