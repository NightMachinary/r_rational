Some data points: This is by far the funniest internet periodic video series I've ever watched, and I regularly watch 5 or so. I consider it better than Yu Gi Oh Abridged - which I'd been watching for several years before discovering DBZ abridged. The first few episodes are only sort of okay, though.
