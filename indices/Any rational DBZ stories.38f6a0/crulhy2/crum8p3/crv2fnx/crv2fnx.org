In fairness, other people made an effort. It's just that Bulma has the resources of the worlds most capable tech corporation at her back, and her first quest for the dragonballs happened to lead her to Goku, of all people. So, between them, they pretty much wiped out or converted the competition.

Without access to dragonballs to study, Freeza still had an easy time hunting them down on Namek, just by virtue of the Namekians leaving the balls with village elders, and Freeza having scouters. By the time the Namekians caught on and attacked the scouters directly, there were only two dragonballs that freeza didn't already possess.

As the movies show, if someone were to actually do half a decent job of searching for them, no one would even notice, unless they happened to pull out the Dragon Radar for some reason. I suppose a security-minded Bulma would take a look at the dragon radar every week or so, just to be safe.
