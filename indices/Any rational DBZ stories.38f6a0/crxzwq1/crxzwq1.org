Okay, it hasn't been mentioned yet, so I feel required to point out "DBZ Abridged". I never watched the original shows, but this has me laughing out loud. To my surprise, I still ended up legitimately invested in the story anyways. Turns out if you cut out all the dead air and lengthy monologues, you're left with a half-decent story.
