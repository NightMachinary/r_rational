I remember one that started awhile back set from Gohan's perspective that seemed promising, since Gohan's the most studious/intelligent of the Z warriors, but I don't think it ever took off past a couple chapters. I think the universe itself is ripe for some rationalizing, what with the crazy technology (capsule corp, FTL travel, etc) especially if the superpowered humans start using their abilities for things other than fighting.
