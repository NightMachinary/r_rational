Not for long; it takes about three minutes or so to morph and demorph IIRC, so if you did that once per hour, and the entire three minutes of morphing and demorphing counted as your regular body (unlikely), you still wouldn't reach your bedtime level of tiredness for about two weeks. If you were willing to pull a virtual all-nighter, that's about five weeks.
