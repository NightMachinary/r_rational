It's hand-wavey. You're right that in a FULLY rationalist rewrite, I would need to delve deeper into this. In my brain, the way this is working is that the bulk of the energy expenditure comes in the transition---the building of the construct, setting up the hyperspace link, etc. That's why morphing exhaustion kicks in after multiple changes in rapid succession, but why sustained BEING IN morph doesn't cause similar problems.

Somewhat BS. My focus was elsewhere; this is an actual weakness of my chosen explanations. But I think (and hope others agree) that I got sufficient value out of putting thought elsewhere to make it the right move.

+1 for paying attention, though. =)
