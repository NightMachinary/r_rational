Oh, wow, I just realised, this explains how the Animorphs were able to wake up every two hours without feeling horrible the next day! Marco even used "Can't sleep lol" as his check-in message.

Of course he couldn't sleep; his morph copy was well rested and wide awake! I'd been wondering why they didn't mention how exhausting it was.
