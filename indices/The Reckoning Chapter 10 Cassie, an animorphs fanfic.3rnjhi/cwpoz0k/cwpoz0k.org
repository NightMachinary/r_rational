[Spoilers] Boy, this really opens up a can of worms. The physical body of a morph is itself a fully viable creature, completely controlled by the morpher's consciousness. That creates many intriguing parallels between the Yeerks and the Andalites.

Is a morph held in stasis in z-space the same way a morpher's body is? That would seem to make sense, and explain how the morphing process actually functions.

Can the morph learn new information, or does it get reset every time it's used? The fact that wounds completely disappear indicates the latter.

Cassie's newfound ability to go on autopilot seems a bit like releasing control of the morph body. Since Jake is essentially in a coma right now, does that mean that his body is still being controlled by "morpher-Jake", who is now dead? If "morpher-Jake" had put himself on autopilot before dying, would "morph-Jake" be awake and active right now? The Elfangor morph's reaction indicates he was fully aware while being controlled by Cassie, so "morph-Jake" is fully conscious, but completely unable to move his body. He may have a permanent case of locked-in syndrome.
