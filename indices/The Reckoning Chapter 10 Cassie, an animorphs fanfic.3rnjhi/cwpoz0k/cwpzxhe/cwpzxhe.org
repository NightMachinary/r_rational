I like your train of thought but I think it's too soon to assume that the Elfangor morph is a copy of Elfangor brain and consciousness. I think it's more likely that the reaction we see is some sort of automatic Andalite anti-yeerk body modification, as opposed to being a full copy of Elfangor himself.
