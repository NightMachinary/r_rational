Yeah, I agree that this is more likely to be some self-modification done by andalites, especially andalite soldiers, to instinctively kill themselves the moment a yerk looses control over them.

If this was really a display of Elfangor's memories he would remember the last moments before Cassie acquired him and know that he's really Cassie in morph.

There is no way that the Andalites didn't know what happens when you morph into another andalite and then you go into autopilot mode. Elfangor would have been prepared for this happening if it was actually the case and not immediately tried to kill himself/Cassie
