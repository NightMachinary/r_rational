I've put the most thought into the Andalites and the Yeerks. Yeerks are as-significantly-different as Andalites, though we haven't seen much of that on-screen yet.

Hork Bajir will remain basically unchanged in terms of external morphology. I haven't given any particular thought yet to their psychological or sociological stuff, but I agree that it makes more sense to change those than to leave them the same.

Taxxons were, iirc, literally exactly a particular species of caterpillar/centipede, just blown up to ridiculous size. I sort of loved that---the alienness of something completely Terran, and will probably leave them unchanged. They won't have any sort of hive mind, though, because I'm saving those points for elsewhere in the series.

Leerans were froggy, not humanoid, I think. They'll continue being weird, and may or may not be relevant in a larger sense, though V3 definitely has and uses a Leeran morph. Trivia: where in the story has a Leeran morph already appeared?

You'll note that the Chee are significantly different (not doglike, not humanlike, six-limbed with no heads), and there are major changes to the Pemalites that will be quite important to the story in time.

HOWLERS.

ARN.

CRAYAK.

I'll likely throw in at least one or two alien species of my own invention, just on general principle.

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A HELMACRON.
