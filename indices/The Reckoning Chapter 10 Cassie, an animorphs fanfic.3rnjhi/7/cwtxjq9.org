Cassie managed to discover the backdoor/autopilot switch after about a week of continuous experimentation. But we are told that the andalite military doesn't know about it in Esplin/Alloran's internal monologue. This leads to a few possibilities:

- The andalites never experimented to that degree with morphing, which seems unlikely in the extreme given this version of the andalite military seems far more competent/ruthless

- Alternatively the 'autopilot' option for nonsentient animals is known about and used by andalite military, but not the option to activate memories of sentient creatures

- -Possible explanation, morphing other sentients is uncommon or tabboo (i can definitely see there being a law/tabboo against mophing another andalite, but seems less likely with aliens given their known disdain for other species)

- Alternatively this option is not possible for most andalites that use the morphing power for whatever reason. Maybe Cassie has a unique talent in morphing, like in canon that has allowed her to unlock it.

- Or Elfangors morphing device was in some way different from the standard one, it would be in character for him to have jailbroken it in some way (maybe that would be necessary to give the power to non-andalites, ) but it didn't seem like he knew this would happen, or he would have said something.
