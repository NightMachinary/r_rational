More centipede/scorpion-esque, though not actually armored/segmented. The four legs are shorter, and the arms are longer, along the lines of insects that alternate between using their forelimbs as legs and as pincers. This makes them less delicate/more muscular than in canon, allowing for a six-legged sprint/skitter.

Because of this, the torso is often downward-facing, meaning that the front eyes point down toward the ground and slightly forward (like you looking where your feet are going when you're on rugged terrain). The nostrils are similarly on the front, where they can easily access the ground. There's no neck, and not MUCH of a "head," but there is a cranium and the brain is there, in the front, close to the nostrils and the eyes.

Speaking of eyes, that's how we got the stalk eyes---the creature had four, and two of them migrated up and out, becoming capable of 360 vision. So your main eyes point down, and your stalk eyes point everywhere else.

There's a highly flexible joint in the spine that allows for centauring, not as a default, but as an easy switch a la apes switching from knuckle walking to upright walking. The whole chest/arm/head thing can come up to 90 degrees from the rest of the spine and balance without needing to exert constant muscular effort.

To balance this, the tail is much longer and thicker---it's an actual counterweight for when the arms are no longer supporting the torso. It's long enough to strike forward over the shoulder even when the head is down (i.e. it's longer than the whole rest of the body put together).

I think those are the main things. Still eats through the feet, still furred, still blue. Still has ears (pointy).
