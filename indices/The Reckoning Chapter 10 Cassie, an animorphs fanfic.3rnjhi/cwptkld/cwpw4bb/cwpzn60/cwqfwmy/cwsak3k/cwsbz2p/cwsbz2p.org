!!Cool!!

It's pretty close. Things I would change: - No neck, so the transition from body to head is unrelated to the shoulders. The head should just be a taper or a dome, I think, and it' either a little farther on from the shoulders, or the eyes are in a more "chest" position. - Main eyes are good. I think nostril should be higher, either centered between them or even "above" such that it's foremost when in the lowered mode (like a dog's snout). Rear eyes should be further behind, on the "back" of the skull, such that they're up and free when the torso is down. - Whole thing should be SLIGHTLY beefier. Like, one weight class up, in wrestling? This looks like Ax rather than like Elfangor, if that makes sense.

You are good at drawing! And at concepting! Thanks for this, and if you feel like doing another version, thanks for that, too---it'll make me really happy!
