Interesting! I like the change, makes them definitively more alien.

Have you any thoughts on the other alien species? Asuming you are still sticking to broad strokes of canon:

- Hork Bajir seem to still be roughly humanoid, which makes sense anyway if they are an arboreal species. But theres no reason for them to stick so closely to human psychology, gender and social norms.

- Taxxons were already pretty alien, but you could do some interesting stuff with teh living hive that was briefly mentioned in the andelite chronicles. Though you might want to avoid the hive mind insect species cliche

- No real reason for the Leeran's to be roughly humanoid as they were in canon. Maybe something more octopus/jellyfish like? Could maybe tie the mind reading into electrical signal detection via their tentacles

- Those are the only ones I know canonically exist in this version, have you decided anything about the more obscure species?
