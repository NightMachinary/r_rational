I don't agree with those who say Cassie is too OOC. She's not acting as a human who beats up animals for cruelty, she's acting as a human who's buried within an animal who chooses to attack other animals for somewhat pragmatic and somewhat emotional reasons. She took care to avoid seriously injuring the animals she fought with, and that seems like a realistic amount of concern for someone training for war. For her to do this certainly requires a reinterpretation of her canon character, but I don't think it's an unreasonable one.
