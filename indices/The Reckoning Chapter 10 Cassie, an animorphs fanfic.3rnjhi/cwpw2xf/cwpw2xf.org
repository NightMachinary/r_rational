Several interesting possibilities from this.

1. Given sentience and language persist, this seems to indicate that memories should be accessible from the morph, at least if you can get cooperation.

2. What memories/personality/etc would a human-hybrid morph have? Some/all from both sources, none, or just whatever Cassie thinks they should?

3. Given her ability to simply alter markings without needing to find an alternative morph, could Cassie create child/genderbent/different race morphs of people?

4. Since morphs are capable of sentience and can be acquired... can you give morphing powers to a morph? Doing so, Cassie could literally embody her entire team and Elfangor to get everyone's input/memories/skills accessible at once. Is Cassie going to become Echo from Dollhouse?

5. How different are attributes such as outer markings and internal attributes? Can Cassie acquire herself and then morph herself but incrementally smarter? If this can also be combined with giving morphs the ability to morph, then Cassie can become her own one-woman singularity.

Personality corrections:

- Cassie picking fights with animals in no way seems right, even with PTSD.

- Cassie eating meat, even in-morph, seems out of character for her. I also likely would have expected her to be vegan, rather than not-even-quite vegetarian. A section showing her handling a morph that she eats in while on autopilot in a similar manner to how Tobias handled his transformation into more hawk than human (initially fear/disgust, then shame, and finally acceptance) might help with this characterization?

- Cassie retreating from everyone /does/ seem in character as a manner of coping with all of her loss.

- Including more descriptions of what the morphs feel like from the inside might make it feel more Cassie-like, as I generally identify her with being more observant and aware of non-critical facts than the others, like the feathers itching as they turn to 3d or even just the mental pressure that the fly feels towards really wanting to play in that pile of poop. (The latter may not be valid with the new form of morphing, since it seems like the whole "overwhelming instincts" from the original books is no longer present.)
