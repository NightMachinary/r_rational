I feel like I've spoted a plot (technology?) hole, but my very casual check isn't backing it up very well.

When he's giving them morphing powers, Elfangor says

#+begin_quote
  The technology draws its power from the background radiation of the universe, which is not present outside of normal space.
#+end_quote

/How long/ does it take to recharge? And, plot-hole-wise, could it recharge in the proportionally tiny amount of time Cassie was spending out of morph?
