Point of contention: the ideas given for getting rich from sideways gravity are not significant. One human's weight worth of acceleration applied to a truck or plane will matter so little it won't save much money at all. Further, if it only works in one direction (relative to the Earth, like say, due East) you would only gain energy when going in that direction, and would either lose energy when making a return trip, or would have to circumnavigate the globe in order to make a net positive.

A 60 kg man pushing a jet travelling at 800 km/hr would produce 48 megaJoules of energy per hour, which could presumably be used to reduce the amount of fuel it needed. Based on the energy density of Jet fuel could replace about 1 kg of Jet Fuel, assuming 100% efficiency rates. A quick googling says Jet fuel costs about $5.21 per gallon, which means a kg is about a third of that, or $1.74.

So, assuming he could find a series of jets already planning to travel around the world in about the same direction as his gravity, he could save them all about $1.74 per hour in fuel costs. I imagine if you built an electric generator that looped around the world that could harness his gravity as electricity you'd earn a similar amount when compared to a gasoline powered generator.

The only exploitable thing here is that technically power scales as force * speed, so the faster he's already going the more power he produces from the same force. Theoretically an advanced society could build such a generator with a vacuum tube and allow him to accelerate him to relativistic speeds before generating electricity and it'd be a much higher rate, but it would take some insane infrastructure to make.
