No that's not what I'm going for, but I was similarly confused over the original game. The point of the game is to give the player characters authority and autonomy and allow them to decide how to use it when they're job is to protect people from subtle evils. That doesn't mean they have to follow the philosophy the NPCs expect them to serve, the point of the setting is to provide social context. It's a launching pad for character drama and moral choices.
