[[/twiponder][]] Okay, so, let me get this straight - in the original game, you have sorcerers and demon-possessed people wandering around, mixing in with ordinary people and being hard to tell apart; and the players, as people with the authority to shoot at Evil Things, wander around trying to spot any hidden Evil Things which they can then either shoot or turn to Good Things, right? And half the problem is that the Evil Things are good at hiding and pretending to be Good Things?
