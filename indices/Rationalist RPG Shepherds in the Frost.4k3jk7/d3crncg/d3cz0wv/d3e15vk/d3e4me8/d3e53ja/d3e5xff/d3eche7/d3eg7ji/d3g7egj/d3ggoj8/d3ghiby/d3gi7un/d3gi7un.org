What better kind of dramatic role playing is there? Dogs is, to me, all about playing characters who serve a black and white morality with deliberate values dissonance having to make controversial decisions to protect their communities, why would Shepherds be any different just because they believe in science and rationality? It's even possible that Reason isn't completely rational due to the knowledge lost in the apocalypse, but I'm leaving that ambiguous.
