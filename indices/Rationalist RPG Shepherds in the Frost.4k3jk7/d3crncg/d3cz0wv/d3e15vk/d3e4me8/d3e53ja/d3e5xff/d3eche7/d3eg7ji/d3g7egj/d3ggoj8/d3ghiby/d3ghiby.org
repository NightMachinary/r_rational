Yeah, but how is a Shepherd supposed to know whether it's him going wrong, and not an entire community going wrong around him? And a group of Shepherds is just another type of (very small) community...

And, often, the Shepherd /is/ going to be the ultimate immediately available authority on matters of Fallacy and/or other Doctrine - at least while out in the field.

So... I think that "shepherds going rogue" is almost inevitable... which is probably what you want, because it sets up all sorts of dilemmas for the players to have to deal with, I guess.
