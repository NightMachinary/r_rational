  I imagine them being as self righteous and determined as HJPEV

I was going to say, this sounds like some of the worst aspects of MoR. Right here you're describing something that was a turnoff even for a lot of people in the LW community. Notice how e.g. Alexander Wales' stuff is pretty pro-rational, but doesn't carry the self-righteousness.

  While the title does have a religious connotation, I thought it would make sense for the Shepherds to believe the apocalypse happened due to people acting irrational and rejecting the advice of those who knew better.

I'm not saying, "Title is religious, therefore your version of the game must be religious." I'm saying, "Title does actually have meaning, so it isn't a point in your favor to make a title that just sounds deep but doesn't actually have an intended meaning."

I like the gist of things--feels like a proactive Canticle for Leibowitz, maybe--but the execution, like I say above, feels overly close to the Author Tract qualities of HPMOR. In other words, if you look at some of the most popular r!fic to come out after HPMOR, there are some qualities that they've left on the wayside, and this concept seems to be picking them up rather than passing them by.

(I'm also not sure whether this really counts as anything more than a reskin of a preexisting game, and if that's all that's needed for a "rational roleplaying game" then I'm pretty sure that some already exist.)
