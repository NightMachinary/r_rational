You should probably know what your title means. The original game's title refers to the "Vineyard of the Lord," which is a running theme in Jewish, Christian, and Mormon scripture, starting with Isaiah but becoming most prominent in Mormon-exclusive scripture (the "allegory of the olive tree").

It wasn't just picked out because it sounded neat.

As for the rest of it: I like the initial idea, but the way it's being carried out is pretty heavy-handed. If this were Objectivism rather than Rationalism then it'd be Atlas Shrugged: The RPG.

Why is "Shepherd" being used? Why would (presumably nontheistic) aspiring rationalists use such explicitly religious terminology?

How are you going to represent the often complex causes of fanaticism? More than anything else, I'm worried that some issues are going to be given a very simplistic (and boring) treatment.

Where is the risk for bias among the Shepherds, or how does that come into play? One of the worst things for an aspiring rationalist to do is to forget about the "aspiring" part, or to think that any human can be get to a point where "aspiring" no longer needs to be appended.
