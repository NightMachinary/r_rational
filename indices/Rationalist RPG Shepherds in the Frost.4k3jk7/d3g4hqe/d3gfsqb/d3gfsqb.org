Congratulations, you have created an interesting myth arc for a campaign. Like the default setting, many details are left ambiguous for the players to develop at they go. The Dogs duty is to fight injustice, Sin, and False Doctrine that can take the form of rebellion. There's the corrupt and decadent Back East the Faithful fled from to escape discrimination, but they are still under the governance of the Territorial Authority that doesn't condone the Dogs' actions.

I figure something similar can easily be worked into this setting. Communities outside the reach of the Shepherds Academy have collapsed or become dictatorships and theocracies. People's tendency to be Fallacious puts communities at risk of suffering the same fate. Many of the towns the Shepherds visit may already be like that, but they're allowed in as missionaries because the supplies, technology, and knowledge they bring are so valuable.
