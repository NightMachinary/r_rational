Who will guard the guardians? Assuming technological and organizational superiority Shepherds can keep their dominant position for some long (but not indefinite) period of time. However the question remain - what would prevent organization from fracturing? In the real history somehow similar authority (USSR, French Revolutionary Government) was kept from fracturing by hostile external environment, with potential or actual enemies /always/ and /obviously/ surpassing it both military and economically. If there is no external enemy, constantly repeating large scale outbreaks of rebellions could be the similar in scale threat. But that would change the role of Shepherds from evangelists and enforcers to kind of gendarmerie. Or author can invent some kind of wonder tech to keep Shepherds in shape.
