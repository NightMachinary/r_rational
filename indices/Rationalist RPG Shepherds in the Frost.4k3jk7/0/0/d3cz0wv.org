You are correct, renaming concepts to fit a different ideology is exactly what I'm doing. Dogs has a very specific structure to its design that's mean to facilitate a particular kind of game, changing that structure would change that experience, which I already find engaging. The difference this setting makes is that the characters exist in a different cultural context, so their beliefs and interactions take on a different flavor, and the nature of the conflicts they encounter is different. Considering the Values Dissonance of the default setting, I though some would find this more palatable.
