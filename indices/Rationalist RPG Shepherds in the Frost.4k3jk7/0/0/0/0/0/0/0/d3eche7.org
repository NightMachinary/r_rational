  It is only your philosophy that declares them Evil, people can invite them out of genuinely good intentions.

Okay, I can see that working - the end does not justify the means and all. And you could make quite an entertaining philosophical game by setting up a situation where the player's sympathies will be with the villain, at least at first. I can even see how rational-thinking type scenarios could work in the original game.

But "good" and "evil" don't map simply to "rational" and "irrational". It is quite possible to be rational and evil (Voldemort in HPMOR being a prime example); because "good" and "evil" are characterised mainly by empathy, while "rational" and "irrational" are characterised mainly by effectiveness.
