I may not have explained this effectively, and I didn't get this impression from the game the first time I read it, but the philosophy your characters serve does not describe the metaphysics of the setting. The Faith preaches that committing Sin allows Demons to attack the town and turn women infertile, but that isn't necessarily true just because people believe it. Town creation merely describes the theological interpretation of the situation the town is in.

I didn't adequately explain that Reason basically preaches science and utilitarian humanism, where it is virtuous to preserve human life and teach things that accurately reflect reality. A Scholar is one who is responsible for teaching others what to believe and how to think, while a Shepherd passes judgment on people's decisions and what should be done in response. If Scholars are priests and monks, Shepherds are crusaders and witch hunters. But for science!
