Alright, I can see how that could make an interesting and engaging post-apocalyptic roleplay centred around a cult founded on dressing itself up to look like rationality with little if any understanding of certain core principles, and with an underlying theme of moral dilemmas that need to be resolved. (It doesn't sound at all ambiguous to me that they've lost something important in the apocalypse).
