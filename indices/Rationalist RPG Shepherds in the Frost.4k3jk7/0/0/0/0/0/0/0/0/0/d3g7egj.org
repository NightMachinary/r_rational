Hmmm. Okay, so it's less a game about shooting demons and more a game about moral dilemmas, then. And... you're proposing a cult, that's come across the basic trappings of the rationality movement, and internalised them? So, from their point of view, the two greatest evils are bad premises (usually due to bad data) and bad logic, and the Shepherd basically has the authority to do anything he likes in order to weed out both bad data and bad logic?

...then the greatest threat to this civilisation is, surely, a Shepherd that's making a mistake. A Shepherd that takes fact A and fact B, reaches erroneous conclusion C, and then /doesn't listen to anyone who tries to correct him/ because he is a Shepherd, he is therefore /right/, and he has the full authority to punish anyone who disagrees with him.

Following on from this, it seems that the obvious reaction of your average fellow, on meeting a Shepherd, is to agree with everything the Shepherd says and/or run away as quickly as possible...
