[[/hmmm][]] Okay, so then you end up with a game that promotes memes associated with the idea of rationalism?

Aside from the promotion of said memes, is there any way in which your proposed RPG could be considered more "rational" than the original? (It /looks/ - from the point of view of someone who knows nothing of the original RPG you're basing this off - like your proposed game will strongly encourage the idea of shooting irrational people in the face, which seems to me more cathartic than educational. I mean, that's fine if that's the sort of game you're going for...).
