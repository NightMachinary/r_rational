My rationale for why the Shepherds are so heavy handed is that I imagine them being as self righteous and determined as HJPEV, and considering all of civilization has collapsed and much of humanity is at risk of descending into barbarism I thought the heavy handedness of their methods would be considered acceptable or even necessary. The final step on the ladder in both settings is Hate and Murder, where people in the community start killing others and justify it with their beliefs. The Shepherds seek to stop this madness.

While the title does have a religious connotation, I thought it would make sense for the Shepherds to believe the apocalypse happened due to people acting irrational and rejecting the advice of those who knew better. Therefore, the principle of Scholarship (similar to Stewardship in the original game) demands they take action to protect and help those who don't know as they do and educate them as best they can. Each town has its own Scholar, who serves a role not unlike a priest.

If that seems unlike rationalists to you, then that could make for interesting roleplaying. Even in the original game, the point of the Faith is not tell the players the right thing to do, but to provide a cultural context for their actions and decisions. The Shepherds may very well be a religious order that happens to worship science and technology, but it's your choice for how your character views them. If a character is biased, then that would be represented on their character sheet under Traits and Relationships.

Looking at the way the game handles Demonic Possession, I thought it would work well for representing Fanaticism. Demons are purely non-physical in the default game and, aside from possession, don't have any special powers beyond what could be attributed to natural causes. Possession itself also has strict limitations that mean it can only happen to practitioners of False Doctrine, and must be intentionally triggered by the person about to be possessed or one of their leaders.

I think Fanatics can be modeled this way, since it supports both people choosing it of their own will and being pressured into it by others. It comes down to the GM to write and play the NPCs, though it can happen to the players too if they want. Of course, Demons/Fanatics are a completely optional tool for the GM to use. The town creation rules just provide structure to creating a situation for the players to enter, after that it's just character drama, moral choices, and problem solving that's completely player-driven.
