One thing I forgot to mention about the game is that the philosophy the players are expected to uphold is supposed to be controversial. The Faith explicitly advocates sexism and homophobia, which I admit turned me off the game at first. Eventually I realized the designers wanted players to get outside their own head when playing characters. You had to consider how someone's moral compass would be colored by growing up under strict social expectations, and the GM was explicitly advised to challenge the characters beliefs and allow the players to challenge social norms.

Dogs in the Vineyard, to me, is ultimately about being social conservatives facing challenges to their community and the ideals that hold it together. With Shepherds in the Frost, I want to deliver the opposite experience. The fundamental goal of science is to uncover the true and destroy the false. As Shepherds, you are the ultimate rebels against tradition. You look at the world and say, "this is wrong, we must do better or people will die", and try to change things. You are free from the judgement of any but yourself, but have the power to pass judgment on others. What will you do with it?
