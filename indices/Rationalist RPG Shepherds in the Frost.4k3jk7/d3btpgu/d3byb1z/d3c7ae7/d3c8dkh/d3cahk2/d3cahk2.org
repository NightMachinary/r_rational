By "rationalist RPG", I didn't mean that the game fits the principles of rationality or rational fiction, but appears to be made for rationalists to play. It places them in situations where they are expected to use their knowledge and reasoning abilities to make intelligent decisions with the best possible outcomes. I co-opted that aspect of HPMOR as a way to justify the players having the in-universe authority they do, since that authority is an essential element of the original game. It is a reskin in a different setting, which I thought would be of interest to this community.
