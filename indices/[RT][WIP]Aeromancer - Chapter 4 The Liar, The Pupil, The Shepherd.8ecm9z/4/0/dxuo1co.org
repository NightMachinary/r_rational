Haha, okay I'll talk about this here because I don't think I'll bring it up again (or if I do, it'll be more of a passing thought).

Let me quote chapter 3 and give my thoughts why I wrote something a certain way:

#+begin_quote
  "Bah, he has no stress. Regardless," Elder Poe started, taking a glance at Seti, "there is a risk to bringing the... uninitiated into the temple."
#+end_quote

Here Elder Poe is worried about bringing the "uninitiated" into the temple (this was his way of worrying that their identity could come into light)

#+begin_quote
  [Faulkner] grinned through the cigarette in his mouth. "Do you know who I am?"

  Seti shook his head. He had difficulty identifying people he already knew as it was, so a stranger he may have seen in the past was definitely out of the question. Sydria also shook her head.

  "I am Faulkner. Does that ring any bells?" The young master was expectant. Though called the young master, he wasn't young in the way that Seti thought; in fact, he was probably the blindfold woman's age.

  Again the two siblings shook their head. *The elders exchanged glances.*

  "Ah, I'll pretend I'm not disappointed. Our temple may or may not have been on a reality TV show a few years back, but I suppose all fame dies out eventually. Now then, with whom am I speaking?"
#+end_quote

This part specifically, from my view, was them checking to see if Faulkner was recognized by them. He played it off when he realized that they didn't, but if they had then who knows what would've happened o.o

So no, I don't think he was actually on a reality show lol
