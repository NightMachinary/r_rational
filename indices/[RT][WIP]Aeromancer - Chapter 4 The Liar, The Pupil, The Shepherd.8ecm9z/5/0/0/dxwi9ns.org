No, I wasn't asking about the number of tiers or what differentiates them. My question was very briefly worded, so I apologize for being unclear.

I was asking about the comparative population sizes. Is it uniform with equal numbers for each tier, linear with each tier being half of the size of the prior tier, logarithmic with exponentially smaller tiers the higher you go, or something else.
