Oh, I understand now. No, it isn't equal or linear. I haven't touched on any of this yet, but certain mancy types are drastically less than others. So for example, there are more wind users in tier 1-4 than fire users simply because fire can reach tier 5 easier. And there is a "limit cap" or whatever, which makes 7s and 8s be fewer in count by a drastic amount.

EDIT: The idea that there are fewer higher rank tiers is mostly true, but certain exceptions apply (like there being no fire users that are tier 1 or 2, or something like that, just by sheer mechanics of how it works).

Tiers come into play a lot more when the Prestige stuff starts so hopefully that'll satisfy these kinds of questions.

Thanks!
