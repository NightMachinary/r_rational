I'll quote several spots from the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  On a scale of one to eight
#+end_quote

And here's another:

#+begin_quote
  Sure, he daydreamed about being able to make tornados with his ability, or whatever the tier eight people could do...
#+end_quote

My goal was to imply that the tiers were set from 1 to 8. And finally,

#+begin_quote
  "I have more in common with the ants than to any of the upper echelon tiers" /// Anyone that was tier five or above received their mancer title. Everyone else was just an adept.
#+end_quote

So when somebody became an upper tier (5-8), they would be known as an aeromancer, pyromancer, and so on. The difference between each tier (like why is a 6 not a 7 and so on) hasn't been touched on yet since Seti is only a 1.

I hope I answered your question.
