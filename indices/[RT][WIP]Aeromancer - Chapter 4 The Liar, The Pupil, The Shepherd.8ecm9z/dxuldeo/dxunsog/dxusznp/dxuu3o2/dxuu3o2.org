Thanks for replying again! I wouldn't say you're overly heavily conditioning yourself based on Cassie's circumstance, as Seti uses that instance himself.

You are right to guess a more police force style rule (in a world of mancers everywhere), but I would be curious to know your thoughts in the future when more details come around as to why some even view the Shepherds as the hero/cool people.

Thanks for reading the story up til now!
