  maybe there was an actual, independent, publicly accountable oversight and authorization process that enabled them to take Seti into custody, but it sure doesn't seem that way.

Why wouldn't it seem that way? Could you go further into why you think the Shepherds are worryingly powerful? In real life, most people do not know the checks and balances of police officers. They only know that usually they need a warrant to search private areas, but otherwise can make an arrest or detain people with the badge. And in real life, lawyers are presented only after the arrest to ensure the rights are known.

In the same vein, a Shepherd is a known entity. We know that there is a law regarding geases (the AVC Act, mentioned during the "arrest"), so the Shepherd's rights could be attached to that.

As for checks and balances, I haven't done any world building (and ultimately, the government) towards that end except to mention that there are Guilds that are different from the Shepherds.
