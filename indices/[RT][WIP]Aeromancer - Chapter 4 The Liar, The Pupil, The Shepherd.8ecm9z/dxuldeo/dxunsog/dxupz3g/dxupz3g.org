  Why wouldn't it seem that way?

Realistically, for the same reason that many people don't actually buy those same systems of supposed checks and balances in real life police forces.

Giving groups of people power over others requires real, difficult, work to prevent it from degenerating into self-serving corruption and power plays and the like.

(This may not be the argument the other poster was making.)

As for worryingly powerful, in general the police in our world (at least in the US) have to at least make up some sort of crime that you personally have committed in order to essentially "force you to go with them" against your will. It seems probable that "suspicion of being under a geas" would likely be this world's equivalent of "I thought they had a gun and/or drugs", except if only drug dealers could determine that you had possession of drugs, or arms dealers were the only ones who could determine that you had a gun.

This is of course assuming that only a vivimancer could determine whether or not another vivimancer placed a geas on someone, along with potentially not being able to determine whether or not any given vivimancer is able to place geases (?).

From the events shown thus far, that doesn't seem like an unreasonable conclusion to make, even if the world as it exists is wildly different from this. At a minimum, it seems like the correct perspective for our MC to have, given the events in his life as we've seen them.
