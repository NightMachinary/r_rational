The story is coming along nicely so far.

Two suggestions:

First, cut back on using proper names; intersperse them with descriptors. For instance, "Shanna" could be "the geomancer," or "the blindfolded woman," or "the terse woman," or "the woman in the suit," or... the list could go on and on. It makes the story feel less repetitive, and, at the same time, reminds us who these other characters are. Remember that it's been several days since we've read your story; it's not a bad idea to subtly re-establish who everyone is in the reader's mind at the start of each chapter. I was picturing Faulkner as an old, frail wizard type until I went back a chapter and found out he was young and muscular.

The second note is much the same as the first: sometimes the progression of events could be made clearer, if you'd tie what's currently happening back to previous occurrences a bit more. I think just using descriptors will help a lot with that, but also don't be afraid, even this early, to draw parallels between what is happening now and what happened one or two chapters ago. For instance, Seti recognizes Elder Narn from the previous chapter; in that chapter, the Elder doesn't seem happy that the MC is staying. So, when the grump throws a nasty glance at the new pupil, Seti can remember the disdain from the previous chapter and speculate on why that is. And by doing so, you're both reminding the reader of what they may have forgotten (who Elder Narn is and what happened last chapter), as well as providing a sense of continuity with earlier events.

Other than those small notes, you seem to be doing a good job telling your story thus far. Keep it up!
