In terms of my impression of the Shepherds, I think I'm conditioning (perhaps overly heavily) based on their treatment of Cassie (blackmailing someone with a demonstrated propensity to violating some pretty severe taboos and laws into working /with/ them), but it seems the Shepherds are a "power at any cost" organization. They take advantage of whatever leverage they have in order to maintain their power and control over at least other mancers, though I would expect that it extends beyond that.

The Shepherds powers displayed here (arresting and detaining someone for a moderately extended period of time) are on the extreme end of what I'd expect a society to tolerate from a police force and certainly not without the detainee being able to exert some resistance or demand for justification to be evaluated by a third party.

And, yeah, for most people it's an unfortunate fact of life that encounters with law enforcement and the judicial system can see them railroaded through the system without a real understanding of their rights and options to oppose police actions.

For rich, educated people with lawyers on retainer, however, the approach is usually to push back, resist, and counter-threaten the police the whole way. Seti certainly seems used to relying on his father's wealth and influence in other matters (leaving a note to contact the company to repair the table Aiden damaged), so if even /he/ more or less crumples and assumes there's nothing that can be done to gainsay the word of a Shepherd /at the first time he's been made aware of potential action against him/, then there's really must be very little that can be done.
