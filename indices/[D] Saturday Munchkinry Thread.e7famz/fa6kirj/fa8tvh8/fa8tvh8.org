I'm not sure if it is against some unspoken assumptions, but why not let open space do the work for you? It's what they did in the real 1800s. A couple of acres of scrubland that's a few miles away from any neighbors seems to fulfill all the requirements.

Explosions will blow up a shack you're mixing things up in, but if they're all dozens of yards away from each other you're fine. If you're doing anything particularly volatile you just pick a spot outside and do it there. Any gas leaks dissipate before they hit any people. Toxic substances will diffuse into the environment.

Nobody can come sabotage or steal things, since you're a couple hours away (at least) from any civilization. Depending on where you situate things, any infiltrators can be seen an hour+ before they arrive at your compound.
