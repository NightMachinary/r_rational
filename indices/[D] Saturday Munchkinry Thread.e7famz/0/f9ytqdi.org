Dear rational, please abuse the following ability:

You have the ability to temporarily shrink down to a height of 12 centimeters, or any height between that and your real height.

- Mass & inertia is adjusted by same scale Your strength & durability are square-cube adjusted to match real animals of that size
- Your mind remains the same
- You can only shrink things other than yourself that in some way more than 50% hang off you, so not shoes when worn, but a lever trailing on the ground would be shrunk. In zero gravity, you would be able to shrink anything up to 1000xyour original mass.
- You can't grow things that haven't already been shrunk to that extent- things have a 'natural' size.
- You don't have any wealth other than derived from this ability
- You cannot reveal that you have this ability
