This is one of the best modern ventilation safety tactics, but it would probably be impossible if OP is serious about restricting the technology to ~1800.

In the early 1800s the only method for forced air circulation in buildings was the maintenance of fires at the bottom of tall shafts (such as fireplace flues or stairwells) that would heat the air and thus continuously draw it upwards. This air circulation was unreliable and could be easily disrupted by leaving doors or windows open. Mechanical ventilation (in the form of steam-driven fans) didn't exist in practical form until the 1840s.^{[[https://web.archive.org/web/20160121152758/http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/8_Engineers%20Contractors%20and%20Industrial%20Construction/Bruegmann_Central.pdf][(source)]]}
