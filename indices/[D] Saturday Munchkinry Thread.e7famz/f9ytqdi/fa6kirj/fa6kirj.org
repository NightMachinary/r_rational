How would you design a building to be resistant to frequent explosions and toxic substance leaks?

Requirements:

- incidents will only originate in laboratories
- incidents can destroy a laboratory, but should be contained to a single room. An explosion should not be able to destroy a neighboring laboratory (barring extreme cases) and toxic gas should not be able to escape the laboratory
- protecting the people in an incident-creating laboratory is not required
- usage of modern tech is permissible but strongly discouraged

  - "modern" is anything invented after ~1800
  - no computers

- Explosions can be:

  - pressure
  - light (including invisible radiation)
  - electricity
  - any other form of energy
  - the size of explosions ranges from something like a grenade to enough energy (if released as a normal pressure explosion) to destroy a small house

- Toxic substances can be:

  - toxic gases, like mustard gas or carbon monoxide
  - flaming substances, like napalm or white phosphorus
  - cold substances, like liquid nitrogen or CO2 slush
  - corrosive liquids, like acids or bases
  - flammable (but unlit) gases, like hydrogen or methane
  - flaming liquids, like gasoline
  - any of these combined, or any other substance you can think of (regardless of when it was invented)

    - there will be no nanotech or other machinery

- designs should be resistant to sabotage
- accidents are random and the results of the accidents are not intelligent or possessed of desires. liquids flow downhill, gases diffuse normally, etc

Thoughts?
