You haven't listed a speed - how long it takes to go from max to min height - so I'll assume faster than light movement/height change. Hold a magnet and generate explosions from air friction to generate tons of free energy and sell the energy for tons of money.

If it's slow, shrink barrels of rocket fuel and make an absolute shit ton of money.
