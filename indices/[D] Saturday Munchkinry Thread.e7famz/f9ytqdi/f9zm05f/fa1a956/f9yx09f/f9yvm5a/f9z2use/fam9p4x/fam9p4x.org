- Objects in free fall are, in fact, in zero gravity due to the workings of Einsteinian physics. Anyone who wants to shrink 1000x their mass may do so by taking a short drop with this material. Since mass and inertia are also impacted by this, you would not get crushed by the newly-shrunk material.

- Strength and durability increase have enormous potential. A large 3D-printed shape made from common plastic could be converted into a nigh-indestructible device for use in surgery, micro-electronics, or other super-fine scale manufacturing.

- This effect presumably works on microbes embedded on and in your body; otherwise, it would outright kill you. (Our bodies have around 2% of our mass in microbes. A 12cm version of a 180cm adult would be 1/15 scale, or about 0.03% original body mass.) This suggests a route to circumvent the 50% rule -- embedding the creatures or objects to shrink within the body. (Ew.)

- The above point gets even more broken when you consider that your blood is a part of your body. A thin coat of this substance will therefore allow you to entirely dodge the 50% limiter, albeit in a very nasty way.
