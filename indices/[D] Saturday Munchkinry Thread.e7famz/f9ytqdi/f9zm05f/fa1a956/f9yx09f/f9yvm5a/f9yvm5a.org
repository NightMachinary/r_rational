Incorporate weights into the top half of my shoes so I can wear shoes. If I let go of an object while shrunk, does it unshrink? If I shrink radioactive material, does this conserve total radiation or radiation per volume? I can shrink wings to fly.

How is the last point implemented? Do people spontaneously forget the ability if they observe it or I tell them? Do I lose the ability if anyone figures out that I have it? What if a camera sees it?
