Shrinking CPUs might make them 15 times faster and much more efficient.

As far as I understand, the simple way to build very, very small machines (Build a machine that builds a smaller copy of itself, repeat) fails on the step where the product must be more accurate than the producer. With me involved, the machine can build a copy of itself that is 14 times larger than itself and 14 times less accurate, and then I shrink it by a factor of 15. Nanotech, yo. At the molecular level, it's also sure to come in handy that the machine is made of atoms 15 times smaller than the raw materials. And the nanoswarm can't possibly eat the planet because I'm needed to shrink each batch :)

Surgically lengthen my bones to increase my shrinking factor.
