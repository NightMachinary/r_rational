You said use of modern technology is discouraged, but you could probably still take inspiration for best practices from real life building code requirements for hazardous locations.

For example, here's a [[https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/article-interpreting-requirements-of-articles-500-516-of-nec-appleton-en-518452.pdf][decently thorough outline]] of the portion of the National Electrical Code (NEC) in the United States which covers requirements for the different classes of locations containing flammable/explosion prone materials. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also has a [[https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9884&p_table=standards][set of rules]] that apply, and The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has [[https://www.nfpa.org/Codes-and-Standards/All-Codes-and-Standards/List-of-Codes-and-Standards][many code standards]] that would be applicable. [[https://karafire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Standard-NFPA-45-2004.pdf][NFPA 45]], "Standard on Fire Protection for Laboratories Using Chemicals", would probably be relevant.
