Very interesting question.

How big single lab room should be?

You've given a lot of requirements, but everything comes down just to having strong, and preferrably hermetic walls.

1. Find the optimal wall structure (thickness versus strenght versus material used versus cost), most likely wall will be made of different layers
2. Add an entrance chamber with disinfection system to each room with two heavy vault doors. Every lab room should have at least two entrance chambers.
3. Equip each room with separate air conditioning, water supply systems, etc, in order to minize the connections with the outside
4. Arrange labs and halls (with extra vault doors) in such a way that a lockdown of a biggert part of facility is possible in the worst case scenario when single lab walls fails to contain the danger
5. Actively watch and monitor situation in halls and in every room

That's the basic idea, of course it could be extended and improved.
