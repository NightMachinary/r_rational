As for gas leaks, negative pressure ensures that the gas stays in the room in an emergency, while still giving you ventilation on regular days. Oxygen masks can protect experimenters from inhaled poisons or particles (but not from acidic gas). The exits can have an airlock if necessary, but that edges on modern tech.

The biggest fear I'd have in this setup would be slow-acting problems like disease, but the CDC uses negative pressure combined with air filtration to ensure nothing gets out.
