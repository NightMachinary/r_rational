I think Akua has something similar to what the Dead King used to turn his people undead, except on a far smaller scale, confined to one city. A necromantic circle of sorts. It would explain why Akua's soldiers turn undead after being struck down. It also makes me wonder if that was the rune Apprentice saw, not a rune for the flying fortress like it seemed at the start. If so, it could raise some speculation about the Name he would have transited into.
