Easily one of the best chapters, if a bonus. I'd love to see more chapters from Malicia's perspective in the future, as well as the rest of the Calamities. It's fun watching Catherine grow into her Name, but there's always something satisfying about watching people with decades of experience in the field use their abilities to the fullest.
