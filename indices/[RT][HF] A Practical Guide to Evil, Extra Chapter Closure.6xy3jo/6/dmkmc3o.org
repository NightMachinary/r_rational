If Akua is Malicia's unknowing accomplice and is expected to fail against Catherine (after using whatever WMD she has set up), Malicia clearly has good reason to think Cat wins and is probably trying to ensure it. Its going to more than just faith in Cat's ability.

So do you think that if we keep an eye on whoever plays a pivital role in that victory we might find an overt mole for Malicia among the 15th or maybe an identity of Assassin (who is also possibly Scribe)?
