I don't even see that first one as a deathist argument. It is rational to be concerned that there is some maximum amount of life a human can bear before limitless ennui has set in. We don't know that isn't the case because nobody has lived that long to test it. A post-death society probably should have a protocol for irrecoverably erasing someone with their full consent and understanding, just to allay that concern. Maybe nobody ever uses it, but having it available doesn't hurt anything at all.
