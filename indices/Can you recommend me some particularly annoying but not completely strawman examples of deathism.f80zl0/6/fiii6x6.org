Euphoria is the greatest emotion one can feel. If you cannot be surprised by things, everything gradually becomes muted, despairing. You are reaching for meaning where, eventually none can be found.

Once you have felt all the euphoria you can, then a given expenditure of resources doesn't give you as much enjoyment as it would a youthful person. So you are being selfish by asking to extend your life past the point where you can find significant enjoyment from regular things.
