Giving back to family could be a decent argument. Ex: "I've had a good life. I don't want to keep using resources, preventing my children and my children's children from experiencing their full potential."

The particular resources depends on your setting. Around the present day, money probably works pretty well. ("Is spending $80K on cryonics better than leaving it to my grandchildren to pay off their loans?") In the far future, we can likely only access some finite amount of the total computational capacity of the universe. ("By continuing to use server time to compute myself, I'm literally preventing my potential descendents from existing.")

You could also generalize from "my descendents" to "any future people", but I think the family angle would seem more persuasive at first glance, especially for a story.
