This thing is pretty incredible: [[https://infidels.org/kiosk/article/the-immortals-dilemma-deconstructing-eternal-life-333.html]]

In which the author makes an argument against immortality using the concept of infinity.

#+begin_quote
  Thus personal immortality poses this dilemma: without the termination option, we will face infinite periods of time when we will wish we could terminate our immortality; with the termination option, we will eventually and inevitably face a period when we will exercise the termination option and thus put the lie to our supposed immortality.
#+end_quote

The author apparently is unaware that infinities can be used to make nonsense of any logical construct, including mathematics and morality. Yes, infinity will include an infinite amount of everything, including an infinite amount of wishing you could die. It will also include an infinite amount of being glad at being alive, even potentially a /bigger/ infinity of that, because not all infinities are equal. But the author doesn't feel the need to mention that.
