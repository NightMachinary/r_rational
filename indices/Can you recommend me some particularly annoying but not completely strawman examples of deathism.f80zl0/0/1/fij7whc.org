OP may have in mind more traditional "deathists" of the "death is good because it's natural/traditional/useful to society/gives life meaning for people to die of old age" rather than "death is good because life is bad"(which I'm personally much more sympathetic to, but that style of deathist would probably be less inclined to /force/ people to die).
