During our years of evolution (we still evolve but technology changes our lives much faster than natural selection) there was no cut-off point where an elder killing themselves of their own free will regardless of environment makes sense. That said, I have anecdotally seen a much larger rate of acceptance of their own death without much (overt) care among old people.
