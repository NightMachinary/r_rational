*Spoilers for the entirety of "The Good Place" below:*

No one else here has tried to summarize the arc of a popular media plot, so this might be a bit out of scope, but this annoyed me, so here goes.

"The Good Place" basically spends most if its 4 seasons with the main characters dead, in an afterlife, but trying to get to a better afterlife, a "heaven" analog. When they finally do, a couple episodes from the end of the show, they realize heaven is incredibly boring and unfulfilling, and after a mere couple episodes of soul searching, they declare (to triumphant music) that the solution is basically "double death", annihilating themselves from heaven. This is particularly annoying as the show legitimately and explicitly explores ethics across its duration, and even features cameos from respected philosophers, yet seems to cop out on a nuanced exploration of this, or even to realize the irony in proposing death as a solution to heaven's issues. (Also, there is this weird subplot in the show that heaven is managed by incompetent bureaucrats; so when the main characters get frustrated by heaven, it seems like the management problems should be addressed first, before leaping immediately to 2nd death as the answer.)

The show basically argues that, for people culturally used to ~80 year lifespans, we would run out of things to do if we had, say 800 years. Our culture and our brains have equilibrated to 80 year lifespans, and one would expect a different cultural equilibrium would need to develop to accommodate 800 year lifespans, and our brains clearly also aren't literally prepared for 800 years of cognition. But the show, as opposed to admitting that 800 years is better than 80 and that the consequences of the next order of magnitude, up to 8000, are hard to predict right now, instead just says "jumping straight from 80 years to infinity years is truly terrifying and unworkable, and after a few hundred years people would probably be begging for 2nd death".
