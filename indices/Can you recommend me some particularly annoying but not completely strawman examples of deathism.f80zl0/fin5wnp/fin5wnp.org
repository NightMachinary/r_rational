I'd like to offer my own argument in favor of death. First, let's imagine a scenario in which a 100% guaranteed method of sustaining life, health, and body function was discovered by Leonardo da Vinci in 1,500 A.D. The method is moderately expensive, requiring some rare elements, so initially it might not have been something everyone had access to, but it would now be within our means as a civilization to provide immortality to everyone, if our civilization were like it is now. There's the first obvious problem though - civilization would be /very/ different if we had discovered immortality in 1,500.

Imagine what the world would be like if late 15th century and early 16th century monarchs had never died. First [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Sforza][Ludovico Sforza]] takes the technology from da Vinci (if he doesn't give up) and becomes immortal, then [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon][Ferdinand II]] of Aragon captures the technology from Ludovico, then [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XII_of_France#Governance][Louis XII]] declares war on Aragon and demands the secret to immortality. By this time, Henry VIII has caught wind of what's going on and he sends the English navy with a mini-crusade's worth of soldiers to recover the secret of immortality from France/Aragon/Milan. Pretty quickly, the secret is out and people like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible][Ivan the Terrible]] are becoming immortal. With the ruling class quickly becoming undying, the world becomes locked into a 15th-century level of society. Monarchy will never go away, and attempts at democracy will be crushed by the strongest reigning monarchs. It's hard for the feudal system to ever fail when its most capable and most ruthless rulers can live forever. Women will remain property, children will be exploited for manual labor by their parents, public education will never take off, and the industrial revolution will be stymied as feudal lords see upstart capitalists as a threat to their eternal rule. By 2020 A.D., maybe the Americas have been colonized, but Henry VIII will still be in charge and anyone who says otherwise is risking death. Now imagine us in 2020. If you develop immortality today, the present is what the future will be. Forever onward, we will barely progress as a society because the ruling class today will be the ruling class eternal, and anything that threatens their rule will not be tolerated. Immortality means the end of progress.

As if that's not bad enough, now you have a population crisis too. If no one ever dies, but people keep having children, we will need to destroy the worlds' forests and rainforest even faster than we already are to make room for homes and farmland. Fairly quickly, even that won't do it anymore. We'll run out of room for humanity, and fail to progress as a society in ways that would be needed to survive beyond Earth. Soon, we're back to death being a thing, it's just being deliver by hand instead of by nature. Let the ruling class decide who lives and who dies, what could go wrong? Not only does the discovery of immortality fail to prevent death, but it makes a society where death is still treated with as much callousness as it was in the 1500s.

In the end, is it really so bad if old people just die eventually from natural causes?
