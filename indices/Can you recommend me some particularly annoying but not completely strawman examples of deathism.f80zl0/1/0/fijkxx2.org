That's another really broken argument. It also leads to the so-called Repugnant Conclusion - that one has a moral duty to procreate as much as possible in order to bring as many of those "unborn ghosts" in the world as can be, regardless of what this means for the happiness of those alive, because /being alive at all/ is happiness enough and we should share it. It's basically the position of those extremist Christians who will use no birth control and have like 15 children. So it's a very funny thing to read /Richard Dawkins/ basically giving arguments to support it.

Subjects that don't exist are not subjects, and thus, moral reasoning does not apply to them. That gives rise to a much more consistent philosophy. Infinite quantities always break everything.
