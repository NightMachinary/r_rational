There's always the standard religious arguments:

- Life is a necessary trial we endure before we are allowed into the afterlife, which is way better than our mortal lives. Trying to avoid death is really just postponing the start of your true life.
- Living is inherently suffering, and all pleasure is inherently transitory and superficial. Through death, we can achieve the only true freedom from suffering.
