Try this [[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1081584611][link]] to a recent Ezra Klein podcast. It's an interview with Martin HÃ¤gglund, a Yale philosopher, who spends the first 20 minutes talking about how without death, life can have no meaning. I couldn't listen to more than that though.

Not Ezra's usual fare, but I think exactly what you're looking for.
