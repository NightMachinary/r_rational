  You assume that most people are capable of letting themselves die when the option to live longer is available to them, but the animal instinct to survive is very strong.

This is a very strange take indeed. "Well, you can't be immortal with an opt-out option, because then you would never really want to opt-out, even though it would definitely be the best option for you, because reasons".

People who simply claim that their whatever philosophical or political theory allows them to determine what you yourself need and want better than you, and thus that external forces should push you along that road for your own good, allow me to no end. It's such a broken, self-justifying reasoning.
