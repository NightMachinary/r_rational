literally nothing but "reproduce" makes sense regardless of environment, in an evolutionary context. But that is not quite my point, there is after all no *sense* when it comes to evolution, merely mutation and selection. The point is, any hypothetical mutation that triggers a sudden drive for suicide *after* reproductive age would not be selected against, because the reproduction has already happened.

You are of course right that there is a selection process on a tribal level that would probably favour people not to suddenly killing themselves at age 40, but thats a tricky thing - there are certainly environments where anyone past their physical prime was selected against. Cultures that preferred early (usually violent) death to senescence, for example.

What I am trying to say is that I believe when it comes to aging and deathism, evolution is a difficult basis for argument.
