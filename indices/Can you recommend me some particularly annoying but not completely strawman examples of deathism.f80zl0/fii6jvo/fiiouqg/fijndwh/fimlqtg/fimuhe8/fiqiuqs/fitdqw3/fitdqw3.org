But that's cultures. Which, beyond basic tribal cultures, arose in a shorter timeframe than the work of large scale evolutionary changes. As far as I know most surviving hunter gatherer tribes aren't known for widespread elder suicide, nor was there a period in history where such a thing was widespread all over the world, or even all over any large racial group.

And you're right that evolution wouldn't necessarily select against suicide post reproduction. But it wouldn't select in favor either. Not to mention that men don't really have a clear end of reproductive age, yet I'd be surprised if female suicide statistics spike post menopause.
