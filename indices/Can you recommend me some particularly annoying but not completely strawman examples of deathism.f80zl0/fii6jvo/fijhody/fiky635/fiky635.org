Does belief in an afterlife count? In this belief system, "death" isn't the end of existence, it's just a transition from one stage of life to another. Everyone is already immortal. Here's a C.S. Lewis quote on the immortality of all human beings:

#+begin_quote
  You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.
