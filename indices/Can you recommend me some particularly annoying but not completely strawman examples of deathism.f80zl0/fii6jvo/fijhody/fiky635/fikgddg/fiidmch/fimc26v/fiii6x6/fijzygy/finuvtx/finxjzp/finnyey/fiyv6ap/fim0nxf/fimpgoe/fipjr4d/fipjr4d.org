I'm not sure this example fits because they don't require anyone to die. "People should have the option to die if/when they want to" isn't a strictly deathist position. In fact I'm not sure I've ever met an immortalist who opposes it. The characters do pay lip service to the whole "death is necessary to give life meaning" thing, but in practice the effect of the door is just to give people an out so they aren't trapped in consciousness for eternity if they don't want to be.
