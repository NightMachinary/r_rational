Churches, all churches, are monuments to deathism. They exist so people can continue to ignore their impending erasure. It's not so much an argument as a blindfold, but it's so effective that the vast majority of humanity is blinded.

It took me a while to figure out that's why I find church buildings so oppressive to be in.
