Not my opinion, but here it goes.

There is no such thing as unlimited resources. Even if we were to all upload our minds into computers, that fact would still not change, as every human would require bandwidth to survive. Even if it isn't going to be a problem for a very, very long time, it will eventually. By choosing to be immortal, a person will in some way leave the next generation just a little bit bereft. Stunting their progress and taking away from everything they might be able to achieve.

Either every immortal person agrees to not reproduce what so ever, or they can agree to trade their lives for their offspring. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
