Social stratification can get way worse if the Supreme Leader/oligarchs/authorities of any kind no longer have a turnover rate. Once all the rich and powerful are immortal they'll have all the time in the world to grow their powerbase and strangle the opposition in the crib.

When the old leader dies the new leader may bring new vision and help guide the company/country/organization down better lines. Or, failing that, the new leader may flounder and give competitors a chance to rise in its place. Without death, the company founder has enough time to become best friends with the other rich immortals and collude and grab for more and more power.

With death, any mistake can be undone. The old man set in his ways can die and the young blood acutely aware of the failings of the old system can push for change. Without death, our mistakes here and now may spell an eternity of failure. The old man set in his ways never dies, and only grows more secure in his position, and the young blood can do nothing to stop him.

And goodness knows we aren't so perfect a society that we don't have any mistakes to entrench.
