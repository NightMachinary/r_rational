Trying to channel Thomas Ligotti for a moment...

  You speak of life extension but, for reasons which have nothing to do with life- or health-span and which you are unlikely to solve, it would be more accurate to speak of /suffering/ extension.

But no one will be required to extend their lives, so people whose suffering is too great will not take this treatment.

  You assume that most people are capable of letting themselves die when the option to live longer is available to them, but the animal instinct to survive is very strong.

  Consider the grotesque pains which people go through in the course of cancer treatments for the sake of stretching out a few months or a slim chance of remission, in those cases where their particular brand of cancer is almost certainly going to kill them anyway. Rather than having a more peaceful time, they undergo the wretchedness of chemotherapy and other treatments, with the upshot that they will probably still not live much longer but now will do so in much greater discomfort.

  There is also, of course, the /cost/ of life extension, which may put many an oldster in great debt, with all the attendant negativities of that condition.
#+end_quote

But is life really so terrible? If death were preferable to life, then why don't haven't we killed ourselves already?

  Natural selection, of course. Anyone who was able to make a rational judgment of their circumstances, conclude that life too horrible to bear, and then commit suicide, would summarily remove themselves from the gene pool. As a rationalist, you are well aware of the cognitive contortions which our brains can perform, so you shouldn't be too shocked to find that there's one more to add to the list. We are necessarily descended only from those apes who, for one reason or another, failed to commit suicide at least long enough to breed. And yes, things are [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/24/how-bad-are-things/][really that terrible]] for many people.

Ligotti never addresses life extension in particular, but you can check out my notes on his nonfiction work [[https://saltphil.wordpress.com/2017/05/14/the-conspiracy-against-the-human-race-by-thomas-ligotti/][here]] if the above was useful.
