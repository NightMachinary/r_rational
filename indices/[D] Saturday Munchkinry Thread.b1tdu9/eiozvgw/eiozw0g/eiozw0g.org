Stuff I've already thought of:

- Antimagic shields, infuse gas with vim and nix (each particle has a different mana type) and hold it in a layer around you. it'll stop any incoming spells but you'll have to open a hole to cast outside
- Deflection shield, trigger to push anything moving over X meters per second away from you
- Kill unshielded targets by conjuring gas into their brain. or poison. or whatever
- Kill unshielded targets by crushing their insides
- Kill unshielded targets by burning them from the inside
- healing, basically just surgery but more precise. it would take a long time though and it's not "magic", if you get beheaded you're done. might be able to reattach fingers, maybe even limbs, but it wouldn't be guaranteed and would take a lot of work.
- conjure white phosphorus instead of directly igniting something
- Heat doorknobs, weapons, etc
- Partial vanish a section of the floor (if in a multistory building). probably needs preparation though
- Conjure explosives inside the target
- Conjure explosives, period
- Conjure acid to melt through composite materials
- Conjure potassium in water
- Dig a pit by conjuring a solid substance then vanishing it (carbon?)
- Drop something really heavy onto a shielded target
- Hydrogen peroxide bomb
- Conjure something to block a doorway or other narrow passage
- Conjure shackles instead of tk holding someone
- Conjure nitrogen gas to extinguish a fire
- Conjure a cube of diamond then use high-precision vanishing to remove the unwanted pieces. Very, very slow, and harder to do, but you can take breaks.
- Conjure drugs (illegal ones or just medicine)
- Go near a jewelry shop and conjure gold or other precious metals
- Use platinum for a cache (non brittle, non toxic, very high storage capacity), or copper (cheap, but won't hold much mana)
- Weave wires through your clothes and use them as a cache to minimize path penalties
- Copy a mechanical key with conjuration
- Infrasonic sounds
- Sound manipulation
- Conjure things beneath a shielded target
- Destroy a hard drive by conjuring stuff inside it
- "Zombie"
- Torture
- Conjure swords, shields, etc
- Rock artillery (accelerate, stop once it's far away). Or do it with a bullet (but easily deflected).
- Prepare spear shafts then conjure heads into the wood (newbie trick)
- Conjure armor and shields
- Clothesline someone with a rope or a stick
- Garrote
- Contact poison booby trap
- Dust bomb
- Booby traps triggered by enemy's antimagic
- Use magic to create fortifications
- Conjure oxygen to survive a choke (have to be quick and it's hard)
- Spear caches to instakill anyone if the tip pokes through a shield
- Wire caches to shorten paths from the tip to the target
- Sneak wires underground to get close to a stationary opponent, or to fortify a building
