  How strong is this explosion? Is it more cost-effective than just conjuring explosives? Can you roughly set how long it will take before it explodes? Because that can be more useful than directly conjuring explosives which don't have set delays.
#+end_quote

The cache explosion is just the usage of all its mana for a random spell effect. Conjuring a bomb is probably more cost effective but cache grenades could still be useful. You can't set how long it'll explode, it just goes off at random or when jarred like, well, a really unstable explosive.

  Apply the usual faster-than-light munchkins.

I'm not familiar with this, can you point me to some reading or explain it? The FTL only applies in a short range and it's only for limited kinds of information, and it's still bounded by how fast you can react to the information.

  Does that pull the hydrogen atoms out of the water, leaving behind free unbound O?
#+end_quote

Yeah. But wouldn't the oxygen just combine with itself?

  If you get in a tub of alcohol (CH3CH2OH) and pull the oxygen atoms off, what happens to the remainder of the molecule?
#+end_quote

The remainder of the molecule is unaffected by magic. So you'd have CH3CH2 plus an H. The oxygen would take its electrons with it. The H probably wouldn't get its electron back. But wouldn't it just recombine naturally? Or break down?

  Could you create large molecules with massively negative or positive charges by selectively stealing electrons from them?
#+end_quote

Yeah, though it probably wouldn't be quick or easy. But, as the spell was working and stealing atoms (and their electrons), wouldn't the remaining molecule bits react on their own and form new, stable molecules? For the water, that would mean lonely H atoms reacting with all the O atoms in the air or with each other and bubbling up and away as H2. You would never end up with a massively charged molecule for the same reasons you don't see massive charges in real life.

Keep in mind, it's not like you can instantly suck all the oxygen out of the swimming pool. A swimming pool has around 400000 liters, which would take 26 hours to conjure all the oxygen out of. That's plenty of time for natural reactions to happen.
