  I'm not familiar with this, can you point me to some reading or explain it? The FTL only applies in a short range and it's only for limited kinds of information, and it's still bounded by how fast you can react to the information.

Can't triggers be used instead of having to react? Thanks to relativity, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone][Faster-than-light means time travel.]]

In this case, you could set up two spells 10m apart: the first conjures iron and is triggered by detecting a spell conjuring copper (you have the ability to do this at 7500 hours). The second conjures copper and is triggered by detecting a spell conjuring gold. Stand next to the iron spell and start conjuring gold. The 10m away copper spell will be triggered by your gold conjuration, and cause the iron spell next to you to also trigger. But since the magic happens faster-than-light, the iron spell next to you will actually trigger BEFORE you started your gold conjuration.

Now, since the distance is short, it will be only a very small amount of time in the past, way less than a second. But that just means you need more triggers or recursion. For example, you could make the first spell conjure gold instead of iron. That forms a loop where the spells will keep triggering each other backwards in time, effectively allowing you to send information to the past as far back as you can maintain the two spells.

Edit: I think I scienced the above wrong. Refer to the wiki article instead, I'm bad at physics.

Now you can apply the standard time-travel munchkins. E.g. precommit to executing some plan, set up the two spells above, and then execute the plan. If the plan fails at some point in the future, conjure gold, causing the two spells you have been maintaining to instantly trigger each other backwards in time until the moment you first set up the two spells, letting you know at that point in the past that your plan won't work. Now you can come up with a different plan.

  But wouldn't it just recombine naturally? Or break down?

  the remaining molecule bits react on their own and form new, stable molecules?
#+end_quote

Yes but they won't recombine to make the same molecules since some of the atoms are now missing. So you could create all kinds of exciting new chemicals that have never been made before. And given your ability to steal atoms without caring about entropy or thermodynamics, the resulting chemicals could be extremely reactive, to the point where you would need to magnetically suspend them in a vacuum so they can't get in contact with any air or other material that they could react with.
