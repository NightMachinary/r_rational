  That's... interesting. I read the article, but I don't really understand most of what it says except in very general terms. However, it sounds like if the information isn't FTL then this problem goes away. Right?

Right.

  This sounds an awful lot like particle accelerators making antimatter and whatnot: really useful for science, but not so important for real-world use. Unfortunately, I have no idea what "exciting new chemicals" might be possible, and it seems like the only way to figure that out would be to learn actual chemistry. Any suggestions for how I might cheat my way out?

This already was the way to cheat your way out, since it is far easier to create complex molecules by stealing atoms from them rather than gaining the in-depth knowledge needed to directly conjure them. I'm not sure you can cheat further.

Another thing you can try to exploit is range. Seeing you gave examples of conjuring steel and bronze, the atoms in them had to come from somewhere. Unless steel conjurers walk around with bars of iron, I'm guessing the atom theft aspect is actually extremely long ranged. This gives you a method to kill/hurt/destroy things from far away, by conjuring rare atoms that compose the target but aren't commonly found in your environment.
