  Refined mana can be placed into caches for use later on, but you have to be touching the cache to withdraw mana. Any material works for a cache, but the storage space scales with the density, mass, and purity of the object. Attempting to force too much mana into a cache will cause it to become unstable and eventually explode.

So, if I have an egg-shaped object of astonishingly poor purity, I can basically use it as a hand grenade by shoving mana into if and throwing it?

As a matter of magic practice, I could also levitate small items - such as my phone - and very quickly never worry about not having enough hands to hold all the bits that need holding while soldering. (In fact, I should be able interesting things with precision electronics by hand that most people need machines to do... and I could thread a needle every time, with practice).
