Oh, yeah, I can also get incredible high scores in Pinball games by using force magic on the ball. (It moves way slower than bullets do). And always win the prize I want in claw games.

Unless they go to the trouble of saturating the glass with nix, and then I just use nix-force spells (I'm guessing that pulls instead of pushing?)

There's loads of ways in which small-scale telekinesis is ridiculously handy without being a big power exploit. (If you want the /big/ power exploit, all you need to do is to be part of the live studio audience when the lottery numbers are drawn... though there they probably have someone to check for mages).
