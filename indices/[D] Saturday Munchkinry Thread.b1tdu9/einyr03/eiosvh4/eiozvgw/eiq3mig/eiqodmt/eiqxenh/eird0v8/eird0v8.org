  If you want the /big/ power exploit, all you need to do is to be part of the live studio audience when the lottery numbers are drawn... though there they probably have someone to check for mages.

I didn't know there was an audience for lotteries but that's clever. People who do that sort of obvious thing don't live very long (magic is still secret and there's powerful groups with an interest in maintaining the status quo). But I bet someone would have /tried/.

​

Vim and nix can both be used for telekinesis. It's a break in the theme but I wasn't able to find a meaningful distinction between pushing and pulling (it's just a different point of view).
