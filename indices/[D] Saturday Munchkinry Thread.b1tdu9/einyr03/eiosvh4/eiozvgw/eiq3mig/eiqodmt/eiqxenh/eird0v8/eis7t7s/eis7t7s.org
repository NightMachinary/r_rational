I went and looked. It turns out that there is not a live studio audience for lotto drawings (but it's the sort of thing that could plausibly happen in a fictional universe).

  People who do that sort of obvious thing don't live very long

If you're /clever/ about it, you /don't/ make it obvious - you just make sure to note down the winning numbers on your wife's lottery ticket before you go.

  Vim and nix can both be used for telekinesis. It's a break in the theme but I wasn't able to find a meaningful distinction between pushing and pulling (it's just a different point of view).

Here's a possibility - vim speeds things up (relative to you) while nix slows them down. So if I want to read from a book that's floating in front of me, then nix will hold it steady but I'd need vim to turn the page.

How's that?
