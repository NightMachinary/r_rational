  Here's a possibility - vim speeds things up (relative to you) while nix slows them down. So if I want to read from a book that's floating in front of me, then nix will hold it steady but I'd need vim to turn the page.

I did think of that, but there's a problem. In the book example, the reason the book falls is because gravity is exerting a force on it. If you can use vim to move the pages, you can also use it to affect the book, which means you can move the book up, against the force of gravity. The logical conclusion is that if you control the power of the spell, you can duplicate any nix effect with vim. This means vim is strictly better than nix and there's no reason to ever use nix for telekinesis, so it might as well not exist.

​

The other thing I considered was changing it from force to kinetic energy. This would make it fit in really nicely with the other two branches (which are both energy based) and there's an obvious division of abilities: vim adds KE, nix removes it. Unfortunately, the math then says that levitating (hovering, not moving) takes zero mana. This is not good, it doesn't make intuitive sense and it's silly overpowered.
