  So, if I have an egg-shaped object of astonishingly poor purity, I can basically use it as a hand grenade by shoving mana into if and throwing it?

  As a matter of magic practice, I could also levitate small items - such as my phone - and very quickly never worry about not having enough hands to hold all the bits that need holding while soldering. (In fact, I should be able interesting things with precision electronics by hand that most people need machines to do... and I could thread a needle every time, with practice).

That's pretty clever. Not a big power exploit but I could totally see how that would be ridiculously handy.
