This seems sort of like an artificially induced version of the real world scenario where someone's really energetic, or like a buddhist monk. Although this doesn't stipulate they have to be good, and we can assume they're fairly intelligent if they're in a rationalfic.

here's an easy solution: given enough intelligence, go sell drugs for money, then labor away at a PhD, but fund your own research if you think you can do something groundbreaking. Fuck, do both at the same time, infinite willpower. Try to make a big bite in anti-aging research.
