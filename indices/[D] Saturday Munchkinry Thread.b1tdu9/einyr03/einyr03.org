*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 14: Bendalloy*

And here we are, the penultimate episode of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 13 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/][7]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ak1kjr/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ef0o7jj/][8]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ametuf/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eflf195/][9]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ar9jrc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eglnl2s/][10]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eh4l3jc/][11]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eh4l3jc/][12]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/az4ct2/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ei5u4v2/][13]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is bendalloy. As always we're interested in what a bendalloy twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, bendalloy is very similar to cadmium. Like with cadmium, burning bendalloy creates a translucent bubble in which time passes differently from the outside world. In bendalloys case time inside the bubble passes faster than normal. From the perspective of anyone in the bubble the outside world appears frozen, while from outside the bubble people inside become blurs, moving to fast to follow.

Bendalloy bubbles are much smaller than cadmium bubbles, the maximum size being roughly enough to envelop a room. The extent to which time is sped up in the bubble is similar to cadmium though: 20 to 30 times faster than normal depending on the strenght of the allomancer. It's worth noting that bendalloy is not a cheap metal and that it burns substantially quicker than cadmium, so most allomancers only maintain bubbles for very brief amounts of time.

A bubble cannot be moved once it's created, it anchors itself to the nearest object of sufficient mass. Typically this is the ground on which the allomancer is standing (in which case the bubble maintains its position relative to the planet as it rotates around it's axis/the sun), but sufficiently large vehicles can also be used to anchor a time bubble to, an allomancer bendalloy while inside a train will see their time bubble stay in place relative to the train, rather than the ground. When the allomancer stops burning bendalloy the bubble immediately seizes to exist and it takes a few seconds before another bubble can be created.

Small objects like bullets can pass through the edge of the bubble if they move quickly enough, but are knocked wildly off course in the process. Larger objects pop the bubble entirely if they move through its edge. Objects are always effected by the time dilation entirely or not at all, depending on if more of their mass is inside or outside the bubble. Whether something constitutes one object or multiple depends on how it is presented in the cognitive realm, which roughly corresponds to how most people would view it. Moving objects that cross the perimeter of the bubble for longer periods of time (eg. a stick that you wiggle back and forth while it is crossing the edge) pop the bubble.

The edge of a time bubble absorb some, but not all, of the sound going through it. Sounds from outside the bubble are almost completely inaudible inside as they are dampened by crossing into the bubble as well as spread out over a much longer time than before. If you amplified it to a reasonable volume you would still only hear random noise though, as the same effect that knocks bullets off course also distorts sounds.

In the outside world, sounds from inside the bubble will be a constant, white noise hum (being amplified and compressed by time dilation and then mangled and dampened by passing through the edge of the bubble).

Light passes through time bubbles unhindered and the magic compensates for the fact that more photons move from inside the bubble to the outside world than vice versa as well as for any redshifting or blueshifting those photons would undergo. The result is that both sides of the bubble see the other side completely as normal, other than the fact that time is sped up/slowed down.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, bendalloy stores nutrition. While storing, any food that is metabolized by the feruchemist does not end up in the feruchemists body, but dissappears instead. Then when tapping the resulting metalmind, the sugars, fat, vitamins, toxins and all other byproducts that the metabolized food would have turned into start appearing in the appropriate places inside the feruchemists body, allowing the feruchemists to go without food for prolonged amounts of time.

Aside from this, bendalloy also allows the feruchemists to store fluids. This requires a separete metalmind (similar to how tin requires different metalminds for different senses), but the process is basically the same: while storing fluids any water that would be absorbed from the feruchemists stomach instead disappears until the resulting metalmind is tapped, at which point it reappears inside the body.
