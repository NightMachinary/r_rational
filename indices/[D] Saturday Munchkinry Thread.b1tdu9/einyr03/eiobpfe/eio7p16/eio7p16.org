*Really terrible ideas*

Waste destruction:

- Eat something you want gone.
- Dump all the output into the metalmind.

I'm not sure what possible use case this would have. What edible thing would you want to get rid of that you couldn't burn (also giving power)? Very diseased/radioactive meat? How do you stop it from hurting you before you poof it?

Could you dispose of inedible things (plastic?), how about if you mixed it with a certain proportion of edible food?

​

Power generation:

- Eat a ton of food.
- Dump it in the metalmind.
- Be raised somewhere high.
- Drain the metalmind.
- Harvest the increased potential energy.

My initial thought was this would give you the power to become overweight on command (but not turn back again) giving a really long and unpleasant cycle-time.

On second thoughts this would only give you hyperglycemia on command, which is even less exploitable.
