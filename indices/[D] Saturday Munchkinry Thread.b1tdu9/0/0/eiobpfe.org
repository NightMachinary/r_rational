So aside from never needing to eat or drink, a bendalloy compounder should also be able to create arbitrary amounts of any chemical which can be secreted from the body and won't just kill you. The most interesting one I can think of is LSD, as it's nonlethal, secreted in urine and sweat (which they can produce more of with their infinite water supply), and could hypothetically be reabsorbed by the compounder to end the effects immediately. Coupled with the time bubble that would come along with compounding, you could create and purify a large amount of high-quality LSD over a busy weekend. This leads to an infinite money supply when sold over the darknet IRL, and would make you a religious leader on Scadrial assuming Harmony let you get away with it.
