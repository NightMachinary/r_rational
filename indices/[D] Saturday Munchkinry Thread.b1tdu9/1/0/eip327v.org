One possibility that springs to mind is picking up new skills. If I never get mentally exhausted from the tedious aspects of practicing, then I can devote more time to developing those skills.

Part of this depends on where you draw the line between willpower and motivation, but someone could (for example) devote a whole day to nothing but sitting at a desk and studying a new language's vocabulary, without having to take a break and go for a walk, or talk to a friend, or whatever.
