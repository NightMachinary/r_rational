Well, in the real world, there aren't any spells to fuel with willpower, so all willpower does is let you force yourself to do things you don't like, such as exercising or working instead of lazing around. Infinite willpower will let you keep on working whenever possible, but that's not such a big difference from workaholics with regular amounts of willpower so you aren't going to gain much from this method. Especially since working smarter tends to yield more than working harder.

Rather, it might be best to look for things that are utterly undesirable. Jobs that normal people would be reluctant to do, you can force yourself to without any problems. And I don't mean undesirable like wading through filth and gore, because plenty of people already do that for their work. It has to be far far worse than that.

Which means you have to find jobs where you are needed to make horrible choices. Become a judge/cop/etc and you can accurately execute the law regardless of how much justification the defendant has or how much suffering it would cause their loved ones. Become a politician and make the tough choices that will make you the most hated governor/president in history for the sake of your people. Become a spy and help your country murder countless innocents that have become your friends and family after you infiltrated their society, just because they oppose your country.
