  Thanks to relativity, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone][Faster-than-light means time travel.]]

That's... interesting. I read the article, but I don't really understand most of what it says except in very general terms. However, it sounds like if the information isn't FTL then this problem goes away. Right?

  So you could create all kinds of exciting new chemicals that have never been made before. And given your ability to steal atoms without caring about entropy or thermodynamics, the resulting chemicals could be extremely reactive, to the point where you would need to magnetically suspend them in a vacuum so they can't get in contact with any air or other material that they could react with.

This sounds an awful lot like particle accelerators making antimatter and whatnot: really useful for science, but not so important for real-world use. Unfortunately, I have no idea what "exciting new chemicals" might be possible, and it seems like the only way to figure that out would be to learn actual chemistry. Any suggestions for how I might cheat my way out?

I guess one possibility would be to leave it open and just have "reverse conjuring" be an exciting field of research, like how nanotech is an exciting field of research in the real world.
