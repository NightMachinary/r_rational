  Attempting to force too much mana into a cache will cause it to become unstable and eventually explode.

How strong is this explosion? Is it more cost-effective than just conjuring explosives? Can you roughly set how long it will take before it explodes? Because that can be more useful than directly conjuring explosives which don't have set delays.

What!? That sounds incredibly overpowered. So suppose you get in a pool of pure water (H2O), and you conjure hydrogen. Does that pull the hydrogen atoms out of the water, leaving behind free unbound O?

I can't even imagine all the mayhem you could cause with more complex molecules. If you get in a tub of alcohol (CH3CH2OH) and pull the oxygen atoms off, what happens to the remainder of the molecule? Does it immediately recombine into ethane (CH3CH3)? Because the O is kind of connecting the CH3CH2 to the H, so wouldn't you end up with some strange CH3CH2 molecule instead? Also what happens to the electrons? Does the H that fell off get its electron back? Did the oxygen or the CH3CH2 steal it? Could you create large molecules with massively negative or positive charges by selectively stealing electrons from them?

By removing select atoms from complex molecules in this manner, you could probably create all kinds of all new chemicals, some possibly reactive enough to put chlorine trifluoride to shame.
