Not really, in ideal libertarianland there are still mechanisms to enforce contracts; Either by considering failure to uphold a contract theft, that can be pursued in whatever legal system this particular manifestation of libertarianland includes. Or by creating a chain of insurance insurance (insurance insurance...) where the IRM would need /literally/ infinite money to buy out everyone.
