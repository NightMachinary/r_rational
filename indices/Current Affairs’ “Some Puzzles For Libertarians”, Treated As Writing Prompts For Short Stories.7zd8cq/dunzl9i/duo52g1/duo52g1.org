Scott is definitely more libertarian than some, but he's also fully in support of e.g. UBI and plenty of other governmental things. It's impossible to read Meditations on Moloch or the Left-Libertarian manifesto and think otherwise. I think this is just frustrated Scott writing (hilarious) fiction to vent and make an exasperated point.

Doesn't really belong in this sub though imo.
