yeah I read the FAQ, and I appreciate his position is nuanced. I just find it weird to toe a "liberatarian" line when the actual positions are much more "critiques of how government currently works" than "we should get rid of most of government." It gives a false impression, I think, of the ideas being discussed. Why use the label at all?
