I think "drunk the libertarian Kool-Aid" is unfair. Even taking into account your lower comment that you're talking about "recently," posts like this:

Show his ability to engage with the good ideas and aspirations of a philosophy or political system, including libertarian ones, while still putting up strong objections.

/My/ main problem with this post is just that the thing he's decrying (weak-manning opposing beliefs, and broad-strokes painting a group by the beliefs of its most extreme minority) is something I feel like he has done quite a few times, and I would have appreciated a comment remarking on that while he's pointing out how silly it is.

This is a blind spot most people have, though, where it's easier to see how ideologies we're more aligned with are being caricatured but not those we're less aligned with, and he did make a sort-of-apology for it somewhat recently, so I'm hoping he's getting more aware of it.
