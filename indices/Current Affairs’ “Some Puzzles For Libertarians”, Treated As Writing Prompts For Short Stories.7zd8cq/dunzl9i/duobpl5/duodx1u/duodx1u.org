It's the same as the "desert island" vegan question: you've probably heard of it, or maybe even considered asking about it it. Completely uncharitable and requires so much special pleading to get off the ground you wonder why anyone would bother...

"Okay, but if you were on a desert island, and all there were was wild pigs, you'd kill and eat the pig, right?"

"I'd probably watch the pigs and work out what they ate and eat that."

"Oh no, the pigs don't eat anything. They're stranded with you, and they've started eating each other in fact! So you have to eat the pigs or you'll starve."

"I'm on a desert island right, so there's no water? So I'm going to die of thirst before I get anywhere near starvation?"

"Oh no, it's not a desert island, it's an island with a giant freshwater lake in the middle of it."

"A giant freshwater lake, but no plants?"

"Yes."

"Well, how did I get on the island?"

"I don't know - plane crash?"

"Okay, so I'd probably just wait for the search crews to find me based on the black box pings, it'd only be a couple of days, then they can rescue the cannibal pigs too!"

"No! You were on MH370 so the black box was turned off so you've got no hope of rescue."

"So... me killing the pigs or not is not a difference between life and death but just me dying in three weeks or me dying in two months?"

"No! There's a cruise ship that will go past your island and they'll rescue you in six weeks! But that's your only hope!"

".... right, so yeah, if you took away every relevant factor that could possibly make someone choose veganism and put them in a completely contrived thought experiment, they would probably kill a pig insomuch as it necessitated their survival. Now, like I was saying, for the morning tea you're organising, it would mean a lot to me if you could bring a packet of oreos so I've got something to enjoy while everyone else is eating cheesecake?"
