This post spawned a good amount of discussion on the SSC sub about the principle of charity. While I love jabs like "Why, in true socialist countries, nobody ever eats anything at all!", I do admit they're pretty undignified and uncharitable.

But I do think Scott has an actual point here - that thought-experiments like the Cannibal Village scenario are ridiculously contrived and don't conform to how human nature actually works at all. Libertarianism is not a perfect ideology, and its nuttier proponents can have some very odd ideas (just like the nuttier proponents of any ideology), but none but the craziest ancaps would claim that it's the perfect ideology for [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/][Babyeaters]].

The Current Affairs article is trying to go "...yes, but */IF/* this horribly contrived imaginary scenario existed, your ideology's failure mode would be worse than any other's". Since no one actually believes this scenario is in any way plausible, the article isn't attacking a view that anyone actually holds - it's not a criticism /of libertarianism/. And it seems this point does need to be made, since some people in the SSC thread are actually taking the hypothetical seriously, as if it deserves to be engaged with.

I think there are real-world scenarios where libertarianism fails or has weaknesses (naturally, people have already mentioned Moloch). But you have to point to those real scenarios in order to attack the real ideology.
