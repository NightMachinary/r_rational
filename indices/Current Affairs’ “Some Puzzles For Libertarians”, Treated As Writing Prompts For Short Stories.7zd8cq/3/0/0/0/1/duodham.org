I'm still a bit confused by some of the points, though. He brushes off the coercion question so lightly, when the problem of how to have adequate safeguards against the power of mega-corporations is unresolved by most formulations of libertarianism. Corps /already/ abuse their power, even with a liberal government supposedly watchdoging them, due to the power of money in politics and policy. with a weaker government, this would get much worse.
