Scott occasionally writes critically of some of the government's 'watchdoging' efforts, seeing them as counterproductive because they become controlled and abused by the industries they seek to regulate; one such example is, in his opinion [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/][some of what the FDA does]]. This is similar to how the link above suggests the government's negative effects on the agricultural and diet of it's citizens by subsidizing terribly unhealthy foodstuffs.

Trying to pin him down as being in overall in favour of 'weaker government' or 'stronger government' is possibly overly reductionist. As far as I can tell, like most people, Scott thinks some of the things the government does are good things that it should do more, and some other things the government does are useless or actively harmful, at least as the government actually does them, and so it should do those things less. Similarly with proposed but not-yet-existant government initiatives, he's big on a case-by-case basis analysis and reasoning rather than just saying "government good!" or "government bad!" at /every single problem/.

Notably, Scott wrote a [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/22/repost-the-non-libertarian-faq/][Non-Libertarian FAQ]] a few years back that is pretty good, and which reads to me like the sort of thing that the Current Affairs article which this story was based on wishes it could be.
