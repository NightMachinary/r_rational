I'm not sure about that, actually. From "meditations on moloch" it seems that scott has a pretty good idea of why bottom-up cooperation tends to fail for game theory reasons, and why in turn top-down cooperation may be necessary. Which makes it unlikely that he's libertarian, because libertarianism is basically the poster child for ideologies trying to rely (almost) entirely on bottom-up cooperation.

So I think it's more likely this post is a meta-argument against weakmanning political opinions, by showing how easy it is to discredit arguments based on, weakmanning, even without actually adressing the arguments themselves.
