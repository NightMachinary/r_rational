I've only ever heard that question in response to someone saying they are vegan because all life is equal; so by setting up a scenario like that (however contrived) where they get the vegan to say they would eat a cannibal pig rather than starve (or eat a fellow castaway), they prove that the vegan does not consider pig equal to man...

Its kinda pointless though, because I don't think I have met a vegan IRL that holds a position stronger than "id rather not kill to eat", or that animal suffering is worth considering (neither require animals to be equal to people).
