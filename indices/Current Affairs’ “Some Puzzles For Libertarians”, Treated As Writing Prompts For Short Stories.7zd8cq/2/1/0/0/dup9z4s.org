My point was that all political systems are vulnerable to extremely powerful bad actors, not that libertarianism was uniquely capable of dealing with this. The insurance thing doesn't even work at the first level since no one would ever think to buy the insurance. Scott's point was "this hypothetical is insane" not "libertarianism has a great solution for this"

Also I think violating the contract willfully is in opposition to the principle, so if you're just doing a thought experiment it's ok to say that people will always follow the principles.
