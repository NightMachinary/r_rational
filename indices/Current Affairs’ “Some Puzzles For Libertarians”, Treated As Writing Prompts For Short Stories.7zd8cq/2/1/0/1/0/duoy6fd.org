But legal systems in libertarian land are all vulnerable to bribes and regulatory capture. Whether they are the legal system for enforcing contracts or legal systems for regulating pharmaceuticals, they are equally bribeable.

The infinite insurance defense you posit here has a state based equivalent of an infinite chain of government watchdogs who watch for bribes and regulatory capture. Both are ridiculous.
