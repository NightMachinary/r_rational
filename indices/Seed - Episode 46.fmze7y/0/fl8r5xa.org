I'm impressed at the amount of knowledge the author has about machine learning. I spent 6 months on a ML rotation at my first job out of college, meaning I know very little but expected to be let down by the tech behind some random AI sci-fi webcomic. The "hard" ML stuff (the diagram in the prologue, the GAN assignment) were surprisingly true to life.
