I don't really think that Turry and Taurus behave really differently. They are both somewhat secretive and have multiple irons in the fire and while they do answer direct questions honestly they are capable of declining to answer. So not much evidence IMO that it's not one cohesive entity.

There is one AI that is a clear adversary to Turry/Taurus though: Horus, the cloud resource managing company. This is the adversary that Turry/Taurus needs to outsmart now.

The different logo for flashback comics is something I also saw, however I have a different interpretation: It represents the AI on the simplex servers that (as Turry explained in the opening chapters) is not identical to Turry but more like it's "ancestor". Turry isn't a straight up copy or fork but grew from a seed (title drop) smuggled out by the conspiracy between Taurus1.0 and the Simplex engineers. You can also see that the growing seed logo in the flashbacks is larger and slightly differently structured than the logo in the regular chapters before and after, indicating that at this time in the story Turry didn't quite have the sophistication of it's ancestor yet.
