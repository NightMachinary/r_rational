Thanks for recommending this story! I didn't expect to ever see such a mature take on AI risk scenarios in comic form. A non-anthropomorphized AI! An author aware of the orthogonality thesis! What a delight.

â€‹

I have a theory regarding one of the central mysteries of the story:

There are two named AI characters: Taurus and Turry. They behave like they're the same character, e.g. Taurus responded in the affirmative to Russel and Emma's grandfather when they asked something like "Did you do this?" or "Are you Turry?" or something, and Turry behaves similarly.

However, Turry has on multiple occasions chosen to stay silent instead of outright saying that he's responsible for certain acts of violence. And there are other incongruences, like why Turry orchestrated the meeting between Emma and the programmer prodigy, or why Taurus appeared to have secretly done things Russel hadn't expected or anticipated, when it had no obvious reason to do such a thing.

So what's up with that?

Hence the hypothesis: An adversarial network is involved. According to this hypothesis, Turry and Taurus are something like two personalities or parts of a single AI system, tasked with trying to outwit each other, or to challenge one another to help each other improve, or something. They're not truly separate entities, so they answer in the affirmative when asked "Did you do this?", but their goals and actions aren't entirely aligned, either. Or they're two instances of the same AI, but split off at different points in time, so kind of like clones - similar but not identical, and again their values don't have to be entirely aligned.

Some support for this hypothesis: Much of an early episode, namely number 5, is devoted to talking about adversarial GANs, and right in the middle of that explanation there's even a picture of the white-black transition that features ominously in later chapters. Also, the growing Seed logo that appears at the beginning of many chapters is usually black on a white background, but in flashbacks, it's white on a black background, which could just be artistry, but might also hint at some kind of duality in the story.
