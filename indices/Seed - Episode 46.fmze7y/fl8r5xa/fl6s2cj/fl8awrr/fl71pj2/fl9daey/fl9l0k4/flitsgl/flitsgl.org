Turry already said what he's planning very early on.

  He stated he can't answer in his current configuration so he stayed/stays quiet. Basically getting around "difficult" questions by not answering at all. He's planning on getting a new configuration and listening to collect data or something. Why? We don't know. But it probably involves getting around whatever compulsion(s) he has. The title is also "Seed" so take it how you will.
