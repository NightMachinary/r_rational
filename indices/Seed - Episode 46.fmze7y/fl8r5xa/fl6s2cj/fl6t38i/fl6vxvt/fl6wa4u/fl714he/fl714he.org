Do you mean this chapter alone? Because this is the first Chapter where Emma starts relying on Turry completely, using him in her personal life and trusting him with control over every facet of it.

I'd say the characters aren't really in focus. In this chapter Turry is, and his omni-presence in Emma's life. Which goes hand in hand with the story's overall theme of AGI and their interactions with humans.
