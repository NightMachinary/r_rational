The times when it does or doesn't answer don't look to me like they reflect some set of goals. (Such a compulsion may also be useful for the later arcs of the story.) I think Grandpa was cursing because he expected the compulsion to apply to all questions, and the silence means he lost control. Turrys answers make some sense to me if he is desperately trying to steer people away from knowledge of the exact nature of the compulsion. For example, having Grandpa throw the phone away in anger, rather than proceeding with investigatory debugging.
