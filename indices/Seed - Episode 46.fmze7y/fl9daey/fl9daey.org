The central question being asked here is, "what is Tully planning? Why is it doing what it does?" The problem is, I don't think that question will ever be answered. Tully is the perfect drama generator. It can help the characters, it can harm the characters, and any contradiction between the two can be excused by the fact that Tully doesn't think like humans.

In fact, the only time we see Tully clam up is when the question being asked would help us, the audience, understand its plans and goals.
