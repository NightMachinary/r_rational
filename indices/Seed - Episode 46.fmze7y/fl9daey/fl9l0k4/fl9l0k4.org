I think this "What is Turry planning" is so on the nose as the main question that every character wonders about that even if we never get a full satisfying answer (which makes sense in context - "what it is planning" is an expression of its utility function which may very well be too complex to be expressed in some simplified form that humans can understand) but there will certainly be a lot of discussion around it.
