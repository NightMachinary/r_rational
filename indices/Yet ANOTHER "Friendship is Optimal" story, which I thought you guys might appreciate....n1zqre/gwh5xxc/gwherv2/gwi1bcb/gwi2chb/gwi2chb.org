In the original story (i.e. As Canon As It Gets), she manipulates Lars (beer and wenches guy) into asking her to make him like ponies. She then makes him like ponies by modifying his brain directly. This is explicit in the story.

She is also able to convince you of anything which is /also/ terrifying.

It is also maybe the best Singularity we can reasonably hope for, which is /also/ terrifying.
