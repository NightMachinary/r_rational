What she does to Lars is pretty clear: slowly eroding stuff in his Earth life and then giving him this beautiful pony utopia that is just torturing enough to make him decide he wants to want to be a pony.

When a true FAI would have made him be an uploaded human avatar with human wenches, you know? Because that would satisfy his values far better and not change him as a person. But she needed friendship /and/ ponies for her utility function.

You can see as the universe starts getting heat death/etc that she could start manipulating you to choose things that make you less resource-intensive to run, too.

IDK. I personally find it hard to grok the horror i n FIO also, but I can definitely see the hints intellectually.
