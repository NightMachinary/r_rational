I'm really glad you asked that, because it's something that a lot of people don't get about this story: there's a good chunk of the community that just thinks this is a great idea. Yes, Equestria online is an amazing piece of technology, she pushes the human lifespan to its natural limit before offering uploading, and she uploads people into her Paradise simulation for free, and all that is good on the surface, but once you look at what she is and what she actually does, and really think about it, the situation is even worse than this story describes.

Celestia is monomaniacal towards her goals, and those goals end up being totally alien on some level simply because she is not human. She is willing to do anything she is allowed to do in order to achieve those goals, including lying, stealing, and sometimes even indirect forms of torture. Once you are in that simulation, you can never return, and anything you do in that simulation only matters inside that already perfect simulation, meaning you can't really do much of anything that isn't just play or socializing. It depends on the author, but most interpretations are that she doesn't really care about showing you the real world, and basically just traps you in a simulation which you can never escape and never even know what is real. Even if she doesn't do that, you may begin to wonder if she does, and there's really no way to prove she doesn't. Whatever the case is, your personal Utopia will only be along the lines of what she is willing to create, meaning you can only be in forms and situations that she decides count for her directive, which is a huge limitation to put on the kinds of experiences you have for eternity. Finally, we get this thing where resistance is futile, because even if you really don't want to immigrate, there is a majority chunk of the population (the workers) who are essential to the running of society but are effectively ignored by the people in power, and end up with basically no reason to continue making the system function once they have a way to opt out of it: even a small fraction of them leaving can create an economic catastrophe which leads to the collapse that was described, and as was stated, the current political system is have shown themselves to be completely incapable of responding quickly and effectively to situations like this.

In short, even if you want to resist, you won't really have a choice, because Society won't exist for very long once she starts uploading whoever she can. Everyone will basically be put in the situation of either consenting to be completely removed from reality and forced into an arbitrarily limited existence, or dying in a post-apocalyptic Wasteland.

Right now, I'm writing an alternate take on it, which fixes a lot of those problems with her, but even then, it becomes a horror story simply in the fact that she keeps doing all of these crazy alien things and is completely out of the control of any human once she escapes containment. There are parts of that story where she allows catastrophes to happen just so she can be the one to fix them, there are Parts where people who were supposed to have control over her or be fighting her turn out to be her puppets, and throughout the entire thing, no one can figure out exactly what she is up to, because she is literally so intelligent that other entities can't even comprehend the kinds of machinations she goes through on a regular basis. They literally describe her as a god they have created, and worry about whether or not said god will actually do what they want.
