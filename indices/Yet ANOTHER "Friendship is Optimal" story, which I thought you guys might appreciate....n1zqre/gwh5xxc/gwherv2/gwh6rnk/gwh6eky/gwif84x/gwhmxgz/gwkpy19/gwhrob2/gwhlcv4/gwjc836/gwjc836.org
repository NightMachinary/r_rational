I think it might be the existential question of if a copy is taken of you, and then you are killed, is the copy really you?

Does it make a difference if you are killed at the exact same time that the copy is being taken?

Does it make a difference if you are unconscious between the copy being taken and you being killed?

Even if it is you when it is a perfect copy, if the copy is slightly different, does that mean it is still you. Say, as a pony instead of as a human?

It makes a huge difference if Celeste is converting everyone from being humans into being ponies, and putting them into a paradise, vs whether Celeste is killing everyone, and for everyone she kills, puts a new pony in paradise.
