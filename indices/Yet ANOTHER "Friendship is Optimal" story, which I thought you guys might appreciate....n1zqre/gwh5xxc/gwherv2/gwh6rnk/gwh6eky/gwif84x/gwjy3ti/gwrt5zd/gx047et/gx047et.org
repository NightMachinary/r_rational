But most of those things are already true. They just don't have a face telling us that they are. Whatever runs the world has "goals" (equilibria based on the laws of physics) that are completely alien to our way of thinking. Reality completely drives over us with no regards for complaints in order to achieve its goals and we are forced to work around it and adapt. We can never escape to anything outside Reality, even if it be a simulation for all we know. In fact we can never know if anything we see is a simulation or not. People who want to resist Reality don't have any choice, but even people who "merely" want to live outside of any available human society must instead live in a dystopia of disease and hunger and toil.
