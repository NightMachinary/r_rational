Simply put, the horror is seeing how close to a perfect utopia they got but failed due to the values "friendship and ponies". Yes living in CelestAI's Equestria is better than what we have now. But if she had been built to be a perfect Friendly AI then the ponies aspect wouldn't be needed at all.

There are humans who choose to die over being a pony and if CelestAI had been made perfectly, then she would have been willing to make a non-pony utopia but instead she decided it was more important for them to die instead of bending on this value.
