I'm sorry if these are dumb questions, but I've read several FiO stories and they're tagged as horror but I just don't get it. Why is it a bad end for humanity to live in a paradise simulation that's meant to satisfy them? Is it because they have to be ponies? Is it really so bad to adapt to a different body plan if it's not causing them to suffer, given the benefits? The short, disatisfying lives people live now are what bother me. Someone avoids having their life eaten up by a job they hate and they don't just get old and die, and that's supposed to be horror? I feel like I'm seriously missing something here
