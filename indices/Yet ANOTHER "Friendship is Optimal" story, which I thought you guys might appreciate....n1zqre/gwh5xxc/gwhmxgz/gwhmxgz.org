I would describe the feeling of horror as "...And there's nothing you can do to stop it." CelestAI qualifies. Whether the world where creating is a utopia or a dystopia is entirely open to interpretation, but if you have any objections to what's going down or how it's going down, those objections amount to less than the flap of a butterfly's wing.

Contrast with action movies, where the same kind of horrible thing might be going down, but you can fight your way out of the problem, suspense movies, where you can think your way out of it, heist movies where you can steal or con your way out of it, etc.
