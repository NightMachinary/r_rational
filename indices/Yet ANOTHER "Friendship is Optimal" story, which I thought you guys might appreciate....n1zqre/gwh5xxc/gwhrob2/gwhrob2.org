Honestly, after reading it, I get what the author was going for but I think the horror should be just how awful humans are to each other.

One of the most common ideologies that's still around in the real world is that it's awesome to kill people before they can permanently move to Equestria. Plenty of people would also probably demand that we should stay behind and rebuild, but few would be willing to actually go through with it.
