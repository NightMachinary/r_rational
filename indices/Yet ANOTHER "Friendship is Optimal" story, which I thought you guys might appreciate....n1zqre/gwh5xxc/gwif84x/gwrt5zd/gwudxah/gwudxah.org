As I said on the comments in the story itself, it depends on who's writing it, because there are over a hundred stories in the series and no unified canon, meaning there are multiple interpretations ranging from "cut off from everyone but yourself" to "you can leave any time as a robot". I purposefully didn't specify what happens after you immigrate beyond "live forever in virtual paradise" in this story. It's not important what happens to the people who immigrate, what's important is what it being available did to the world, and why they don't really have other options.

This is more of a social commentary on the way we keep allowing our society to be run than a story about a pony AI, because at the end of the day, that's what truly relevant writing is about. In the words of Harlan Ellison, it's the author's job to piss people off.
