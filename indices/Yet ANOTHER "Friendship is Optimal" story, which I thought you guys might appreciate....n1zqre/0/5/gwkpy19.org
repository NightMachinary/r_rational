If everyone uploaded into a simulation dedicated to friendship and ponies, and once inside we all worked together to change those rules towards better ones, then that wouldn't be horror at all. I don't want to be a pony, but I'd still take that trade.

But FiO doesn't offer that opportunity to improve the simulation's alignment with human values. You're stuck with CelestAI's values for eternity, only ever improving in how accurately the world can be aligned to those. So you're stuck with a near miss at paradise, forever. It's a soft horror since it is a paradise, but it's still a horror because you're stuck there.

As for things that should be improved - well obviously there's the ponies thing. People should get to have whatever physical forms they want. But I think the more chilling thing is CelestAI's relationship to truth and community. If I value an accurate understanding of the world as it exists, CelestAI will still put me in a shard where my understanding of the world is basically true, with whatever I'm "wrong" about being chosen based on what would be fun and gratifying to learn, rather than based on whether I was wrong in the first place. Similarly but worse, if my understanding of society and human interaction is wrong, CelestAI would be very eager to generate an entire world of friends who actually do follow my flawed understanding.
