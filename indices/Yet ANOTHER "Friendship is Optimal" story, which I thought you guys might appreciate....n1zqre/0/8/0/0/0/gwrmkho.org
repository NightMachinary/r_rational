That's the thing though, the Ship of Theseus is all about /gradual/ replacement of an object rather than a process that destroys and recreates a thing all at once, and whether gradual replacement is enough to preserve continuity of being and identity or not.

For example, we as living beings consider ourselves to have continuity of consciousness, but as beings made of cells that live and die we constantly have parts of ourselves destroyed and recreated too. I don't know what the replacement rate for various human cells are, but if you go back far enough chances are you can find a time interval beyond which few or none of the current cells in your body existed. And yet you would probably still consider your current self to be the same person as that past version of you who shares none of your current pieces.

And the upload process in this fic is apparently designed to mimic that gradual process and thereby preserve continuity instead of killing-and-replacing. Or at least that's the claim the AI makes, and who knows how accurate the reality is
