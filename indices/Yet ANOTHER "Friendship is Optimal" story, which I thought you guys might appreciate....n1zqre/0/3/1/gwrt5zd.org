  you can't really do much of anything that isn't just play or socializing.

You don't even get to do the socialising. CelestAI can - and presumably /will/ - run a puppet image that looks like you, acts virtually indistinguishably from you, and yet pushes her agenda even if it's not what you'd want to do. And once you're in her digital world, you can only see /what she shows you/ of the outside world - so if you really want X to be true, and really value the idea of X being true, then when you contact your cousin in the real world and ask about X, then you will see him telling you that X is true even if he's really telling you that X is false.
