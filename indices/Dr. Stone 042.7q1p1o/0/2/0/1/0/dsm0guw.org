  But if your exasperated at it not being rational as per the definitions of this community then that's fucking ridiculous, because it was never intended to appeal to this specific community aside from the incidental.

I never said i was exasperated, im just pointing out the obvious that this chapter and by extension the manga are most likely not going to be rational going forward. Youre arguing a strawman here.

  Meanwhile other members of your community might want updates on the work because of it still aligns with their interests even if it's not strictly Hashtag rational.

Thats what [[/r/manga]] is for. Or they can just google it if they like it so much. Why are you assuming nobody will be able to find it unless its here? Its a popular manga with a large fanbase, itll be easy for anyone who knows the name and is capable of doing a quick google search to find it.

I honestly dont understand why youre upset about this. A manga can have a great story and inspiring characters, and still be irrational. Just like a rational story can be boring, depressive, or extremely disheartening. This sub is for rationally written stories regardless of the content, and this one no longer fits the bill. Theres no need to take these comments so personally. This is exactly the kind of attitude were trying to prevent here.
