  It's a manga. The author is a forty year old Japanese guy who's most well known work is a manga about football. He most likely does not have a clue what rational fiction is or why her should abide by it

None of that has any bearing on whether its a rational manga or not....which it is clearly not. Doesnt mean its bad, just means its no longer rational and there's no need for further chapters to be posted here.
