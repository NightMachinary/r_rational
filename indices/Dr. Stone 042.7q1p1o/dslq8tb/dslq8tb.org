/Sigh/ At this point, while I love the story and will continue to read the manga, it has lost even the slight shade of rationality it previously had.

It made sense for there to plausibly be a human village if the founders were from a whole group of people breaking out of the stone, but not from the people who survived the petrification 3,700 years prior. Human civilization established themselves within two to three thousand years and you're telling me that a group of people starting over with all of the knowledge of science at their finger tips (due to being astronauts!) were stuck at prehistoric levels for 3,700 years!?! They shouldn't even have the same language anymore! Plus their biology might've warped and changed over time due to evolution.
