Yeah, it still uses rational themes and (usually) seems to have rational principles behind things even if on their surface they're a dumb trope.

IE: The one guy seeming to bust out of his shell due to THE POWER OF LOVE, but it was really the scientist dragging him to the cave for the correct chemicals to drip on him which, not coincidentally, became a huge plot point for the story.

So maybe the village has a dumb reason for existing, or maybe there's more meat to it. At the end of the day we're reading a fic about a guy making sulfa-antibiotics from complete scratch, but also has "Peak Neanderthal Highschooler" who can somehow snatch an arrow out of mid-air.
