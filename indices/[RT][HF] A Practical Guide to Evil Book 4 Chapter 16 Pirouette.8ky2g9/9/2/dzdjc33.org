The impression I got was the gate was formed at roughly ground level, we've seen in the past that gates match their approximate position on the other side (e.g. gates you can walkthough have land on the other side, and the small number of gates in the air cat made when attacking the army camp led to air on teh other side as well. ) So water was able to flow through, because thats what water does, but its not dropping form the sky
