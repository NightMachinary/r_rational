  Game of Thrones approach of "Aegon had dragons and conquered the whole continent by using the same approach over and over again, because no one had an answer for it."

Well, that's how Triumphant's conquest worked. That said, any approach with a singular point of failure (a flying fortress with a levitation-controlling array in the center of it, a magical system for opening portals that can only be used by one person under specific conditions, a group of being from another dimension bound to a specific artifact) wil have heroes thown at it until one of them rolls the right combination for exploiting that weakness. Triumphant won not becaus there were no heroes with an advantage against devils or demons, but because there were /too many/ devils and demons for them to fight. When she ran itno something she couldn't throw demons at (Tyrian sea) she lost momentum, while the heroes kept coming until there was enough to contain all she could have mustered (at least I assume so; her defeat isn't exactly described in detail, save for the fact that she let all the demons she had in Praes loose when she brought down the Tower on top of her enemies).

As for the stuff you mentioned, while portals are Catherine's schtick and can be explored in her story, the rest is harder to exploit. Most magic stuff can't simultaneously be mass-produced, controlled or used safely, and if you look at places like the Wasteland, even their disproportional amount of practitioners barely makes a dent in the pile that is supporting a nation.
