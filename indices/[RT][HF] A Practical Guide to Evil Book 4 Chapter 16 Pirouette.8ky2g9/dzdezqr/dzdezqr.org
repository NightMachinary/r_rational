So... Is there any reason why Cat couldn't set up the portals in the reverse direction? Just transport an entire enemy army from Creation directly into Arcadia. If she's feeling kind, they'll just be marooned in an alternate dimension filled with probably hostile fae. Pretty decent hostage bait. If not, she can transport them into Arcadia... a mile above the surface. That usage has way less collateral damage than transferring stuff from Arcadia into Creation.
