You know how in WWI, simple barbed wires made it almost impossible for infantry to charge a position? A lake on your head, even aside from the drowning and crushing and freezing deaths, will make it nigh impossible to take the defender's position. You will advance so slowly, if you can even advance at all, that the artillery and archers will pick everyone off before you make halfway.
