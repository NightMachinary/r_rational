The international community traditionally tends to rally round when a state thats seen as irrational/aggressive is getting nuclear weapons or similar. (See Iran and NK). And Evil is prety much by definition irrational (at least from the perspective of the Good nations).

Their world also doesn't really seem to have a single superpower, or unified body that can set rules and norms, in the way the USA or UN did in the 20th century IRL. So the situation is maybe more analogous to WW1 where people invade based on seeing enemies building up forces and power.
