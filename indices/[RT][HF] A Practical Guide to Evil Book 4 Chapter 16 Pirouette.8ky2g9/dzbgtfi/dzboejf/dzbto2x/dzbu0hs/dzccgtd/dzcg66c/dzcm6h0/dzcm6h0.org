Well, story patterns in and of themselves deter any (rational) villain from using them because it is guaranteed to eventually fail in some way that leads to their downfall. But there are a couple differences that explain why nukes were a deterrent in real life but rough equivalents don't function similarly.

The big one is MAD. Namely that in real life other nations outside of the US got nukes as well relatively quickly. MAD doesn't work without each side being able to hit just as hard and Good generally speaking doesn't havve the power to hit as hard as a doomsday weapon outside of flinging heroes at them hoping one can call down an Angel to enter creation. Related is that good /knows/ they are right. So while they don't have the juice to immediately counter a doomsday weapon, they also have a moral certainty that won't let them surrender in the face of a show of overwhelming force like normal people would. It's why Cat is basing her strategy of getting surrender from the crusade around losses suffered by Princes of the material realm, not suffered by heroes which ultimately only answer to higher loftier concerns

The second is that real life leaders have to give something of a shit about their citizens. Remember, part of the reason the A bomb was used is that a conventional invasion of Japan would have resulted in a very large number of Japanese and American casualities. In terms of deaths caused, fire bombing by the US was far more deadly than the two dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Calernia doesn't fare near as well here. Evil obviously has had villains who literally could not care less (Akua) but even in Procer, which is probably the best life a peasant could have, any nonnamed that wasnt rich in the best case scenario lives the life of a serf. Procer cares about it's people in general, strategically (have enough to fill army, defend the chain of hunger, to farm food, etc.) but would take a succesful First Liesse happening, even if it was to one of their own cities. MAD only works if the potiental loss is too great for you to be willing to bear, and in a fight against a side you know to be Evil and where your citizens are thought of as at least somewhat expendable, that scope of loss is very narrow indeed.
