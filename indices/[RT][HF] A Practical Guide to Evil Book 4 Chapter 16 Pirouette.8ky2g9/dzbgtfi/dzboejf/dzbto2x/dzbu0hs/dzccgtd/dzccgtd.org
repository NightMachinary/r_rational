Yes though not quite in that way.. Remember that with the gates she could in theory take an army traipsing across Procer with The Principate unable to stop her because she just gates to another part of the country (that they can't predict) before an enemy force can close in. But (moral arguments aside) that's the sort of weapon that would demand a unified response from basically the rest of the world that would be completely unwilling to end hostilities until Cat is dead because she showed herself to be so dangerous. She has to temper what she uses so that Procer actually feels like they have the option of ending the crusade and at least temporarily coexisting with Cat and Callow
