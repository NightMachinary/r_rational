The heroes seem pretty good at dealing with direct threats, e.g. if you have a massive kill em all curse or something. But the advantage of the water is that its a big mundane problem that they can't confront directly. Their powers are optimised for combat, not dealing with a massive swamp, or several thousand cold and wet soldiers.
