Black called Praes a backwater. Praes is pretty significant and cosmopolitan compared to Callow, and, as a client state of Praes, Callow is also inferior to it along that axis. Callow is doubly backwater to a backwater. It's double decker recursively backwater. It's so backwater it's under the regular backwater in an underwater current of even more backerer water.
