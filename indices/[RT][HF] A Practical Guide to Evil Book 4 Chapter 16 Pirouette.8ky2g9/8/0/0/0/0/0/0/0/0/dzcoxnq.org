Ah, I thought you meant the plan would be for Cat's forces to attack the camp. As for just leaving the crusaders there, the time until starvation becomes a potential problem and the time until one of the heroes decides to play Moses differ by orders of magnitude, and that's not counting the possibilities like the priests putting together a bridge. The only way the water can be an undeniable advantage to Cat is when the good guys can't bullshit their way out of it because the crusaders are already in there, and her main means of delivering it is by opening the portal above the target.
