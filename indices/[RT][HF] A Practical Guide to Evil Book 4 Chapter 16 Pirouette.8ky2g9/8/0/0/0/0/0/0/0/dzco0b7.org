Sure, but I was responding to your claim that:

#+begin_quote
  Siege against superior numbers would be even bigger disadvantage to Cat, not to mention she'd have to cross the water to take the camp.
#+end_quote

If this were somehow to come about it would actually be a major advantage - the onus isn't on her to sally forth and attack their camp, it's on them to come to her or they'll just starve. I'm not sure if they even /could/ get their army out - surviving impossible bullshit is for Named. If they did, it would at least cost them a significant amount of bullshit.

I don't think it's going to happen, I just think your assertion that it would somehow be a disadvantage for Cat is nonsense.
