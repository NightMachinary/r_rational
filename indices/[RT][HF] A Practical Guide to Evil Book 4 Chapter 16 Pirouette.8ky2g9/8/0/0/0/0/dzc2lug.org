Why give the enemy safe grounds? Siege against superior numbers would be even bigger disadvantage to Cat, not to mention she'd have to cross the water to take the camp.

I'm wondering why didn't she reduce the numbers of crusaders before the battle if she ended up using it anyway. My best guess is to give an impression that this is a line-of-sight last-ditch attack and not something she can do anywhere at will, so the potential enemies wouldn't see it as an excuse to rush her instead of agreeing to a treaty.
