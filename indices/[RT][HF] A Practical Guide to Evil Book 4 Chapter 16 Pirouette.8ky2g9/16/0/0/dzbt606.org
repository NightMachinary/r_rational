I figured, but I think the narrative is my least favorite part of this story. I prefer the Game of Thrones approach of "Aegon had dragons and conquered the whole continent by using the same approach over and over again, because no one had an answer for it."

'My enemy used this tactic before' is not, on its own, a satisfying counter. And something as versatile as absolute positioning should be the focus of an entire campaign, or even overarching military strategy as long as it can be used.

It's like a new mechanic in a game. The most satisfaction would derive from exploring it and using it in a multitude of different ways, not observing it from a superficial perspective and then tossing it away.

Using it to move cities around, shape the terrain, teleport specific units to/away from battles, creating large portals to other armies and shuffling around the battlefield. So many fun things to do.

And for that matter, I like the idea of flying fortresses and crazy magic items. The story is great, I just wish it allowed for Cat acting like a real crazy villain, even if it's subverted heavily. (Like, making a series of flying farms to optimize crop production, or manipulating giant nets to catch large amounts of fish. Warlock's reality alterations could be used to establish trade with Arcadia/other realms. Demons, if properly controlled, could be used to improve manufacturing processes, like shutting down harmful oxygenation processes when forging blades, etc.)
