so, I tried out this story but I put it down around chapter 16. Can someone convince me to keep reading?

Here was my experience:

- First chapter, introduced to Cat, she seems interesting, good so far
- Black Knight shows up, drives the plot, chooses Cat for completely opaque reasons. I get a little bored.
- Some trippy dream thing happens, whatever.
- some sort of fight between Cat and other squire-wannabes. Not really sure who these guys were or where they came from. Some parts of the fight were cool, I guess.
- Black knight uses his command voice to control Cat. Cat sees the results of her actions. OH SHIT, now shit is getting real.
- Gnomes, red letters?? wow, this sounds intriguing.
- Oh, I also thought the concept of 'Scribe', someone whose superpower appears to be being really good at paperwork, pretty amusing.
- Now we're at... battle school...? Gnome plotline is dropped? Totally not invested in whatever fight is going down right now.

And... that's where I stopped because I couldn't force myself to slog through this battle stuff. So given which parts I liked and didn't like, should I keep on going?
