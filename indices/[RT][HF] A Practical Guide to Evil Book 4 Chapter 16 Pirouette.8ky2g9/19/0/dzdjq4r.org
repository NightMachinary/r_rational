  Some trippy dream thing happens, whatever.

  some sort of fight between Cat and other squire-wannabes. Not really sure who these guys were or where they came from. Some parts of the fight were cool, I guess.

  Gnome plotline is dropped?

See, I get the feeling that, like with Worm, stuff like this is a casualty of the story being recommended on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. This story isn't entirely (or even mostly) about optimizing the world: the industrial revolution is nowhere in sight (the society seems to be barely nearing Renaissance at best), and the whole concept of Fate is about history being driven into the ground by the constant repetition of established patterns.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/chapter-4-return/#comment-549][Creation, broadly speaking, isn't a world that encourages technological progress,]] and the gnomes are only a part of the problem. That said, they aren't a mere plot device, it's just that in a world where a reasonable reaction to a more experienced wizard telling you not to meddle in something dangerous is to burn your research and salt the ashes, where just keeping notes on certain subjects warps reality and where the only warning before everything you know will be wiped off the face of the Earth is a letter in a red leather sheath, everybody in the know has no reason nor an inclination to pursue those avenues of research. The gnomes are still mentioned here and there, but nobody wants to pull a pin on that grenade.

Given what you paid attention to and what you didn't (like Name dreams and Heiress' appearance) I feel the need to clarify that this story is explicitly genre savvy and deals first and foremost with breaking out of story patterns that lead nowhere. The world the characters live in isn't the one which innovation in and of itself can improve, so they look primarily to manipulating what already exists rather than creating something new.

For me it wasn't really what Worm was to superhero fiction, since I read way too much fantasy that is genre-savvy to some extent, so making it a system with rules and memes of its own (like Rule of Three, which isn't nearly as formalized in our stories, of flying fortresses as the foremost example of a magical weapon with glaring inherent weaknesses) is a logical next step.

That said, I like Erraticerrata's take on genre awareness more than almost any other, because it comes to the logical conclusion where other commentaries on the genre conventions sort of leave the thought hanging. Playing a trope straight may be done well, but while it being a trope in the first place means that there are examples of it being done well, that also raises the bar over time. Deconstructing the trope requires bringing a misconception into a reality where it would have no reason to exist in the first place, which needs either a sufficiently naive character to bring it up or a convoluted set-up for what is all too often an unnecessary detour. Demonstrating a cliche ironically is easy to mishandle, since the author risks being either too repetitive and unoriginal, lazy and obvious or, again, shoehorning into the story something that doesn't belong in its world.

Guideverse has an actual /reason/ for stories repeating over and over: the Roles are the repetitive patterns in the Fate /as they are known to people/. That's why stealth Names aren't a thing despite covert tactics being brutally effective against systems relying on singular individual like the Named (a Name is fueled by its tale as it is told, and you need to at least keep people speculating, like the Assassin), but comic reliefs are (stories spread based on their entertainment value, making the amusing characters invulnerable as long as they are funny). Human decisions matter not just because they are far more convoluted than simple physical processes and we need different models to understand them, but because there are beings who make the choices /matter/. Magic and spells seem to take advantage of that, manipulating the Pattern more directly than living a story would, more flexible in terms of control over the results but with less reach in manipulation of the consequences.
