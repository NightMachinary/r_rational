Starting from the War College, a whole lot of words are used to describe large scale battle tactics and maneuvers. Honestly, I find that kind of tedious myself at points. As of Book 4, gnomes have still not really been explored as a plot point. Scribe hasn't gotten a whole lot of attention either. We are eventually introduced to some other unconventional Names though. Cat continues to escalate and do continually more impressively badass things, but the scale of conflicts she engages in means there's a lot of focus on big battles and politics too rather than just individual action.
