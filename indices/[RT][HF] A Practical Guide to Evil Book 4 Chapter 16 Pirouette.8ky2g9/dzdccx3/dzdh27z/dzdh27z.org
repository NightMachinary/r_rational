I thought the plot quality dropped significantly after the war college (though the prose quality continues to increase) and the parts I once found charming and fun have become grating and annoying. A lot of the most interesting parts of the setting got not-exactly-retconned to be less interesting and now I'm struggling to find anything redeeming about the continued story.

If you've reached the war college and you aren't enjoying it now, I would give up.
