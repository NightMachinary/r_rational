I was thinking just set the gate horizontally a bit beneath the surface of the ground and have everything fall through.

You can't typically scry underground though, so that might not work. You'd have to set the gate on the surface of the ground, but there might be weird limitation about that too, like a gate has to be a plane, so you couldn't open one on the ground unless the ground was perfectly flat or something. We don't have know what would happen if she tried opening up a gate at, say, knee height where a bunch of people/objects already exist either.
