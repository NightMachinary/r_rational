It's crazy actually. It's like if someone took Metropolitan Man to the extreme. [[https://screenrant.com/hancock-will-smith-reshoots-darker-ending/amp/]]

SPOILERS: Originally it was called “Tonight, He Comes” and it was a much darker ending. “Well, Tonight, He Comes did not follow the story of a depressed superhero finding his long-lost mate through the intervention of a friendly publicist. In the original draft, like the finished film, Hancock does end up living with a suburban family, but in this version, the father of the family is a security guard instead of working in PR, his wife doesn't know Hancock, and their son plays a far larger role in proceedings. In the first draft script, Hancock also suffers severe PTSD and this is implied to be the cause of his violent outbursts. In this original draft, the movie opens on the film's narrator discussing the experience of witnessing something traumatic. Throughout the film, the audience assumes this narrator is Will Smith's Hancock and the trauma he's talking about is the decades of tragedies he has seen. The film makes it clear that these tragedies have taken a severe psychological toll on the superpowered being, resulting in attempts to better himself before he loses his mind. These attempts are unsuccessful, as the film's climax sees him turn to violence after failing to stop another tragedy. Near the end of the movie, a collapsing building kills the family's loving mother Mary after she is kidnapped. Enraged and driven insane, Hancock himself proceeds to slaughter an entire police department in frustration. But after this incredibly violent sequence, the film's bombshell twist - which ranks up there with Fight Club's twist for impact - reveals that the narrator isn't Hancock himself at all. Instead, the viewer discovers that Hancock transferred his powers to the family's young son Aaron and sent him back in time to save his mother. The traumatic incident that the narrator, Aaron, was talking about witnessing was walking in on his parents having sex, and his heart-breaking madness comes from trying and failing to save his mother's life. He has been through this before and will go through it all over again, as the now-superpowered Aaron is trapped in a never-ending loop and is unable to save his mother from her inevitable fate. It's this frustration and hopelessness that drives his tragic downfall and makes the outburst of homicidal madness inevitable.” Basically Hancock and the son were the same person trapped in a time loop that causes to go him mad. Or better yet Hancock sent the son back in time and he caused the building to collapse and his mother to die leaving him in an endless time loop. At least that's what I think is going on. I'm not sure.
