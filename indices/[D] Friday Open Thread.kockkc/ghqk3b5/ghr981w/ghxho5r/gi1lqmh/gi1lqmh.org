It's a movie preaching extreme self-sacrifice made in a country where extreme selfishness is disproportionately present (something something please wear a mask). Whether out of genuine belief, desire to create controversy for free advertising, or just to be contrarian, it doesn't seen deserving of that level of disdain.

idk I wouldn't use the term 'depravity' here with all its supreme negative connotations. Maybe 'morally pig-headed' or even some variant of stupid, there's better ways to do good than suicidal organ donation after all, but eh.
