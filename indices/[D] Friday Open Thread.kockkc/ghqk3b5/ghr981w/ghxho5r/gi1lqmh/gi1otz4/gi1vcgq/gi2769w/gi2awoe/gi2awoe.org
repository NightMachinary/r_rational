(should probably clarify I agree with your points about killing and chain reactions and lowering the bar and all)

I think the difference of opinion here on my side kinda comes down to that the decisions don't seem anything particularly special? Like jury formation, selection, power, etc. is an example of people having much more power than their knowledge justifies. As is the case for large swathes of politicians and law enforcement.

I don't see Seven Pounds as a horror movie because I'm inured to a story that's a microcosm of larger issues. A big chunk of my stance comes from a life filled with bullshit though, so I guess this is playing a big part in the difference of opinions.

(also I kinda disagree with calling it a horror movie when the main character's actions seem arguably net positive to me, especially compared to if he decided to handle his depression and suicidal tendencies with any number of 'immediate solutions' instead)

(also also self-sacrifice being presented as a virtue ain't out of left field given the broad strokes of a bunch of religions in America. Dude deciding on that path seems less like extreme narcissism if that's taken into consideration)
