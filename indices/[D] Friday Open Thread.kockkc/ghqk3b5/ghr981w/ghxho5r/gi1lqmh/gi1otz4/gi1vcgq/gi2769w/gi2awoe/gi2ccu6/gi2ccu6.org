  Like jury formation, selection, power, etc. is an example of people having much more power than their knowledge justifies.

We can argue about the ethics of those things (juries seem dumb to me), but one wrong thing doesn't make another one right. When it comes to organ donations, we have in place systems to keep donors and receivers anonymous and unknown to each other, and to decide priorities based on simple need and life expectancy, not perceived moral worth. I think that is a lot fairer than what Tim does. Breaking laws to go beyond it is Tim saying "no, I know better than literally the rest of society, I will donate my organs but only on /my/ terms". Why did he have to pick seven especially good people anyway? He doesn't know what the people he killed were like. Maybe some were assholes too.

  I don't see Seven Pounds as a horror movie because I'm inured to a story that's a microcosm of larger issues. A big chunk of my stance comes from a life filled with bullshit though, so I guess this is playing a big part in the difference of opinions.

Something that I haven't even gotten into however is Tim's biggest, worst action. His behaviour towards Emily. In order to evaluate her, he gets close to her. He /knows/ what he wants to do. But he doesn't restrain himself. He gets close, and they fall in love, and she now loves him and dreams of a life with him. And at the height of it... he goes and kills himself, and has her receive his heart, and now she has to live both with the pain of having lost the one she loved and the knowledge he lied to her, and manipulated her, and did it all purportedly /for her own good/, all without giving her any agency or say in the matter. She could have said "no, I want to live with you, so don't leave me, I'll hope that another heart arrives and if it doesn't then I want you to be there for me when I die". He doesn't ask. He's too self-absorbed in deciding what is good for others, he doesn't take into account their opinion. What he does is like... textbook narcissistic abuse on a grandiose scale. The fact that he dies for it doesn't really excuse him. He /wanted/ to die. It always was about him getting what he wanted. He just coated his suicide in the guise of a selfless act for the sake of making himself feel good. Yes, some good comes out of it, but a lot more good and a lot less suffering could have come out of it if he wasn't so hell bent on making it all some sort of twisted human sacrifice ritual.
