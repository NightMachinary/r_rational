I just took it for the first time in a 2 years and got INFJ, which surprised me. I'd usually get INTJ or ENTJ depending on how extroverted I had been at the time.

Somewhere in along the way I'd jumped over from the "Analyst" grouping to the "Diplomat" grouping. The description for INFJ wasn't a very accurate description of me though. (Not that the meyers briggs is especially accurate anyways.)
