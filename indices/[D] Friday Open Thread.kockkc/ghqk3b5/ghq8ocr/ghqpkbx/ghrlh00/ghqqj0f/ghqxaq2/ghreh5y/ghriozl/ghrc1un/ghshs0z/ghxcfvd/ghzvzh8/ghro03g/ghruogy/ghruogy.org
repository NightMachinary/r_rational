That's true in real life, yes.

I'd agree that some rational stories are unrealistic. Some present a cast of characters that are all unfailingly articulate, literate, and above average intelligence.

Just for example, I love all of Wildbow's works, but I do notice that most of his characters (even the ones who are supposed to be dumb) are more articulate and reasonable than the people I know from similar walks of life in reality.
