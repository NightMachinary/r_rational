There certainly are rational stories that prefer to have people acting as rational as possible and end up appearing more like robots than people, but I don't find that to be common in popular works. I don't think I agree with you on Wildbow's works, though I've only read Worm and Ward. Main characters sometimes act unreasonably and also interact with people who act unreasonably. The only explicitly “dumb” character I can think of is Rachel and I don't think she was particularly articulate.
