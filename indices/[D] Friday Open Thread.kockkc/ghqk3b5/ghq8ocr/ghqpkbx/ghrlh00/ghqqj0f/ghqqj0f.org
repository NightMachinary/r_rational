It seems that the, "official" longest pieces of English literature by word count are fanfiction. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12715870/1/The-Loud-House-Revamped][/The Loud House Revamped/]] is ongoing, has been around for more than two years, and currently stands at over 7.8 million words surpassing both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10333897][/Ambience: A Fleet Symphony/]] (4.5 million) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4112682/1/The_Subspace_Emissarys_Worlds_Conquest][/The Subspace Emissary's Worlds Conquest/]] (4.1 million) by a wide margin.

For comparison, Worm is 1.6 mill. words, the Harry Potter series is 1.08 mill., HPMOR is 0.66 mill.

This would of course be excluding works which are nonsense, extremely obscure, blatantly just meant to be record-setters, and/or don't really count as a single work.

Some would demand that the standards be stricter, excluding serials, demanding that included stories be published by standards closer to the mainstream, etc.

I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to reading. At the same time, I burn through books very quickly, even when not on lockdown. One of my favorite series is /A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight/ by Henry Williamson whose most known trait is its length (2.6 mill). Girth aside, it's not something that has broad appeal to a contemporary audience, even to rationalists, but I'd recommend it if you're interested in the early 20th century.

I haven't read any of the above mentioned fanfic aside from HPMOR, but I do end up reading a lot of it and other webfiction that floats above Sturgeon's Law to fulfill the potential that more mainstream media doesn't have the time, ability, or willingness to fulfill.

I often wonder about the truly niche series that exist, even more niche than genre-bending fanfic.
