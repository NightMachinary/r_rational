  ... but I still get that nice feeling of accomplishment when something falls into place.

I do this with video games. I've put in a whole bunch of hours into Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2, and have yet to complete either even once. I enjoy tinkering around with party composition, figuring out which spells and skills work in what combinations.

I spend a lot of time optimizing things, probably too much.
