I think in /Queen's Gambit/, and in other works, a lot of what underpins the narrative is the joy of playing the game, and the emergent beauty that it sometimes has. /Queen's Gambit/ doesn't go very far into actual chess, seeing as actually explaining tactics to a layman is quite hard, especially without having enough room to breathe, but I think you do get the sense of it as that to the people involved. There's joy in clean, precise lines of play, or brilliant insights, and the fact that it's ultimately meaningless expect as a matter of competition is kind of immaterial.

Pure mathematics has some of that too, but it's harder to show on the screen, and perhaps less easy to identify with. Playing games is easy to identify with, because it's something that almost everyone has done, and some of the "deeper" feelings are accessible even to novices. I'm not good at chess (rated like 900), but I still get that nice feeling of accomplishment when something falls into place.

And yes, I would agree that this is in some sense "wasteful". Especially with chess, all you leave behind are games that you played, recorded for posterity, and it's not quite like a different pursuit where people can build off of it, or take their own joy in consuming and integrating what you've made. (This isn't /quite/ true, because high-level chess players learn a lot from old games, and chess theory develops, and there /is/ joy to be had from replaying and analyzing exceptional games, but IMO this pales in comparison to the utility of something like an old painting or an old book.)

I guess I would caution against going too far into utilitarian calculation that doesn't take into account the utilitarian benefits of play, and of the happiness that can be had from watching and enjoying high-level experts at fields that are specifically selected for being stimulating in particular ways that /aren't/ necessarily "helpful" to anyone in a more concrete way. It's just harder to evaluate the utility.
