I feel the opposite way. For any game/hobby for the top few most talented people in the world to not pursue it seems like such a waste to me. Even if it's a silly game it's just a few people out of the billions in the world.

I guess the difference is that I don't think talent in specific games transfer much at all. Top chess players don't seem to have exceptionally high IQs.
