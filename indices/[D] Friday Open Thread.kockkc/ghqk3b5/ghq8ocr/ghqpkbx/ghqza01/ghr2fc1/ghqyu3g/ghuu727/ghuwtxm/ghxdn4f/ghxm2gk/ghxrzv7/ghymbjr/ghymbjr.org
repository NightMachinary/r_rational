While the MC is 'attractive' she is definitely in the category of 'attractive but not enough that it inherently annoys average people of that gender', which is what actors and actresses in general tend to be if they are main characters.

They need to be likeable to average people, so not attractive enough that it annoys them.

From personal taste and general understanding of how men tastes work I can tell you that MC isn't hot. She's beautiful sure, I doubt many men would say otherwise but you'd be hard pressed to find one that calls her hot, or sexually appealing in general.

I mentioned the series to a couple friends and their reaction was, 'oh my gf is watching that', and 'who recommended that to you? that's more of a women show.' None were that enthused or particularly interested in watching it, so at least from my experience the target audience is clearly mostly women.
