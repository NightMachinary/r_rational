That was one specific period, the exception rather than the rule. If you assume evolution influences physical attraction most men are attracted to what we can assume fertile women looked like for most of our evolutionary history. i.e Tan, lean and in shape.. Similarly for women but with some differences like a lower importance of fertility and a higher focus on status and providing capacity.

Hair color preferences, are a bit weird for instance natural blond hair was rare for adults even in northern europe, but it was relatively more common for teens. Meaning men who in general prefer to date younger saw it as a desirable trait, but women who in general prefer to date older tended to like dark hair better..

It's also where the general view that blond women tend to not be very bright comes from. Before hair dyes, blond women were for the most part teenagers.

  Frankly it sounds a lot like it'd have to be men who are really super invested on appearing hypermasculine all the time who would call it "a women's show". I've never heard it called that once.

It might be surprising but a very large percentage of men will not consume a story where the main character isn't a man given the choice. And no it's not just the far right, or hyper masculine dudes. This is a known thing, like female authors, although that's slowly changing. Studios know that if they make a female main character they'll sell less.
