I don't think I have a deep enough knowledge of obscure ascii art rogue likes to do that! I've played Stone Soup but never managed to finish a single run. Also TOME, and more recently Caves of Qud, if we're talking really hard, traditional style stuff, and never finished any of those either. I like roguelikes, I just suck at them.
