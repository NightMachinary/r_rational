If its playing God to die for a (dumb) cause or belief than what do you count actual life or death decisions made over someone else as (be they violent, in defense, or as part of justice being carried out)? Like you're equating the deep end of bodily autonomy, having control over your own death, with playing God here.

And I really disagree with demonising it as a type of vigilantism. If you're using that word for making a decision about someone else's wellbeing then does voting or not voting count? Does a medical practitioner's work count? Does doing charity work count? If you're only counting things with negative impact, then what about the decisions people make to not do those things at all? If a decision you made had a life or death impact that you didn't forsee as possible, did you play God?

Like at the end of the day, beyond this movie, if you can make a value judgement about how good or bad the world is, you can decide if the removal of any one person (or yourself) would be an improvement. Whether your threshold is trying to work out whether someone is just a net positive or negative overall, or your threshold being the Hitlers of the world and their kin, or what have you. If you consider good or bad, if you consider the implications of your actions, the reason for shying away from taking a single course as 'it would be playing God' is a cover for (reasonable) concerns about your own ability, biases and knowledge rather than some inherent virtue or value of making decisions.

(It's hard for me to express that all, given I'm on mobile and fairly sleep deprived right now. But tl:dr; the thing I hate the most is fear of the choice itself rather than fear of the consequences. One of the times I've felt the most disgust in someone is a discussion in an ethics course about the trolley problem where a small group refused to give an answer and said they'd miraculously save everyone somehow. If you can't even consider theoretical and abstract life or death choices, how small is your mind?)
