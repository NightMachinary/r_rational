But that's the thing, it's actually supreme selfishness in the guise of selflessness. Not once the protagonist worries about other people's feelings or opinions. He arbitrarily decides to play God and judge “the worthy”; he breaks bioethical and privacy laws that exist for a reason; and by getting close to the woman he's decided will have his heart, he inflicts her needless trauma and suffering when he then “dies for her”... when at that point she wanted to live in order to be /with him/. He's like a vigilante. He's actually a selfish, disturbed, suicidal narcissist; but somehow we're supposed to consider this a good thing.
