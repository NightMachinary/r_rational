What looks uncanny about it, at least to me, is how balanced they are. Being that balanced while dancing solo jazz is a skill that take a lot of practice to learn, and is often eschewed in favor of styling. Seeing a dance with near perfect balance, where the limited flair is also balanced in is mildly unsettling. The choreography is fun though.
