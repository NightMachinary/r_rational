I mean, it's the kind of test where you need to answer sincerely... supposedly. I think that's more of a problem that would arise with any sort of test (potentially even a psychological examination by an expert): repeat it long enough, you learn how to game it. The Forer effect thing is a separate issue IMO, even if the test was legit it probably is more of a function of not wanting to give anyone a personality description that reads like "yeah, you're probably a self-absorbed, heartless psychopath, do humanity a favor and kill yourself".
