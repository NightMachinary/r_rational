Happy (belated, for those in Oceania / East Asia) New Year, everyone! Hindsight is 2020, as they say, so I'm curious how y'all's years went in retrospect. What were your biggest success and failures? In what contexts would you have acted differently, given predictable foreknowledge of the outcome? Were you able to satisfy any New Year's Resolutions made one orbital period ago, and if so (or if not), what do you think was most instrumental there? (probs best to [[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02336.x][not share]] any current resolutions, ofc). How did this year's unique circumstances (e.g. the global pandemic) affect your lifts?
