It has a lot appeal because it's what we evolved to like. We didn't evolve to live in cities where most people are lonely while surrounded by people.

​

We evolved to live in tightly knit groups of family and friends, who work with us but just enough work to maintain ourselves and our families rather than to stockpile. To travel and explore new places, share excess food with others because there's no refrigeration and that's technically food preservation because it means when we're hungry other will be more likely to share their food with us etc.

​

There's a lot of appeal to that way of life, it's technically heaven, specially if you remove the bad parts like disease, suffering and all.

(Just started on Heaven's River the new bobiverse book and so far a specie of alien seems to have chosen that scenario for themselves even though they possessed advanced tech).
