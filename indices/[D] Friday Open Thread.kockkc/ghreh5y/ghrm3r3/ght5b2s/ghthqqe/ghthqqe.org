Possibly the issue with no wand for Harry. This gets resolved... eventually. Without it, Harry has a hard time in general. With a wand, his combat ability seems to match or exceed that of the other Istari. This is having a significant effect on the goblins and orcs, as the war is being brought to them early and more effectively.

Aside: What's amusing is that Harry seems to lack the meta-knowledge that cannon-Harry has regarding the LotR.
