  I liked how The Shadow of Angmar started, but it sort of lost me after a half dozen chapters. Would you recommend trying it again?

I think it has been interesting so far. One of the major sticking points finally gets resolved a bit further in. Though at great cost.

Yeah, I'd still want some high tech, but not the disposable culture that currently surrounds it. Living near the mountains, with access to some city life would be grand.

Even in a high-tech, post-scarcity society, there's still plenty that is interesting out there. Like dark matter / energy, the possibilities with alien life, etc. I'd enjoy having enough time to study those sorts of things.
