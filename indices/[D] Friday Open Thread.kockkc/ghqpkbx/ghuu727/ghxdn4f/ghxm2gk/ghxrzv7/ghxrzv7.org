Not entirely correct, IMHO. First, there's plenty of western female audience that has experienced something similar - the weeb part of it, that is. Second, it's hardly targeted only at women, or did you miss the part where the main actress is kinda really hot and is always framed in a way to make sure we never forget it? If anything it's sort of the reverse of the usual shonen sports manga - whereas those tend to give an outlet for self insert to men and lots of steamy shirtlessness and bromance with gay subtext to women, this one was exactly the other way around, with a protagonist women could identify with and plenty of fanservice for men.

It's more that it reached out to the sort of mainstream audience that would dismiss anime as "cartoons" and not give them a chance, by offering a very similar kind of story and payoff in a format that appeared more "serious" and thus credible, easy to recommend to friends, and so on.
