Bubble stuff, I saw plenty of men appreciating her. I don't think people who are "too attractive" annoy anyone, it's more that if they're blatantly used /only/ for the purpose of racking up sexy points anyone who's not interested in them sexually (aka: heterosexual people of the opposite sex, homosexual of the same, and bisexual of either) is not interested at all. But this is not the case here, she's attractive but she's also a good actress and there was more to her character than simply being a pretty face. But if anything I've even seen a lot of criticism aimed at the show for glamourizing Beth too much even when she was at rock bottom, or for being too male gaze-y. So.
