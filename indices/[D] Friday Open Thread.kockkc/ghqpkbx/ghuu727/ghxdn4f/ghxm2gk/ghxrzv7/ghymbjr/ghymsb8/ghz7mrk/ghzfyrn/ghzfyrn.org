  I'd be interested if the people that brought that up were men.

They absolutely were. And some of the comments weren't the sort you'd make in front of your girlfriend, unless she's pretty open minded. If you know what I mean.

  But men don't rate that very highly, we are attracted to health because evolutionarily that's more conductive to having big healthy babies and an easier pregnancy. Pale skin doesn't exactly signals good health. But then again maybe she's really hot to very pasty men with Scottish ancestry ?

Oh, come on, culture easily trumps all that. In practice, at any time in history, we're attracted by whatever is a sign of being wealthy. It used to be being pale and plump, now it's more often being tan and thin. Same difference. And yes, she's quite fair skinned, but it's not like that's such a turnoff on its own. Another huge factor is difference and variety - men who see dark haired women all day might like blondes, and vice versa. Anyway, the series had its appeal for male audiences too, though I'd be interested in seeing audience stats. I think your personal bubble might just have that specific slant. Frankly it sounds a lot like it'd have to be men who are really super invested on appearing hypermasculine all the time who would call it "a women's show". I've never heard it called that once.
