The various, uh, â€˜personalities' (with unique mannerisms, styles of dress, etc.) featured in all the tournaments did remind me of an anime's colorful cast of competitors! I do agree that it was pretty tropey, but I think cookie cutter narratives & character arcs work well for a reason, and otherwise enjoyed the acting and cinematography etc. as you say :]
