I've watched it and I must say the story is so cliché, and cookie cutter. You can see the beats coming from a mile away.

​

We start with an orphan, she lives in an orphanage, gets a mentor. Her talent is discovered. Gets adopted and has her first real fight. Finds a way to get money. Continues to win so that the crash that's coming in the middle for tension is bigger. Crash comes. Training arc. MC wins..

​

I thought he'd do something interesting in the end, or have some theme. But all we get is what we knew would happen, and a generic 'Drugs are bad, hmm ok'.

​

The music and cinematography carry the show there, but the plot and storyline are imho a tad simple. It feels like an average power fantasy webnovel, but set irl.
