I've heard of Queen's Gambit, wasn't convinced and still not quite convinced it's worth watching, despite I'm a longtime chess player, good enough that I could make a living off of it and become an FM.

It struck me as woke-bait and I anticipated that it'd probably be mediocre while still hitting a handful of milestones meant for broad appeal. There's not much profit in portraying chess or competitive chess authentically or at least without a lot of extraneous content.

Bits and pieces of what I've heard about it suggest I may have underestimated it a bit, but despite having a passion for chess, I have little desire to watch it and a broad disgust with being associated with Netflix, even in spirit.

Answering what you brought up, your average chess prodigy is a combination of someone who was immersed in the chess world from an early age and someone who is a savant in a handful of cognitive skills that lend very well to chess.

Professional chess is psychologically draining both on and off the board. The people who can withstand the stress enough to make it a career are often either twisted enough on some level that the world of chess is one of the only places they can thrive, so they go all in, or are all-around ordered enough individuals that they can see a bigger picture while still having the self-mastery to be successful. I consider myself in the latter category.

I'm not a savant or the result of someone pushed into the sport. Chess was a side hobby before I decided it was what I wanted to do as a job to provide the revenue to do other things I enjoy doing. That doesn't mean I don't like chess a lot, but I'm not a prodigy and it's not my life.

I suspect that I'd have done a lot more if I made chess into an end unto itself. I suspect I could've contributed to the world even more if I pursued something in STEM. I'm self-taught in mathematics and various other fields enough that I can read works about them at roughly postgraduate levels. That being said my goal was never to fit into the world in that way. That's a whole different rant on its own, but the contributions I chose to make are more abstract.
