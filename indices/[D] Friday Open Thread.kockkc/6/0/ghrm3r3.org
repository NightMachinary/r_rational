I liked how The Shadow of Angmar started, but it sort of lost me after a half dozen chapters. Would you recommend trying it again?

In terms of fictional universes, I think I'd much rather be a citizen of the Culture than of some elven realm of Middle-earth -- if anything, the latter can be produced by the former if you ask a Mind nicely.

In the real world...I do like outdoorsy stuff (mostly walking), as well as more city-based fl√¢nerie, but I also like goofing around with computer-y stuff and hermithood. I think my ideal house would be if you modernized fallingwater's interior, transplanted it to the base of some waterfall in the Lauterbrunnen Valley, and put in high-speed rail to Zurich, while incidentally also transplanting Tokyo's downtown into one of its corner's. Alternatively, take [[https://www.telluriderealestatecorp.com/listing/38274/341-royer-lane-telluride-co-81435/?fbclid=IwAR2C62-7NmFEgTGLfR1O7Uuwc2mx56qHvkD0Ys1T_r4ruF7surDVEedoNWU][this house]] and chuck it into the mountains north of Vancouver, BC.

In this scenario I'd ofc be independently wealthy, and a small fleet of robots would take care of all household chores. Each morning I would wake up and (after consulting my partner over morning lattes, we'd) choose to either tend to personal (science / programming / altruistic) projects, or go on a long walk in the surrounding forests and hills. Once a week we'd invite a few friends over to play games and have fun conversations.
