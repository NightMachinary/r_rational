Sorry, this rambles a bit...

After zipping through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]] (Harry Potter is transported to Tolkein's Middle Earth), I think I'd like to live like the Elves.

Well, not exactly as an Elf or in Middle Earth, but more in tune with the environment and nature as they are. I've read LotR and such before, but it for whatever reason, really sunk in to me reading that fanfic just how appealing their lifestyle would be for me.

If we do see some sort of Rapture of the Nerds or otherwise solve some pressing problems with the environment and mortality, I'd probably choose to stay human for a while if that is feasible.

I'm envisioning an alternate version of the 20th century America. There's no plastic packaging and the disposable consumer lifestyle, everything is (or at least can be) recycled. Lots of towns and small cities that are more attuned to their environment. Walkable downtown areas that don't allow cars. Not on the level of Lothlorien, but more trees and a garden-like environ outside of the core. There's enough non-animal sources of complete protein that there is no need for factory farms, everyone is gladly vegan.

People living a long, long time, and developing their own skills and crafts and art.

I suppose I could deal with the occasional orc and goblin incursions, but I'd rather not see the long-term withering of lightness and culture by a formless and implacable evil like Morgoth or Sauron. Even with their defeat, the Forth Age of Middle Earth sounds fairly... meh.

Elves, The Culture, or something else... what would be your idyllic living look like?
