"100% of the 28 studies to date report positive effects" raises some red flags. For p=0.05 there's only a 23.8% chance of all of them being positive, even if all factors were the same throughout. They mention this, along with widely varying protocols, but then go on to make very definitive conclusions from these studies.

Is there a proposed mechanism of action somewhere?

Edit: this site is impressive though. It's super cool to see this kind of transparent analysis and visuals out in the wild like this!
