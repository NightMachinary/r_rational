This also raises a huge number of red flags. This is not my field but HCQ has been throughly researched and discarded as a treatment. It's not some conspiracy of overly negative reporting of studies in North America, the global community has come to the same conclusions. It would be interesting to see an expert review of this, off the top of my head there's blatant: bad usage of p values, begging the question, and over conclusions.

Is this some weird conspiracy thing? There's clearly a lot of work put into it but it's obviously not targeting other experts. Is it just supposed to be a weird massive source for "actually /science/ says there's tons of treatments for Covid" for layman debates?
