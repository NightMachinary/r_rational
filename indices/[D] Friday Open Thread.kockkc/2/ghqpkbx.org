Just watched the show "Queen's Gambit" these last couple weeks, which I quite enjoyed! All about a young woman struggling to rise to the top of the competitive chess world while struggling with interpersonal relationships and substance abuse problems. Especially liked the (rare, for Western media) positive portrayal of Russian people and culture -- the Americans were all alcoholics in this one, for a change! lol

One thing that struck me, though, that doesn't seem to be a very popular topic of discussion on the [[/r/queensgambit]] subreddit, is how devoting one's life and talents to playing children's +card+ board games is always seen as a worthwhile way to spend one's time, relative to, say, working in pure maths or physics research, or some other "productive intellectual pursuit". Beth Harmon in the first episode is shown to effortlessly excel in school, especially in more theoretical subjects (i.e. math), and takes to chess initially after trivially acing some academic test in demonstrable mismatch between her abilities and those of her peers. Her failure to become the next Turing or Euler or whoever is not shown as a tragedy -- indeed, it's never remarked upon at all. Except maybe in how her mother's mental illness led her to attempt murder-suicide, instead of capitalizing upon whatever talents enabled her to achieve a Math PhD from Cornell, and also when Beth is shown to ask another chess player what his intentions are after becoming King of Games.

Anyone feel the same? (I remember participating in a similar discussion on this subject 5-10 years ago here -- iirc, it was in reference to the Paul Murphy quote "The ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life." Curious if sentiment's changed since). Is playing chess not actually a squandering of one's talents, in the same way that, say, playing Starcraft is? (obviously a life you enjoy is a life well-lived blah blah blah you know what I mean). At least when Lex Luthor [[https://i.imgur.com/Mg4w7uA.jpeg][plays exhibition matches]] he only does so in between other useful things, like plotting world domination or something. And would chess prodigies even make math or science prodigies, otherwise? It sounds like [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289616301593]["cognitive ability" underpins]] both, but is the relationship tightly coupled enough that any given individual would find themselves in both tails with sufficiently high probability? Am I too far up my own asshole? What do y'all think?
