I mean, she likes chess though. In another story she might have met a janitor who was into theoretical physics and taken that path, but this isn't it. I would be wary of portray it as “a tragedy” - people have also their own preferences, they're not just tools to advance society. It would be a tragedy if she both failed to live up to her potential and suffered from it. Besides, for all we know she might have been just a decently good physicist instead of a world class chess player.
