A large percentage of people are annoyed by overly attractive people that dress well irl. It's blatant and happens very often. They rationalize it and use different words for it to not seem shallow but it is a thing that happens..

It's one of the reasons why main actors in superhero and other action movies and shows aren't the most handsome men available. Same thing for main actresses in romcoms. They are attractive sure, but they are not attractive enough to annoy their target audiences.

  But if anything I've even seen a lot of criticism aimed at the show for glamourizing Beth too much even when she was at rock bottom, or for being too male gaze-y.

  I saw plenty of men appreciating her.

I'd be interested if the people that brought that up were men. And in what context those men were appreciating her.. For instance having your gf ask if they think beth is beautiful / pretty, most men would reply yes very. But that doesn't necessarily mean they'd follow her instagram.. Know what I mean ?

She has traits women think are very attractive like a very even, pale white skin. But men don't rate that very highly, we are attracted to health because evolutionarily that's more conductive to having big healthy babies and an easier pregnancy. Pale skin doesn't exactly signals good health. But then again maybe she's really hot to very pasty men with Scottish ancestry ?
