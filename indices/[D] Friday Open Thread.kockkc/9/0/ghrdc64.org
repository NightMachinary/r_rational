From their FAQ:

#+begin_quote
  *Why should we trust* [[/u/CovidAnalysis][u/CovidAnalysis]]*?*

  There is no need to. We provide organization and analysis, but all sources are public and you can easily verify everything. For the country-based analysis, all data is public and the analysis is simple to replicate. *We also note that many equally qualified experts report contradictory conclusions.* If you don't like our analysis, you can use our database to locate information you may have missed for your own research.

I'd like to see these what those contradictory conclusions are before blindly trusting this website..

​

The same site states this if you click on HCQ at the top:

#+begin_quote
  Censored by Twitter - [[https://hcqtw.com/][Twitter version (data only, no conclusion)]]

  [[https://hcqmeta.com/][*HCQ is effective for COVID-19 when used early: meta analysis of 185 studies*]]
#+end_quote

HCQ = Hydroxychloroquine. Which AFAIK has been proven ineffective and removed from the emergency approval by the US gov it initially passed, after study results showed it's ineffective.

​

So overhaul not a trustworthy website.
