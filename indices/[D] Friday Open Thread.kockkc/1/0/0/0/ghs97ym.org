Both of these explainations are good: unnatural balance and jerky/precise movements. Humans naturally move their center of balance around much more and usually value smooth movement, but they're never perfect. I think the balance is the most unerving, they don't move through unbalanced phases like we do all the time.

I couldn't stop thinking about the poor souls who had to put in a huge amount of work to make a robot dance video. I doubt that was in their job description.
