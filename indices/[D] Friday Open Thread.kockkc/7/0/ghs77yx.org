For the first 5ish years after I first learned of the test long ago, I'd always get INFP.

Then after thinking something like "I'm just giving 'INFP answers', what if I try to approach it as if I didn't already know what the answers /'should'/ be," I started getting INFJ consistently for a while.

Then I came back to it years later and was getting INTP and INTJ. A few years ago I came back to it again and got ENTP and ENFP consistently for a period of time. I took it again for the first time in several years just now and got INFP.

  If the test gives people such inaccurate results, why do so many still put stock in it? One reason is that the flattering, vague descriptions for many of the types have huge amounts of overlap --- so many people could fit into several of them.

  This is called the Forer effect, and is a technique long used by purveyors of astrology, fortune telling, and other sorts of pseudoscience to persuade people they have accurate information about them.

It's a glorified horoscope.
