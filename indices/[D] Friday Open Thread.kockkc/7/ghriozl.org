What personality type from the Myers-Briggs framework are you? I'm interested in seeing similarities from this subreddit.

I predict people would be :

Introverts over Extroverts to be more into reading.

Writers of fiction would be Sensing over Intuitive- more likely to put rationalist ideas into actions, whereas readers would be Intuitive - enjoy making connections and ideas from reading fiction.

Thinking over feeling

Judging over Perceiving.

Personally I am ENTP but I'm very interested in discussion.
