Who says we don't? Wear what you want, bruh.

Even a ten dollar shirt from Walmart will look good if you have it tailored. I've never personally taken that step, but I've been aware for a while now that everything looks better on models when they take the pictures for advertising because they have the clothes all pinned up in the back for a temporary tailoring.

Even in person at a store, the mannequins usually have the shirts pinned together in the back so it looks like it fits better than it does.

If you or I wore the stuff in the pictures you linked, we wouldn't look that good.

I'm not sure how all that relates back to "wear what you want, bruh," but I've typed it now so there it is.
