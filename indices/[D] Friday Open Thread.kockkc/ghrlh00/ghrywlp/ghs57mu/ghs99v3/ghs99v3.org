I was looking at pictures from models, posing with the colorful clothing meant to sell stuff, and 95% of them couldn't pull it off imho.

​

There's also the fact that clothes are in general designed and made for fit people with good posture, not necessarily to average people. Which means most clothes don't look as good as they do in pictures from models as they do when we buy them.

PS. I'm not sure if you're a man or if you're trolling because of the way I phrased it, from your name I always assumed you were a woman but now I'm confused XD
