I agree in principle, but in practice what I'd want probably doesn't exist, and reasonably many people can't exactly afford to be their own stylists and then get tailor-made clothes. I like men's cuts for clothes, I'd just enjoy if they weren't almost all so drab in color choices.

I'm less worried about the social judgement aspect. I've got the marked impression that in many circumstances you could push the envelope quite a bit as long as you're distinctly confident while doing it. People will either be too embarrassed, too polite or too stunned to say anything to your face, and the Emperor's New Clothing effect will benefit you. After a while, if you're not a pain in the butt for them for more practical reason, it'll likely just become filed as a quirk of yours, and it might if anything benefit you as you are now visually very distinctive and jump to people's mind more easily and draw their attention more.
