You're jumping a few steps here. Let's review his actions. Tim (that's his name, apparently) kills seven people in an accident caused by his own carelessness. He now feels the weight of those lives, and his guilt for them. That's all fine and good, it makes sense, any human with a conscience ought to. He decides he needs to atone for them by doing good. No, wait, he doesn't /exactly/ decide that. He could do that in a very simple way: keep living and dedicate his efforts from then on to the selfless betterment of humanity. Depending on what he does, he could save tens, hundreds of lives.

But he doesn't do that.

He wants to die, he's suicidal. Fine. I can understand that. He doesn't seek therapy and maybe it wouldn't help. His atonement will be that he will turn his body into a way to make others survive. He finds out a way to die that will make his organs easily harvestable (let's not even get into the utter stupidity of the jellyfish thing, and just assume he finds an /actual realistic/ way to do that). He could then just sign himself as an organ donor, off himself and have his body be found. They will be used to help as many people as they can. Maybe eight, or ten. According to the usual criteria that are used to distribute organs. For, you know, everyone else, whom Tim has no reason to consider himself morally superior to. In fact, he's a murderer, even if only by negligence. He's supposed to be all self-loathing and shit. He's by most metrics likely to be a /worse/ judge of morality than the average bioethicist.

But he doesn't do that either. No, that is not enough to satisfy Tim's oh-so-deep need for redemption.

No, Tim needs more. Tim needs an elaborate, twisted scheme that allows his organs to go to the ritualistic number of seven people, because of course that's how doing good works, you offset exactly how much evil you did and not one bit more. Balanced, as all things should be. And these seven people shouldn't be just random people, no, they should be worthy, they should be the Chosen Ones. And who's the arbiter of that choice? Why, Tim, of course. Tim the murderer, Tim the self-loathing narcissistic psycho who somehow has now turned into the one human who understands morality better than anyone else. He hurls abuse at a blind man over the phone to "test him", as if that man getting angry wouldn't have been entirely appropriate and would have made him bad. How are these fair evaluations of a person's moral character? How can you even decide who deserves to live or die based on this? Why /should/ you decide?

#+begin_quote
  if you can make a value judgement about how good or bad the world is, you can decide if the removal of any one person (or yourself) would be an improvement. Whether your threshold is trying to work out whether someone is just a net positive or negative overall, or your threshold being the Hitlers of the world and their kin, or what have you

If everyone simply drew a line and said "everyone below this line needs to die because the world would be better off without them", the world would be a constant shootout with people trying to kill each other for the Greater Good. Because everyone's line would be different. That's how fanatics think. In reality, most people who want to be moral without being absolutist about a no killing rule - but are also sensible enough to see their own limits - have two far spaced lines. I can be reasonably sure that if someone killed, say, everyone keeping together Boko Haram, the world would be overall better for it. And I can be reasonably sure that if someone killed Gino Strada (war doctor who helps refugees etc., first name that came to my mind), the world would be overall worse. But in between there's a big, big bunch of people who qualify for "does not compute". The world is a complex system and you can't split everything so clearly in good and bad, or foresee all consequences of an action. You do good to someone, you do bad to someone else. And it takes a whole lot of good to offset and justify the act of killing itself (which isn't just the taking of a life; killing can lower the bar for /more/ killing, and depending on the context, it can set off a chain reaction which then leads to much greater loss of life).

So, conversely, who's Tim to decide who deserves to live more? No one. His choices will still be little more than random. Maybe the guy he thought was an asshole was just having a bad day, and the guy he thought was a saint is actually a clever psychopath who projects a very well studied image. Tim can't know, because Tim isn't a psychologist, isn't an ethicist, isn't even an especially moral person, Tim is a disturbed megalomaniac who committed manslaughter and is now having a very elaborated narcissistic episode, and lacks the self reflection and awareness to realise that. Seven Pounds is a horror movie.
