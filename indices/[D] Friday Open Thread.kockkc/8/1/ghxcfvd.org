Rational fiction means treating people as having inner motives and thoughts. Even the stupider reactions to this pandemic aren't something out of nowhere: they're either the result of thinking from wrong information, of having goals different from the stated ones, or just giving in to fear and thus indulging in wishful thinking - very irrational, but something we know humans do all the time. It would be stupidly unrealistic to model the world as a system of fully rational, perfectly informed agents, sure.
