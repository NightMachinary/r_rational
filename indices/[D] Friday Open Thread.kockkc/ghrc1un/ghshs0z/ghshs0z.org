Any work that is written with every character using a roughly identical frame of reference are unrealistic.

However, people rarely make entirely irrational decisions, although they may be illogical from a strict sense.

Peer pressure, for example.

It can make people behave illogically in some sense. (Asch conformity experiments).

But is it entirely irrational to not want to defy the majority?

I think rational fictions where everyone is very logical is unrealistic. Rational fictions where people follow their own interests typically are quite realistic.
