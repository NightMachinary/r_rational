It isn't as simple as "they're just behaving irrationally". That's too simplistic a map of people. They're /playing different games/.

Why should a 20-year old follow any of the restrictions? Is it a good idea to be the first in line for a vaccine that was rushed? "I don't know, but I don't trust the people on TV who hate people like me, so I'll sit it out." "Everything I do is posturing in order to jockey for social position, and my vocal responses to the events of the last year reflects that".

People can be a lot more interesting if you let them be. They're all running different heuristics under bounded rationality, and a large part of what I enjoy in those pieces of rational fiction I've liked is the juxtaposition of the ways different people reason, even if they don't do it explicitly.
