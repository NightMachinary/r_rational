If you know the location of secret military bases, then minimizing the number of people who know about the alt-earth is relatively easy. Simply send an agent up to the front door and knock on it. Get arrested and interviewed, and pass on some whistle-blower/defector style information that needs to be passed up the chain of command.

Once you have the direct attention of someone in a sufficiently high position, tell them about the alt-earth, and hopefully arrange for them to send an agent to verify it, then you're done.
