Forgive the brevity; on my phone.

The first question is authenticity. Anyone can say that they're from an alternate earth, the difficulty is in proving it. How much does SG Earth know about our Earth? Can they pinpoint some historical divergence? Can they dig up some classified material that they shouldn't have? Those add in an easy path to proving themselves.

If you've got that, all you really need is to get passed up the chain of command. Governments have these pathways in place already for defectors and whistleblowers.
