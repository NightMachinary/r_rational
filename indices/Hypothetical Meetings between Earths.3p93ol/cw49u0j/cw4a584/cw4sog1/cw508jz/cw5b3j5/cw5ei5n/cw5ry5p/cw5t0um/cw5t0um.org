Yes, I get that. You're right. Though I have one /minor/ quibble:

#+begin_quote
  there is no realistic guarantee that it was ever exactly the same to begin with, in the next universe over
#+end_quote

Depends when your universe diverged from theirs. If it was later than when they rebuilt it in 1933, the oval office is going to be in the same place, and if it was much before 1909 it will likely not be there at all, and certainly not anywhere near. You'd need to be in a pretty narrow range for slight offsets to exist.

Edit: corrected dates.
