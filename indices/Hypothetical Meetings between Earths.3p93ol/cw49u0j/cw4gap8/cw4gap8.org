Mine involved the use of a gate designed for trans-dimensional connection.

It involved a billionaire buying what he thought to be prop, but it turned out to be an actual stargate that connect to a different reality.

Then, Frank Cromwell, the guy who died in the blackhole incident, came through and knock out the billionaire on his driveway.

Anyway, conflict happened, because people don't expect fiction to become real.
