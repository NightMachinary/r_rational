Presumably they're using the quantum mirror to explore alternate dimensions? The mirror opens into the corresponding location in the alternate dimension, so they can step through anywhere they want, including into the Oval Office. The mirror opens a window through which both sides can see the other, so what would happen is that the President would see a window open in midair with some people on the other side standing in another Oval Office. Were I the SGC I would open the window, wave and say "hi, we're friendly explorers and we just want to talk. We'll call back tomorrow at this time so you can have some time to prep."

The next day I'd have a small, unarmed team step through. I'd leave the window open with armed backup just on the other side, but out of sight. I'd also make sure that I could repel an assault if the alternate USA decided to try one. Again, all of that would be out of sight.

At this point we've established extra-normal abilities and "we're from a parallel dimension" would be reasonable. We could ask for the local alternates of the contact team to be brought in so they could compare histories as another piece of proof.

The first substantive thing to talk about is why we're here. There must be some goal -- explore, trade, colonize, etc. Things will go very differently depending on whether SGC-verse wants to trade alien tech for oil as opposed to "we need a place for several thousand people to retreat to before the aliens kill us all."

I'd want to negotiate from a strong position, and it wouldn't be hard; we have tech hundreds of years beyond real!USA and they'd be crazy not to work with us in exchange for it. Being the only ones on the planet with staff weapon tech and X302s would put the USA firmly back on top as the world's only hyperpower. Unspoken would be the fact that, if we wanted to, we could use that tech to blow the crap out of anything local, and no security can stop us because we can open a doorway inside even the most secure bunker.
