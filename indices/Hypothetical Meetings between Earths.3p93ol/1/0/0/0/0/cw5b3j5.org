The Oval Office actually gets redecorated with every new president. Each wants to make their own mark on the Office and uses the interior decoration to say something about themselves. Now, the actual furniture within it is often historical, yes. But there are lots of historical options that allow a President to Say Something (or just express personal preference). For example, there have been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oval_Office_desks][six desks]] used in the Oval Office. Anytime the president changes, the rug, drapes, pictures, and upholstery seem to change as well; you can see [[http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/oval-office-history.htm][pictures here]].
