If the divergence was that far back and involved any interaction with Earth? The probability of humans having developed... let alone having recognizably similar languages, societies, states, and architecture... is approximately zero.

So in-universe (multiverse?) the divergence would have had to have happened within (lifetime + 9 months + news propagation time) of the youngest person sharing a common identity between the two timelines.
