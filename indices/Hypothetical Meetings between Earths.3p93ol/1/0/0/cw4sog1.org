For the record, while I like the concept personally, you couldn't necessarily guarantee even an /almost/ invisible window to another parallel, unless something about the setting mitigates butterflies, since there's more to an image than the exact location it's taken. Are the walls even the same color? How's the weather over there?

I guess if you could use read-only scrying portals to take accurate measurements, you could mitigate some of that; and for the purposes of this discussion, it's rather moot; but, there it is.
