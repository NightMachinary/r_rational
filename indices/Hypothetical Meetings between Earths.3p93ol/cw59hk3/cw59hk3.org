Why does SG!Earth USA want to contact a different Earth?

Depending on their goals, they would go about it in different ways, starting with /who/ they're going to contact.

Also, no government is a monolith. The POTUS may not have as much power in certain situations as other members of government (the POTUS is only around for up to 8 years and is a politician). Also, maybe the Russians would be a better choice. Or Brazil, or a combo.
