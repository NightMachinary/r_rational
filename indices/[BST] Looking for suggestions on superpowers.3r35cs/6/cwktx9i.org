+Two+Some random suggestions:

1. The power to decide to change your physical state and position to what it was 10 seconds ago (in the reference frame of the heaviest nearby object or something along those lines), everything else is unaffected . Naturally since your brain state is part of your physical state using this leads to losing all memories gained in that time. To make it more interesting and powerful change the time to anything less than 24 hours. Now the character has the option to do things without having knowledge of having done it as long as they do it within 24 hours of having the idea. Also creates the possibility of noticing you just made a big reset and have no idea why.

2. Having access to your mental state precisely 10 seconds into the future that would exist if you didn't use your power in the next 10 seconds. This allows things like gather information counter factually (for example to learn what is behind the forbidden door decide that in one second you will check if you already know what is behind the door, if you don't open the door, now use you power). Also allows thinking faster than usual by repeatedly reading the mind of a version of you that has already spent time thinking about the problem, but unless the information can be absorbed very quickly this would only allow for something like a 10x speed up. Also perhaps somewhat surprisingly someone with this power can be surprised by something so long as it happens within 10 as a result of using this power.

3. Probability manipulation working as follows: the character may specify any number of events as long as it would in principle be possible to tell if they had occurred. Then out of "all possible futures" futures in which any of the events did not occur are eliminated at a rate proportional to the number of futures remaining. So, for example if it say takes 1 hour to eliminate half of all futures then this character can make something which previously had a probability of 1/2 be guaranteed with one hour of use of their power, something with probability 1/4 with 2 hours of use of their power or something with probably 1/sqrt(2) be guaranteed with 30 minutes use of their power.
