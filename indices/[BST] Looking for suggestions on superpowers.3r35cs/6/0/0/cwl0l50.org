I don't want my internet persona so easily connected to my real life person, are you ok crediting a pseudonym? I usually go by NoSuchPlace.

Also I seem to have undersold number 3 since you only seem to only consider number 2s power noteworthy. Allow me to try to amend that:

Suppose you want the answer to some yes/no question, you can decide to toss a coin in 1 hour and use your power to eliminate futures in which the coin lands heads and the statement is false and futures in which the coin lands tails and the statement is true. Then in one hour the coin is guaranteed to land heads if and only if the statement is true. This gives you one bit of information, by repeating this and using binary search you can find the answer to almost any question.

Suppose now that you want to work out the answer to a problem which you could solve in principle but might take you a very long time. You start to use your power to eliminate futures in which you don't find the answer within 2 days. After one hour you will have eliminated approximately half the cases where you don't find the answer effectively halving the search space or doubling the speed at which you search. After 10 hours you will have effectively increased the rate at which you search by a factor of 1000. The same trick allows them to build a computer that computes NP-complete problems in polynomial time.

By running their power for long enough they could make essentially anything happen (they can force one in one quadrillion events to happen by applying their power for 2 days). Their main limitation would be that they need to ask for something far enough in advance, and their requests may be fulfilled in ways they did not expect (with potentially catastrophic outcomes): The way the power works is simply by eliminating futures in which the event did not happen. So, the event will happen in the way it was most likely to happen:

For example say they want to force the outcome of a lottery draw, so they request that a certain string of numbers is drawn in the next lottery. It will probably be more likely that the power user will decide to rig the lottery more directly and because of their power succeed, than the numbers appearing by natural means, so the request will be granted by making the user decide to use their power to rig the lottery by more conventional means.

Essentially they have an [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/][outcome pump]] with an adjustable power setting. If they are smart they will avoid using it at anything close to full power. Apologies for the wall of text.
