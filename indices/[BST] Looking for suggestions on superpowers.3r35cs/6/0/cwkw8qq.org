Nice. I especially like the first one. I think I would do it as 'set a chrono-anchor, then revert to that anchor', and let him have up to 2 anchors set at a time, with an anchor "coming loose" after 24 hours.

Number 2 is interesting to think about, but I think it would be hard to write for. Not just that it's very powerful, but also that it's complicated and would be hard to explain.

Number 3 is also very cool but hard to write. I'll put it in the list, though.
