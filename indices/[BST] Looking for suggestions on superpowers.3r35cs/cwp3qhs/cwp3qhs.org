My favorite gotcha along these lines was a Larry Niven story in which the characters discover a time accelerator - time inside the field speeds up by orders of magnitude. Later they find out that the inventor didn't mean it as a time accelerator, he meant it as an inertia-reducing drive for space travel purposes. It wasn't until years later that I thought back to the story and realized the link - I don't think it was ever spelled out in the story.
