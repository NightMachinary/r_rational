I don't think this fits quite so well, but maybe it could, and I've been thinking about it for the past couple days, so: Human Shapeshifting.

The idea was to make it look as much like standard "change into anyone" shapeshifting as possible, without making it too horrifically broken. (That you already have someone with subspace-related powers helps, since I was thinking that would be crucial to making it work.)

So, for example: you can't violate conservation of energy so much (not that I know where the energy for the transformations come from), so you can't change into anyone larger than your default form, unless you exploit some technicality regarding eating while shifted to stock up on mass to use later.

Transmuting elements would be absurdly energy-expensive, but moving around molecules less so.

You'll want your clothes and ID to change along with you, so the ability should probably extend as far as clothing can be reasonably expected to extend (so a couple inches or so). Anything that leaves your range will quickly revert to its original form (maybe there would be a delay that follows your favorite inverse power law, so you can show your ID to a police officer or a bouncer without it immediately changing in their hands, but so that it won't make it easy to disguise money or jewels?).

Identities: you can only change into humans (I was thinking you'd need to change into unique people, excluding your default form, because the impersonation possibilities are scary and overused). The same applies to things that you transfigure: clothes change to clothes, rocks change to rocks, coins to coins, guns to guns, smart phones to smart phones.

Brute: not only can you shapeshift away many injuries, but it'd be real convenient if lethal damage to a shapeshifted form cause dyou to revert to your (uninjured) default form, subspacing or forcefully ejecting any loose penetrants. That wouldn't work so will if, say, someone has their arm through your chest, or if your body is in pieces that are more than a few inches apart, but if it's slow enough, you could take a typical burst of gunfire and keep going, provided nothing important got blown away in the process.

I kinda focused on civilian exploits. For example: you can't make anything persist once it leaves your range, but if you make something that can be copied (for example, stick a transfigured jumpdrive into a computer, hold onto it with one hand, copy data with the other), you can still get something out of it. The same applies to medical developments, if with more tedium. After all, your transfigured cells are replicators, and if you can get them to copy onto some unmodified material, you might be able to get something out of it.

Then, of course, there's the momentum question: what happens if you change into a differently-sized form while in motion? How long does this take? Can it be exploited to, say, jump higher, or get finer control over one's speed, or something? What if you're in a small form, someone grabs you, and you try to change into a bigger form?
