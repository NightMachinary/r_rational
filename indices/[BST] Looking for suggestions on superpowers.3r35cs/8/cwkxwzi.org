One superpower I came up with a while ago was the idea of implementing a Speed-of-Matter constraint in the same way a Speed-of-Light constraint exists. You can create spatial bubbles where there exists an arbitrary maximum speed that physical objects are allowed to travel at, and this can be used for instance to stop incoming projectiles or to essentially kill people by preventing them from breathing.
