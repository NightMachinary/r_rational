/"what happens if the speed of light doubles?"/

Taken straight: particles in the zone where the speed of light doubles can be accelerated to a higher velocity than the speed of light in a vacuum. When they leave the zone they will emit the extra kinetic energy as cherenkov radiation.

Otherwise... what does it mean for the speed of light to double? Can you link to the places where people answered "nothing"? I'm not at all sure that's correct.
