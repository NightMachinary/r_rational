I think the original response is wrong. Doubling the speed of light would have the effect of replacing "1" with "2" in all those equations the poster is talking about. Or changing all the other constants (including the mass of everything) to bring it back to "1".

I /think/ that the most likely result would be the same as changing the rate at which time passes. Time is derived from the speed of light, not the other way around.
