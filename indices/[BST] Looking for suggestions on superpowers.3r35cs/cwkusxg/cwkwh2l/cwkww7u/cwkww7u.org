-For the magnetic capacitor guy, just make sure you shy away from recreating Electro: someone who can power up by directly connecting himself to an electric current. Maybe our magnetic protagonist wears a copper wire suit that he can hook up to the grid and turn himself into an electromagnet, thus directly feeding himself magnetic energy...

-Why not make this an actual male stripper that was kicked out of his profession for causing electric shocks and burns?

Other ideas will come soon. Might want to give me some direction?

PS: Credited? I just want to contribute something back to my favorite author.

Hummm...

Okay, how about this: You use anything from here in any way you like, so long as you complete another champter of Team Anko within this year? deal?
