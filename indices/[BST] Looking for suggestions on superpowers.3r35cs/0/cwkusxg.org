How about these:

-A person that can convert kinetic energy into thermal energy in a short-ranged field. Bullets become clouds of steam with no net forward motion. Punching him will scald your hand. He can perform incredible feats of impact, fall and damage resistance, but they come at the risk of boiling him alive, so he carries flas-vaporizing bottles of liquid nitrogen to act as heatsinks.

-Quantum dis-entangler/suppressor. Had no real combat effect... but some theories maintain that our consciousness and higher-level thought are linked to quantum properties of our intra-neuron communication. Suppressing someone's entangled neurons can cause them to become 'dumb', as in, they can think, react, feel, but not more than a really well-trained dog. In combat, being unable to react intelligently might cause you to lose. In other scenarios, you'd become much more open to suggestions, lies and misdirection, without feeling any different.

-Some more common examples: slowing down the speed of light. Imagine your opponent having to deal with relativistic effects at walking speed. The edges of their limbs shear off as they try to punch someone. Blood being pumped from the heart is sddenly many times heavier and blood pressure builds up... fun times.

-A magnetic capacitor: A weak-level magnetic manipulator that can't do more than pick up a kilo or so of iron in normal circumstances, but can accumulate 'magnetic energy' over time. In a combat scenario, he can hurl cars and swing lamposts about, but if he runs out of energy, he's back to being weak. For more gun, he has no upper limit.

-An touch-based electron-stripper

-A vibration manipulator that can only create extremely low Hz waves with massive pressure gradients. Basically, slow-moving aerial tsunamis.

And more, if you ask :)
