Cool power. I like the time lag feature in particular. Definitely a good power for a seeker squad, and the Army of Freedom could get s lot of mileage from it too.

Nice. Especially if the drain is ongoing, and potentially dangerous. Better power for a hero, I think -- it makes for more tension if the guy has to be careful.
