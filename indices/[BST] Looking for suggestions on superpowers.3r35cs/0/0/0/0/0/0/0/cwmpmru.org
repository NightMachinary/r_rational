Had two ideas today:

- Status quo: when this guy enters a battle, the macro outcome will be fixed. Whatever you do, the balance of power at any point of the fight will not move. The guy doesn't decide what the balance is, but he can choose whether to use it or not, so rhe onl way to beat this power is through deceit. It can also be used negatively: if you're a villain and you see Status !uo being used, kill a teammate. Enemies will die.

Trigger: can cause anyone to have high fever symptoms and auto*immune attacks, but with no physical intermediate.

Mutiltate: self-harm allows the user to mutate limbs into nightmarish appendages.

Hypnolight: can cause any strong source of light into a powerful hypnotic. Hilarious when used on TV channels. Has never tried using it on the Sun...
