That person would have to step into some pretty big shoes...

Two more ideas for today:

-Third eye/Ghost: This person has a 'ghost' they can project from their bodies and control remotely. The ghost can phase through matter and theoretically travel right through the Earth. However, increasing the distance between ghost and user creates a feedback lag, as in, new commands are relayed instantaneously but the execution takes longer and longer to be accomplished. The supervillain uses this mostly for spying and scrying, as more solid interactions, such as manipulating switches, are very exhausting. Why villain? Imagine not knowing whether you're being watched, anywhere in the world.

-'Crowdsource'. A superhero with powers proportional to the size of the crowd they're in. Basically, they skim off a portion of the surrounding people's energy, making them Superman in a bustling city, but a skinny teenager out in the forest.
