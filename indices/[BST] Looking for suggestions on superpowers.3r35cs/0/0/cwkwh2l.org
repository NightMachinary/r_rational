Nice. I really like this one; thank you.

  -A magnetic capacitor: A weak-level magnetic manipulator that can't do more than pick up a kilo or so of iron in normal circumstances, but can accumulate 'magnetic energy' over time. In a combat scenario, he can hurl cars and swing lamposts about, but if he runs out of energy, he's back to being weak. For more gun, he has no upper limit.

Nice. And, of course, he needs to actually absorb magnetic energy from an external field. The Earth's field will charge him up over times, but an MRI machine is much better. Thanks!
