Yup, exactly my thoughts! For higher speeds, she could just make the airflow laminar around an arbitrarily shaped jet or rocket-powered vehicle, adding slight turbulence as needed for trajectory adjustments. For combat, with absolute control, she could even halt melee attacks; but even slowing down punches by a significant percentage would provide a huge advantage, dropping the kinetic energy by the cube of the slowdown and throwing off the attacker's expectations. Asphyxiation, of course, would depend on the manton limits of the power.
