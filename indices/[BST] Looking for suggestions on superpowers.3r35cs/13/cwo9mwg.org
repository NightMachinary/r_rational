The power of drag coefficient manipulation. Not true fluid telekinesis like Leviathan, just skin drag, pressure drag, maybe even laminar to turbulent flow boundaries.

The wielder of that power could synergize very well with a tinker, creating otherwise-unusable hypersonic transport or projectile weapons. Would also be very difficult to harm kinetically in an atmosphere. Offensive options would depend on manton limits, physical range, and the ability to independently affect different regions or objects.
