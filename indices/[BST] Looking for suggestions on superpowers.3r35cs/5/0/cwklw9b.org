A college friend of mine played a Champions character called Lightweight. He wasn't super strong, but his strength was bought with massive amounts of extra knockback. He did damage by smashing you into walls. Might be fun to do something like that.

Changing the direction of gravity could definitely be fun -- I think I might have that in my 'ideas for powersets' list, but I'd forgotten about it. Thank you for suggesting it.
