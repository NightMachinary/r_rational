The power to change matter into magnetic monopoles.

Not sure what it might do. Large explosions are a guess as the matter converted into monopoles would no longer be bound. Also possibly larger explosions as I have heard a rumor about monopoles catalyzing proton decay(?). And if you could hold some monopoles in one place odd magnetic effects because monopole magnetic fields fall of with distance in some other way than by the inverse square, providing much greater range.

Secondary effect would be to revolutionize technology if the character can produce and package large amounts.
