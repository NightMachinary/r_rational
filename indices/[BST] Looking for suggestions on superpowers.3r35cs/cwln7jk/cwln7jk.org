Fleet Mind. At will you can accelerate your mental.. And /only/ your mental processes by however much you like. At significant factors, this subjectively feels like a case if lock-in because your body responds at normal speeds so from your perspective, you are a thinking statue.

"Sensitive". You have an absurdly keen theory of mind, and perceive the emotional state, motivation and intents of everyone with ease.

"Truthtell" you can't deceive. This is accompanied by the supernatural certainty in everyone you communicate with that you are not being deceptive.

"Causal Lightcone Enforcer". You have been empovered by the Escaton. Time travel, ftl engines, ect, break down if within a lightyear of you. Then you are compelled to go and destroy them. Akrasia has no hold on you until this is done. That's it. Those are your powers.
