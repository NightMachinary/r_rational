I have someone who creates subspace pockets in which to store stuff. So far I've been avoiding creating Doormaker or any other portal-based teleporter because they are enormously overpowered and usually setting-breaking. If I can find a nerf for it that makes it unique and not OP then maybe. Any suggestions?

  You could also ask [[/r/askphysics]][1] for power ideas, instead of what each individual thing will do.

I was trying to specifically stick to the 'what are the physics of this scenario' so as not to be outside their purview but I think I'll take your advice and just preface it with "if this is off-topic for this sub I'll nuke it".
