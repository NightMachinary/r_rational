- Nonchalant time-based superspeed. The less user cares, the more he/she slows down time and thus the faster he/she moves.
- Tactile fat polarization. Ability to make lipids dissolve in water (or any other polar solvent) upon a touch. At first glance may not seem impressive, but when you consider how cellular membrane of living beings is built, it turns out to be basically touch of death.
- Contagious reverse empathy. User of this power unconsciously makes nearby people assume his mental state and they in turn pass it on other people like a virus. If he/she gets sad, everyone gets sad; if someone pisses him/her off, it may end up with riots; if he gets drunk/doped, then well...
- Energy storage through talismans. This power allows to sap certain kinds of energy, store it in inorganic trinkets and release on will. One trinket can keep only one kind of energy, so you cannot put e.g. lightwaves and momentum in the same object. So user can e.g. create flashbangs or accelerate himself/herself with stored momentum.
