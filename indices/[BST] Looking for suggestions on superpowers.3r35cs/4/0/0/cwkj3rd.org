Wit my idea, you have to actually bring the portal somewhere. You can't just portal into the pentagon or something. Although you could still presumably move one end of the portal from the other end, and just keep it so tiny that nobody notices. You could have it so they can't hold a portal that small open for long, so any portals they leave lying around would be clearly visible. And they have to stay next to one end to keep it open, so if they left a portal where they shouldn't, someone could shoot them through it. There's also problems with air pressure. If they try to cross too much vertical distance, there'd be large amounts of wind through the portal. They could fix this by messing around with the time part of spacetime, so that there's a force to counter pressure, but it's probably better just to avoid giving them that part of the power.
