Theoretically, you can slow down time, giving you enhanced reaction time, and if you take psychic to mean predicting the future you can make it into a time machine. But even a minor amount of time slowing results in vast forces that can destroy cities. You can still get time travel just with the portals, but that takes a while. You have to have a significant amount of time dilation.

It's not just being smart about it. There's also limitations in how well you can control it.
