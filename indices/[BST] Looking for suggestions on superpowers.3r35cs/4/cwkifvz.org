Perhaps something with warping spacetime. If you warp time, you get crazy gravitational forces, but warping space alone is pretty safe. As long as there's nothing rigid there. He may or may not be able to warp the space to make sure it stays flat anywhere where anything is. They could use it to make a bag of holding (although it won't be any lighter) or wormholes. I would make it so both ends of the wormhole need to be created right next to each other and then he warps space to move them apart.

You could also ask [[/r/askphysics]] for power ideas, instead of what each individual thing will do.
