Hmm, just thought of it off the top of my head so not well defined at all.

perhaps it needs to be activated, then once a certain amount of time has passed, they can re-organize events that happened in the bubble that the effect covers, within the time that the ability was activated. Being able to go and make sure that your friend stepped out of the cover after the bullets were shot, then having your return fire happen before the they ducked back down.

this would need good awareness of when the power could be useful, and maybe good intuition of how things play out after events have been re-organized. probably with a cooldown so they cant just constantly activate it.

Or perhaps its always active for the past 10 seconds or so, and serves a more re-active and defensive purpose.

other things that might need consideration: event awareness, do they need to know that a particular thing has happened to re-queue it. how do people react to having there actions requeued. if the alternate events would have cause different decisions, do those get added to the queue, or is there some other kind of resolution system.
