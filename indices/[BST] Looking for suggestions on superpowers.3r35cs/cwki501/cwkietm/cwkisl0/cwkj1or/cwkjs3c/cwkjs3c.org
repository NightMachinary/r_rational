New idea, being able to disagree with the past. Probably limited to a certain amount of time in the past an a limited number of uses per day. Imagine going to a show, but you forgot the tickets, you could say "actually no I didnt" and the past would re-arrange itself to be the most similar timeline in which you picked up the tickets. Perhaps there would also be limitations on who and what you could affect with this.
