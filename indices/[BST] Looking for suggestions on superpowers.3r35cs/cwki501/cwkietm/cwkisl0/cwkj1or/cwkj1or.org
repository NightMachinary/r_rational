Hm. I think this would end up being difficult to manage. Maybe something like time clones? There's a video game (I wish I could remember remember the name) the goal of which is to shoot moving blocks. You play each level four times; each time, your previous playthroughs are repeated alongside your current run so, by the end, there are four of you shooting, but three of them are repeats of what you did before. There's a series of playthroughs on YouTube that were really interesting.
