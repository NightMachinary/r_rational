Borrow time from future self is fairly OP, but it's not time travel. With time clones, you can check the stock market on your fist pass, and then buy/sell on your second. Or have someone try to guess a password, and then go back and tell them if it worked and have them guess another one (although contrary to popular belief, that only works for short passwords. If it's too long, you'll just randomly die on one of the tries.)
