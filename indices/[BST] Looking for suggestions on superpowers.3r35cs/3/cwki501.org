Any specific area of physics you would like a focus on?

Either way, I think forms of momentum manipulation are fairly easy to think about while still being fairly interesting. A roleplay i started involves a character that has a field in which they can sap and re-use momentum from objects in that field. Although maybe your not looking for something telekinetic-ish.

I like to use random verbs to think of interesting abilities. Just got the word "Queue", how about some kind of local time manipulation in which you can re-queue events, or something.
