It was a desktop game, and a shooter. You started off in a wide open room with a bunch of guns floating in front of you. The guns have various upgrades that you can buy, then you go through the door into the arena and see a bunch of floating cubes that are either white or red. Blowing them up gets you money; white are tougher but worth more. Usually the blocks move, generally in flowing streams but in a couple of cases they've been carefully arranged so that they make a giant spider that walks with realistic leg motion, or something like that.
