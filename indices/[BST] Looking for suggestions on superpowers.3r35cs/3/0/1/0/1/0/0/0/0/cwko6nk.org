How do the time clones function? Is this single-timeline time travel, or is it like in those games where each time you go back its a new timeline, but you have your past selves doing what they did before for no apparent reason?

Do they get to decide to use the time clones at the end of the time (like seeing their friend die and then going back to stop it) or at the beginning (so they might decide to go back, then have a friend open something that might be booby-trapped and stop them if it is)?
