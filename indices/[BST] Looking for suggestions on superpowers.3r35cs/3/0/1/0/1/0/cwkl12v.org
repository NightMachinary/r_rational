I'm definitely not allowing any sort of open-ended time travel. Something like time clones is very limited.

Although, one of the main characters does have the ability "borrow time from her future self." She chooses an amount of time (e.g., five minutes) and when to borrow it from (e.g. ten minutes from now) gets that much time right now, while the rest of the universe is frozen. When the five minutes ends everything starts up again. Ten minutes from when things start up again, she vanishes from spacetime for five minutes. There are some rules about how she interacts with things while she's in hypertime, but that's the general idea.

And yes, it's a ridiculously powerful ability that has required some very careful handling.
