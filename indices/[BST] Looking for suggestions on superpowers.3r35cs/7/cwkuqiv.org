For some phlebotinum-types, I remember writing descriptions on Reddit of characters from an old superhero campaign I ran a while back. A quick use of google shows [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/1v82xp/what_powers_do_you_wish_were_in_worm/ceq2dyx][it was on the /r/Parahumans subreddit]]. Forgive the Worm-style classification, since it fit the place I was posting it.

Feel free to use anything there if it sounds interesting, but bear in mind that I was very much /not/ going for a munchkinny or realistic approach to superpowers at the time.

EDIT: Heh, I just read the OP for that thread, and /he/ came up with the idea of momentum-swapping characters, too.
