Observation: you can specify your wish in negative terms to make some things easier to think about. If the wish is odd and you can't express it, the antiwish may be much better defined and easier to express.

Find out if I can convince my Mean to include a binary do-nothing condition. For example, if step one in the wish is "if this coin flips tails, do nothing, if it flips heads, do X", and then convince myself that that the negative outcome really is the coin flipping tails.

If that doesn't work, find a system with a finite global minimum value but no global maximum. For example, "I wish that either that I have infinite money", for which the antiwish would almost certainly be "I wish that I have no money". Then wish until you get the wish instead of the antiwish.

There may be value here in attempting to wish faster, but I don't know a change that would safely increase wishing speed without the antiwish setting wish speed to zero.

For directly doing things, it's relatively easy to construct wishes which perform physical changes for which the antiwish is just as useful. For example, "spin this rotor clockwise" would almost certainly antiwish into "spin this rotor counterclockwise", at which point you just use gears to normalize it and feed it to a generator. Even if it interprets the wish as "keep this rotor from spinning" you could probably extract some force from it.

If you're really, really sure about your interpretation of quantum mechanics, you could exploit the anthropic principle and quantum suicide to delete the antiwish effects. "Retroactively delete the universe and make me think a million times faster" will either never be experienced or resolve into the (positive) antiwish which simultaneously makes the universe last longer somehow and makes you smarter.
