Given that any particular sequence of wishes would likely send me on a random walk of wishes and anti-wishes, and a random walk along one direction will tend to eventually intersect any bottom-line of value (which is why gamblers need an infinite bank account to succeed in most gambits)... then setting the scale so that the worst possible sequence of repeated wishes isn't that bad, while the corresponding anti-wish is at least modestly nice, might tilt the probability mass of copies of oneself towards heaven.

"I wish for the difference between my current wealth, and the wealth I would need for a pleasant if modest above-subsistence lifestyle, to be halved." (This assumes that you're starting with wealth above that level. If you aren't, then adjust accordingly.) Repeat ad nauseum, until you eventually, by purely random walking, end up with more anti-wishes than wishes. This will happen in nearly all universe-branches, and in them, due to the results of the anti-wish which presumably doesn't quite double your wealth, you will then have more wealth than you started with. From this new point, adjust the wish to wish to lower your wealth halfway to the previous set-point.

It may take a Very Large number of wishes, but in nearly all universes, you should end up with an arbitrarily high level of wealth, at which point you may want to adjust your wishing strategy to increase some other form of leverage by which to build a heaven.
