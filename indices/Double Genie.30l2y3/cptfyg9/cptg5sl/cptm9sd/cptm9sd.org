Repeat the game with your IQ. "You have now suddenly acquired a large IQ" is usually a win condition.

(Edit: To make sure I don't forfeit Gurkenglas' ability to choose what his character does for the rest of the game, if the double genie appears before me as I'm typing here, I shall study math and cognitics for a week, then set the IQ set-point to what I had a week ago.)

(Edit: To make sure I don't turn myself into a potato in case that week happens to lower my IQ, I set the point at "99.999999% of my current IQ or what I had a week ago, whichever is lower". Losing a 100millionth of my IQ plus a week of misled study might make my posts and the actions of my character dissonant but the chance is small.)
