Solution:

"I wish to know how, be able, and have the resources to use the laws of nature to create Heaven for almost all of my futures across the many universes, and never create Hell."

The problem with the solutions I've read thus far is that they seem to forget the genie will pervert the SPIRIT of your wish for the anti-you.

Wish for information and anti-you will become confused.

Wish to fix malaria, and the anti-you will worsen malaria.

Wish to improve your IQ/finances/universe by (best - current)/2, then his universe uses the formula (worst - current)/2.

I am not sure my wish will work, but my understanding is the following:

Anti-me receives no information on making the world better. It is also possible that the perversion of the wish has stripped my other self of ability, knowledge, and resources. His fate, however, is unimportant because his value system is such that if his universe improves, he is happy even if dead.

However, after the wish, I now have the know-how, ability, and resources to /ignore the genie/ and use science/magic to improve most universes until they become heavens, and no universe will be hell.

--------------

The other way to pervert this wish is to likewise give anti-me the knowledge, ability, resources, and intention to turn all universes into hell, and thus begins an eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil and I and my anti-self eventually become God/Devil analogues. Awkward . . .

I don't think the above is a possible outcome, however, because it prevents my wish from fulfillment.
