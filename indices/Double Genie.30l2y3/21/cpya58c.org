I wish for the ability to travel between universes. In one universe I get this ability, and can then create a series of additional universes by making inconsequential wishes with no major effects, just to multiply my forces. In the universe where I got the anti-wish... I don't know what the proportionately worse thing that would happen is. Regardless, that version of me can be rescued from his predicament by the universe traveling versions.

Once I've got a team of universe traveling alt-selves, it also becomes easy to use the wishes to do all sorts of useful stuff, since we can then go intervene in the universe that got hit by the anti-wish.
