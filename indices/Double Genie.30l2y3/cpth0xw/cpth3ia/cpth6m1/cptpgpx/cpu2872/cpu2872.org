I was going to go into a convoluted series of experimental wishes designed to test the genie's capacity to inject ideas into peoples' minds, but for posterity, here's my final solution:

1) Wish for Heaven (with all of the appropriate wording, such as by including that the genie only grant 'good' wishes).

2) In the universe which is now Hell, wait for a moment.

3) In the universe which is now Heaven, with your newly-obedient genie, wish that the genie now in the Hell universe was replaced by a copy of the good!genie, and that Hell be replaced with Heaven. Now you have two Heavens. Maybe erase the memories of the people in Hell, if their tortures in that span of time were particularly awful.

3) Find yourself from the other universe. Exchange fist-bumps.
