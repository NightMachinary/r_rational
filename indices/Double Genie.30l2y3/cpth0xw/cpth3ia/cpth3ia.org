Heads: You obtain a plaster bust of Napolean.

Tails: You lose an object of equivalent value to you personally. If no such object is available, you lose a number of objects whose emotional or economic value would sum to that of the Napolean bust. If such objects are exhausted, you suffer some Napoleon-bust-related tragedy, such as the bust falling from a train and breaking while causing you a leg fracture.
