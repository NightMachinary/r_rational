The number sign changes being 0 signifies that the sequence never goes back to and beyond the starting point. Yes, that has a nonnegligible probability and 0 is, perhaps surprisingly, the most probable number of sign changes, as the link points out. That means that the counterpart does not necessarily (in the sense of with a probability approaching one) eventually make it to the positive side of things.
