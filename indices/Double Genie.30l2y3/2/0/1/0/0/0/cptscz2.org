I'm... not quite sure I understand what you're talking about by 'number sign changes', then, since what I'm trying to interpret contradicts the actual math of random walks.

You might want to read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#One-dimensional_random_walk]] , "How many times will a random walk cross a boundary line if permitted to continue walking forever? A simple random walk on \mathbb Z will cross every point an infinite number of times."
