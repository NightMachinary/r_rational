This is not a random walk, though, and the walks you are generating are not infinitely long. In practice, making this wish and stopping when you're above the boundary line results in smaller and smaller proportions of successful universes as time goes on. With a threshold of three net positive results and a thousand steps, the ratio is about 7% universes that are net positive and 3% universes that cross the threshold.

If you make a new rule like "wish for pennies 20 times when I cross the threshold" you could probably offset this, though.
