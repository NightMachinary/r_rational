Actually, PacRat got their math wrong, I think. From a quick look at [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomWalk1-Dimensional.html]] , it says that the most probable number of sign changes is 0, so for half of that probability, you end up never having more money than you started the game with.

What should actually work would be for me to set my set point at halfway between what he was going to set it at and what my current wealth is, do his game for a hundred steps, reset my set point to halfway between its current position and what he was going to set it at, and repeat until we end up with at least 10 times the initial wealth, then repeat the whole thing as necessary.
