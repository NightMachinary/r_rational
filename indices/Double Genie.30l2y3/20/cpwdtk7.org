It seems that anti-wishes are generated based on my own personal value of what would be opposite and equivalent.

Therefore, I begin with the assumption that Heaven and Hell are generated in response to each other via anti-wishes because creating Hell holds a negative value to me equivalent to the positive value I place in creating Heaven. So, by changing the values of Hell and Heaven, the results of creating one would change how much of the other would show up as a result of the anti-wish.

If, for example, my belief system states that the existence of Hell is so abhorrent that Hell is twice as bad as Heaven is good, then if I wished to create Heaven, then only half of a Hell would be created in the anti-Wish universe.

Therefore:

Wish 1: "I wish to change my own beliefs so that I no longer find any value in the idea of Hell, while maintaining the same amount of value in the idea of Heaven that I currently hold."

Because of the information-twisting properties of anti-wishes, I believe that this works in both resulting universes, even though my underlying beliefs are different in both. In the wish universe, my value of Hell is 0 and my value of Heaven is still 1. In the anti-wish universe, my value of Heaven is now 0 and my value of Hell is still 1.

Wish 2: "I wish to create Heaven."

In the Wish -> Wish universe, Heaven is created.

In the Wish -> Anti-Wish universe, and anti-wish is generated that is equivalently negative based on my own personal values. Because my value of Hell is 0, Hell is not created.

In the Anti-Wish -> Wish universe, Heaven is created. In the Anti-Wish -> Anti-Wish universe, nothing happens, because Heaven has 0 value to me.
