Except in the Hell-Universes, the bad genie grants the antiwish and doesn't get replaced. Now you have two versions of every hell universe, one where the bad genie was replaced and the universe became a heaven, the other where the bad genie /wasn't/ replaced and everything was still hell. I think the only way this problem can be solved has to involve interuniversal travel/communication/trade that doesn't depend on the genie. Also, I would like to point out that: >every time you make a wish, another universe is created where the opposite of that wish is granted.

So every antiwish has its own separate universe, but all the wishes are in one universe. Since you never wished for the genie to exist or not exist, that means the genie can only exist in the wish universe.
