Even so, it clearly has some point where it values "Anti-Wish" over "Fake Real Wish to Trick You".

Also, there are two kinds of maliciousness here as well.

If it is actively malicious in the "I want to fuck up your current wish" sense, then the easy fix is universe split plus the wish "I wish to want for my next wish to be to wish for Heaven." In Good universes you now want to wish for heaven and do so. In evil universes you now want to wish for Hell and create Heaven since reversed wishes for bad things have already been explained to create good things.

If it is malicious as to the end goal of Heaven or Hell, then it will actively prevent you from ever getting enough information to be sure on what universe you are in, and so it is never safe to make a major wish.

Basically, if it is malicious on current wishes, you can win by tricking yourself. If it is even slightly malicious and omnicognizant, you can't win.

"Only somewhat malicious" actually gives us /less/ predictive power then not telling us that, since that means it is inherently unpredictable unless we know its goals.

Are you sure /you're/ not an anti-genie?
