  You then wish for almost-Heaven, which send you to almost-Hell in anti-wish-world.

So, what's the cutoff point? If that's not an information seeking wish, or if the Anti-Genie (who at this point is not just perverting the intent but being actively malicious, since it clearly isn't intent that matters) just decides at some point to actually anti-fulfill the wish rather than giving you the information, then there is some point where it either judges a wish non-information seeking, or ignores that to achieve an anti-goal.

This implies either a weighted function, an endstate goal, or sentient intent.

If it's a weighted function, then wish up by 1% at a time until it actually switches to Hell, then wish down to the nearest non-Hell number.

If it's an endstate goal, then my thing would have worked, because .99 Hell is insufficient to meet the endstate of Hell.

If it's a sentient process that is actively malicious, and good genies cannot effect universes with bad genies (really? no multiuniverse travel at all, in any circumstances? In Heaven Universe you have /literally all of polynomial time/ to figure out an answer and then either wormhole it back to your origin point, time travel or dilation being something an all powerful Genie should be able to do, or somehow or another get to that universe.) then there is no safe wish and no right answer to the problem.
