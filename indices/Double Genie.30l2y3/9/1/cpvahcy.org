Splitting the universes makes almost everything an information seeking wish, so the wish just gets granted to trick you. You then wish for almost-Heaven, which send you to almost-Hell in anti-wish-world. In wish-world, you make Heaven. Unfortunately even with a real genie you can't enter a universe that has already split off.

Since you made Heaven and only almost-Hell, you end up performing very slightly better than if you had made a CEV wish.
