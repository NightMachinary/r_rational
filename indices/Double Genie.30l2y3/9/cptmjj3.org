So, the current problem is that once you split the universes, the information perversion of the anti-wish genie means you cannot tell by information searching wishes whether you are in the good or bad universe.

So, ignore the informational goals.

That leaves two options: Perform wishes which equalize over time, or perform wishes which will increase or decrease your standard of living by a non-lethal amount.

I trust the perfect copy of me in the good universe even if I am in the bad one. I legitimately want to make money/power/whatever. I am willing to accept any non-death outcome of my wishes.

Wish to win a smallish lottery for the sake of making money. Have the goal "it doesn't matter which universe I am in. I want to win this." This gets you the information you need without you actually having the goal of obtaining the information.

If that doesn't work, I wish for 0.9999999999999 Heaven with the intent of using it to gather information for my final Heaven 1.0 wish. *Fuck you, contrary genie.*

If the anti-genie doesn't actually care even what your current goals are, find a way to change your long term goals.

Alternatively, use someone else. Get a suicidal person to wish to die. This would actually be in their CEV, the Genie could not pervert it. Death for the true universe, continued life for the other.

Wait a minute. /I don't actually care./

We already know something that differentiates anti from true universe. CEV Heaven wishing.

I wish for a Heaven with no time dilation or differential time traits. I get Hell in Universe 1 and Heaven in Universe 2. In Universe 1 I suffer unimaginable pain for the time it takes me in Universe 2 to say "I wish the genie in the other universe was replaced by a copy of you, and all memories of all people since the Hell wish was made were replaced by the memories of those same people in this universe since the Heaven wish was made."

Now I have two Heaven universes which are perfect duplicates. I walk across the planar border, high-five myself, and go on to enjoy the Heavens. Nobody around ever remembers that I created Hell, so nobody cares.
