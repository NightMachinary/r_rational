As has been demonstrated, any information-content wish is maximally perverted, so the anti-wish returns the same results as the real wish. Accordingly, your tests all tell you everything is fine, and the anti-wish versions give you bad information. This applies even if, like I did [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30l2y3/double_genie/cptg6g9][here]], you first make a wish to stop the universes from dividing, which is the only way to plausibly create a 'wish-universe' and an 'anti-wish-universe'.

Remember: both possibilities always occur. You can wish that the universes would stop multiplying, but you can't make wishes that are only beneficial; every positive wish is matched by an equal but opposite anti-wish. The two are just granted to other people.

More to the point, atoms are very small. You will die of old age long before making unique wishes for all the atoms that compose a single cell of your own body. Even if you were able to make a wish every second for the next hundred years and didn't need to worry about anti-wishes, you wouldn't have finished more than a fraction of a percent of that one cell... and, absent wishes to protect you from mundane concerns like the need to eat, sleep, or otherwise do things other than make wishes, you won't even get that far.
