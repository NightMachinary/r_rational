  More to the point, atoms are very small. You will die of old age long before making unique wishes for all the atoms that compose a single cell of your own body. Even if you were able to make a wish every second for the next hundred years and didn't need to worry about anti-wishes, you wouldn't have finished more than a fraction of a percent of that one cell... and, absent wishes to protect you from mundane concerns like the need to eat, sleep, or otherwise do things other than make wishes, you won't even get that far.

I could simply add 'and halve the time required to make my next wish' to every wish. Then I would finish all my wishes within the amount of time it would have taken me to make two wishes before the adjustment.
