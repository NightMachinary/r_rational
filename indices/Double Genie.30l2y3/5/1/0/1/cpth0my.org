The genie grants your wishes identically in both branches until you make a wish large enough to create Hell. Because you smartly decide to consult with others, you realise this and never make the "instantiate many Heavens" wish, instead opting for small incremental improvements to reality in both universes. You fail at creating Heaven, but you permanently alter the course of both worlds for the positive.
