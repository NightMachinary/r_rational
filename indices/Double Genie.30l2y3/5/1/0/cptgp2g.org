Okay, so if coinflip-tier wishes are assumed to be purely-information-seeking, start small instead. The anti-genie will show itself sooner or later through use of non-trivial-but-not-reality-destroying wishes. Presumably, the content of a wish like "I wish my headache would be cured" is not information-seeking, so the invariably-corrupted genie would make the headache worse. All wishes with notable effects also have information content in this context, so I either have the genie that's granting all my wishes because it is in fact a safe genie, or the genie that's granting all my wishes because it's trying to trick me. In all practicality, my actions in a universe in which a genie seems to be granting beneficial wishes for me would be to acquire wealth and power and correspond with other like-minded individuals before making a CEV wish, it seems like there'd be plenty of time to notice any chicanery. And even if the genie is actually granting me large sums of cash just to trick me, there's still the possibility that access to mundane wealth and power may obviate the need to wish up CEV (y'know, via conventionally-possible means of reality improvement).

The objective is to create Heaven in almost all futures, and to create no instance of Hell. As such, in the debugged genie branch, I wish additional instances of Heaven into existence, eventually resulting in a vast number of instances of Heaven. In the anti-genie universe, it presumably eventually reveals itself by screwing me out of lottery winnings or something, and after some experimentation to determine that no, it won't be manipulated, I proceed to not make a CEV wish, and thus not make things any worse.
