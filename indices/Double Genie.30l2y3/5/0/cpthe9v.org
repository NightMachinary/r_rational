Okay, I have a (maybe?) better solution for what to do after you separate the universes. Once you determine which universe you're in:

- Benevolent: Wish for your counterpart in the malicious universe to recieve benevolent wishes instead.

- Malevolent: wait for a few hours for the above to happen.

Then wish for CEV.
