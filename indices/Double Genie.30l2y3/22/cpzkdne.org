Hmm. I guess if I knew that more universes existing was a net benefit to me, because I value other people and myself existing, and overall the universe created net positive utility by existing, then I could just make infinite wishes for the minor dislocation of a single quark or something similarly inconsequential for the sake of creating more universes. Of course I have no idea if this universe will generate net positive utility over the long term. I tend to think so, but what a massive choice to make for the universe.

This is assuming the genie sticks to the rules about creating the universe with the opposite of your wish, with the creation of two new universes being assumed to be already accounted for in the wish.

I'd note that Otherwise if someone places any value at all on the general net utility of the universe as a whole this would create a neverending cycle of value calculation which would instantly convert all possible wished for worlds into net neutral worlds.

ex. I wish for a hat. Universe A I receive a hat + the net value I assign to the universe Universe B I lose a hat + the value I assigned to the universe, but the universe just got split so I just got that value by virtue of the universe existing.

So now what? Does the genie adjust for me giving a net positive or negative value to the universe splitting in the first place or is that accounted for in the wish?

It seems since there is a law of conservation of value in effect on these wishes, the only way to alter anything about the universe is going to be if the initial universe splitting doesn't obey the law of conservation of value imposed on the rest of the wish.
