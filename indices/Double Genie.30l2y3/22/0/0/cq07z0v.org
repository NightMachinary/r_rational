Wait, the universe is split during the wish. That means that a universe is created. Two identical copies of the original universe now exist. If I assign positive utility to each additional universe exactly like this one existing then that means each time I make a wish I get the amount of positive utility I assign to that entire new copy existing.

So basically, If I assign a positive utility to the universe as it is right now, I double my utility value every time I make a wish because that universe is copied by virtue of making the wish. Now I just have to tally up all possible utility that may ever exist for me in the universe and decide if it adds up to be positive. (Shouldn't be too hard with the information I have now, right? Not at all arrogant for me to make this decision for the entire universe.)
