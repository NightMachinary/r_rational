I suspect that would be an information granting wish and therefore no good to me thanks the utilitarian trolling nature of value-neutral net wish effects. The only net utility change to the universe is the splitting. Anything else I wish for is going to basically just polarize the two new universes towards positive and negative values to varying degrees of ridiculousness.

Of course I may have misunderstood the wish rules.
