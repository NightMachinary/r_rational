The genie pauses for a moment, considering what sort of anti-wish would be appropriate, then, in anti-wish-world, the genie instantiates a new class of major world problem corresponding to every Pokemon. The people of anti-wish-world run terrified as massive electrical storms from Pikachu's Problem Avatar. All subterranean structures collapse as Diglet's Problem Avatar is brought into being. Waves of contagious schizophrenia appear representing Alakazam, and humana gain the ability of uncontrolled spontaneous teleportation (sometimes into the air) from Abra. Truly Hell is created.

In wish-world, [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] goes around saving the world by catching Pokemon. Truly Heaven on Earth.

The genie concludes that this is clearly a CEV-equivalent wish.
