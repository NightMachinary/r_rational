I make my wishes specific and obvious. If I wish to eradicate malaria, is the anti-wish going to double malaria and make it look eradicated?

I also only have to know if the universe is worth existing. If I believe this to be the case from the beginning, I can just make pointless wishes to create new universes. This isn't as good as making important wishes that make some universes not worth living in and then not multiplying those, but it works.
