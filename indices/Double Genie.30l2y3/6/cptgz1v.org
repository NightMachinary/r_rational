  Your goal is to create Heaven for almost all of your futures, and never create Hell.
#+end_quote

1. "I wish to change the world by half of the difference between heaven and it (positively, world += (heaven - world) / 2)."
2. If you find yourself in the anti-wish universe, abort.
3. "I wish to change the world by the same amount I changed it last time."
4. If you find yourself in the anti-wish universe, abort.
5. "I wish for a random particle to be sped up by an infinitesimal small amount." (Or any other NOP)
6. Go to step 5.

You got two futures that are not heaven (but not hell either, one at -0.5, the other at 0 on the hell-heaven scale), and an exponentially increasing number of universes that are heaven. This assumes that the world is originally at 0 or better. If that is not the case, just apply the procedure [steps 1 to 4] to double your difference to hell until it is.
