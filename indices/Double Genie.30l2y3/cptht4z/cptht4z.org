I'll assume that a certain arrangement of atoms corresponds to heaven (under our physical laws)

1.  I wish for locality (i.e. no spooky action at a distance). I now have only a finite amount of atoms a1..aN to care about.
2.  I wish for a sign which uniquely determines whether I am in the wish-universe or in the anti-wish-universe. (Alternatively I wish for my next coin flip to come up heads or something so I can tell them apart).
3.  I wish to know an arrangement of atoms which corresponds to immanentization of the eschaton.
4.  Test.
5.  In the wish-universe I wish for a1 to be be at a certain position x1 at a time T so far into the future that I will have time to make sufficiently many wishes afterwards. In the anti-wish-universe I do nothing.
6.  Test.
7.  Repeat 2. with a2, x2. ...
8.  In the universe where all my atom arrangements will be carried out I wish to flip a coin.
9.  Repeat 8. in both universes. ...
10. At time T I have a lot of universes where a single atom is "out of place". None of them can be considered hell. I have more universes which have instantiated heaven.
