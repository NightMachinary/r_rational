If the genie is malicious, then this is probably not solvable.

It's like the Monty Hall paradox. It's only a paradox because the Monty hall in the paradox is not malicious and isn't trying to trick you. The real Monty Hall /is/ malicious and so you can't use logical tricks to extract information from whether he shows you a goat or not.
