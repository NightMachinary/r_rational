I don't really see the point of asking us to flip coins. By the rules of the thought experiment, any information-granting wishes will result in a universe in which true and useful information is granted, and one in which false and misleading information is granted. Similarly, any meta-wishes will result in a universe which is successfully meta-altered, and one in which the universe is maliciously meta-altered.

As such, plans must include the factual existence of universes in which your wishes were perverted. Given that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30l2y3/double_genie/cptfdtu][this]] is the response to a wish that anti-wish universes no longer be generated, though, there is a solution.

Step 1: I wish that whenever a wish is made, an anti-wish universe is no longer generated.

(this will, of course, produce a universe in which wishes are always granted faithfully, and a universe in which wishes are always perverted)

Step 2: Test to see which of those two universes I am in, probably with innocuous wishes like "I wish that the next coin I flip should land on heads". (probably do this fifty times or so, to confirm that Step 1 actually worked; there's still a small chance that I just happen to be in the universe in which things went right/wrong 50 times, but if I do in fact get 50 heads or 50 tails, I will assume that Step 1 worked).

Step 3a: In the universe in which wishing has been successfully debugged, wish CEV, creating Heaven.

Step 3b: In the universe in which wishing has been confirmed to be invariably corrupted, experiment with the use of anti-wishes to result in beneficial consequences, via wishing for undesirable events to happen. If the anti-genie seems to pervert wishes in a predictably-reversed fashion, wish anti-CEV, therefore causing the anti-genie to create a Heaven instead of the Hell I just asked it to create.
