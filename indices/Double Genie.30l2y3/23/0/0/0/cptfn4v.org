In Heads, the genie gives you a dollar, thereby giving you a dollar and the knowledge that you are in the safe universe. You make a CEV wish, and create Heaven.

In Tails, the genie gives you a dollar, and deducts two dollars from your bank account, thereby taking away a dollar and giving you the false knowledge that you are in the safe universe. You make a CEV wish, and create Hell.
