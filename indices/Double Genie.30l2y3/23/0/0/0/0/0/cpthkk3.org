You just aren't fucking with the genie hard enough. Declare the square meter around you to be a new country, with a currency made out of a specific rock on the ground. Each Rock is worth /i/ dollars, so there is no conversion rate. Then, while holding a Rock, wish for twice as many Rocks. There's nowhere else to draw a supply of Rocks from, so either the genie creates a new one /ex nihilo/ or it doesn't.
