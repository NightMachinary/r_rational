Sounds like wishes are bullshit. The genie is supposed to grant my wish exactly as I intend it. I intend to wish for a dollar. I can deduce knowledge after the fact, but I intend to wish for a dollar. In one universe I gain a bit of happiness from getting a dollar, and in the other I lose a bit of happiness from losing a dollar. Then I figure out what's going on. It sounds like you're just fucking with the rules to prevent this from working.
