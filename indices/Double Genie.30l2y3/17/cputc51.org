I wish that all of the most dangerous things in the world were replaced by their pokemon-world counterparts, except for businesses/corporations. So the problem of unfriendly AI becomes as simple as catching a porygon. If you want to end death, catch both Xerneas and Yveltal, kill Yveltal and use Xerneas's power to keep everything alive. If you want to stop a meteor catch Rayquaza. If you want to keep the universe from ending, catch Arceus. I wish for infinite master balls to be received by each of every good, smart, and responsible person in the world. Then catch Palkia to open the way to the other universe and spread all the good outcomes to them too, without wishing for it from the genie.
