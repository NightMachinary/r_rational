I see what you're trying to do, but the point of the thought experiment is that you can't do that. When reality is split, you don't get to decide whether or not that happens nicely. It's trusting your fate to a fair coin each time. So the result of any power you get to see what happens is always "yes", and you don't get to finagle things such that unpleasant things only happen to other versions of you.

Otherwise, you could just decide to screw all the other versions of yourself, and ascend directly to godhood via repeated power-wishes. Remember, that's not allowed; the goal is to make the best future for all of you, and the power you're trying to get would only make a good future for one of you.
