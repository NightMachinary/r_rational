<Some time later in the anti-universe>

I stand out on the street, staring at the strange phenomenon in front of me. Some sort of a shimmering portal has suddenly appeared. Out of it emerges a figure...

"People of the Negative World, I have come in peace, and to apologize for the time it has taken to unlock the secrets of trans-universal travel to share our good fortune with you.

But all your pain and suffering is over now. Rejoice!"

Then I shake hands with myself.
