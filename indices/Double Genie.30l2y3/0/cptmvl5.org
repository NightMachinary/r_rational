Hm.

I'll make a wish to no longer have anti-wishes happen. Two universes appear, in one only anti-wishes happen and in the other, only wishes.

Then, I'll begin 'testing'. Every wish I make will be minor enough that an anti-result won't be catastrophic, but major enough that the positive effect is, in fact, a quite nice thing to have happened.

If I ever see an anti-result, I will stop wishing immediately.

If I don't ever see an anti-result, I will work with my fellow human beings to create Heaven by my own hands, and with the assistance of an infinite amount of minor wishes that allow me to positively direct the development of the world.

I will also go through the effort of thinking about the situation in depth and also giving the information on the genie to other people to think on, hoping for someone to come up with a better solution at some point. And I will take precautions to ensure that no-one will be able to input a potentially Hell-creating wish by accident or malevolent design, or benevolent design that is not very well thought-out first.
