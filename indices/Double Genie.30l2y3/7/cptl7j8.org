Test Wish #1: "I wish to be presented with a clear opportunity to gain ten dollars."

Repeat until you are in a universe where you just lost ten dollars or were given the opportunity to do so. Now:

If you were presented with the /opportunity/ to lose ten dollars, then the wish-reversing only applies to the change itself, not the presentation. Make all your future wishes of the form "I wish to be presented with the clear opportunity for...", and simply do not take the opportunities for negative results.

If you were not presented with the opportunity, but instead were forced to lose ten dollars, then the wish-reversing applies to the presentation as well as the change. Make all your future wishes of the form "I wish to have no opportunity to make a decision about whether to accept or reject the following thing:...", and antiwishes should come out as giving you the opportunity, when you can then decline.
