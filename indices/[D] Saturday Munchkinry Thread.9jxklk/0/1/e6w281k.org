/(all depend on how common the Super Crown as an item is in the setting, as well as some other aspects)/

- means to gaining a healthy body, escaping from terminal illnesses and pain

  - escape from temporary negative body conditions (e.g. flu, seasonal allergies, post-op recovery, etc)
  - possible treatment for phantom limb syndrom and mental disorders

- rich source of research data (e.g. in neurology, psychology)
- tool for gaining pseudo-anonymity (e.g. to evade the law enforcement system, to participate in protests while evading possible retaliation from the government, to evade mass surveillance systems, etc)
- option to go through pregnancy, for people who can't bear children

  - alternatively, a form of birth control ([[https://img.rule34.xxx//samples/2629/sample_dacbbfc2eb58f2eb7f81c6b5adfb4c321e21537f.jpg?2922179][nsfw --- if it does work for that)]]

- reversible type of gender reassignment

  - in some aspects, a more perfect type of gender reassignment
  - option to circumvent mismatching sexual preferences between otherwise interested romantic \ sexual partners
  - prostitution

- roleplaying games

  - masquerades --- a tool for organising and participating in them
  - tool for establishing a better contact with some abuse victims (e.g. interaction between a male police officer and [[http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-45648-003.html][someone who has a fear of males)]]

- option for court ordered anti-misogyny cources

  - form of punishment

- easier transportation of prisoners, without them being aware where they are being taken (if the host doesn't have access to their Peach-state memories)

  - easier containment of prisoners

- animal uplifting, pet uplifting, cheap workforce, loophole used for non-illegal slavery (depending on how much much of an intelligence boost an animal wearing it gets)
- cheaper types of transport infrastructure (e.g. the seats have to only be designed to accommodate a very narrow window of body shapes and weights)
- form of immortality for Princess Peach (each Super Crown is a seedling of her consciousness)
- workforce that can perform traumatising tasks without any lasting negative effects (if the memories of a pseudo-Peach get reset once she removes the crown)

  - workforce that can easily be motivated to work cheaply or for free

- access to the real Princess Peach's memories (depending on the mechanics)

  - legal loophole to usurp power in Princess Peach's kingdom by creating a legitimate offspring of hers (depending on the mechanics, laws of her kingdom)

- the usual shenanigans arising from an available No Conservation of Energy mechanics (e.g. using it as an energy generator)
- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph][defeat bosses by polymorphing them]] shenanigans.
