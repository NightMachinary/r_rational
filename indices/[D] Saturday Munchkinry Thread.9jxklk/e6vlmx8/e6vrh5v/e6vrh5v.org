  The transformation only happens if there is enough space whith air or some fluid of similar density for it to happen ,otherwise it does nothing .

Hmm? What about the other direction?

​

Bowser is bigger than Peach, so if it puts on the crown and shrinks to Peach's size, enters a confined space, and takes off the crown, does he stay as Peach since there isn't enough space to transform back into his original size?

​

If so, you can use a single crown to transform as many large creatures into Peaches as you want, as long as you have confined spaces to put them in. Like say a suit of armor.

​

The next question is: What happens to parts of the body that are disconnected? Say I chop off one of Bowsette's fingers. Does it revert back to Bowser finger? (Also how would that work since Bowser has 8 fingers while Peach has 10?) Does it stay a Peach finger even after Bowsette takes off the crown? Can you force it to stay in Peach form by keeping it in a small container where there is no space to revert?

​

If so, it's time to begin mass organ harvesting. Transform animals like horses and cows into Peaches, and harvest their now human organs to save countless human lives with organ transplants. Do the same for blood transfusions. (If I remember correctly, Princess Peach has blood type O, so this is excellent for blood transfusions.)
