By transformation I meant transformation in both directions, but you know what happens whith transparency illusion. For the reverting thing I say that it takes a volume shaped arround more or less continuous amounts of matter that it detects as a working living being at least bigger than the crown (not sure if I should say it has to be an animal since the idea of turning pando into a peach its really funny for one reason )stores it on a pocket dimesion , and creates a peach body on the same place (plus a few complicated effects whith rewiting brains to alow continuity of consciousness) And reverting its the same just reemplacing your peach whith your old body.

Cutting parts of the peach body doesn't make them revert , killing the peach leaves you whith a peach body that might still revert if you remove the crown soon but will stop being considered one after its dead for a while .

I could say that its always the same peach body for an specific living being , but lets say its a brand new one (which even explains why Mario power ups alow you to take more hits ) .
