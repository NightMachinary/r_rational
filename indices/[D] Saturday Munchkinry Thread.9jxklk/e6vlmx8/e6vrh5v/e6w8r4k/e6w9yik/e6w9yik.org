    Any living being wearing it turns into a human girl...

    The transformation only happens if there is enough space whith air or some fluid of similar density for it to happen ,otherwise it does nothing.

  Hmm? What about the other direction?

Well, aging might be solved, then. Do you age while transformed? Does your original form age?

Put on a crown, transform into a youthful girl, get your ear pierced, and then you can take the crown off and stay a human girl indefinitely. Maybe you age as Peach--then the question is whether putting the crown back on will remove your age, and whether you have to get another ear piercing to keep it that way. Perhaps you can alternate ears indefinitely, removing age every time.

Don't take your earring out, lest you instantly transform backward into a series of increasingly old women, then your (probably just bones by now) original self.
