Yeah I imagine it as a unlimited healing item ( sorry for not answering sooner , I went to sleep ). Since it seems the easiest way for the crown to work , just reemplace the body whith a new one .

I guess I could say that your transformed form retains its injuries ( and if it was using it on an ttrpg I would to balance it)but I like the organ harvesting exploits .
