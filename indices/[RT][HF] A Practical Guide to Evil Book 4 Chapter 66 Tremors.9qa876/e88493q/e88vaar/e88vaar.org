As to the memory holes going undetected, I think this is the case only outside the marker. At least the way I read Akua's response to the memory question, the first command appears to restore the memories of previous check-ins in addition to compelling truth. Or possibly because of that compulsion.

Of course, this opens up a second hole wherein Akua has time to scheme during the check and can hide the memories of doing so after the memory question is asked. So long as she uncovers them before the next time Cat asks, anyway. Might be best practice to ask the memory question at the beginning and end of a marker conversation.
