I figure that magical compulsion is not going to be an unkown problem that might need to be solved in a society of evil, backstabbing magicians. From what we've seen of the world, mind control is relatively common. And Drow secrets seem pretty one-size-fits all; the Secret for preventing Drow healing worked on preventing Cat's mantle from healing her "creationally fixed body" (which we know is a far bigger deal than whatever regeneration the Drow have got going on).
