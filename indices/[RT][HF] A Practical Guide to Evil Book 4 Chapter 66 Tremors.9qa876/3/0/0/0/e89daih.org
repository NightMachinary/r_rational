My initial thought on reading it assumed that to answer Cat's questions truthfully and completely, Akua would have to regain the missing memories. Having thought about it some more and reread that section, I think you're right. Akua's reaction is from deducing that these conversations have happened before without even leaving holes in her memory when she considers the answer to the memory question.

However, I've become even more certain that the reason this one took place on screen has to do with my hole- Akua used the time after the memory question to scheme and it will likely pay off soon. Either Cat doesn't get the chance to 'ask her tomorrow', allowing the schemes to begin to play out or she does ask and it comes out that Akua began making plans against Cat, meaning she's become too dangerous and has to go back in the box despite how difficult it will make the rest of the Drow takeover.
