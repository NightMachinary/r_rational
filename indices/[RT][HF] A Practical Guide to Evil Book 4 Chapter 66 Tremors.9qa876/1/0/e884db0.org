Personally I'd put the biggest exploit at the condition of:

#+begin_quote
  there will be a day where the world we made no longer has place for her. When we have faced all the horrors before us.
#+end_quote

This is a pretty broad set of conditions that would trigger the need to kill Akua. She's already working on making herself indispensable (and thus having a place in the world), and facing all the horrors in front of them is the sort of thing that might not have an end - there's always room for another threat, as Cat herself has proven.
