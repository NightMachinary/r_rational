Yeah, even putting a regular legionary officer (Abigail!) in charge of the drow would be better than friggin Larat.

Would be a good thing too, since the drow will need to be integrated into the Legion at some point if Cat wants them to stay around on the long term and not completely cause havoc. Getting them used to a regular military hierarchy would probably do them a lot of good.
