One other thing that struck me which I haven't seen commentary on is how frankly bad a guess Larat is as Cat's designated successor. I'd have guessed Vivienne- the person Cat uses as her morality compass and who she's entrusted what's basically a kill switch for herself to. If not Vivienne, maybe Hakram. Heck, Abigail and Kilian would probably rank higher in the succession than Larat.

Larat is her treacherous lieutenant. His goals aren't at all aligned with hers, the best she could do is make him swear a series of oaths that put him pretty much on rails but that'd require assuming context never changes and he can never slip the bounds given infinite time.

So, has Akua figured out a way to lie? Still doing an Evil cannot comprehend Slightly More Pragmatic Evil thing?
