Possibly not a crack theory: Cat climbs the tower and imbues the role of dread emporer with Winter.

Praes and Callow already personify the same aspects as winter and summer: constant greed and treachery on winter/praes, as well as the direct equivalence of praes always needing callows food.

Having one fae kingdom in the real world wouldn't work, so my guess is vivienne would become the summer queen and rule callow. This */might/* be currently foreshadowed with Vivienne losing her role, though its quite a stretch.

The main difference is these two courts would begin allied, and hopefully stay that way.
