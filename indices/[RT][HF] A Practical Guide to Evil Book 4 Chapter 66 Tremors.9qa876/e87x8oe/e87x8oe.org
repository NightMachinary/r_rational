My guess is that Cat is going to invest her title into Callow itself, making it the Kingdom of Moonless Nights, so that all the power that she's acquired will be able to be used by any of her successors to protect Callow, this protection enforced by Fey promises ingrained into the title itself.

As a call back, she could condense a sword of pure Winter and jam it into a stone for people to try and pull out to become her successor.
