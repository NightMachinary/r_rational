Yeah, she can have manipulated the oaths, and erase memory of that before cat asks that question. But this relies on cat asking the same questions in the same order each time. I feel like cat has a pretty good understanding of loopholes, and should have seen that one.

Even just a "have you created, repaired, or can currently detect the presence of any memory alteration during this conversation?" would be a solution.

The only way around this would be to alter her memory in a way that cannot be detected by her... literally changing who she is by replacing parts of herself with new but indistinguishable parts.

Which, given her statement that she would try to survive in a way that keeps as much of herself as possible, is actually a bit of a concern.
