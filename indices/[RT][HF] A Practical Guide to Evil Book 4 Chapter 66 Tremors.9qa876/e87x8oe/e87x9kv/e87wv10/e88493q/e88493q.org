  Most those bodies were already bereft of Night, their killers have wasted no time claiming their due

This is probably unavoidable, but I still think the Drow chowing down on the Night is a vector for risk. You don't want Drow becoming powerful enough that they can test their bonds, or gaining knowledge on how to escape magical oaths.

Thank god. I'm not convinced Larat is /much/ better, but he's probably better than Akua.

  I have begun to worry, Catherine. Urulan was perhaps in the twenty strongest drow of Great Lotow, and likely close to the bottom of that division. It fought... better than I expected. You came close to death more than once.”
#+end_quote

Yep. Why is it Akua who always seems to be the one bringing up reasonable points? That's actually a worrying trend.

But Cat better have some damn good contingencies for the upcoming fights, let alone for Sve Noc (who is apparently a Dead King level threat).

Oh good. We haven't seen much of Cat reigning in Akua recently, so this was comforting to see.

I feel like a (admittedly small) hole might open up immediately though. Take

#+begin_quote
  “We have,” I murmured. “Have you walled off any memories or knowledge, or considered doing so?”

  “I have not,” Akua replied.

  “Do you have any hole or holes in your memories?”

  “I do not,” she said, then cocked her head to the side. “I do not. Oh my, you have been thorough.”

and

#+begin_quote
  “From and including the word ‘marker' I spoke earlier today, you will remember this conversation as idle chatter from the moment this sentence ends,” I Spoke.
#+end_quote

And it becomes fairly obvious. Cat's checking for holes in Akua's memories, but apparently modifications to her memory can go undetected. It's a fairly small hole, all things considered (especially as Akua would probably have to erase the memory of considering to do so), but it's still a thing.

  “Have you plotted or acted against my interests?” I asked.

  “I have not,” she replied, sounding amused.

  ....

  “Have you manipulated the greater or lesser oaths, or both, so that you can exploit them in any way?” I asked.

  “I have not,” she said.
#+end_quote

This is all very good to know.

  My only long-term objective is survival.
#+end_quote

Although this I find quite surprising. I'd have figured Akua would be a little more ambitious, whether she's backed into a corner or no.

#+begin_quote
  I'd ask again tomorrow.
#+end_quote

A daily check in like this is definitely a much needed policy.
