This made me want to see if I could find an exploit in Cat's oath to Thief.

(Chapter 29).

Context: Cat asked Vivienne if she wanted "the soul" destroyed.

  “For small slights, long prices," "Let Akua Sahelian see the light and taste freedom. Let her believe she has slipped the noose, so long as she remains of use.” “But there will be a day where the world we made no longer has place for her,” “When we have faced all the horrors before us. And on that day, when she has glimpsed victory?” “Snuff her out, Catherine,” “Slowly. Painfully. Excruciatingly aware of what is being taken from her.”

The biggest potential exploit that seems likely would be if for whatever reason the individual we've been calling "Akua Sahelian" doesn't count as Akua. I can't remember if the Akua we have now is Akua's original soul or the copy of Akua's mind she put on another soul. If it's the latter, it could be that she doesn't count as Akua Sahelian. This would also I think be the best shot Akua has at a plausible 'redemption' arc in the eyes of Cat and the audience, arguing that while she's certainly similar, the soul is meaningful enough that she isn't actually the same person responsible for Liesse.
