Oh, right, a possibility that an /object/ woud receive the title (though, how would that even work?).

Kingdom of Moonless Nights sounds a little bit cheesy for me, close second to the “Black Princess of Night”, but making a regalia like the Deadwood Crown that would allow for the title to switch hands is very much in the cards.

I hope, for the sake of variety, that the seasons would also change with it: can do only so much with a power built around not having sufficient resources to sustain itself. Maybe it would even be a Tyrant of Helike kind of deal, where the rising or falling influence of the country would call for different basis of power.
