Taking the prior point as a bit of foreshadowing, would Cat still actually have the power to Speak if she's functionally Nameless? I would understand if it drew upon her mantle of Winter (as Ubua is bound to obey it), but I thought Speaking was always a Name thing?

If that's the case, perhaps Ubua is able to resist, either partially or completely (but acts otherwise).
