If I don't remember badly that was how Ursula K. Le Guin's "A Wizard of Earthsea" magic tended to work. Especially the True Names part. That said, it wasn't exactly rational maybe but I don't remember any major plot problems or contrivances in it either - the first novel of the cycle, at least. I think it sort of got lost after that, but it's good that it also works well as a stand-alone story.
