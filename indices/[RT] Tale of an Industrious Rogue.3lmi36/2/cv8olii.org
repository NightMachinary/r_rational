I have to admit when I read the title, I thought of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes][roguelikes]]. Has anyone posted on [[/r/rational]] about them before? IMO, the best games in the genre (DCSS, Brogue) are some of the best games full stop, at demanding thought out action, rewarding relentlessly rational behaviour and punishing irrational behaviour.
