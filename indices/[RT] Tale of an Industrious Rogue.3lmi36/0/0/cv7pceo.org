/tg/ has a bounty of great stories. There was one very long saga I remember about a group of Earth humans dropped into a typical D&D setting, and they try to keep themselves together as a group and survive. I remember there was a bit of a focus on warring technology; that was where I first learned about the strategic benefits of mounted soldiers.
