I did something like this once. I built a fighter that did enough damage per round to tunnel through normal materials at speed, according to the hit-points-per-inch-of-thickness tables in the DMG, and then started bypassing dungeons by going through walls and around fortifications. Eventually my DM got sufficiently annoyed that he declared that the wizard's tower that was the next dungeon had walls of solid adamantine. Mistake. Adamantine has a price-per-pound. It's a /big/ price-per-pound. I funded basically the rest of the campaign by selling off chunks of that tower.
