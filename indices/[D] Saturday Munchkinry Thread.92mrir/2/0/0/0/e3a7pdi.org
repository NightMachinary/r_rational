Can I move during this time? If so, what matter is left out? That which I have in my body? Carry? Touch and choose? I could try carrying a supercomputer and giving it double time.

If I can only think during this time, asking an MRI to look at my brain would be interesting. I could benefit from this in sports, wherever split-second decisions are important. Rubick from Dota 2 comes to mind.
