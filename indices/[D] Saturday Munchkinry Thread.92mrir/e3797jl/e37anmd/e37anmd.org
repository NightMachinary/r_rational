What do you mean by "break out"? Closing your eyes doesn't let you ignore things in the real world because, for example, a real bus will hit you whether you see it coming or not. An illusory bus /will never hit you/. Similarly, an illusory bus isn't going to run you over even if you hear its engine, squealing brakes and tires, and blaring horn.

The illusory bus might make you turn around, or jump to the side, or some other action convenient to the spellcaster... or your steadfast quip, "I'm not going to fall for /that/ again" may prove ironic as a spellcaster playing the long game tricks you into ignoring a real bus.

How is any of this different from standard overpowered illusion magic?
