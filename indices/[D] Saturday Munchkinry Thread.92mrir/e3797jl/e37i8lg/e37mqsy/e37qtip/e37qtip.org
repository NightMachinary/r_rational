I was imagining them fading into coherence over the course of their creation: visuals start out abstract or fuzzy, sounds quiet or indistinct, smells vague or artificial. They fade from perception the same way while ignored. A victim that can withdraw partway might be able to identify illusions from reality by examining them closely, but if they withdraw entirely the illusions would be obviously fake.

So an illusion that casts quickly has less persistence than one that casts slowly. It's not imprinted on the brain very deeply. An illusion that take a long time to fully resolve is a lot harder to ignore or forget.
