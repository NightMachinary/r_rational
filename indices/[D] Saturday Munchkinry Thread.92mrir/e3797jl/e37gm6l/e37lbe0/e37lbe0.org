Yep, lol I'm talking about genjutsu. I mostly agree, but I've seen instances where mind/illusion magic are underpowered (or should be) in which people can sense the magic before it reaches them and prevent the illusions from ever taking hold. So to me, it seems it'll be OP or completely useless against people that have been trained to fight it.

  Just make the person experience unbelievable pain. Enough pain can make someone unable to act.

I've thought extensively about this and it seems almost impossible to deal with unless you remove somatory illusions from the magic's capabilities. But even then, you could simply render someone blind and deaf and it'll probably take them a second to recognize what happened and break out, but we're dealing with ninja in the Naruto universe so a second of being blind and deaf almost certainly means death. Maybe you can be conditioned to automatically/unconsciously flush foreign magic out of your system when a certain threshold of pain is experienced? Perhaps there might be an inherent problem with causing instantaneously crippling pain since there are many instances where people feel nothing at the time of a severe injury? Idk, mind magic is tough.
