Alright, so I have an illusionary magical system in which the magic can be attached and delivered through a sensory medium (light/sound waves, gases, maybe heat). In order to break out of an illusion that is delivered by a constantly emitting sensory medium you have to first prevent it from reaching whatever sensory organ it is targeting, then do the necessary procedure for escaping the illusion. So for example, if it is a flute, you have to plug your ears first and keep them plugged. The problem here is if someone, or a group of someones, cast illusions delivered through light and sound waves, then the only way to escape the illusion is to render yourself deaf and blind which is ridiculous.

So this is basically a reverse munchkinry question, there is an obviously overpowered exploitation and I need to find a way to limit it without gimping the entire branch of magic. If you see any other OP exploitations feel free to mention them too. I feel like this may be untenable.
