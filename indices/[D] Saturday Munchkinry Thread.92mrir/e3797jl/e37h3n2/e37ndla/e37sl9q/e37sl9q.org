  We're in the Naruto universe here so I don't think loudspeakers or amplifiers exist (I'm not certain though).

Ah. Electrical speakers do exist in Naruto. They use them as early as [[https://i.imgur.com/vhgCCVt.png][episode 6]]. IIRC, they have pretty modern electrical tech, including a few computers. So an illusionist with a subwoofer seems completely plausible in-universe.
