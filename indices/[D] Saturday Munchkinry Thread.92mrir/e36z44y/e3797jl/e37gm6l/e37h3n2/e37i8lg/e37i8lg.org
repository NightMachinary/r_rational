The risk is always that the illusionist's victim will realize they're being fooled and ignore the illusion one way or another.

Based on the other post, I think you can make it work by adding a time component. Say it takes five seconds of sense delivery for the illusion to become absolutely believable, and it does so by degrees. It would also take five seconds of sense avoidance to undo it, again by degree. Plugging your ears for five seconds will render the flute bard's illusions completely obvious, and as soon as you unplug them you've got five seconds before they re-resolve. At that point you'll know what's fake and what's real. Similarly if you stop looking at a hypnotic light or stop inhaling a hallucinatory gas for even a few seconds their respective illusions dissipate from your mental frame.

Shorter times make the illusion easier to break, but also easier to establish, favoring quick-thinking illusionists against ignorant opponents. Longer times make both harder, favoring prepared illusionists against unprepared opponents.
