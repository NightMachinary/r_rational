Huh, this is a really interesting idea, it adds an extra layer of depth but isn't overly convoluted, thank you. I'm mentally going through all the instances in which this illusion magic was used in the thing I'm writing and everything still works!

Now I just have to figure out an explanation for why illusions that take longer to establish take longer to escape. I was operating under a system in which escaping was done by flooding the brain with magic so the excess foreign magic overflows out.
