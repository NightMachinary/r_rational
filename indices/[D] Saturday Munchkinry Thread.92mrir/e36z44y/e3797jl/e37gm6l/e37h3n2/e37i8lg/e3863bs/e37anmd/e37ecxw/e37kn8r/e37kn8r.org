If magic is being delivered to your brain, why don't you just cast illusion magic on yourself to deliver interfering magic? You can't fill it with magic if it's already filled up.

Better yet, in a world where illusion magic is real and humans/animals evolved alongside it, they probably /already/ have some latent magic in their brains that needs to be overcome.

Since this /saves/ you from the magic and automatically /throws/ it out of your brain, you could call this natural resistance something like a 'saving throw'. It usually blocks illusions naturally unless the caster is much stronger than the target, or the caster is doing it sneaky enough that the body doesn't realize or isn't ready to fight it off (eg, they have disadvantage).
