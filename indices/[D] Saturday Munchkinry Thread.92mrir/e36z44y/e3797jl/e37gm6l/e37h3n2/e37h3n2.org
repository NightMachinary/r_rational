Sound waves are overpowered because they can't be blocked without completely leaving the area. Loud enough sound can be felt through your body.

But the gas transmission medium is interesting. If all illusion magic is gaseous, I can imagine people holding their breathe for a long time, and almost passing out, just to get a glimpse of reality before they take a deep breathe and fall back into the illusion. And if you know you are going to fight an illusionist, then you would want to wear bulky breathing equipment. If your setting is less technologically advanced, there could be superstitions about hanging pungeant stuff like onions around your neck to ward of the 'evil miasmas' of sorcerors.
