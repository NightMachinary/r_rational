What if you stack it in layers? Say you have a bunch of thin plastic 10 gram discs with the tops coated in this material. You take ten of these, put them on top of each other, then put the stack on a scale with the bare side down. What happens? Does the scale only measure 10 grams instead of the full hundred?

What if you flip the stack and put the coated side touching the scale? Does the scale then read 0 grams?

I have a hunch that antinertium batteries can somehow be used to lift cargo into space.
