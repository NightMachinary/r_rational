The scale will weigh 10 grams the first time, since that works as you expect. Never rest one on its face, though, since the coated object won't stop falling down due to gravity until the pressure exceeds the threshold. So it'll weigh 100 grams the second time and all of the surfaces will be broken.

I do think you can achieve flight with this, though I'm not sure how efficient it'll be.
