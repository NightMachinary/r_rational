There are quick issues using this for getting to space; first it needs to be sealed lest the change in atmospheric pressure breaks it; secondly it has to be active since any static configuration will move the set point of the material in a couple of hours. This is fine if you're building an ion thruster alternative where the weight of these additions is irrelevant, but when getting to space you really don't have much headroom before gravity wins.

You can reduce some of these issues by launching off a high altitude aircraft, where the atmosphere is far thinner, which should make it easier to build within weight constraints. You might even be able to echew containment if you take a few days to ascend.
