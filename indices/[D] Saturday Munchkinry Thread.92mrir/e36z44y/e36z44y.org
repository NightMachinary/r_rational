R&D have announced their newest discovery: Antinertium. An object coated with a thin film of antinertium dodges the laws of conservation, as small fluctuations of forces applied to its outside through the coated areas are not transferred to the coated object. The material slowly normalises to its current external pressure (about 0.01 Pa/s, or 100 days to adjust from vacuum to 1 atm), and negates about 100 Pa of dynamic force. Going above its dynamic limit breaks the affected material permanently and immediately.

The material is going to be expensive to produce, about $1M/mÂ², but you project this to slowly drop a factor of 10 or so over the next couple of decades before levelling out. The material is nontoxic, thin, otherwise durable and applicable to most materials.

You have yet to announce this product to the world. What do you do with it? Who do you sell it to?
