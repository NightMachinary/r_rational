Hrm. So when the material adjusts to a new set point, it starts transferring the energy through again? In the scale example, the measured weight increases over the course of several days until it registers the full weight of the object, right?

If pressure is decreased, does the set-point instantly decrease? Say you add a sheet of metal, leave it for a while, add another, etc, until you have 50 kg sitting on top of the sheet. Then you lift up 40 kg of metal and then set it back down carefully. Does this instantly shatter the platform or is there a grace period?
