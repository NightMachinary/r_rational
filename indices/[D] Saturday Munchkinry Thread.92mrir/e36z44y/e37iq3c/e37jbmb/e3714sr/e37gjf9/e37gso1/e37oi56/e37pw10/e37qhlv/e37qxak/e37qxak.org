An antinertium coat with a set point of 1000 Pa will constantly transfer 1000 Pa of pressure to the coated object, as long as the real external pressure is between 990 Pa and 1100 Pa. The set point moves at 0.01 Pa/s, so it takes 10000 seconds for the set point to change by 100 Pa.

In your example, if you lift up the 40 kg of metal, the coating immediately fails.
