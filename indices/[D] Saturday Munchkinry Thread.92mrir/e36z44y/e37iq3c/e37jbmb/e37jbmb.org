Best of my ideas so far:

- Extremely high quality IEMs, headphones and earmuffs.

- Noise removal from scientific tools.

- Ion-thruster alternative; you need to be able to modulate pressure to avoid it just adjusting to the current environment, but it should be self-sustaining since the energy required to compress/decompress a small amount of air isn't very high.
