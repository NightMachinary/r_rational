This sounds a lot like Genjutsu from Naruto. Which is fine, but the thing is, when you have magic that can interact with the brain indirectly, through a sense, well, I've always thought it could ONLY be extremely overpowered.

Just make the person experience unbelievable pain. Enough pain can make someone unable to act. If you are unable to act, then you can just be killed or subdued by a second person.

The only thing I can think of is for people to have automatic self defense systems, with some sort of trigger (falling down, rapid blinking, etc) that automatically casts a spell that turns off all of your senses and then turns them back on.

But then you could counter that with a spell that is automatically set to just constantly emit a spell.

Maybe being a mage is so so so difficult because you have to internalize this self defense spell before you can ever deal with another mage.

I dont know. Illusionary magic is really tough, in my opinion.
