Breaking out of the illusion is basically expelling the foreign magic out of your brain, preventing the caster from creating any more illusions. I probably should have clarified this, but what I was talking about was simply methods of delivering magic into another person's brain. So in the flute example, as long as your ears are receiving sensory information from the flute, the person with the flute will be able to conjure any illusion they wish (auditory, visual, somatory, olfactory, etc.).

  How is any of this different from standard overpowered illusion magic?

Well, it's supposed to be extremely easy to escape, expelling foreign magic and blocking/plugging one of your senses (with magic) takes a fraction of a second with no incantations or gestures required, the only cost being that you can't use magic for anything else during that fraction of a second (so you can't break out of an illusion while casting a fireball). I had hoped it would be somewhat underpowered (at least on its own) so that it's only effective when used very subtly, or on someone that is already incapacitated/drugged or while the opponent is in the middle of something.
