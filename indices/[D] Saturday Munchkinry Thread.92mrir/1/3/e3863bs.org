Option: Limit the spells to being delivered through a single sense at a time. Thus, you might have to deafen yourself /or/ blind yourself to escape a given illusion, but not both at once.

A canny opponent might be able to use one sound-based illusion and /at the same time/ one sight-based illusion of the exact same thing - this can be broken out of by first closing your eyes (and escaping the sight-based illusion) and /then/ opening your eyes but blocking your ears (and thus escaping the sound-based illusion) - then you never need to render yourself entirely insensate.
