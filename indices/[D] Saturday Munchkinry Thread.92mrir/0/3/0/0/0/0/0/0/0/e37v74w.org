The coating is thin enough that it adds negligible thermal resistance. However, its special effect is going to do weird things when the pressures are mismatched; the right answer isn't obvious to me yet but it should be roughly equivalent to the coated object experiencing the external object as if it was time dilated such that its pressure was equal to the internally-experienced pressure, which means that the temperature as experienced from inside is scaled by that same factor. Vice-versa applies to the external object. I'll think about this more.
