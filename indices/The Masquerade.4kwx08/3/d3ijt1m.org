  Stories set in the Cthulhu Mythos usually have the justification that knowing about the Mythos erodes your sanity because of its very nature, but that's based on a presupposition about how human minds work that we rationalists try to defy by altering our conception of reality.

This is a case of flanderization. If you look at Lovecraft's stories, the erosion of sanity almost always takes the form of either trauma-related disorders (e.g. having a phobia of subways, cellars, and other underground places because of ghouls) or acting in ways which are perfectly rational but depend on information that others don't have (e.g. obsessively avoiding places with angles, because that's how the Hounds of Tindalos get you).
