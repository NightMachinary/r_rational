Unless you have submitted original rational!work, the rule is you aren't allowed to post purely brainstorming threads (I think 1 chapter per 1 post or something like that it the rule of thumb the mods use). However you can post in the Friday off-topic, Monday general discussion, and Wednesday world-building threads and people will reply there if you really want to get some feed back.

In case you have made submissions and this thread isn't taken down... Nasuverse has magecraft that gets weaker the more people that know it's secrets. So it is rational for magi to hide the existence of magecraft given their goals of strengthening and improving their magecraft to reach Akasha (basically gaining omniscience/ascending to a higher plane of existence/getting magic that is omnipotent within its specialty, depending on how the path to Akasha is used)
