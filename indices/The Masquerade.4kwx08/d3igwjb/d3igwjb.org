Isn't this against the "don't post scenarios for discussion" rule?

Anyway, HPMoR [[#s][has an example of this]].

More generally, it is often quite feasible that back when the separation started, there was a good reason for secrecy; a minority with magical powers could be the target of exploitation. Since then, the balance of power changed, but now disrupting the status quo would be more trouble than it's worth. Even if the rationalist protagonist thinks it would be better for humanity if secrecy were broken, he might have better things to do (like, you know, the plot), and not have the opportunity either.

In other words, a rational character doesn't need to support The Masquerade; they just need to find it momentarily less bad than the process of society readjusting.
