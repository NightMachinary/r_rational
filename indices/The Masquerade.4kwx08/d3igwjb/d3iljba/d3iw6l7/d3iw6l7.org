Well, I wouldn't call this any more "temporary" than, say, the existence of the human race. For my suggestion to work, the status quo should be firmly ingrained, so the Masquerade should have been going on for at least a few generations, if not for a few thousand years. On the other end of things, it's not like anyone forces you to say what will happen to it once the story is done. Maybe your character will finally have time to get around to breaking it, maybe they won't.
