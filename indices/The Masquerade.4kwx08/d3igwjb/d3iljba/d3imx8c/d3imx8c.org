Just remember that truth-telling and knowledge-seeking are *instrumental* rather than *terminal*. If a good and proper rationalist learned that truth-telling was, in some cases, bad for mankind, he would cease to tell the truth. If he learned that seeking knowledge was, in some cases, bad for mankind, he would cease to seek knowledge.
