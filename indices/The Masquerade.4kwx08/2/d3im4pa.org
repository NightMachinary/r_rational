- Some knowledge is dangerous. If it were possible to somehow make the equivalent of an atomic bomb in your kitchen using household ingredients, would you spread that information?

- Some knowledge is private. If you learned that someone was homosexual and knew that they didn't want that information shared with anyone, would you spread that information?

- Some knowledge creates anti-utility. If you learned that an otherwise fantastic doctor was regularly using cocaine, would you spread that knowledge?

I think those are the three basic arguments; danger, privacy, and utility. Though I could probably come up with more if I knew what specific Masquerade you were working with.
