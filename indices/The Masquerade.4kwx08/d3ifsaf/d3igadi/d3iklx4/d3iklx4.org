Depends the setting. And in real life its a problem to spend years developing something, releasing it and then having someone else (usually someone with more resources) just arrive and reap the benefits. Sure in an ideal world everyone would release everything for the benefit of the masses but even then, some information may be worth less or have undesirable side effects if released.

Could also be because we live in a capitalist society and in a post scarcity world where we didn't require competition we could afford to just share everything.
