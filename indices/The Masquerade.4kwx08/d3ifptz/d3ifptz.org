Have you read the Sequences? Eliezer provides pretty solid reasoning for keeping science relatively secret [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/p0/to_spread_science_keep_it_secret/][here]]; the post is immediately followed by the first installment of [[http://lesswrong.com/tag/conspiracy_world/][his Bayesian Conspiracy story]], which is entirely founded on the idea of keeping science (and rationality in general) relatively secret. Whether or not this suggestion is entirely serious, it's still pretty interesting imo, and certainly fits the Masquerade bill.

Related or not, I know many who would argue that certain information concerning nuclear weaponry, artificial intelligence, and various basilisks would be best kept under wraps.
