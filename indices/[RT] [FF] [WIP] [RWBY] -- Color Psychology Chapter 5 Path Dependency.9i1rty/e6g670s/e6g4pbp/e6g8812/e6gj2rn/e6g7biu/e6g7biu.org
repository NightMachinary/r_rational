1. I liked the short interlude from Weiss; I had been wondering how she was reacting to Ruby. A common problem that I have with short interludes is that often times they reveal information that the protagonist doesn't have. While I'm aware of dramatic irony, I'm personally not a fan.

2. I think the combat worked well, I feel a balance was struck between an analytical fighter and a highly emotional one.
