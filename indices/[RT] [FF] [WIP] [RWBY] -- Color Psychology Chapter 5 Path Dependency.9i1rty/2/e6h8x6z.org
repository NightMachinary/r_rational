I have to say, this is one of my new favorite things.

I think one of the interesting things that you have introduced is how self-image influences aura. I hope you how that influences a huntsman/huntswoman's education. I feel like a lot of effort would go into developing a more robust self-image that is capable of greater influence on reality. Further, if one's self-image dictates how one's aura restores your body, could you if you are capable of internalizing an ideal self, make oneself stronger, smarter, etc?

Anyway, so far you've made characters I enjoy and your world has got me thinking. Great start.
