I like the interlude from Weiss certainly. In my mind, RWBY has four protagonists, so seeing POV of the others is great. Here, especially, it's great to see how Ruby looked from the outside to contrast with how she seems on the inside. (Ozpin is iffier, since he presumably Knows Too Much, but I still liked his interlude.)

Overall, I'm still loving this fic. I love the depiction of Ruby, the focus on her internal state, and I was laughing at the linear algebra lectures.

I did wonder, though, if Weiss was just joking when she said she would let Ruby finish dismantling the Grimm on her own, why did she... not step up to help once Ruby started? I wasn't sure if I was supposed to read this as Ruby being mega-awkward somehow, or as Weiss blaming Ruby's awkwardness for her own awkwardness. Well, it's fine if this is meant to a bit open-ended.
