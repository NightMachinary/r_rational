So her silver eye thing is presumably making her /very/ happy to kill Grimm, and probably scales with the strength/ age of the Grimm.

Weiss seems to have actually had lessons in not pointlessly being a brat, here, so it'll be interesting to see how that change affects team dynamics - especially her interactions with Blake.

The fight scene was /excellent/, and I usually dislike reading fight scenes enough that I'll just skim them. I think Ruby's perspective might be uniquely suited to detailed, written fight scenes, thanks to her mental speed-ups.
