1. I agree with [[/u/tjhance]]. I like these kind of interludes when they are from characters with similar knowledge to the protagonists, but not when they are from antagonists or characters that know more about what is going on than the protagonists.

2. The combat scene worked really well! Ruby's semblance is super interesting and having her meticulously analyse what is happening really conveys that everything is happening in slow motion.
