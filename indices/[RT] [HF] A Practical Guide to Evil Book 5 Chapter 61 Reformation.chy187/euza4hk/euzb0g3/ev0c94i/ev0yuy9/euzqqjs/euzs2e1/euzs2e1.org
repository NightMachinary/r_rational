The chapter starts with Cat seeing the Firstborn competing in a range of non violent ways (slam poetry, not!Go, contests of skill). We then are introduced to a problem that would normally be solved through violent competition. My guess is she's going to have the claimants do the poetry thing and have the Firstborn vote on the winner.
