Caught up again, some thoughts on recent chapters.

The weird geary AI chapter was my favourite. Something about the tone. A vaguely ominous (dopamine?) yet likeable version of "Hey I'm totally not evil!" I'd rate it 10 pitchforks. Lilith seems to have volunteered to be the witch.

Kam's becoming a more interesting character, less predictable I think. Good to see her developing.

Feels like a lot of significant things have been said that have gone over my head. Oh well, hopefully I'll catch onto some of it as the story goes on.
