  No, please keep making puns. I enjoy the titles a lot.

I see you are a man of taste.

Re: the Pilaf gang, while I've made my own changes of course, it's interesting to point out how this characterisation for me was partly influenced by how DB Super fleshed them out. In particular, showed them to be far more technically competent than we ever saw (they help Bulma repair the Time Machine), and Mai is specifically shown to be a serious "badass normal" when she wants to. Of course that doesn't count for much in Dragon Ball but that's her bad lot in life I guess.
