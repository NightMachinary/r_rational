Either Reddit or Matrix if I find a client to my satisfaction :). I don't promise anything about when I might be able to though - sorry for that, but I'm often busy, and well, I do some story planning on my spare time (riding a bus, walking around) and in the weekends I usually either write, spend time with my GF, do other stuff, or am busy being too busted to function. Guess the best shot for me would be a dead day at work when I can sneak in a few chat messages :).
