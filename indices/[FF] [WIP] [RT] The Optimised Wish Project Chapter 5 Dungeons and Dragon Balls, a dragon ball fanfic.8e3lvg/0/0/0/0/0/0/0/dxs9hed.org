  And suppose Goku has read Sun Tzu's Art of War?

Well, to do that, /I/ would need to read it first. Which I probably should. But anyway I'll avoid citing explicitly real authors since technically the Dragon World just isn't /our/ Earth, and thus they never had any Sun Tzu to begin with.

And thanks for the offer :). Though that means you get a bit spoiled beforehand :D. I'll get in touch when I have time!
