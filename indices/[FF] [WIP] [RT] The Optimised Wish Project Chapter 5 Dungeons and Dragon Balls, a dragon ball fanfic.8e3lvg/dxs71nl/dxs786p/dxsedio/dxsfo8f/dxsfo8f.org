Personally I may edit if I ever do a "final" edition (like Eliezer did for HPMOR on his site), but I won't change an ongoing fic on FF.net, I'd be worried it would get even more confusing. "Oh, go back and read the ending of Chapter 3 again 'cos I added stuff" sounds a recipe for disaster.

I may need to make it more evident, but I don't think it's a deus ex machina because of three reasons:

1) it's not really key to the solution of the chapter, after all Goku could have used the capsule to trap the gas anyway, the laws only say the time freezes which is relatively unimportant (he could subdue Shu in other ways)\\
2) while not stated outright in canon, it's a logical way to expect such a thing to work; as for the laws concerning living beings and other capsules, as I said elsewhere, they /are/ inspired by some things that are said in the games, at the very least, and\\
3) they are groundwork for stuff that will happen later, so this chapter's events weren't the main reason to mention them. Being so early in the story, I think there's still some leeway for worldbuilding in these situations.
