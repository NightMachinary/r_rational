Also, a small note. The laws are inspired by similar laws that are hinted at in the GBA games "Legacy of Goku 2" and "Buu's Fury". They mention that no living being can be put inside a capsule, and that no capsule can be put inside a capsule. However they have someone who invents a prototype of capsule that /can/ hold a living being, and also hint at some kind of disaster that would happen if you put a capsule inside another (which I removed because any disaster could as well be a weapon, and I didn't want to juggle with that possibility too).
