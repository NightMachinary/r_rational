I checked it out, but I thought it was a little feature light. There is, however, a slightly newer [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=squirrelinhell.lwpredictions][app]] that does mostly the same thing and that one does look interesting enough to give it a try.

Thanks for the recommendation!
