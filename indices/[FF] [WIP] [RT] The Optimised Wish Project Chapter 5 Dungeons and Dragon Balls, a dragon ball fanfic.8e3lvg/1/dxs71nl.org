[[#s][new insta kill technique unlocked]]

And I was wrong about Bulma locking out the Pilaf gang from the castle. (At least for now.)

The soul explanation for the second law of capsule seems a little more of guessing, than deduction. Even if souls exist (Which they do in the DB Universe), the problem could still be biological. And scientists should be able to experiment with that. Also, bad way to find out, if something has a soul. I guess plants would survive, animals don't. Would an animal turned into a carrot survive being stored?

Maybe put the three laws into earlier chapters or at the end of this, when you upload the next chapter. It was really confusing, that Bulma explained stuff calmly after freaking out at the end of the last chapter.
