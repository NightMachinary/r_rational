I got that, after it ended. Yesterday doesn't help much, if there could have been a time skip.

Just saying, consider using the power of editing. Personally, I don't know why it is there anyhow. They didn't use the capsule for anything, that would need to be explained with the laws. The sleeping gas could also just be stored in one without stasis effect. So just put the laws on the end or where it should be chronological after everyone read it. [[#s][of course]] And even if the laws were needed, introducing them in the chapter they are needed to explain stuff, would be close to a Deus Ex Machina.

[[#s][worth a try anyway]]

But I'm just complaining, ignore me, if you think it has no merit. ;-)
