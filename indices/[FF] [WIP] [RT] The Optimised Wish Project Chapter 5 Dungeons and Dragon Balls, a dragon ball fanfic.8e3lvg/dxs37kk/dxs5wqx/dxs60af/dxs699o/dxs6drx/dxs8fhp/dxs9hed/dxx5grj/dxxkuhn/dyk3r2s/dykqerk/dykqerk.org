Hey! It's fine. I wrote you on Matrix. I don't have much time to dedicate to this project at the moment, so what I have, I'm trying to focus on the short term objective of actually writing the next chapters than on long-term planning, since I have the upcoming arc ( [[#s][slight spoilers]] ) more or less figured out already. As for that ship, that sounds like a good safety feature for any gravity chamber, but I'm not even sure that ship will /exist/ in this timeline. Major changes will begin after the end of this arc.
