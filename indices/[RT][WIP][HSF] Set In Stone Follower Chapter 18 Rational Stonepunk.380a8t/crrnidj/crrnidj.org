I can't follow the link. It keeps timing out for me... help? EDIT: Looks like I cant access any wordpress stories but the site apparently isn't down... All I know how to do is flush dns and that didn't fix it.

EDIT2: OK according to my ISP some servers can't be accessed in/from Australia/New Zealand at the moment. I'll have to try again later. Looking forward to the update.
