Stark reminder that for all of the combat power assembled by the Officers, there are still bigger fish around.

On the other side of things, official government recognition without making an end-run around bureaucracy with an Orange. As a solo actor, Nate's been fairly well-integrated into the group. If the FBI (or any other three letter agency) insisted that they accept a larger taskforce as a subunit, would James/the group go along with it? Could they at this point afford not to?

There isn't actually that much in terms of incentives that the government could offer at this point if they didn't. Threats, sure. But incentives that would be actually enticing to the leadership? The group is in an awkward spot where the only stuff that would appeal are way above their weight, like access to key figures of government or input on policy. The kind of stuff offered to billionaires. A photo-op with the mayor isn't going to cut it. So threats seem like a likely opening posture, pointing out that the group has been assuming authority that isn't actually theirs to put them on a back foot before demanding oversight.
