After the initial freak out, the developed world will just see them as citizens like anyone else. It's not like they can control it, and most humans are able to restrain themselves from punching people, even though they can.

The power set you have described means there are no superheroes. Offensively they cause too much collateral damage, and defensively they can't take much more dynamite than a normal person. (They might /survive/ more dynamite, but getting their legs blown off is still a mission kill.) They'll be good against conventional criminals, but not against each other. And really, most conventional crimes don't end in police shoot-outs, so superheroes won't make that much of a difference even there.

Every year, there are about 400 reported incidences of violent crime in the US per 100,000 people. That works out to about one supervillain for every two thousand people or so. (With repeat offenders, there could be fewer.) That's without the insurance fraud market. About 1% of people admit to having set fires for fun or property damage, so you could be looking at two or three or more times that number in serial arsonists, with some overlap.

Those bombers will be much harder to catch than the mundane sort, since they won't leave any evidence that distinguishes them from any other superbeing. But they can be shut down hard just by using more security cameras. In fact, insurance companies might offer to cut your rates back to pre-superbeing levels if you install cameras. Ultimately, I don't think the average person's life would change all that much.

The developing world is a bit more interesting. Radical groups with superbeing members can rapidly expand their influence, and the more they have, the more control they can have. But I think this is also a self-limiting problem. If ISIS and Al Qaeda go at each other with even more bombs, things will get really bloody, and any civilians are in big trouble. It'll be bad, but it won't end in a supervillain god-king - It will just end in fire.
