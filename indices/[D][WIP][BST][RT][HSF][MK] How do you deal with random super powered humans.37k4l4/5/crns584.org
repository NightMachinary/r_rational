How efficient is are their powers. If their powers are very efficient, then HEIs could use their abilities to make coal, gasoline, alcohol, etc... cheaper that it is to mine and/or refine naturally. I can see HEIs going to work in power production and industry for their ability to synthesis materials more effectively than current processes can.

What can't they produce? Does it have to be explosive? Does the energy requirements for producing something come from them or something else?

This reminds me of alchemy from Full Metal Alchemist.
