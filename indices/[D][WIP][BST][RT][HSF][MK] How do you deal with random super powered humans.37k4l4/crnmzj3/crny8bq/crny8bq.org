[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZYM_MUlBGY][Something like this is possible several times a day]]. From my watching of every mythbusters episode ever and a few other things involving explosives. I'd say that against soft squishy human targets each of those is probably lethal via shock wave to any human within a meter or three. From that perspective this stuff is a lot more lethal then guns to crowds and individuals but has inferior range, about as far as you can throw a baseball .

I suppose if you wanted to build a gun with the results though you could get by with making quite a lot of munitions though.
