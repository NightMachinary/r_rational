Uhm, magic can change anything. It's magic. It is stated they are used to buy things on an Amazon-like service, so it is conceivable the money is actually tokens for a magical process that creates goods ex nihilo and mind controls people in proportion to what an equivalent amount of money could do. Or it could just alter all those balance sheets and prevent anyone from noticing. Or alter the universe so that everyone uses Zerocash. It is magic; there is no end to the ways it could acheive this.
