I didn't assume it was limited to your own property.

Money just doesn't come from nowhere. Even magic can't change that, because money isn't a physical thing. It's a set of numbers on balance sheets. It's information agreed to by many people in many different places. Transferring billions of dollars involves getting people to agree to change those balance sheets... there's automated methods of doing that, including cash, but on this scale even cash is traceable and a lot of people spend an awful lot of energy "laundering" cash.

So...

Where does this billion dollars come from? Or rather, WHO does it come from? Why are they making this payout? How are they benefiting? What happens when the money is traced to them?

No, really, that part of it is less rational than the super powers.
