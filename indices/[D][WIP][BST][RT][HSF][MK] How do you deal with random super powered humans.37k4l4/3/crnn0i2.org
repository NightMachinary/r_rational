  For those of you in the position of the potential easy bomb creators, Say you could essentially be paid the insurance payout evaluation of any property damage for anything you personally destroy how would this change your behavior?

If I wanted to engage in insurance fraud I could already do that, so no. This is unlikely to be long-term viable... insurance markets would adjust and the folks behind these payouts would probably be treated as terrorists if they went on for any period of time.

Rationally, I don't see any incentive for that to happen. Really.
