The energy comes from the stuff the powered individuals eat with perhaps minor amounts of solar energy collected from being outside. At a spit ball I am not a perfect engineer of metabolisms but this seems viably right now to me I'd suspect they can convert food with an efficiency of about half? if that's really off lets assume it's the equivalent of double-triple the ability of humans to convert food into muscle motion but as chemical energy.

And yes they can produce some compounds like gasoline and alcohol. Although They probably would have to eat a massive buffet platter each for it to be industrially useful.
