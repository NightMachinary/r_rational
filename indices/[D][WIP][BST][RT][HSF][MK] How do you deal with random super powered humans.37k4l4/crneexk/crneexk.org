  How do you anticipate governments, authorities, civilization in general and various other groups with a vested interest in providing security to others to deal with this scenario?

Up to this point, it seems easy enough to apply the cultural detail of the 'right to bear arms', in those countries which have it (or some close equivalent), in that such people cannot be treated differently merely because they are unable to /stop/ exercising that right. There would be lawsuits galore, but for once, I suspect that the NRA and ACLU would join forces to defend the bomb-makers in question.

/This/, however, changes the incentives that such people face, and would cause all /sorts/ of fooferaw. The fact that they can create explosives isn't that big a deal - the fact that someone is willing to pay them to destroy valuable landmarks is. From at least a certain perspective, whoever set up that market and makes the payouts has effectively declared war on just about every civilized society; and the governments of those societies have every incentive to treat the marketeers as being 'enemies of all humanity' in much the way that seafaring pirates are. With some luck, then the top brass of the major nations will get together, issue a formal declaration of war, and go about the matter of working out strategies and tactics in a manner consistent with 'just war theory'. Without that luck... round-ups and pogroms will end up giving the bomb-making people every incentive to defend themselves, by blowing things up to get the money to buy the tools they need.
