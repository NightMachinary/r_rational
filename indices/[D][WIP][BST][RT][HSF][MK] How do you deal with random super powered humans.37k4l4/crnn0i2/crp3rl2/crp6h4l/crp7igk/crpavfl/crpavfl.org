So the feds stop deliveries from "the Amazon like service". And the magic has to stop up another plot hole. Why would whoever is behind this make such a bizarre scheme when it's easier to mind-control the super-beings to get a pleasure kick every time they blow something up, or just turn them all evil. It would be easier.

Basically, it's not /rational/, in the [[/r/rational/]] sense. It's narratively implausible. It's pecuniam ex machina. It's leaving the universe holding the idiot ball.

If you want a "superbeings destroy the economy in a weird way" story, make it so they can magically create exact duplicates of any object up to the mass of the food they've eaten that day. Everything that's valuable because of its rarity is suddenly commonplace. Everything that's valuable because it's hard to make is suddenly commonplace.
