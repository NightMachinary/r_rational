It's the insurance value. There's lots of properties that have excessive insurance value. /That's how insurance fraud works./ So you have a house with a book value of $100,000 that's been let run down but hasn't been revalued yet. You blow it up. You wish a new $100,000 house on the property and pocket a 10% kickback.

Nobody loses, since you're getting Magical Amazon to deliver the new property. The insurance company doesn't even have to pay out. In fact it's now rational for the insurance company to write over-valued policies on building just so they could be blown up and rebuilt. They get higher premium payments, and never have to actually write anything off.
