So now you're saying you blow up a building and get a billion dollars in gold bullion delivered to you? Or a billion dollars in whatever other commodity you want?

1. That's even less rational.

2. I can munchkin the shit out of that. Blow up a crappy old building and get my billion dollars delivered in the form of a new building on the same site. I'd go to work for a real estate company, have them buy up overvalued houses and blow them up and replace them with upgraded ones. Pity "urban renewal man" is kind of long to put on a costume.
