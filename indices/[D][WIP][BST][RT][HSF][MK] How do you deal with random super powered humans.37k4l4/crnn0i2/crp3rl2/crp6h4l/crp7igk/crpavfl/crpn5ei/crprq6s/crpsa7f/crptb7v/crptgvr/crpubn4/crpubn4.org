Why would you assume that? What does "the actual value" even mean? Is this an oracle that predicts value of selling a property? Some "fair market value" like the one insurance agencies use? Or is it some measure of expected earned income over the life of the property? Whatever you pick, someone here will be able to munchkin it, that's what [[/r/rational]] is all about. Even if it's a perfect "insurance value" oracle, I'm sure insurance companies would be happy to pay a fee to have condemned buildings they're stuck with demolished and turned into negotiable goods.
