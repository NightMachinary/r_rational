Most of what you described will essentially end up with a word and society identical to our own, with the minor different of possible ways to abuse that power to generate energy etc.

The incentive you mention in the end changes things somewhat, but to be honest not as much as it would seem. money is only worth soemthing because society says so, money cannot be untraceable as you mention unless we are dealing with reality warpers. you couldn't just make 100 million dollars, be a mutant and everyone will be like "hmm that huge building exploded a month ago and this dude suddenly has lots of free cash and is a mutant, but its probably nothing right?". moreover i don't see any reason that incentive will not cause the same issues with non-mutants. I mean the part about bullet resistance and ability to produce explosives is fairly insignificant in the grand scheme of things. if it was actually possible to destroy shit, get money for it and not get hurt in the process with any kind of positive percentage everyone will be doing it. if necessary a guy with not power will simply use a mutant to do it. because much more then the explosive or minor physical resistance what you need to pull off such crime is brains, and they would presumably still be distributed normally

so there are 2 options, either you have that reality warper, and the world governments don't actually care, which ends in complete destruction of everything, until the point money isn't actually worth anything.

Or nothing will happen, except for maybe one in a while a crazy person tries to explode shit, which is essentially pretty much what we have now anyhow.
