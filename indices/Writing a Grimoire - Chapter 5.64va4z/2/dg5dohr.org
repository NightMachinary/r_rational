Actually, someone did [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3wabss/writing_a_grimoire_chapter_4/cxvhtrp/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational][propose]] a way to test the slowed time hypothesis from the last discussion...sorta.

If it's 'slowed' in time in a way that affects the temperature, then try drawing the whole pentagram except the last line, set a corner of the paper on fire, and then draw the last line. Do this twice for the cold and hard 'spells'.

Also another interesting experiment I would like to try is to fold the paper into a rectangular prism and then draw the pentagram on one side.
