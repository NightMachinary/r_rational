this looks to be using the logical quotation style, in which punctuation marks are placed outside of quotations if they are not a literal component of the quotation itself. it seems that programmers and engineers (and other similar types) tend to independently discover this style with some regularity, and in recent years it has become widespread enough to be recognized as a legitimate variant of English writing rules in some contexts.
