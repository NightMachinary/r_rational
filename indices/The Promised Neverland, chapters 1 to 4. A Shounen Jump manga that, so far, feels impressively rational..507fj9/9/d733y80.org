I can't imagine any way the kids would escape in a rational universe, especially if they try to take other kids with them.

The obvious obstacle nÂ°1 is that the moment they go over the big prison wall, their tracker emits an alarm signal and maybe releases an anaesthetic in their bloodstream. The general problem (which has been kind of ignored by the manga so far) is that the monsters would have no reason to teach the kids any skills or knowledge that might be relevant to prison breaking.
