Starts out interesting, but I'm not sure of how far the story will have contort itself to allow the idealistic gotta-save-everyone hero and her I'll-do-everything-for-the-one-I-love sidekick some measure of success.

Every time I see this "I refuse to admit/don't care how impossible it is" bullshit I just start hoping that the hero doesn't beat the ridiculous odds for once and gets everyone killed. Will probably devolve into typical sh≈çnen fare soon enough.
