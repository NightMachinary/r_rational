My only real problem with that movie, at least from what I remember, is that the clones have that annoying "memory leak" problem that's common in stories about clones.

If clones inherit memories and skills from the original, you can clone extremely smart and knowledgeable people and use the clones to greatly increase the pool of smart and knowledgeable people you can throw at problems.

It's not an instant solution to problems, but it would mean that The Island could be a competitive scientific and medical power in its own right.
