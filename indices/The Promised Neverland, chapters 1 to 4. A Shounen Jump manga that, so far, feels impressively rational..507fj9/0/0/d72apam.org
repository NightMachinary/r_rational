I agree. They hit a good balance with the rationality.

The characters are making reasonable steps towards their goal. But they still feel reasonably human.

I just hope that the argument about [[#s][]] doesn't drag on forever. It would be way more interesting to see a "good" character accept an unpleasant truth.
