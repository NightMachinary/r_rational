Oh, good. I just re-read that fairly recently and was wondering if the author would ever finish it.

I wish fanfiction.net had an option for authors to upload an outline (or list of spoilers or some statement about where the story is going) that starts out hidden but becomes visible automatically if there are no updates for two or three years. That way, stories would at least have an ending, even if it isn't developed as well as one would like.
