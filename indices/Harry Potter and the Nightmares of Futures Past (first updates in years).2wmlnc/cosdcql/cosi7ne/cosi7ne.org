The plot diverges with canon after HBP. After years of war, Voldemord is dead, and so are most of Harry's friends. In despair he kills himself with the ritual, and his soul travels back in time and merges with 11-old Harry.

He immediately starts physical exercises, occlumency practises and DA in first year, defeating Quirell alone without any problems. He prevents Ginny from getting the diary, but fails. In book 2 he reveals himself to a friends. He saves Sirius from Azkaban early on. That's all I can recall.
