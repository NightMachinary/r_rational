(Author speaking)

Thanks, glad you like it! Out of curiosity, what are the rules things that you object to? I've been trying to stay within very strict RAW (although by "very strict", what I mean is "if it's not explicitly and unambiguously disallowed, then it's ok" :) ) If there are goofs, I'd like to fix them.
