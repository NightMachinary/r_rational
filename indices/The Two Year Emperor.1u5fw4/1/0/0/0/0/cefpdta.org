For XP on ridiculously high level encounters, the DMG has this to say:

#+begin_quote
  However, an encounter in which the PCs defeat something far above their own level (CRs higher than their level by eight or more) was probably the result of fantastic luck or a unique set of circumstances, and thus a full XP award may not be appropriate. You're going to have to make these decisions.

It's another thing that the DMG is vague on. They've still got everything done in formula though, so it would be possible to derive the values.

AD&D /did/ have explicit language stating that you couldn't gain more than one level at a time ("Once a character has points which are equal to or greater than the minimum number necessary to move upward in experience level, no further experience points can be gained until the character actually gains the new level.") but that language didn't make the jump between editions.
