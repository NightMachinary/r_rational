Ah, good point about the bard tower, I completely missed that. Thanks for pointing it out; I'll fix it. Now that I think about it, though, you don't need bards. Just jam commoners in there and have them use Aid Another. For that, a tower probably wouldn't be the best (more believable). You'd want something more like an assembly line.

As to the arenas...yep, you don't get experience for the monsters, you get experience for beating the mage that summoned them. Honestly, this is actually better -- the mage will have a higher CR than the monster.

It could also be argued that there are two other issues with the arenas:

1) You only get (at most) 1/2 XP for nonlethal combats.

2) If the DM was against you, then no XP would be awarded for a staged fight like this where there were no consequences for failure. But, if the battle consists of "beat your opponent unconscious", then there actually is something on the line, and I would rule you should get half. The RAW supports that (or, at least, does not flatly rule against it), so it works for my story.

None of these things really matters, though -- as long as you get /some/ XP, the idea works. Because it didn't matter too much, I left it out instead of going into the full fussy details.

As to the wizards leveling after the orbital bombardment...that's freaking brilliant. I definitely need to write that in. Is that actually doable? I seem to remember something in the rules that says you can't get enough experience to jump you more than one level at a time -- that you will cap out one XP short of the second level up. Even if that's so, I think it's a crock and I'm going to add it as a house rule; I'll put it in the list on chapter 10.

Thanks for reading, and for pointing all this out.
