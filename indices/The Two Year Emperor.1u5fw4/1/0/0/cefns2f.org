Mostly just the bard tower. I mean, they already point out that it doesn't work because they don't have enough bards, but:

1. Bardic music is once per day per bard level, Inspire Competence lasts two minutes max, a max level bard can therefore only Inspire Competence for 40 minutes a day (that's 3.5, in Pathfinder it's even worse - tracked in total rounds per day, usually well below a hundred)
2. Inspire Competence provides a competence bonus, and multiple competence bonuses don't stack. (An early version of the 3.0 or 3.5 DMG had [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#iounStones][ioun stones]] as being untyped bonuses instead of enhancement bonuses, which led to lots of fights within our group.)

Easy fix for that is for those things to be pointed out, it doesn't substantially change the story.

Also, by RAW in the DMG, you don't get XP for defeating summoned monsters (which happens in chapter 3):

#+begin_quote
  Do not award XP for creatures that enemies summon or otherwise add to their forces with magic powers. An enemy's ability to summon or add these creatures is part of the enemy's CR already.
#+end_quote

So defeating a summoned monster doesn't count as defeating a real monster ... though XP is one of those weird things in a setting like this, because it's normally handled under DM discretion and while there's the CR and EL charts and stuff, they don't do all that great a job of laying out concrete rules (like, for example, those wizards who killed thousands of men with their orbital bombardment - should they have jumped five levels? If you're just going by CR and EL, then probably).
