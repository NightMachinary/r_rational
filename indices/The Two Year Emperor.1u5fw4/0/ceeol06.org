I was reminded to post this by the recent post of a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1u4de0/the_tippyverse_a_dd_35_campaign_setting_where_the/][link]] to the Tippyverse on this subreddit. The antagonists in this story end up basically being the Tippyverse, and it is awesome to see that in action in the hands of a talented author.
