I heartily recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] by Alexander Wales (aka [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]). It's a deconstruction of the genre; the protagonist is isekai'd into a mishmash of all the D&D sessions he's run, including some pretty dark/spooky ones. He struggles with general surviving/world-saving, forming meaningful relationships despite the game system, and dealing with grief from both his original world and the new one.
