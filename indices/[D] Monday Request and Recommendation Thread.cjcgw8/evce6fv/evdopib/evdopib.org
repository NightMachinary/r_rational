That's a helluva throwaway for rec asks.

I've got a few - first was definitely recommended here but I'm not sure about the others.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5173610][Outside View]] by lev_aarons [LOTR] - Rational!Aragorn carries the ring to Mordor. 'nuff said.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3376361/chapters/7385021][Wayne Manor]] by Unpretty [Batman] - Extremely vibrant retelling of how Alfred Pennyworth came to work for the Waynes and a glimpse of Bruce's childhood influences. One of the best fanfictions out there, IMO. Forgot to mention that the author also has a bunch of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/440926][other stories in the DC universe]], including one that's been recommended a few times here ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6447187][Empty Graves]]), but quite a few are smuttier.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7762027/chapters/17700841][Paper Cranes]] bytenspontaneite [Hikaru no Go] - The continuation we needed to HnG (follows a kid growing up into the strategy game of Go). Edit after rereading 1st chapter: knowing canon is highly recommended. Latest chapter is always on her [[https://tenspontaneite.tumblr.com/][tumblr]].
