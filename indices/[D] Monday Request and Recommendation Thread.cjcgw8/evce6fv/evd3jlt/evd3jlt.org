I don't know how much overlap there is between this thread and the Friday one, so I guess I'll just repost:

 

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486]["I've summoned a demon for sex," she said, on the second date and the fourth martini. "It's safe as long as you don't let them talk."]]

/For The Taking/, by lintamande. It's from an established setting so there are canon answers to the questions raised, but I like it more on its own.

("Revelation" is a recent historical event where an anonymous source mass-published the summoning ritual - previously only known to a secretive few.)
