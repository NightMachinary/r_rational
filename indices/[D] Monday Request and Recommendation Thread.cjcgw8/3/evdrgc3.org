Id love some stories similar to the web novel Im A Spider, So What? ( Kumo desu ga, nani ka?)

I found the tone hilarious and the plot moved at a well enough pace for me.

Also, links to it because Ive totally lost the translation for it.

Edit: Id also like to recall a recommendation I seconded last week. A Ghost of A Chance started out quite strong but it has since devolved into philosophical self-flellagetion and introspection. The author spends too much time post the mid mark of arc 2 addressing reader concerns in 4th wall breaking introspections rather than moving the plot forward. It has totally killed the momentum of the story.

If you can stand that, the action and tinkering is well written.
