[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]] is both good and the most similar thing I have found to Kumo, especially at the start. At the star the plot is nearly identical (except subbing in spider for ant) but later on it diverges quite significantly, although it stays quality the whole time.
