[[http://forgotten.faithweb.com/MaxLandis/legit00.htm][The Shocker: Legit]] is a action-mystery story centered on the Shocker ([[https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Shocker-Marvel-Comics-Herman-Schultz-Spider-Man.jpg][this guy from Spiderman]]) that gives a beautiful depth of characterization and worldbuilding to the kind of lifestyle villains in their world have. It definitely has some degree of rationality too, though that's within the context of the kind of conceits the Marvel setting needs to exist. Very rarely talked about and shockingly funny.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31364][Demon Alchemist]] series is an AU of Fullmetal Alchemist. The series is broken up into individual books, Defiance of Reason is the first. Knowledge of FMA is recommended and you will be spoiled for its entire plot if you read it.
