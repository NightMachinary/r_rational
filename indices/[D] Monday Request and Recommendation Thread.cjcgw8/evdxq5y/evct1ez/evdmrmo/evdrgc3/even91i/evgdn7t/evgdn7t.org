[[https://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents]] - The high-quality translation of the first ~150 chapters, now dead.

[[https://turb0translation.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html]] - The low-quality translation, got much further.

[[https://rtd.moe/category/kumo-desu-ga/]] - continuation of the turbo translation, mid-quality. Caught up to the author.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Spider-What-Vol-light-novel-ebook/dp/B0723G97LX]] - the official light novel translation.

For a new reader, I'd recommend starting with the first link above, and the moving to either the light novels or the second translation.
