Damn, that was great. I love cognitohazard and AI in a box type stories, especially when they have characters and are not simply an SCP entry.

For the people wondering where it's from, the author answered in the credits that it's from a roleplaying setting called [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=115][Daevinity]], apparently by Alicorn, the writer of Luminosity. The author also gives the answer in the story's comments.

Would love it if anyone could recommend anything similar (assume that I've read everything by Alexander Wales).
