If you're in the market for young adult novels, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartimaeus_Sequence][Bartimaeus Sequence]] has wonderful demon-in-a-box negotiations.

It's impressively rational, too (besides having villains whose nefarious plans have /far/ too many moving parts). It's a delightful dance of intelligent humans responding to incentives.

e: apparently has been adapted into a graphic novel, though I cannot comment on its quality.
