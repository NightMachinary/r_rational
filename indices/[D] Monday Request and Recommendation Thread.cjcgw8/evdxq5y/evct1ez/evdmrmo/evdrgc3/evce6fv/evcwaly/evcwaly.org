Any 'meta' isekai that is not your typical OP wish fulfilment power wank? Preferably with a dark undertone that shows the reality of the situation?

[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/akuyaku-reijo-ni-koi-wo-shite/][Falling In Love With the Villainess]] is as meta as it can get.The MC is reincarnated in a fantasy world and soon realizes hes in a story driven game with all the typical plot devices one would expect. The problem is hes not the main protaganist and his benefactor is the villian. He soon finds out that the world is catering to the main protaganist and any feeble attempts to kill her goes south in her favor.
