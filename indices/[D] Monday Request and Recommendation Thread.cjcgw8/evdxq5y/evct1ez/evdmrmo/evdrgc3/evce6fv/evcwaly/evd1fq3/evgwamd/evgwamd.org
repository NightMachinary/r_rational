Aside from the obvious, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], I have an entire recommendation list on this topic for you! Well, the part about having meta-awareness about being in a story. Not all of them are about being put into a story. Some are story characters who are somewhat aware of being in a story.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]] - a girl wakes up with Gamer powers with the classic abilities to level up and increase stats. It has the twist that she's an eroge gamer rather than the classic RPG gamer and she actually takes the time to question and investigate why she has these powers instead of taking them for granted unlike the protagonists of other gamer stories. You need an account on QuestionableQuesting to read it, but it's free and quick to set up.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Thursday-Next-Novel-Book/dp/B00WKNLISI][A Thursday Next Novel]] - a seven book series where people know they are characters in a story and act as if they are living real lives with the ability to move from story to story. Thursday Next is a Special Operative in literary detection who needs to rescue kidnapped literary characters.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-novels-extra][The Novel's Extra]] - Author is sucked into his own unfinished story of a modern heroic fantasy world to fight monsters and humans.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/trash-of-the-counts-family][Trash of the Count's Family]] - Reader is sucked into the story of a medieval Asian high fantasy world to survive a coming war and he only read the first five volumes.

[[https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/][Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]] - Reader is living through a game-like apocalypse where he read the entire series, but there were numerous unanswered questions about the original story.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts][Redshirts by John Scalzi]] - What if you discover you're in a story and you're just a side character with the usual side character's life span?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] - A D&D character is translated into the HP universe, and operates using his knowledge of narrative logic as well as D&D rules.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping_with_the_Girls][Sleeping With The Girls]] - An intended deconstruction of the self-insert where the protagonist is constantly jumping to a new story world every time he falls asleep.

I tried to find an appropriate tv tropes page that relates to being aware of being in a story with story conventions, but the closest I found was [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness][Medium Awareness]]. However it's usually used as a one-off gag rather than being consistently applied throughout a story.
