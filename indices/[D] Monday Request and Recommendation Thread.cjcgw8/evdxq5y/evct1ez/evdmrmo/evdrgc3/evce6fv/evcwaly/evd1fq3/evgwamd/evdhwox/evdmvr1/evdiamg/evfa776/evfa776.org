Worm fanfic [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/worm-going-native.17415/][Going Native]] was the best one (within the Worm fandom) I've ever found. he Main character reconizes Earth Bet is a deathworld, and realistically speaking he has no way to guarantee its survival, unless he makes absolutely certain not to interfere with what happened in canon.\\
Also he doesn't have any setting-breaking superpowers, he triggered the hard way with something useful but not amazing.
