Anyone here read The Expanse? I'm new to this reddit, so not really sure if it falls under Rational Fiction but it seems like it would. It does a wonderful job of thinking through the implications of technologies, politics and human condition within the context if the story.

Curious to read what people think. Also looking for recommendation of similar sci-fi as I have read through all the core novels.
