What are your hidden gems? Stories you loved that for some reason don't get enough attention. I have checked almost everything recommended here -- including all previous recommendation threads -- and am looking for great works I might have missed.

I'll take anything, but my preferences are: fanfiction or manga, 10k < size < 200k, fast-paced, not romance nor comedy focused, competent/mature protagonist and if not rational, at least realistic. It can be from any fandom, including crossovers, and I don't mind trigger warnings and incomplete stories.

Two recs of my own that satisfy most of the above conditions are:

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307390/1/Heliocentrism][Heliocentrism]] (Naruto, 15k, dead?) -- unique take on The Gamer, where Minato was born as the gamer and interprets the world accordingly. Cannon knowledge unnecessary.
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10225110/1/Servant-of-Zero][Servant of Zero]] (Fate/Familiar of Zero, 31k, dead) -- best characterization of EMIYA I've ever seeing. Archer summoned to FoZ universe. Fate knowledge helpful.
