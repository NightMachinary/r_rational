Over the weekend I found [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25962/cultivating-earth][Cultivating Earth]], and so far it's /super good/.

The setup is very basic Xianxia (cultivate the energy of the heavens, get power), but the story's set on actual modern-day Earth, post-breakdown of a formation that was keeping all of that delicious Qi away from us.

The newly-immortal cultivator who's responsible feels kinda bad in a karmic way, and so he starts teaching cultivation to select people of Earth.

IMO what makes this really cool is that (from what I can tell so far) the system of cultivation is particularly well fleshed out under the hood, and the various cultivators involved are fairly scientific in their exploration of it (for a bunch of mystics, at least). After all, they now have a blank slate to paint on, which means starting from ground zero when it comes to teaching cultivation to us Earthlings.
