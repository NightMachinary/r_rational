Hoo boy. It's definitely a book. If we call it "social fiction" in analogy with "science fiction," then the corresponding piece of science fiction would be one of those books where a mad scientist makes a bunch of miraculous inventions that all have cool sound effects and flashing lights. You don't read that book to worry about how exactly the lightning cannon stores and shoots lightning. You read the book because you think the lightning cannon sounds cool.

This is how it is for the future social games described lovingly and at great length in the book. When the narrator spends five pages talking alternately about gender and about how in the future it's transgressive to talk about gender, you've gotta be on board with thinking those pages are interesting, because if it doesn't have that mad-science appeal to you, the book is probably not for you.
