I don't have time to give a more thorough recommendation, but this is one of my (15) favorite books. In many ways it isn't very rationalist, but I expect rationalists to like it, especially if they have a fondness for more literary-style works and appreciate beauty in prose.

Beyond that, the series includes an interesting and complex utopia, some thoughtful philosophy, and an inspiring representation of transhumanist ideals that I haven't found anywhere else (except for HPMOR, of course).

I want to sort of counter [[/u/Charlie___][u/Charlie___]]'s point. I don't think I would read the book if my only exposure was that comment and the impression that some people like the book a lot, and yet I've read the book a bunch of times and consider it a favorite. If I get a chance I'll come back and say more about why.
