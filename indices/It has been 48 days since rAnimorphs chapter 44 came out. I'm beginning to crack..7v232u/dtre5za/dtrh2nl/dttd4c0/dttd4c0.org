Would you rather fight 100 visser three-sized ducks, or one duck-sized visser three?

Assume that Visser Three is controlling the body of a duck that is not currently morph-capable. He is not allowed to leave the duck, nor is he allowed time to plan.

The ducks are the size of the visser's andalite body. They are also hungry.
