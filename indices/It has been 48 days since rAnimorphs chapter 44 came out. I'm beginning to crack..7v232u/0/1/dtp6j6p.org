But then you might never experience some great stories because the fact is many of them will never be finished (fanfiction and other online stories especially). I think the best way to read them is to just enjoy each chapter for what it's worth. Or being a bit more sardonic: adapt ratfic tenet #1 to "neatly wrapped endings don't happen solely because the plot requires it."
