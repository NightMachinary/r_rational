Mostly. It's more that two of the things that help most with SAD, sleeping proper hours and exercising, eat up so much of my writing time. I've been sort of cutting into my sleeping time once again, which I think has paid dividends in terms of output but definitely also starts to show up in my mood; I'll be more comfortable doing that as the days start to get longer. I wouldn't say that I'm suffering from SAD now, more that I'm chafing under the treatments.

But the other thing is that I've just been writing longer chapters, and grouping those chapters together, which makes it seem like less writing. I wrote 12,000 words in the last 8 days, which is 1,500 words per day, and (IMO) would look more impressive as 3,000 word chapters every other day than what it's going to be, which is probably three +5,000 word chapters a few days from now.

As for why /that's/ been happening, it's partly that I like to group things by their plot beats, and those plot beats have gotten longer, and it's partly that added complexity means that I want to have more time to think about (and edit) things after they're written. Might change after the current book is done and there's a different subject that gets a different treatment?

(Stephen King has said that you should never spend longer than a season writing a book, because your writing will naturally change with the seasons and the things you wanted to capture will shift in your head, and there might be some of that going on too.)
