You know, I was getting kind of antsy because I'd gone more than a week without updating /Worth the Candle/, but that sort of puts it in perspective.

(The last /A Song of Ice and Fire/ book came out 2399 days ago, and it's been 1769 days since the second book in the /Kingkiller Chronicles/ series was released, if that helps further put wait times in perspective.)
