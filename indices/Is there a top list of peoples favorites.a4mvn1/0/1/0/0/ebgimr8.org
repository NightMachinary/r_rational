I'd actually mark Unsong as being on the far "soft" end of soft-hard magic spectrum. A lot of it is glued together from different ideas that the author had and wanted to exist in the same world, rather than natural outgrowths of a rules-based system or much coherent logic.

Edit: Just to be clear the "every idea the author had" thing was explicitly posted to Scott's tumblr some time ago, when Unsong was running. I can't find it now, partly because tumblr sucks for searching, partly because Scott increased the privacy settings to require login. A link/quote would be appreciated, if someone has more time/dedication/patience to find one.
