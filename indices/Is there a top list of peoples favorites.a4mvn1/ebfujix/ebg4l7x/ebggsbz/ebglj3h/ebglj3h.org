There are lots of fantasy novels that have consistent logic and magic, and stick to them. Unsong starts off that way but quickly breaks down into effectively random events that are not even in principle predictable.

If you want actual rational and consistent magic, I'd start with the Lord Darcy stories which include actual legitimate by-the-rules mysteries.
