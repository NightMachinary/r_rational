I like unsong, and I think there's something appealing-to-rational-fic-fans about the way it pokes fun at stuff and about the way some of its characters think. But it really isn't very consistent or predictable at all.

Whenever a character is doing advanced kabbalah magic (stuff sohu or uriel can do), you just have to roll with whatever they say is possible.

All the kabbalistic reasoning is really there to make the meta-textual point that you can connect the dots for just about anything when the space of connections you're searching through gets big enough. You can't use it to /actually/ make predictions about what will happen in the story.

Placebomancy is based off of narrative logic, but that really just means the author can do whatever they want and then say "hey, this was a narrative, so it worked".
