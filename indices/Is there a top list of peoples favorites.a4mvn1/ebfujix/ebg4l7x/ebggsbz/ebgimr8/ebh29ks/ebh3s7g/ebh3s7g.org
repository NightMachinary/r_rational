No, it was specifically an acknowledgement that Unsong itself was every story idea he'd ever had (paraphrasing, because obviously I don't have the source). It would have been posted to tumblr after Unsong started, but before it completed.

If you gathered up all of the component parts of Unsong that had appeared in previous blog posts (either LJ, tumblr, or his blog), I think you'd have something like half the book, maybe more, if you're just counting kernels.

Not that I think there's anything /wrong/ with putting a whole bunch of previous ideas together, but in the case of /Unsong/, I felt like the whole was less than the sum of its parts (for a variety of reasons).
