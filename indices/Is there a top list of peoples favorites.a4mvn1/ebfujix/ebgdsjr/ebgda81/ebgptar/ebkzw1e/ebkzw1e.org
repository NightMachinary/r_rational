I've heard the wish-fulfillment criticism before but it never seemed right to me, and I've just figured out why. Kvothe isn't an everyman protagonist whose shoes you're meant to step into. He's a hero, an archetype, a force of nature. When Kvothe has mind-blowing awesome sex with Felurian, that's not because Kvothe is the vehicle for the reader's wish-fulfillment, it's because he's the foil for the reader's own capabilities. We're not meant to empathize with him. We're meant to be slapped in the face by his alien nature. It's not titillating except in the sense that watching a tornado is titillating. It's mostly just fucking cool.
