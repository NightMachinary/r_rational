Patrick Rothfuss has an incredible writing style where the words just flow so smoothly. Whilst I agree on the wish-fulfillment, it also has great world-building and the magical system of sympathy is very rational.

The fact that the writing style got the books so freaking popular whilst having all easily identified glaring problems just shows that Rothfuss could write a book about paint drying and have it be wonderful.
