Unsong is fantasy, but as far as fantasy goes, it has pretty consistent logic and magic. You could say the same of HPMoR, or even some sci-fi stuff: after all, the only fully consistent scientific and technological system we know is our own. Start introducing new rules, there's bound to be /some/ contradiction at some level, unless you worked them all out from a theory of everything. Usually we settle for the rules as stated to be more or less consistent, we don't go much into meta-rules, meta-meta-rules, etc.
