I agree it's not predictable and doesn't fit the "the reader could guess what will happen next" mold. However it does have a lot of philosophy and tinkering with concepts from maths and programming in it. I'm still pretty awed by its answer to theodicy, for example. Let's put it this way, it may be an edge case at best, and not purely 'rational', but calling it 'anti-rational' seems really like a stretch to me. It makes it sound like it's actively going out of its way to be /the opposite/ of rational, which I really don't think it does.
