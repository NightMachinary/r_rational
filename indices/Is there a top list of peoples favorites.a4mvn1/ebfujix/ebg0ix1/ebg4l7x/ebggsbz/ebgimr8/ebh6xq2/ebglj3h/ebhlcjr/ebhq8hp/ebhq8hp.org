I mean... okay, but I'd be surprised if it turned out that GR and QM 'just work' and don't actually agree with each other or an underlying theory at any scale :D. I'm not even sure how that could possibly /work/. What would happen if I try make an experiment at the Planck scale? The Universe crashes to a BSOD due to overflow?
