I quite disagree with your criticisms for several reasons. First and foremost, you're looking at it through the wrong lens; you're looking at it as a Harry Potter hero triumphs over adversity kind of story when really it's a tragedy and will end tragically. You have a hero that's really good at most things obviously and repeatedly fuck himself over through arrogance, anger, and recklessness. The triumphs /are setting him up for a fall/.

​

As for sympathy; you lump three criticisms together: simple, boring, and childish. Simple it is, but that's not a bad thing, especially not for rationalists. Complexity frequently brings contradiction, railroading, and plot holes. Neither are intrinsically indicative of good or bad writing; you're merely stating a preference for complexity. Boring and Childish are subjective, although I would say that the primary attribute of childish world-building is that they tend not to think about consequences of their world-building decisions and that has not happened here.

​

As for the scene where one character gets three others drunk and rambling about magic, you were paying attention to the wrong hand in the shell game. Yes it serves as another explanation for the reader, but the thing that makes the scene interesting is not the young blowhards rambling, it's the questions the young lady is asking. She's looking for something, and doesn't really get it from asking them.

​

As for alchemy, it's heavily foreshadowed that it will be used again, multiple times. It's also the skill that Kvothe is teaching Bast.

​

As for examples of writing skill, Rothfuss is excellent at foreshadowing, including a major plot point in slant rhyme in a joking poem or in the dismissive comment of a professor. He uses of metanarrative to create both characterization and make you question the reliability of the narrator. He repeatedly uses names to make jokes about the characters. He uses multiple foils of the main character, as tragedies do, to show different potential paths. He uses constructed etymology to reveal world-building choices. As jokes or characterization, sometimes characters will break into different rhythms or speak in one case speak entirely in iambic pentameter.
