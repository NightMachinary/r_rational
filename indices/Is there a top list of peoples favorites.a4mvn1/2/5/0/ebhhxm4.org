Thank you, this is much more similar to my own view of the series, the most important part of the story, that everyone seems to forget, is that we already know the ending, Kote is a innkeeper in a tiny inn in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere, if everything that happens in the books is true, and Kvothe is reliably narrating, then how does he get here, with everyone having assumed his death and him just standing around waiting for them to be right? The tragedy is coming, but what is it? How will Kvothe fail? I want to know!
