I think [[http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-751][this review]] of Rothfuss' work is pretty good at taking apart his writing from a similar point of view to yours, but with extensive textual support and more examples, to really hammer home the ways Rothfuss becomes unappealing. I mostly agree with the author of that review - the first book showed promise, and the second was so bad that it demonstrated that all of the promise of the first was actually never going to go anywhere good and therefore actively removed enjoyment retroactively.
