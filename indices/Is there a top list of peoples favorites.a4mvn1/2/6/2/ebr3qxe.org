Everyone loves to be contrarian and there are valid complaints about the books. However, they are very widely loved and one of the most popularly recommended series over at [[/r/Fantasy]]. People pine for the third book in the series and, as you can probably tell from the discussion that the criticism generated, it isn't the popular opinion on the book. The books are very well written in that they are engaging and the characters are addicting to read. But many characters, especially the main character and his love interest, are deeply flawed people, which is why some people like to shit on it as bad characters.
