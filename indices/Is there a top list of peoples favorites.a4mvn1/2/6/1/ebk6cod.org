Listen, some of the criticism is valid, the book is not perfect, and the some way people talk about it makes you think it would be.

But there is a reason why thousands of people have bothered the author about the upcoming third book, Doors of Stone. There is a reason why people are willing to spend the time trashing the book.

The sign of a bad book is that nobody reads it, and you can't say that about the Kingkiller chronicles.

If you come into the series with no expectations, I guarantee you will enjoy the first book. The second is deeply flawed but the first book is very fun, very creative, and with a truly unique writing style.
