I think you read this series much more recently than me, but what I liked what the 3rd layer deep stories.

The 1st layer is old Kvothe, 2nd is old Kvothe telling his story about young Kvothe, 3rd layer is young Kvothe hearing/telling a story about something else. When Kvothe hears the story in the bar, from Skarpi (?), about the war (about the Chandrian) that happened eons ago it feels like something incredibly important. To all other characters in the story, it's just a fun story, but to Kvothe and the reader it reveals a fundamental truth about what their world is really like. Even when Kvothe tells silly short stories to his friends, you feel like you get a feel for his own morality and some understanding about his view of the world.
