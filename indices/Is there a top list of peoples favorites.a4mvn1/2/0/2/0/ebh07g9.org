Not to make excuses as I mostly agree with your, but it is made clear several times that the story we're reading and the story that chronicler is hearing is not the same. Also it wouldn't make sense to explain it directly to chronicler, who is an actual graduate of the University.

And I like the magic system. Of all the faults the books have, sympathy is not one of them, imo.
