Who voted for king killer chronicles to be so high up? Those books are utter trash. Probably the most infuriatingly bad, childish storylines I've read in a fantasy novel.

Good-at-everything prodigal child attends magic school. All the women want him, all the men want to be him. Constantly pining for and worshipping the manic pixie girl. Only temporarily fails at anything in order to set up how brilliant he is at coming back from any setback.

It's like someone wrote a bad wish fulfillment fanfiction of an already bad fanfiction of an amateur story comprised entirely of every tired, overused, terrible fantasy trope. And then combined that with [[/r/iamverysmart]] and [[/r/niceguys]].

What a pile of dog crap aspiring to be a dumpster fire.
