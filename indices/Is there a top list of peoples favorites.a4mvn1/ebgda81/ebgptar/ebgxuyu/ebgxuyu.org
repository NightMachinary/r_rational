Can you give me one example of his supposed good world building or writing style? I can give dozens of examples of his story and world building and style of writing being utter trash.

Sympathy is juvenile and simple to the point of being insulting to the reader. I've never read a system of magic as boring and childish.

The worst part of it is the multiple pages of dialogue in the music bar between kvothe's group and the manic pixie girl where they explain in excruciating detail to pixie girl (actually to the reader, which is the insulting part) how sympathy works. A classic shitty style of writing where the author forgot the "show, don't tell" rule and just explains his whole magic system in a long diatribe. Just awful. The insulting part is that he thinks the reader is too stupid to understand it without this long dialogue. The entire sympathy magic is summed up in two sentences:

Use willpower to cause an effect on something which causes the same effect on a similar item. The higher the similarity between your piece and the target piece, and the closer together they are, the easier it is to cause the effect to the target piece.

That's it. It's the sort of magic system a middle schooler comes up with and thinks is really innovative. It's boring, simple, and juvenile.

The only magic in the book that seems complex and neat is alchemy. And Rothfuss just uses it as a one time Deux ex Machina for Kvothe to solve some temporary setback, and then Rothfuss literally, LITERALLY, has one of his secondary characters make Kvothe say, out loud, the exact sentence "I know nothing about alchemy" in order to cop out of having to explain anything about alchemy in his story. Then Rothfuss has Kvothe relay that exact sentence to the Chronicler in order to get it into the book that the reader is holding, as insurance against the reader calling out Rothfuss about anything to do with alchemy in the story.

Rothfuss is directly telling the reader that he's using alchemy to solve a plot point and is never going to explain anything about it.

But spends loads of screen time explaining his basic bitch magic directly to the reader instead of just showing how it works. Because obviously the reader is too stupid to get it without the dialogue crammed in there.

And it's so ham-fisted. Rothfuss could have had Kvothe explain to the Chronicler directly how sympathy works, cutting out the thin, insulting veil, but instead has Kvothe relay a long, irrelevant section of dialogue to the Chronicler. It has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the story he's telling. It's not like he doesn't skip over massive relevant details in other parts of his story. So why include such an idiotic dialogue about his basic bitch magic?
