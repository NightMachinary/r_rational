It's actually completely the opposite. When Kvothe first agrees to tell the story, it's on the condition that the Chronicler record exactly what Kvothe says word for word and nothing more or less. Otherwise he won't tell his story. Rothfuss spends a fair bit of dialogue to establish that EVERYTHING you are reading is coming straight from Kvothe's mouth. Including the fucking cliffhangers at the ends of each chapter. Which is ok writing, but makes no fucking sense considering it's not just what Rothfuss is writing, but what kvothe is literally telling the Chronicler.
