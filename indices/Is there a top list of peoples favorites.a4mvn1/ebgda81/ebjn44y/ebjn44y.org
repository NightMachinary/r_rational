  Maybe instead of looking for why the kingkillers are trash, you might look at what about the community makes them so well regarded stories? I could list a couple dozen reasons why I like the kingkiller saga, despite and sometimes because, as you say them using several old patterns.

  Those reasons won't mean anything to you except as anecdotal information, but I do have an example of similarity that might be useful: the tale of 1001 nights is a frame narrative, and the king-killer chronicles uses a similar exploit, both to suspend disbelief and with naming, narrativium, and and honest distrust of the narrator in light of the former, his opponents, and his plight to keep you guessing. I'm still unsure if its playing any deeper than 1.5 levels, but it does keep you guessing.
