I always enjoy the sections that focus on Flicker being awesome, so this is right up my alley.

It's nice to see that Hermes can learn...I wonder, would he have gotten the message if she had said to him "Look, the next time you cause trouble we're going to do this again, but next time I'm not going to bother being so careful and you're going to end up a lot more injured. The time after /that/, I'm just going to rip you in half. If you get summoned or otherwise end up outside the Box, don't cause trouble. Okay?"
