First (hopefully) weekly update on my arguably kinda rational game engine project.

--------------

The Tesseract Engine (WIP name) is a game engine / editor heavily inspired by Minecraft and LittleBigPlanet. The aim of the project is to use the features popularized by Minecraft (click on something to place it / destroy it) to provide an editor that needs almost no introduction or tutorials. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t32OHPtbsFtlOi70zNL5RrwwPbuZhkBHfZbRScFcrhg/edit?usp=sharing][You can read the full Game Design Document here]].

My goal making this project, is to build the game editor that I would like to use. I will try to give forms to all the ideas and the design philosophies that I miss in other editors, and build this project around them.

These philosophies are the closest in this project to being "rational". They're inspired in part by the general culture of epistemology of communities like [[/r/rational][r/rational]], and in part by my own experience using game engines and other computer tools.

That's it for presentation. I said I was going to give a month-long timeline, but I don't think I can do that yet. I will try to complete the GDD before next Friday, and write up a more complete presentation then (which I will send to other places, including school teachers, [[/r/gamedev][r/gamedev]] and my personal blog). From then I'm hoping I will spend way more time organizing ideas and way more time implementing them.

In the meantime, I would really really appreciate any questions, remarks on nitpicks you can send me.

--------------

I'm honestly surprised I made it in time. I mean, I cut a lot of content to make it (as attested by the huge "To be added next time" chapter") and I did not proofread anything, but it's still a pleasant surprise. I realize I was kind of expecting myself to fail silently here.

I'll try to post an update every week before Friday 10pm Seoul time (9am EST, 6am PST, 1pm GMT). I'd also appreciate, as a commitment mechanism, any people who could promise to bomb me with messages and reminders should I fail these deadlines.
