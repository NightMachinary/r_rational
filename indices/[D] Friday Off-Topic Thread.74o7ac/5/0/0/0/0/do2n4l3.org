I'm not sure I get what you're saying.

I'm not trying to build the Primordial Logical Interface of Intuitiveness; I just think most editors on the market are systemically missing some huge potential, and I can do better by tapping that potential. I can say that confidently, while I couldn't say "I can make a better programming language than what's out there" or "I can make a better OS API".

But yeah, I'm not trying to build the perfect tool to build the perfect game; I mean, I also plan to make lots of games on that tool, because it's what it's for, but building a good tool that gets used by people is also its own reward.

EDIT: To clarify, when I said "every editor out there is flawed", I didn't mean "So I'm gonna make an editor that has no flaws". I meant that I've seen specific flaws in existing editors; like, specific metrics where I think editors do poorly; and I think I can do way better by focusing on those metrics. See [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t32OHPtbsFtlOi70zNL5RrwwPbuZhkBHfZbRScFcrhg/edit#heading=h.su4ldcbhyjmn][Editor Philosophy]] for actual details (keeping in mind that part is WIP).

Yeah, I should probably keep that in mind.
