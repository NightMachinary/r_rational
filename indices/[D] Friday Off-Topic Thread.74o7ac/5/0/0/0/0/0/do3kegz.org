I've seen far too many people go down this road before, and I can see the train-wreck coming. Save yourself a lot of grief. Please listen to our advice.

  building a good tool that gets used by people is also its own reward

No one will use the tool unless you do. Which means you have to build a game.

  I also plan to make lots of games on that tool, because it's what it's for

Do that first. It's really, /really/, hard to build an editor and then build a game. Build the game first, and build an editor that is particularly well-suited for building that game as you go. After a few iterations of this process, you'll know better how to build a general purpose editor.
