  heavily inspired by Minecraft and LittleBigPlanet

The GDD continually references Minecraft, in the sense of "should be like Minecraft". This leaves me wondering: how does the vision diverge from Minecraft? What is the purpose, and why can't it be achieved by modding an existing game engine?

It almost looks like you have in mind something you'd like to build, and you think this is the way to do it. Is that the case? And if so, can you tell us what it is you really want to make?
