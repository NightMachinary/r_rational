You do realize the whole "friendship system" thing isn't going to work? As in, it's not that you system needs a few major tweaks or new tools; it's that you're going to rebuild your system from the ground up again and again and you'll never get good social interactions out of it.

I say that at the risk of making of an ass of myself if you did test it and get good results out of it, but... I really doubt it. I'd be pretty surprised if you got more from it than a few interesting-but-awkward conversations that don't go anywhere.

I wish I knew how to explain this better, but by making this kind of system, you're trying to fit square pegs in round holes *hard*. It reminds me of the kind of teacher who makes a super-convoluted marking scale for your dissertation, that notes you on your grammar, whether you respected the three-parts paragraph structure presented in class, whether you use the different argumentative methods presented in class, whether you include all the different keywords... basically, the teacher tries to make a super rigid scale that covers all these formulas, but ultimately cares little for whether the dissertation made any sense.

In a healthy relationship, the exact structure of interactions doesn't matter as much as the information exchanged, how interesting it is, how often you talk, etc. Improving the structure doesn't improve the metrics that matter, and often hurts them.
