I'm... going to do the trainwreck thing and keep going anyway. In that optic, do you have advice on how I can make a burnout less likely?

I agree that, using outside view reasoning, this project seems extremely worrying. And some of these outside view reasons worry me with an inside view too; I think the scope is way larger than I'm comfortable with, and I'm worried that I might get disgusted as I become aware of the project's flaws mid-development.

On the other hand, I think I can avoid some obstacles common to large scale amateur game projects; I think the major problem unexperienced game designers run into is massive overconfidence; I definitely had that feeling from my teammates (and from other groups) back when this was a school project. I'm spending a lot of time planning out what features I will need, to avoid being blindsided by the "I implemented 90% of the game design document and the project still feels 5% done" effect.

Now that I'm writing this, I realize that I have done very little research so far, and most of the design has been me thinking things through. I should probably look for and contact someone with experience designing editors.

  Build the game first

I have done, I am doing and will keep doing that. I've coded small game engines and small games before, I've worked with Unity, and I'm working on a mid-sized Unity game project right now. I... don't think I have the experience you think I need, but I'm not willing to wait. Though I'm totally going to do design by iteration, I don't know if that count for something or if it's just me trying to reassure myself.

I did plan to work on multiple games to stress-test the engine as I'm developing it; I should probably emphasize that a lot in the GDD and other stuff, now that you remind me, because it's the kind of thing you can easily delay. (sure, I'll make games when the engine is done!)

Thanks for your feedback.
