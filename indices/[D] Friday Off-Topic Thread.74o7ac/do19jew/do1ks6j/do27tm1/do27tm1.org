  It almost looks like you have in mind something you'd like to build
#+end_quote

I think this is mostly it, and the vision I have doesn't show in the document yet, because there are key points I didn't mention.

I don't want to sound weaselly, because those are really good questions and don't want to be like "Oh, all will be answered in time", but some of the answers /are/ pretty long and will take me a few days to write.

  how does the vision diverge from Minecraft?
#+end_quote

My main gripe with Minecraft is, it's a game engine first, a bunch of features second, and a game editor third.

The features you can access in Minecraft-the-editor are all one step removed from features of Minecraft-the-survival-game. There are non-survival features (resource packs, command blocks, function files), but they're a second thought; Minecraft's creative mode isn't a coherent experience, is a bunch of features stacked on previously existing stuff. So for instance, if you want to make a Sim-City like game, you can, but you're going be working with tools, a UI and mechanics mostly intended for a survival game.

  why can't it be achieved by modding an existing game engine?
#+end_quote

I'm on the fence on this. I think part of it is arrogance; I want the engine to be mine from the ground up, because in a way I believe that everything will be better if I made it.

But yeah, I want a great degree of control; I'd like to use a custom-made lighting and shading system, for one.

#+begin_quote
  And if so, can you tell us what it is you really want to make?
#+end_quote

Basically, my mission statement goes something like this: I think every game editor I've worked with, like Unity, Hammer, Minecraft and Game Maker, as well as non-game editors (by which I mean stuff like Word or Powerpoint or Photoshop) is flawed in specific, systematic ways. I'll touch on what exactly I mean later, but basically feature creep, assuming the user knows how to use everything, and a lack of imagination.

I think I can make a better, more intuitive, faster-to-use game editor by identifying and avoiding these flaws.
