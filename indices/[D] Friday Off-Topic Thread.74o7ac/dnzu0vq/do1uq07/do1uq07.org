  quantum computing still very difficult (scientists have created stable universal quantum computing up to ~10 qbits so far, and from what I've read quantum computing isn't a replacement for traditional computing anyway)

This is correct. We're still far away from actually getting the hardware to scale in a reliable way, and even when we do, the speedup isn't likely to be universally useful. It /is/ going to be useful for running simulations of quantum systems, so at least we can hope to design better hardware that exploits quantum effects. Maybe we'll see some sort of positive feedback loop there.
