To be honest, I'm not particularly worried about moore's law in the mid term. I very much doubt we'll keep to the original time frame (double the speed every 18 months), but the general idea of sticking to exponential improvement instead of linear or even logistic will likely stick around because there are just so many alternate paths we can take other than regular silicon wafers. They're all unfeasible right now for some reason or another, but with the right impetus you can bet we'll adopt them. Plus, as our ability to program gets better, we'll have better tools to develop the tools we need to develop the tools we need to build the chips, and so on. A sort of soft-singularity.
