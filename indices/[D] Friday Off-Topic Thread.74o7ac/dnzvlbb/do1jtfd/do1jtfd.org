I honestly don't care about the lackluster season end just because of the freaking masterpiece that was episode 7. When the second Simple Rick's ad came on and it was revealed exactly how depraved that company was, I said Holy Shit out loud, which I never do. The Stalinist takeover by Evil Morty was played amazingly well. You almost wanted to trust him in the beginning even though you knew this universe, knew these writers, and knew that something was going to go terribly wrong. And the end, with the victims' bodies floating out into space away from the Citadel, Ricks and Morties casually destroyed with no care taken for the differences between them, just left me speechless.

They managed to take a silly comedy show about defying tropes and turn it into something that felt brutally real. It was totally awesome, and I hope they do more like it.
