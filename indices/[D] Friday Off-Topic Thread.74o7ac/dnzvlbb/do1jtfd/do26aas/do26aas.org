I didn't think the political commentary was that clever (not that I expected it to be). I mean, the whole thing boiled down to "Politicians are assholes and sometimes they pretend to be nice but they're actually evil" which doesn't really feel new or insightful. But it the storytelling itself was top notch.

(also, as soon as the council of shadowy real-world-inspired behind-the-scene Citadel leaders started, I though "Oh man he's going to kill them all even though that makes no sense because they should have deadman switches, isn't he?")

The Simple Rick 2.0 reveal was pretty great.
