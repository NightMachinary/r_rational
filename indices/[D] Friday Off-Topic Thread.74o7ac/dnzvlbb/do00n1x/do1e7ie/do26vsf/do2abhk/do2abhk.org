I honestly do recommend the show. It is painfully nihilistic at times and lacking in emotional payoff, but it's damn funny and has some of the most imaginative stories I've ever seen. Even the social satire, while not always good, works brilliantly when it hits the mark.

There are plenty of parts of the show I don't like, but it has still given me stories unlike anything I've ever seen that nearly always leave me with interesting ideas I wanted to discuss with other people. I don't think it's a masterpiece like some people do, but it's still worth watching.
