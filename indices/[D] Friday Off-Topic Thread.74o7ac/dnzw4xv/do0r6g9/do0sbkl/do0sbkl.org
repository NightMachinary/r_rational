  You do realize the whole "friendship system" thing isn't going to work?

I did say that it was "defunct".

  I'd be pretty surprised if you got more from it than a few interesting-but-awkward conversations that don't go anywhere.

Well, it depends on what you count as "going somewhere". Do several pseudofriendships, each of which lasted for many months and included several hundred questions (with corresponding answers), count as "going somewhere"? Pseudofriendship 1 lasted for 600 questions, 2 lasted for 500 questions, and 6 included a whopping 1300 questions (in two series that were separated by a hiatus; [[https://pastebin.com/q016vjxE][the list of seven hundred questions linked above]] comprises most of the first of those series).

On the other hand, as I noted above, familiarity bred contempt (on both sides).
