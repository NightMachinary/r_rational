I'm not too interested in resuscitating my [[https://i.imgur.com/rWBpQkT.png][defunct]] pseudofriendship system*, as [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/familiarity_breeds_contempt][familiarity bred contempt]] in every instance. I feel somewhat disappointed, though, that I never managed to improve it significantly**. Even though Pseudofriendships 7 and 8 were conducted through Reddit's excellent messaging system rather than through Facebook's pitiful one, I failed in those two conversations to take advantage of the ability to link to individual messages, and instead continued to adhere rigidly to the link-free thread-numbering system that I originally had devised to make searching Facebook's messages possible***.

***Amazingly, the search function in Facebook's messaging system seems to have gotten /even worse/ that it used to be, as searching for a number with it now returns /zero/ results.
