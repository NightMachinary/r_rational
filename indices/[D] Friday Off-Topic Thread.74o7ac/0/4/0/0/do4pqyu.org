  A completable goal would be acceptable, it just leads to the same problem once it's done.
#+end_quote

Noted. A temporary, as compared to a permanent solution. (Hmmm... but a means of generating an arbitrary number of completable goals would also serve as a permanent solution, I guess).

#+begin_quote
  It doesn't strictly /have/ to have a significant net positive for humanity, I would just feel guilty ignoring all the world's considerable problems.
#+end_quote

I don't think that trying to fit the word 'significant' in there is a good idea at all; down that road lies working yourself to poor health.

However, I think that your other comments here have cleared some things up further, while leaving a single great big gaping hole in your question.

In short; you're looking for happiness_2 (could this perhaps be satisfaction?)

So, then, the immediate question is - how do you define happiness_2? Where have you felt (or not felt) happiness_2 before?
