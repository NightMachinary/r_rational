  Noted. A temporary, as compared to a permanent solution. (Hmmm... but a means of generating an arbitrary number of completable goals would also serve as a permanent solution, I guess).

Yes, that would work.

  I don't think that trying to fit the word 'significant' in there is a good idea at all; down that road lies working yourself to poor health.

What I meant was closer to "an ethically-acceptable portion of how much good I might optimally do if I devoted my life solely to the betterment of humanity" than significant on an absolute scale.

Happiness_2 is really hard to define. The difference between happiness_1 and happiness_2 is like the difference between eating candy and having a meal. A meal is better for you and more satisfying, but in a moment to moment sense candy is more enjoyable.

I want a life worth living, something I won't regret 10+ years later. I want to have things in my life worth pursuing, that are fulfilling and not just enjoyable in the moment but ultimately unsatisfying.

A notable lack of happiness_2 happens when I spend too much time playing something like cookie clicker. It's engaging, and entertaining in the moment, but utterly meaningless. Experiencing a well-written story (regardless of medium) is more fulfilling.

I think the main difference is that happiness_2 feels worthwhile in hindsight as well as while it's happening. You don't regret it. If sufficiently introspected in the moment it can be detected but it's hard to notice sometimes until you regret spending too much time on the thing. It's easier to notice after the happiness_1 has worn off.
