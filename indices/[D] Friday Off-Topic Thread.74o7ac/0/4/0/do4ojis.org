Basically, yes.

My main problem with "consume entertainment" is that it's only enjoyable, not satisfying. It leads to happiness_1 (moment to moment enjoyment) but not happiness_2 (having a good life in a virtue ethics sense). Ideally I'd like to have both, but it would be simple to augment happiness_2 with entertainment to get happiness_1 as long as there's free time so really happiness_2 is the hard part.

A completable goal would be acceptable, it just leads to the same problem once it's done.

It doesn't strictly /have/ to have a significant net positive for humanity, I would just feel guilty ignoring all the world's considerable problems.
