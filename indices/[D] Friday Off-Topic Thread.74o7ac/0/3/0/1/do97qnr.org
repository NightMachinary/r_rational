You can and should ask about any medication you think has potential to improve your treatment. The worst your doctor will do is say "no." They don't work for the DEA, and you aren't admitting a history of substance abuse; all you're doing is inquiring about the efficacy of a medication you heard of from a point of ignorance. If they tell you "No, such and such drug is illegal and impossible to prescribe," you say "Oh, okay" and move on.
