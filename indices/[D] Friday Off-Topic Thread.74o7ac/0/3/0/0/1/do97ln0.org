I understand how people come to this misconception, but they aren't the same drug. In the sidebar of the wikipedia pages on these substances you will see a section labeled "Identifiers" which lists all of the systematic approaches chemists take to labeling substances. They have no identifiers in common. They are also very different looking if you view the skeletal structure picture at the top of the sidebar and you understand how that diagram works.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine]]

To add to this, PCP is schedule II(high potential for abuse but with accepted medical uses) and Ketamine is schedule III(low to moderate potential for abuse). Currently esketamine (the s enantiomer of ketamine which is typically an equal mixture of the r and s enantiomers) is in phase III clinical trials for depression.

Also, your doctors don't work for the DEA and are under no obligation to report casual inquiries about medication to an authority.
