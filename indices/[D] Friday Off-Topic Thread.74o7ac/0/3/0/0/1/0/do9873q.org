Still. They're both dissociatives. They act on the same receptors and pathways and whatnot. Just like ecstasy and meth and cocaine all feel similarish in some respects, ketamine and PCP ought to feel similarish. My uncle ("Elizabeth" is a character, not a real person, so I'm functionally anonymous here) used to big-time deal meth and heroin down in Florida for a few years, and he's told me about how he and other associates would break into veterinarian's clinics to steal their ketamine and sell it to people looking for PCP. If it binds to the same receptor sites, it's going to make you feel the same, so it might as well be the same thing. (This is close to a decade ago) I've snorted adderal, and I've snorted bath salts, and I've snorted cocaine, and they were practically indistinguishable. The fact that ketamine isn't /literally/ PCP is irrelevant. Your doctor might not work for the DEA, but they recognize "drug seeking behavior," and asking for a prescription for ketamine is 100% going to be viewed as such by a doctor.
