Yes, I have tried dissociatives. I found them to be subjectively similar in some ways. I didn't like them, so I didn't try them enough to get a feel for the differences. I've also tried multiple stimulants and found they had differences. I was also /prescribed/ modafinil until my insurance changed. It doesn't matter.

Subjective experience is by no means the only parameter relevant to any particular substance. And what you're calling /on paper/ actually means /in controlled laboratory studies./ Observations by you /in the real world/ as you call it are biased, uncontrolled, and anecdotal and don't have any status as evidence in a scientific worldview until they're properly studied.

EDIT

Also, I don't need to be qualified. The studied differences speak for themselves. Qualifications are not evidence and are irrelevant to the truth of any matter.
