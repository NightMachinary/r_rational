  I was never accused of drug seeking behavior for mentioning to my doctor that I heard a substance could be used for some condition.

But did you ever ask for a /legitimate/ drug that /druggies/ do? I got a side-eye for even /mentioning/ modafinil.

Also, to address your first paragraph, I've done a three different dissociatives in my past (two of them by accident, for the record). /Have you done even one?/ How are /you/ qualified to say that their differences /on paper/ mean that their differences /in the real world/ are significant?
