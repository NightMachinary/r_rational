I'm seeing a psychiatrist. Going on antidepressants has had the largest positive effect of any one thing I've done so far. I'm currently on sertraline and wellbutrin. I haven't tried ketamine. I'm hesitant to make suggestions when the doctor has a medical degree and I don't, but maybe I shouldn't be?
