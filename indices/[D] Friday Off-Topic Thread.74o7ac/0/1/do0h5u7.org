Have felt the amazing feeling of self-actualization?

I got back from a trip in August, and decided there were some things I wanted to achieve; among them, hamstring flexibity and handstands.

Within a week I had noticable progress, and I felt really good; not about the progress per se, but about having decided to do a thing and then that thing getting done. It's a great feeling.

You might just pick some small stuff you want to see different; about yourself or your world; make a plan to enact that change and then watch as it happens when you do it. It's pretty cool.

Otherwise... Approach from an information theory direction? What's the most different thing you could go try from the things you've already tried?

Otherwise... What do you want there to be more of in the world?

You may be experiencing a numbness from existential analysis paralysis. You don't have to do the right thing, you just have to do any thing, and observe your reaction.
