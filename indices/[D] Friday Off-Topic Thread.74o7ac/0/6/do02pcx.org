Are you asking for the meaning of life? 'Cause I think you're asking how to find meaning in life.

- Many people find that religion helps them discover meaning. If that word offends you, call it spirituality. There is a great deal of information available on this subject.

- Help other people. Not in an abstract sense. Giving to charity and helping with causes won't do it. Find specific people with specific needs and help them. And by "find" I mean pay more attention to the people you already see and know.

- Start a family. If you have a romantic partner, you can make that person a focus for your utility function: maximize that person's happiness. If you have children, you can do the same for them.
