There's a reset, but despite their claims that things will be just like season 1, there's clearly changes:

- Rick is now the bitch of the family. Beth doesn't care if he stays or goes, Jerry actively wants him gone, and Summer and Morty are each sick of his shit in their own ways.

- Beth and Jerry are in a loving relationship now, whereas before their marriage was miserable.

- Morty is increasingly the person that the family is revolving around - Rick gets into his pissing match with the president solely for Morty's sake, the family hides where Morty says they should hide, and so on and so forth.

- Summer has a better relationship with her parents, which is going to improve the self-esteem problems she's had since the beginning of the show.

- Jerry... has to get a new car, I guess.

With all of those changes, plus the various villains that have been established and could show up at any time in season 4, and the continued absence of the Federation, things /aren't/ the same. While I think a lot of it was clearing things up for an easier season 4, I also think that where in this season we saw characters pursue changes only to lose them or realize they sucked, next season's going to have a lot of episodes where characters think the status quo is in play but isn't.
