Yeah, I heard about it.

But if we're assigning blame... I don't think we can fault Season 3's ending to bad logistics, unless the logistics were /really, really/ bad. Maybe the writers had a really good end to the character's arc planned that got cut; but then shouldn't they have cut other stuff instead? Maybe they had already produced most of the 10 episodes by the time they learned they couldn't produce more, so there's no way they could work a satisfying conclusion in the time they had left, and they produced the episodes in order of diffusion instead of order of importance... but then we go back to really shitty logistics.

Which is plausible, I guess. But since Season 3 ends with "now it's going to be like season 1, except more streamlined", also Rick's rant about how none of this matters, also the fact that they don't end on a cliffhanger, etc... I think the most likely explanation is the writers wanted to touch on serious themes (abuse, therapy, toxicity), but didn't actually plan to conclusively address them.
