Worth noting that we've seen a huge logistical mistake related to the end of a R&M season before: season 2 was not supposed to end on a clliffhanger*. They were having trouble figuring out how to resolve the whole prison thing, so they whipped up Who's Purging Now as the second-last episode of the season and left it on a cliffhanger.

Now, EoS2 was much better than EoS3, but there's still precedent for an unintentionally abrupt season finale being resolved more satisfyingly at the start of the following season.
