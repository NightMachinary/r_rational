I've read about predictive processing through SSC. The more I think about it I feel like I've given a glint of the Ultimate Understanding of the Mind, and I can almooooost-but-not-quite reach it.

I'm looking for good, easy-for-a-layman literature on the subject, but I'm not sure there's any; I think the field is still young. I've read a few blog articles from Andi Clark (the guy who wrote /Surfing Uncertainty/), and so far it's not clicking; my lack of background aside, he makes some weird assumptions that seem plain false to me.

I should probably try to write a list of questions I want answered before I seriously go looking for answers.

But honestly, I kind of feel this is it. Like, I feel like all my life I've been asking questions in the same general category "Why do I feel like that and not other people? How does motivation work? How does intelligence work? How does bias work", which I feel would be get satisfying answers if I understood PP better; and I also expect these answers would lead me to become a better pedagogue and better at motivating myself by order of magnitudes.

So, um, here's hoping? (I'm really hoping future-me isn't looking at this post and laughing at present-me's naïveté).

So, Rick and Morty Season 3 just finished. Those of you who followed, what did you think?

Personally, I was seriously disappointed by the ending. I was already expecting disappointment after episode 9 (Lost-style; ep.9 was the points where there were too many philosophical hook for the finale to meaningfully address them all).

Basically, I feel like season 3 was setting me up for a character development arc; with an ongoing thread (Jerry's divorce), and episodes setting up potential personal growth for each character: the Mad Max episode for Summer, the amusement park for Jerry, the therapist for Rick and Beth, etc.

But the end just explicitly resets everything. The divorce is cancelled, Rick is automatically forgiven, and apparently nobody shows that they have learned anything from their experience.

And, usually, I'd be fine with that? Like, it's accepted for shows like the Simpsons that when a character learns a lesson, you don't expect the lesson to stick (though it's a bit of a cheat to have the character "learn" it in the first place then), but this season really seemed to promise that /something/ would eventually happen.

But the intended messages seems to be that the author prefer the season 1 format and don't actually want the changes to stick. Which is especially annoying after season 1 had an episode specifically mocking the idea that you could go back to "normal" after you fucked up so completely it affected everyone around you.

I intended to post an announce now, but the material isn't ready yet. Since I've already delayed this a lot, I'm pre-committing right now: I will post an announce on this Friday thread, within the next 24h, detailing a game project I'm working on. The announce will include details about the project, a link to a Game Design Document, and a timeline for at least the next month.

I will emulate [[/u/ketura][u/ketura]] and post an update on the game every week; this update will include:

- The content I've produced, or, if there's no new content, some sort of reflection on game design and rationality.

- An updated timeline.

- Links and stuff.

(if that's alright with the mods? I'd like to post here because I'm familiar with the community; the game won't necessarily be directly related to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]).

By the way, if anyone here has advice or additional recommendations on pre-commitment, I'm very open to those right now. (I'm familiar with general advice like "don't just promise the moon and assume you'll follow through")
