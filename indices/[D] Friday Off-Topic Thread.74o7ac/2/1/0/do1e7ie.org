I think this along with [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] are the most plausible explanations, but I think the problem [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] has with the show runs deeper than that. I don't think show was ever meant to be anything other than a dark parody of high-concept adventure. It exists expressly for the purpose of nihilistically skewering genre fiction.

The writing is still creative and funny enough to carry that premise and theme, but subverting tropes can only carry a story so far. We still want to experience stories that stories that have familiar meaning to us, and that's an issue when the fundamental purpose of your story is to deconstruct other stories.

I find it hard to saw I'm disappointed in season 3 because the series is still doing what it always has been and clearly just wants to keep doing that no matter what I want from it. I would like to see development in the characters and setting, but that would be /meaningful/ in a show that believes meaning is illusionary.

I honestly think the show's relationship with its audience, myself included, mirrors Rick's relationship with Morty. Rick only spends time with Morty because his narrative existence requires it like how a story needs an audience, and exploits Morty's irrational attachment to him the same way the series draws us in with the promise of fun adventure.

Now matter how much Rick abuses Morty, he's never able to overcome his emotional dependency even when he knows how unhealthy it is. In the same way, we make excuses for how the show must have some value and latch onto the few emotionally satisfying moments there are that keep us coming back. It still takes us on fun rides, but is it still worth it? Was it ever?

Maybe I just never liked this show as much as everyone else and have accepted that it won't get any more enjoyable for me even though I'll keep watching, but I really think the show's nihilistic attitude and refusal to change is catching up with it. What else should we expect from a story about how happiness is delusional, suffering is inevitable, and every desire we have will hurt us?
