- From a philosophy-of-mind perspective, [[http://predictive-mind.net/][there's an entire website here]].

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18012311-the-predictive-mind][A book besides Clark's]]

- [[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/%7Ekarl/Whatever%20next.pdf][Clark has a big review paper here]]

/Surfing Uncertainty/ was the big review as of, I guess, late 2015 when it was published, and /The Predictive Mind/ was in 2007. I'm guessing that not enough time has elapsed in two years for someone to write a /new/ full-field review.
