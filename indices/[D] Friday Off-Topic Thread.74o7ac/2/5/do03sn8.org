I've read a shit-ton about predictive processing and computational cognitive science to apply for PhD programs in the field.

Ask me anything, but there may not /be/ answers because it /is/ a young field. Also, you have to swear that should you really understand, you won't use this knowledge to destroy the world.

That's my job.
