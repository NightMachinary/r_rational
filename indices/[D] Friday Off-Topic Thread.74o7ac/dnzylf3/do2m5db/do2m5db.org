Hmmm.

You've given quite a description of what you're looking for. Let me rephrase it in my own words to make sure I am understanding you correctly.

You want a long term life goal. However, you will not accept any, random goal; rather, you require a goal with certain attributes. These attributes include, but are not limited to, the following:

- The goal must, in some manner, be a net positive for humanity.
- The goal must be something towards which it is possible to make progress
- The goal is not required to be obtainable, and preferably should never be entirely completable
- Making progress towards the goal must in some manner be enjoyable

So, for example, consider the theoretical goal "make infinite money and donate it all to efficient charities". This succeeds on the second and third point, but fails on the last point. Or the aim of "consume infinite entertainment"; this succeeds on the second, third and fourth point, but fails on the first.

Would this be an accurate restatement of your question?
