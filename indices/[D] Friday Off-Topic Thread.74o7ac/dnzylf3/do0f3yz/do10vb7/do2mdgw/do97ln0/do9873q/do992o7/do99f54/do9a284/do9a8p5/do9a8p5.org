What dissociatives have you tried? Robitussin? OTC sleep medicine? Dissociatives /suck/ as far as I'm concerned, but Ive done enogh of them to get a feel for the differences and they don't really /feel/ that different.

Obviously X feels different than coke feels different than meth, but if you've /really/ done all three then you know there's more in common than not.
