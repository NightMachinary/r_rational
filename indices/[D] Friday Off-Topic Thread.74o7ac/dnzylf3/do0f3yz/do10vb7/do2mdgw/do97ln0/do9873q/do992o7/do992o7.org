  If it binds to the same receptor sites, it's going to make you feel the same, so it might as well be the same thing.

Ketamine and PCP only /partially/ share the same mechanism. They have other mechanisms of action, and the full effects are not believed to be explained by the currently suggested mechanisms of action. To add to that, they have a different metabolic pathway, toxicity profile, dosage, and addiction potential. These differences are not insignificant factors, especially if you look at it through a regulatory perspective where the concern is purportedly to protect people from its dangers.

  asking for a prescription for ketamine is 100% going to be viewed as such by a doctor.

Don't /insistently demand/ prescriptions from your doctor and this will never be an issue. I've suggested many drugs I was interested in to my psychiatrist, and his no answers have always been along the lines of "it'd be hard to get insurance to pay for that" or "that's a schedule X substance, and I doubt I could get it approved for this purpose." I was never accused of drug seeking behavior for mentioning to my doctor that I heard a substance could be used for some condition.
