Quite.

You can't /just ask/ a doctor for something like that any more than you can /just ask/ for something like adderal (which is pretty much cocaine) or xanax (which is xanax). They /will/ assume you're trying to get it for the sole purpose of selling it.

That's not to say it wouldn't work for treating depression. EY wouldn't've suggested it if there wasn't scientific literature documenting evidence of it working.

There's also a lot of good evidence for psilocybin (the compound that puts the "magic" in magic mushrooms). I did those a few times close to a decade ago, when I was in college. The first time, we watched this horror movie called /Hatchet/, and I swear I watched a movie that doesn't exist in our universe, like, the characters were all looking out through the screen at me and talking to me and each other about the events transpiring around them and it was very strange, because I was perfectly aware of the fact that it wasn't real, but it still looked and sounded like they were saying things which they /certainly/ were not. I've checked, it was definitely a horror film, not a campy meta comedy wherein the characters were all aware of the fact that they were in a movie.
