It feels kind of weird talking about this but this is a pseudo-throwaway anyway so whatever.

TL;DR my utility function is missing, what do?

I've come to the point where I basically only care about basic needs. Food/shelter/entertainment. I need some kind of long term goal/purpose in order for things to matter. It seems like I'm missing something there isn't a word for because nobody needed it because almost everyone has enough of it. I call it self-ness, the extent to which people are themselves, in an essentialist/non-tautological way. People have interests, goals, hobbies. They know what they want to be when they grow up. I don't.

I can think of a few things that might work in principle but I can't just make myself care about them enough for it to work.

Getting an easy job that pays enough and spending all my free time on entertainment has a certain appeal but I wouldn't really be happy, just distracted from being unsatisfied with life. Grad school isn't easy but I otherwise more or less live this way and I'm not happy now.

Acquiring as much money as possible, letting it gain interest, then leaving it to the utilitarian-optimal charity in my will also has a certain appeal but I'm not a good enough person for this to be my characteristic driving goal/identity.

When I think about what I want to do with my life the mindscape is blank and flat. I see nothing possible worth persuing. I want to be the sort of person who does things instead of just existing but I don't have things that feel compelling/important.

I vaguely remember wanting things around highschool / undergrad but even then the problem existed. I kept myself busy so that I wouldn't have free time to choose how to spend because I knew I'd do nothing with it other than persue entertainment and ultimately that leads to a certain long-term-boredom/dissatisfaction-with-life that I don't know how to get rid of.

I'm working through anxiety/depression and I've reached a plateau I can't get past without something to persue that feels worthwhile. Career and life-goal/purpose aren't necessarily the same thing but I kinda wish I could just get scanned by a Futurama device and have it just tell me what job I should get and have that automatically set everything up. It's harder to imagine a device that also can scan your brain and tell you what you should do with your life based on abilities and conscious/unconscious values but that would be perfect if it were possible.

Related but distinct is my difficulty making subjective decisions. There's an ever-present caricature of social pressure that leaves me certain that whatever I pick will be "wrong" in some sense, that people will think less of me for it, but at the same time I know that that's unrealistic, because few people are that harsh and it's narcissistic to think people would even care about such trivial decisions. When I get past that I experience a similar empty/flat indifference mentioned above.

It's like I'm a defective artificial mind, capable of some intelligence and some degree of humanity but only in a local, first-few-orders approximation and not in an accurate-across-a-whole-lifetime way. Like I'd pass a Turing test that spans a few hours or days but not one that lasts a lifetime.

How do you get a utility function if your old one goes missing or you never had one in the first place? That's overstating it of course, but the idea I'm trying to express is metaphorically in the direction of that idea at a lower magnitude. I'm not truly indifferent to everything, I just can't seem to find anything I care about other than short-term needs. I dislike that I only care about short-term needs but I can't seem to find a way to change that.

To clarify a bit, by "care" I mean care enough to actually change behavior. In a broader sense I care about more things but it's more abstract.

Has anyone else dug a way out of this problem before? What do?
