  You cannot take the standardized Deep Wisdom of your surrounding culture and make your characters rehearse it. What leaps into your mind as a cached thought for Deep Wisdom, even if you think that Deep Wisdom unknown to the laity, is nonetheless the equivalent of writing vampires who hiss and drink blood instead of asking yourself what you would do as a vampire.

[[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]], do you by any chance know who Dio Brando is? I think you'd really like him, actually. In short: he started out an ambitious and sociopathic social climber, then unexpectedly found out an artifact could turn people into vampires, then /used it on himself to gain immortality/, then started /upgrading his own biology halfway to Elder Thing/ using his newfound vampire powers, and decided to /take over the world as an immortal vampiric god-king/.

[[#s][JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Phantom Blood]]

And he still manages to keep his ability to [[#s][Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Stardust Crusaders]] secret until the very end, making his defeat require something of a Deus Ex Machina, although even that was /somewhat/ rational in that [[#s][Stardust Crusaders]].

TL;DR: Vampires do not actually hiss, they go WRRRRRRYYYYYYYYY.
