It depends. If you have to change a step in the A>B>C causal chain that makes up the plot, then it's horrendously expensive to change. If you're lucky, it's just an extra paragraph somewhere. (In my case it's a little bit more complicated, because it's a time travel story, and the causal chain goes A>B>C>A and so on.)
