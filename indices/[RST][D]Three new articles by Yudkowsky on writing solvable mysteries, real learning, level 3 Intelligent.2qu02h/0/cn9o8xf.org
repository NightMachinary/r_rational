I'm working on editing a manuscript right now, and the question of how transparent to make the plot is one of the big things on my mind. Of course, having a community of people to read what you've written works better if you're writing serially and can make course corrections along the way - if you're writing a book that's going to be published and with no plans for a sequel, it's considerably less good, and if no one understands the plot when the book is over, you can't really make changes after the fact.

So you can't make the mystery too mysterious, or people won't get it and the climax will seem to come from nowhere, and you can't make it too obvious, or people will be bored when the mystery rips off its paper thin disguise and declares itself. I think the solution must be to have a large number of beta readers to give you feedback, but that offers its own problems.
