I've been thinking about sending a call out to the audience at some point asking people interested in contributing to each pick one episode to transcribe, maybe for some audio credit or a promotion of their work or something they're interested in. The professional pace of audio transcription is something like 1 hour of work for 15 minutes of audio, so [[/u/alexanderwales]] wasn't actually doing too bad, but assuming a similar level of inexperience it would take people about 3-5 hours of work to do each episode.

Paying people is also an option, but financially the podcast isn't a money maker, and anything we'd be able to afford would be such a pittance for the time investment that I'd worry it would feel more insulting than anything. Maybe someday.
