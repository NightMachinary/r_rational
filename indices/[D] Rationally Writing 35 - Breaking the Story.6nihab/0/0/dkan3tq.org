No, it's too much work. I actually tried transcribing our first episode as a test (and because it's one that I think is useful whenever the topic of "What is rational fiction" comes up). It took me about half an hour to transcribe the first six minutes. My efficiency would probably go up over time, but some of the episodes are long enough that it would take me four to five hours to complete the transcript even if I were proficient. The ROI is pretty terrible.

Maybe if auto-transcription technology improves enough that it wouldn't be a nightmare of picking through the errors it leaves behind? But that's a ways off yet, and my initial tests did not have great results, especially given how often we talk about things that aren't in the dictionary.
