Thanks for pointing that out :) $1 a minute gets pretty pricey for a project with such little income, but it's good to know what a professional rate is.

Some quick and rough math says it would cost about $1,500 to get all the current episodes done, but it might be a good investment for a few of the most popular ones, to help draw interest in.
