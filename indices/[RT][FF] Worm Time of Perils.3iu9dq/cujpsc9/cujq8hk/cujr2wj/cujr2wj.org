A lot of it is plausible, no doubt. Also, I separate his predictions into strategic, operational, tactical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and political. My biggest problems were with the last two.

What I mean by unjustified is that he's simply reaching. He has this conjecture spamming mode, which is good for low hanging fruit/obvious shit, but then as he picks more particular pieces of conjecture as more likely it's just there. There's no stacking or parallel observations which narrow his ranges or alter his focus. His ranges just include some asinine shit, obvious shit, + canon answer. It's flat. I can't sufficiently explain this. It's not a deal breaker, because it's not too bad. It just induces a mild eyeroll.

As far as his familiarity with BB gang politics are concerned. That is somewhat over the top. The public is simply unaware of the inner machinations and convoluted alliances and deal making involved. Hence the desperation IRL for "transparency."

Many a white man thought they could show up in the middle east and do the same thing as Warren. The idea is laughable. Yes BB is a town, but the same principle applies.
