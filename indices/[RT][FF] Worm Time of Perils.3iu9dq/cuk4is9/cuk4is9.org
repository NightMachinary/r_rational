Yeah, not very rational, someone mentioned that he always gets the canon answer to every question but the author hides it by making it part of a series of guesses so it doesn't look like an asspull. He does it a lot.

It was entertaining though, and I liked that you're not really meant to sympathize with him given his reasons for his annoying attitude, but at the same time it kind of kills the immersion since there aren't any likable characters you can identify with. Taylor is basically a side character with no agency in this fic.

He's also steamrolling through every challenge and the only thing that might give him trouble seems to be Coil, unless we get a fakeout like what happened with Control, which I really disliked. I hope the author handles that fight well.
