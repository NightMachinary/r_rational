  You're not really meant to sympathize with him given his reasons for his annoying attitude.

Can you elaborate? I found him pretty damn likeable, although dropping the whole tired 'egomaniac supervillain supergenius conquers the world' backstory wouldn't hurt. His position on utilitarian 'end justifies the means' strategies seems to be 'tried it once, didn't work out, now I'll never take this seriously', which is rather weak. Either this viewpoint comes from his traumatic heel-face turn, in which case he's not rational enough, or it's simple author's fiat, which means the story is not rational enough.

  He's also steamrolling through every challenge and the only thing that might give him trouble seems to be Coil, unless we get a fakeout like what happened with Control, which I really disliked. I hope the author handles that fight well.

To be fair, he's supposed to be a top-tier player in his universe, it's quite natural he's steamrolling everyone so far. He's fighting eldritch civilisation-destroying abominations using his intellect in backstory, can't expect him to struggle against a couple of thugs. Simurgh, Coil, and Contessa should present more of a challenge.
