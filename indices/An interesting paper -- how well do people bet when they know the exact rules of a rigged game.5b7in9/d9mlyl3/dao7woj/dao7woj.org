Got my $250 in about 8 minutes, but I got a lucky run. Bet 60% of my cash each time. I could have done it faster, but 60% is not a natural division for me to calculate and I was doing it without assistance. Spent another 10 minutes fooling around over the cap, but the popups got annoying so I stopped at $266.64 after starting with a 0.01 bet and doubling it a few times (betting half the difference of my overage each time).
