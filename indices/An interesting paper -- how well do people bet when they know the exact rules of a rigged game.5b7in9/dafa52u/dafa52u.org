It's not that surprising a result. In all these sorts of experiments, whether it's the RAND studies on the prisoner's dilemma or calibration training, people initially perform terrible on tasks which are not ecologically valid or they have done before, but then gradually improve their performance. This takes more than 300 flips, though, which is not much for trying out various strategies with such a small edge. For example, calibration training requires at least that many items for most people, and their test items are much more informative than binary coin flips (eg one can update a lot from predicting 99% on a false item; one doesn't update nearly as much from one out of many strategies in betting $2 and losing on a 40% chance). So you would have to use play money, which I don't think would seriously damage the results' validity.
