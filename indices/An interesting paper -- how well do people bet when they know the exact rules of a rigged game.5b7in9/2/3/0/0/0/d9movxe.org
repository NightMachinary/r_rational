I feel the suspicion is justified when I'm offered a gambling deal where they insist the odds are in my favor. I guess I'm in that small fraction.

Quick edit: If the RNG was done via dice or some other traditional method, I'd feel a lot better about it, and would probably end up betting roughly a third of my cash each time (I was not aware of the correct formula ahead of time, but it makes sense to bet a predetermined percentage each time).
