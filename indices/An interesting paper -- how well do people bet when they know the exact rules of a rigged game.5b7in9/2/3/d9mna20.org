I honestly didn't consider deception and I totally should have. It would probably be worth it to bet a single penny approximately 40 times to determine if the 60% probability is holding before starting "real" bets.

My betting strategy before reading the guide would have been 50% of my pool each bet. After reading their explanation I can see that my instinct is too high lol.
