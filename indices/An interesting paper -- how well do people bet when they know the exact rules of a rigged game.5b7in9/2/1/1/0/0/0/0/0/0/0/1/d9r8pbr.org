Welp, according to [[http://www.columbia.edu/%7Eww2040/PortfolioChoice96.pdf][this paper]] (third section) betting using Kelly criterion with the Bayesian posterior mean is "optimal".

I'm still confused about the precise technical meaning of "optimal" here, since the strategy is outperformed by not betting anything for the first 50 bets and then starting to bet.

[[https://plot.ly/%7EAugSphere/5/][Here's]] the mean log-money for 500 simulated "optimal" bots. [[https://plot.ly/%7EAugSphere/7/][Here]] is for bots that don't bet anything for first 50 flips.

EDIT: The situation is the same if I measure performance by simple average money of bots, rather than the average of logarithm.
