  No, what I assume is: it is possible that what is being tested is not actually what I am told is being tested. For all I know, they could be testing for how many people are actually willing to play when presented with a gambling game with odds in their favor, or maybe they are testing how people react to losing and the coin is rigged to make them lose. The point is that I can't know for certain.
