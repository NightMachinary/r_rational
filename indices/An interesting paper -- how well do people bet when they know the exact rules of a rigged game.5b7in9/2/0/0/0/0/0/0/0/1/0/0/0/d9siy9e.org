My dislike for real life gambling is that usually it is either is dumb (designed in a way that the bank has better odds than you) or it is smart but unethical (you know the odds are in your favor and the guy you plan to gain from effectively doesn't or is to ignorant to know why this matters) or is pointless (50% odds). But whenever these things don't apply I don't see how there's a problem.

Examples are when the other party knows they are probably going to lose money to you but are okay with it for secondary reasons or when the gains themselves are secondary like when you are spicing up a fun game by putting a noticeable but ultimately unimportant stake (playing poker for a few dollars that you won't miss).

Do you know where your dislike for gambling stems from, assuming it isn't a final utility value of yours?
