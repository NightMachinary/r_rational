Let me explain differently: Experiments are designed to collect data from subjects. Sometimes, it is necessary to trick, lie to, or mislead subjects to collect the data. I, currently, have no information on the frequency of trickery experiments versus non-trickery experiments. Therefore, if part of the rules of an experiment I am participating in is "you can walk away now with cash", I will likely walk away with cash.
