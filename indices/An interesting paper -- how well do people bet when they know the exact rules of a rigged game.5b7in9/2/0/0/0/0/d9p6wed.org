  OP says "you are offered a stake of $25". The paper says that they gave out the money.

I skimmed to the rules of the game, but is there really a difference between betting my money and money given to me? The moment they say I am given $25 to start, the $25 is now my money, and I am investing it into gambling if I play.

  you assume that someone who wants to do an experiment is definitely going to cheat

No, what I assume is: it is possible that what is being tested is not actually what I am told is being tested. For all I know, they could be testing for how many people are actually willing to play when presented with a gambling game with odds in their favor, or maybe they are testing how people react to losing and the coin is rigged to make them lose. The point is that I can't know for certain.

I'm not saying they are trying to cheat me out of my money, I am saying that I would rather walk away with a guaranteed small payout than risk it. I can't know for certain that they aren't testing something else entirely.

Distrust of a game is a valid reason to decide not to play.
