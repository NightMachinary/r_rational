OP says "you are offered a stake of $25". The paper says that they gave out the money.

You realize that you're saying you would give up $225 that you are statistically almost guaranteed to get because you assume that someone who wants to do an experiment is definitely going to cheat you? I'm sorry to hear that; it sounds like a tough way to think.
