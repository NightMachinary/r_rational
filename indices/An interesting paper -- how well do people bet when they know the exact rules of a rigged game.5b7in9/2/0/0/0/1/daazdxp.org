But "don't gamble" is a very effective strategy against the dangers of gambling, lotteries, and advertising in our society.

Real life is not a simulation. And in real life, the probable returns on gambling are always less than your inputs.

A similar theory I frequently see in rational writing is substance abuse - characters who take up smoking because the end of the world is at hand and the ability to focus on stopping it is more important than life expectancy. That's not the real world. Perhaps you would have a good probability to better accomplish your productive, relaxation, creative, or pleasure goals with the help of caffeine, nicotine, adderall, alcohol, marijuana, opiates, LSD, or harder drugs. Yes, there is a variety of dangers and addictive properties in that list. And lots of people use the lighter options successfully, some are prescribed by medical professionals, and a rare few artists used illicit drugs to get results. But too many end up as barely recognizable burned out husks of their former selves.

It can be very useful to precommit to not attempt certain activities that may be tempting in certain circumstances, such as gambling, drugs, or crime. This still means saying no when a contrived situation and perfect knowledge show that saying yes is advantageous: the whole point is that it protects you when it only appears advantageous.

Don't criticize psychobeans for refusing to gamble. It's a very good life strategy!
