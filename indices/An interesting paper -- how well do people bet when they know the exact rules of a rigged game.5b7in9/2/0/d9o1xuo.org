There's a significant opportunity cost to this strategy. You're playing with house money and your maximum possible loss is $25. If the expected value of the experiment is greater than $50 then you are losing money by not taking them at their word and playing aggressively.

Put differently: you're playing with house money and cannot possibly walk out the door with less money than you had when you walked in. Why would you /not/ assume that they're telling the truth and play to win? Or, alternatively, just take the $25 and leave immediately without making a single bet? What are you trying to achieve with your strategy?
