It's reasonable to assume that people won't instantly know the Kelly Criterion so wouldn't play "perfectly" optimally. And in fact it's I'm not completely sure that it's truly optimal in the case where a maximal cap exists, if you bet a smaller pecentage more time by betting very quickly (since you know you're always betting heads and it's computer simulated, I think you can bet as quickly as you can type in what your bet is) you might be able to hit the cap more consistently, I'm not completely sure. And also it would be a waste of time to calculate the precise percent of your current worth between each bet (unless you're using something easy like 10%) some approximations are fine.

But I think it's pretty intuitive to scale your bets with your current value, and never bet 100%.

And "always bet heads" is obvious to anyone who knows anything about probability. There is no excuse. I am astounded and disappointed and angry all at once.
