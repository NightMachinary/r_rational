As far as optimal betting goes, requiring an 0.05 significance level with 80% power is way too risk-averse, isn't it?

Simply estimating the bias using the Laplace's rule of succession and plugging that into the Kelly criterion would be a decent alternative. You don't /have/ to require large amounts of evidence for the bias before you're ready to bet on the outcomes.
