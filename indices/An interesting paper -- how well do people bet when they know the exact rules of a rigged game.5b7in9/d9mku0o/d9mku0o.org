My strategy would come from mistrust of the digitally controlled coin. I have no idea if the 60% is true, and the coin could be rigged; rules changing based on bet and bank size, etc. There could even be a human on the other end deciding the results.

My strategy would be to bet a single cent every time until time runs out, or I noticed the results moving away from 60% heads. Either I'll statistically walk away with a small amount of winnings, or I'll catch on to trickery and stop playing before I lose more. Sure, this isn't optimal for the goal of maximizing winnings, but you can't play optimally if you can't trust the RNG.
