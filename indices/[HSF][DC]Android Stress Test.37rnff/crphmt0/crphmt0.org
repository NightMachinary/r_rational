From the title, I thought it was about stress testing an Android phone.

From the comments, I thought it was about stress testing an Android phone's ability to make emotional sounds and this was a post to talk about the ethics of listening to a phone screaming and whimpering.

From the first few images, I thought it was going to be about rape and I was very annoyed that there wasn't a NSFW tag here. I wanted to click away, but I had to know why anyone would post it to here.

What I got was so, so, so much worse......

It was an ethical gut punch.

It wasn't visually horrible in any way. There was no gore, no blood, no viscerally disgusting images, or anything else that would make me have an instinctive reaction. But seeing one possible way humans could treat machines so good at emotional reactions that it's a challenge to say whether or not she's sentient (I already think of her as a person after just a few images!), this makes me feel sad to see the limitations of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number][human empathy]].
