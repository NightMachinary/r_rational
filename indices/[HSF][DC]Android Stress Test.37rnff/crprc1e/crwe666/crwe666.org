Just because a machine is capable of convincing you it has human level reaction to stimulus doesn't mean that it is actually sentient. I understand this particular piece may have been alluding to this bot being practically human, but there really is no evidence the machine truly is. We are quite a distance away from building true AI so I try to take this with a grain of salt; as we tend to murder simulations everyday.
