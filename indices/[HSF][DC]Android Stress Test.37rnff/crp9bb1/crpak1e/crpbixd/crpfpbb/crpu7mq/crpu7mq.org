How did you manage to conclude that from the available information anyway? Even if the companies are Japanese - which isn't clear as far as I can see - this takes place an unspecified amount of time in the future, so there's no way to tell how popular or advanced these robots are compared to other technology. Perhaps all the Western super-rich have fancy Google haptic-feedback capable VR chambers already. Japan is world leader with android technology, mostly because others don't really try that hard. Maybe they don't try in the future either.
