I think you have interpreted my statement as a bit less favorably then I actually mean.

Of course if you build it to act human in all ways it will be human. But that is not what I'm proposing. It's not about the external behaviors in entirety. It is about the external behaviors in very controlled contexts and then other behaviors being in different contexts.

For example an Actor pretending to be injured is DIFFERENT then some one being injured. That is the distinction I am making. The actor may be argued to potentially run a simulation of the injured consciousness but that gets kind of tricky to determine.

That is the kind of distinction I am making, artists, actors, fiction writers. These are of a comparable type of ethical question related to what you said.

BUT This is a DIFFERENT ethical thing then intentionally trying to make a consciousness that will suffer and put it in a body and torturing it.

It is a DIFFERENT ethical question to making a child and then tormenting it.

It is still an ethical question but making an AI who is conscious and choosing to 'play the role' of a victim with its own consent and not actually suffering in the sense of it does not actually care or possibly even enjoys it (but it makes a face like it does suffer in order to scratch whatever sick itch the human involved has) is not the same as one that does suffer and feel the pain and genuinely not want to be hurt.

Essentially I'm proposing androids will provide a way to have something even more extreme then present BDSM that people will probably make lots of noise about but is not in any way like what this comic shows except in immediate outside appearances.
