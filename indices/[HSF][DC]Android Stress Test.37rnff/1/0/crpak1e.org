I'm damn glad that didn't happen. Look, in real life, I don't think we're actually going to have androids with humanlike minds, emotions, and subjective experiences (unless someone already human ditched their meat-body and wanted a meat-like android body for some reason), but within the fictional conceit of doing so, I'm pretty damn ticked off. /Beating and murdering children is a special kind of evil./

Also, mangaka are still doing a good job of pretending Japan is a world leader in scifi-grade high technology despite two and a half Lost Decades.
