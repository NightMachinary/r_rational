  *Dunbar's number* is a suggested [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition][cognitive]] limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship][social relationships]]. These are relationships in which an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual][individual]] knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology][anthropologist]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar][Robin Dunbar]], who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size. By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can only comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group][group]]. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 250, with a commonly used value of 150. Dunbar's number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and likely depends on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory][long-term memory]] size.
