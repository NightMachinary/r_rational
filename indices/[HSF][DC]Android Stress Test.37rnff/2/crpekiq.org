I think that on the one hand having a machine that did feel emotional things like a meat organism is kind of disgusting (I can't in good conscience say this is even just the purview of mammals when they are finding results that suggest fruit flies have a fear response).

But having an android that is willing to 'play the part' has it's place.

However the ethics of it shift in that regard from the actual torture of a self aware being, and it being a DEPICTION of the torture of a self aware being.

That is different ethical question for me.
