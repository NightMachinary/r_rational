She got up there using a flying kayak. Now, that could be a different flying kayak, but nothing is a coincidence. Also, she's really fast, and is capable of memorizing Names after just two repetitions.

She also said "Call me Jane" rather than "My name is Jane", which means it's not her name (because of narrative reasons), but she prefers not to lie (probably for religious reasons, or because it's a rational fiction trope to never lie unless the reader knows it's a lie), and her name is important in some way (could be because religious reasons of names having power, because she's someone he would know, or just because while in a government monitored facility you shouldn't use your real name anyways).

Possible reasons against: she's not 8, and the daughter of the Comet King could probably have easier access without having to break in.

The last time we saw Sohu being 8 was in 2001, so if she started aging again right after that she would be around 24, so the right age to be Jane. I guess we'll have more information to figure out if it is Sohu the next time we see either Jane or Sohu.

If she's not Sohu, I'm not sure who she is. That's definitely the greatest possibility, at the moment.
