Uriel appeared because he needed to reduce system requirements somehow, and here was a group of folks waiting for divine help, who were likely to do anything he told them to do. Convenient!

Also, God doesn't do anything particularly...god-ey in the OT. Sure, there's some minor miracles, and burning bushes, and battles pushed one way or the other, but are we really to expect that an omnipotent being could only do those things? I expect an omnipotent deity to rewrite reality at his whim, not glorified party tricks. No, all of that is much more consistent with a frazzled cosmic sysop with limited resources trying to help the folks who know how to comply with his system requirements.

And who will also stop /boiling goats in mother's milk, dammit I have to reset Southeast Asia again./
