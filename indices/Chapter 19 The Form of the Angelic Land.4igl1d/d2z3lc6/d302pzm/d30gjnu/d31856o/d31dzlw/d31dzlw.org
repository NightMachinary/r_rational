It is unclear how archangels and angels relate-there are distinct similarities, and the angels seem to know the archangels, but in some ways they seem rather like a completely different species.

If an (non-arch)angel looked at the world the way Uriel did it seems like they would definitely be fallen.

But it isn't clear to me that you can generalize that to archangels-the size, mindstate, and abilities all seem radically different-they both exist in the same 'world' and similar origin, but a lot of the overlap between Uriel and angels would also apply to comparing Humans and Turtles-both have a shared origin and similar underlying biology. Uriel and angels are more similar to be sure-both are clearly humanish intelligences, but I'm not convinced they are really closely related.
