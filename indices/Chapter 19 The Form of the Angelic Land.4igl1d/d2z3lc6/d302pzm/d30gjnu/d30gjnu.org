It doesn't bother me because of religion, it bothers me because it breaks from what I thought the story was going for. I thought it would be some weird "what if the Torah was true" kind of thing, only for that scene to state the events of the Torah did not occur as described and came about almost as an accident.

So Kabbalah and the Talmud are true, angels and demons are real, and the universe is built out a programming language based on Hebrew, so why wouldn't the Jews be God's people? They really misinterpreted all the weird stuff that happened to them as God's plan when it was just Uriel bumbling through his job?

If there's no plan anyone was following, then how is it possible that "nothing is ever a coincidence"? It sounds pretty coincidental to me that the Jews would just happen to know about the true nature of the universe without that being part of the plan. Why would Uriel even appear to them if they he didn't have any instruction to do so?
