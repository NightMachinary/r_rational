I'm thinking it's gotta be the same skyak for narrative reasons. The answer to the question "How do you break into a joint government/angelic facility protected from all comers on pain of death?" is a fantastic time to introduce some new and powerful magic unknown or unusable to other actors. The fact that something already known to us (if not to Aaron) was used means that it is important to the story that we be wondering what happened to Sohu (and her skyak).
