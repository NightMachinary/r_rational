You also encountered the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, which is named after a German terrorist group in the 1990s. Aaron Smith-Teller has =aa= and a =-= in his name, and was also born in the 1990s.

The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon asserts that noticing things repeatedly is not a coincidence, as does Aaron Smith-Teller.

This is not a coincidence - they both agree on that - which is also not a coincidence.

Nothing is ever a coincidence, humans just don't notice most of the time.
