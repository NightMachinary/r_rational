Shelf 2270 = BCDEGHL = un-or-gal-ged-pa-drux-na

Level 36 = CF = or-??

  Their names and phonetic pronunciations, as written-right to left, are: Pa (B), Veh (C/K), Ged (G/J), Gal (D), Or (F), Un (A), Graph (E), Tal (M), Gon (I/Y), Na (H), Ur (L), Mals (P), Ger (Q), Drux (N), Pal (X), Med (O), Don (R), Ceph (Z), Van (U/V), Fam (S), Gisg (T).
