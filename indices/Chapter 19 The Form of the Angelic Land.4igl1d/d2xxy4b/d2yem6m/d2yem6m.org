112 = 7x2^{4}

7 I think means "godly". I don't remember any meanings for multiplicative combinations of 4 2s (though 2 itself might have been "evil"?).

2270 = 10x227

I think 227 is prime, so that probably has no kabbalistic meaning (unless it's "evil evil godly").

36 = 3x12

12 is the number of the tribes of Israel. 3 is probably something important.

All in all, doesn't seem terribly likely to be a factorisation thing. That's about the limit of my ideas.
