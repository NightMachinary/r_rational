Best part of the chapter, for me.

--------------

The Vanishing Name chose the situation as "Inside a secure government facility, and about to be found by a woman".

The second phone call in /The Cracks in the Sky/ was in Enochian, which is why it sounded like 16th century capital cities.

She says "Call me Jane," not "My name is Jane."

The numbers for the location of the book translate as follows: Volume 112 = EFG, Shelf 2270 = BCDEGHL, level 36 = CF. This doesn't look significant to me, but it might be in Enochian.
