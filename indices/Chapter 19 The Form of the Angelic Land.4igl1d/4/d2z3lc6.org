I would've posted this last week but by the time I read Chapter 18 nobody would have seen this comment, so now I'm going to say that I think the scene with Moses is the worst part of this story so far. I know the entire setting is weird biblical and programming in-jokes, but I just didn't like the idea that the events of Exodus happened basically by accident. I didn't find it funny, thought Uriel writing the Ten Commandments himself kind of undermines the premise about the Old Testament and Kabbala being true, and found it a bit disrespectful to say the systemic homophobia in Judaism was the product of Moses misinterpreting Uriel's instructions, which were themselves products of his incompetence at system administration and understanding humans.
