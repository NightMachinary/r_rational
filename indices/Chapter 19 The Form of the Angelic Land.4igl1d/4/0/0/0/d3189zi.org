I think that a kabbalist in story would say all of this was happening at multiple levels.

For example, the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem because God used them as an instrument of His vengeance, but the Babylonians also destroyed Jerusalem because of normal iron age Middle Eastern politics. If you asked the King of Babylon, he would certainly have normal iron-age-king reasons for invading Jerusalem. But by "coincidence", those happened to accord with the Divine Plan anyway.

In the same way, Uriel had his own reasons for giving the Commandments, but the Commandments correspond to higher-level aspects of the Divine Plan - there are Ten Commandments because there are ten sephirot and ten fingers on the hand and all of the other things mentioned in Chapter 9, /but also/ because Uriel had ten things he thought it was really important to have Moses do.

(in much the same way the organization is called "UNSONG" because that is the perfectly natural acronym for a United Nations subcommittee on names of God, but also because of kabbalistic implications of singers and song and silence and so on as mentioned in Chapter 5)
