I don't know. If you were looking for a book that agreed well with the normal Jewish interpretation of religion I think there were already plenty that disagreed with it.

This is a work of fiction. I'll venture a guess that most of the people one here aren't religious, but even if you are I think it needs viewed as such. This isn't Narnia and was never meant to be.
