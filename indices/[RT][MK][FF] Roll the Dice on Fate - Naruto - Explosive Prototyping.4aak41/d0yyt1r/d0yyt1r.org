Do you think you could combine the smaller meta-chapters together to make more sizeable ones? From what I could tell, you've designated every chapter at around a thousand words - while all of them are concise and well written, it would feel more storyish if you merged all of the smaller arcs into bigger chapters (Worm had an average chapter count of 5000 words).

I know it might seem strange, but trust me - if I were browsing the website looking for stories I'd be much more likely to click on a story that had a 1/5000 chapter to word ratio than one that had a 1/1000.
