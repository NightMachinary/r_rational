Perhaps once it's finished (or at least the first book is finished) I'll do just that. For the moment though I work best when putting out larger numbers of smaller individual chapters. Once I've finished with the story I do plan to run a pass or three back over the whole thing to smooth it out and make sure it all makes sense, and that seems like the kind of thing that would be lumped in with that whole process.
