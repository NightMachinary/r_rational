Just the one actually and a couple extra paragraphs added near the end of the one before that. I was re-arranging some chapters (because of re-writes) to make sure everything was in chronological order, and the interface threw a bit of a hissy fit and e-mailed everyone.

Edit: I did kinda expect something like that to happen, but so far as I could tell it was the only way to re-order things properly. I've added a note to the start of the chapter to explain.
