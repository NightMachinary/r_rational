Yeah, there were all sorts of things that would have been nice to have--sadly it doesn't look like Google forms does random question order, which was one of the things it really needed.

There also needed to be a good way to filter the list, so people could respond just on those they felt strongest on if they were pressed for time. That or a system that would only ask "have you read this" and would progressively unlock other questions based on responses.

At any rate it's served its purpose of giving us a kick start to begin with. If anyone with better statistical background wants to make a more fully featured survey and crunch the numbers, I would highly encourage you to do so!
