To me, rationality within the context of a story means:

A) Things operate according to underlying rules rather than narrative convenience, and

B) Characters behave consistent with their goals and values rather than to further narrative impact.

In RPG crafting circles, we talk about the simulationist / gamist / narrativist triad. Rational fiction is strongly at the simuationist corner.
