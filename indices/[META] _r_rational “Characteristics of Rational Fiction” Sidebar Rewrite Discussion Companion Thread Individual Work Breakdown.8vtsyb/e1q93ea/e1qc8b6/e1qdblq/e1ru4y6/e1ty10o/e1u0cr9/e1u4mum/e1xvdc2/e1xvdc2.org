Oh jeez, hm. I kind of stopped reading Mother of learning after Zorian went back to XP grinding after confronting Red Robe, but from what I've read there wasn't any particular fantasy about being high-status. Worm doesn't show the main character as high status, but she /is/ treated as special to the point where all the major events tend to center around her somehow. I haven't read Optimized Wishing Project. Unsong seemed mostly a /deliberate/ attempt to portray rationality as a superpower, which is fine of course as a concept so I don't have any issue with that.

Maybe I was mostly thinking of Naruto rationalfics? Pretty much every single one of them is a power fantasy of some sort, honestly. The source material might be to blame for that one.
