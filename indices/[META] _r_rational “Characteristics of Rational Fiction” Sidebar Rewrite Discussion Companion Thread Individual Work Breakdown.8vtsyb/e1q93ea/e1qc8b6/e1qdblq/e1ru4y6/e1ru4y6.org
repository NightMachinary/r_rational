Pffff, The Need to Become Stronger is never included on these lists, even though it's one of the best rational fics out there. In my own, uh, 100% objective opinion.

Thanks for putting in the work to crunch this data. The fact that 'intelligent' and 'competent' are listed at the top of the desired criteria kind of fits with my overall impression that readers mainly want stories to make them *feel* smart, which is why power fantasies are so common here despite being inherently irrational. Even we chosen few are not without bias, it seems.

Edit: More specifically, the impression I have is that rational fiction readers want to read stories where people like us have higher relative status, which I suspect is a big reason why NTBS tends not to get included in these lists.
