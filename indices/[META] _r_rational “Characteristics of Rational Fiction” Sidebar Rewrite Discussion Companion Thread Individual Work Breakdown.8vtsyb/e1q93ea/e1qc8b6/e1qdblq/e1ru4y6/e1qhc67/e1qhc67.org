Thanks for explaining. I agree about triaging works - you were already near the limit on a survey very many people will take the time to complete.

I think any edge cases that Delphic might represent are already represented by other works on the list. Here's a quick list of some of the arguments I think people might make that the work isn't rational.

- The work is written in the first person with a narrator, Hector, that is recognized within the work itself as being unreliable. He suffers from derealization/depersonalization and is drug-addicted.

- Hector's goals are not grandiose humanist goals. He wants to "be a hero" but isn't engaged in prompting a technical revolution or saving the world.

- The most rationalist / transhumanist character in the work, Doc Stevens, is treated as a dangerous villain/foil rather than a protagonist. A lot of the characters view his work with disgust and his motives with suspicion.

- The super powers don't make sense / aren't treated the way society actually would / aren't treated consistently in the narrative.

To the extent that each of these points will get hammered-out with respect to other works, Delphic doesn't contribute anything unique to the list.
