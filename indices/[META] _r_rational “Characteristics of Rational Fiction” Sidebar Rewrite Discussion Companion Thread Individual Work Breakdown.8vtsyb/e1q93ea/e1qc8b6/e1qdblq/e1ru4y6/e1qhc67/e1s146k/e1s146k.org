This is usually what I look for in a rational story, so I'm surprised you listed it as something your story doesn't have. (The first three points are not something I look for when I look for a rational story, so I don't mind if it has it or not).

I'm curious now, since we're on the topic of the problems of our definition this week, how do you define rationality?
