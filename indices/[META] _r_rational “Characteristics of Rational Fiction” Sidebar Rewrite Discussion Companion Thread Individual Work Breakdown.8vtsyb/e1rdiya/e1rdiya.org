Surely a more useful measure for the graphs would be graphing the fics against the percentage of people thought that, for example, the fic belonged on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] who answered the survey for that fic? That would help out with the whole disproportionate bars, which really hides what people actually think.

HPMOR being a little low for general appeal for example /really/ indicates a disagreement over where it belongs, rather than friendship is optimal's near unanimous opinion.
