A completely biased selection criteria on my end, I'm afraid. I started by listing all the perennial works I could think of, then added some "controls" (the decidedly non-rational works such as LOTR), then I went to rational reads and the subreddit top-all-time list to see if there were any major items I missed. By that point in the process, I was trying to select for works which were interesting edge cases or controversial, so as to hopefully get helpful data

I myself haven't read Delphic, but more importantly I don't know anything about it, so I didn't know what it would bring to the survey that by the end had nearly sixty entries. It ended up passed over as were several other works for the same reason.
