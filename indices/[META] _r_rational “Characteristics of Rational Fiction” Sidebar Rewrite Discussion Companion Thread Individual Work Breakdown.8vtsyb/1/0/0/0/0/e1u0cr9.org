Oh no, I totally agree that there's nothing wrong with having a competent, intelligent main character who displays a great deal of agency. That part is fine.

The part that is inherently irrational is where the rest of the world accommodates that character to the point where reality seems to bend around them. Stories like e.g. the Miles Vorkosigan Saga which is well-liked here all have that.

Specifically with rational fiction, the issue is that rationality itself is treated as high-status. Even in stories like Marked for Death, where the main characters are just cogs in a machine, it's still the case that their rationality makes them special. Every one of that world's leaders, including Jakuza bosses and other NPCs, have a high degree of rationality because the assumption is that anyone who isn't like us cannot be taken seriously. That's nothing like the real world, in which rationality is inherently about making painful tradeoffs and the most powerful people inevitably optimize for gaining power/status rather than rationality.

I have seen very few stories that adhere to that standard of realism. In fact, I think your example of Waves Arisen is one of the /better/ ones precisely because rationality /doesn't/ get treated as a superpower. I would agree that Animorphs doesn't really fall into this trap, but I can't really think of many others right now.
