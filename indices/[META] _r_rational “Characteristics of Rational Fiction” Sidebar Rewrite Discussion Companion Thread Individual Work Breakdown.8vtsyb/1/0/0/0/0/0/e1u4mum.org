Ok, phrased like that I have a lot less issues with it. I still think it isn't as prevalent a phenomenon as you think it is, but pinning down exactly to what extend a story exhibits this will strongly depend on what exactly you consider rational (especially to what extend you buy into the whole "rationality is winning" thing).

Which of Mother of Learning, Worm, the Optimized Wishing Project and UNSONG would you consider to be treating rationality as a superpower? Because I can see arguments for and against for each of those stories.
