  Which is why power fantasies are so common here despite being inherently irrational.

I think this is kinda unfair on multiple grounds:

1. Having a competent and intelligent main character does not automatically make something a power fantasy, nor does having a main character that people can strive to be like. Take for instance Animorphs the Reckoning, the main characters are all competent, intelligent people, but I would classify that story as something like a thriller or horror story, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from a power fantasy (and that is just the most extreme case among stories I have read).

2. Perhaps linked to the first point, power fantasies might be relatively more common here than in other places (presumably because HPMOR was one), but from a quick count of the 10-ish rational stories that I've read/am currently reading only HPMOR, Mother of Learning and Waves Arisen are clearly power fantasies.

3. Power fantasies are not inherently irrational stories (nor are they automatically /bad/ stories, btw, I greatly enjoyed all three of the above mentioned stories). Why would they be? You can have a disproportionally effective main character that is someone the reader can project onto and still have a story that is set in consistent world, where characters make reasonable/consistent choices, without for the evulz bad guys, where the good guys win or lose based on their own choices, rather than plot conveniences or whatever other criteria you want a rational story to adhere to.
