In terms of munchkinry is anyone here familiar with Dungeons and Dragons or any other tabletop roleplaying games? And if so which ones?

My personal preference is pathfinder amongst the DND games and in terms of munchkinry Anima:Beyond Fantasy. I think Anima is a terrible game to run or play but as a thought exercise for munchkin builds it's incredible.
