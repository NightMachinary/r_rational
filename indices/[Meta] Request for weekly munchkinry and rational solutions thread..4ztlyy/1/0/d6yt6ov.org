D&D 3e (and variants like PF) is the munchkin's dream, as it attempts to simulate every aspect of the world with rules (which takes power away from the GM or "common sense"), and has tons and tons of content designed with varying levels of skill and foresight.

I'm familiar with a bunch of other RPGs, but their rules tend to be either much less flawed, or much more vague. Haven't tried Anima.

I'll give props to D&D 5e for being /terrible/ at actually defining its key rules terms. It allowed me to write [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2e92hw/5e_find_steed_cone_of_cold/][my masterpiece]].
