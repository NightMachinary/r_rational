  I don't think that the caster being the only target of cone of cold follows

  I don't think that a spell necessarily needs to have a target

#+begin_quote
  I don't think having two targets means the spell is cast twice

This is a stronger objection. A reasonable interpretation is that the spell having two targets just means its cone has two points of origin.

But then you have a single cone with two apexes, and geometry breaks down.

#+end_quote

Don't worry, this is just a rules-as-written intellectual exercise completely unrelated to the game as it's actually played. Nobody would get away with this at a gaming table, or even try.
