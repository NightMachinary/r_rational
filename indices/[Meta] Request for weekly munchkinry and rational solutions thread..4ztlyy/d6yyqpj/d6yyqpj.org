Is anyone here familiar enough with Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series to tell me why Gold isn't the best form of allomancy in that world? What stops someone from pulling information from an alternate past that is very similar from there own and very recent? Can I decide to not fight someone who I met 1 hour ago then burn Gold to work out his fighting style from the past where I fought him? This gets much more powerful because you can get information from people from conversations that never happened and with bribes you never paid etc.
