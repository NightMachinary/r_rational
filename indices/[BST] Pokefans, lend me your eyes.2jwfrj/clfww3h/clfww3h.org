In addition to my previous comments on this, (I'm too lazy to find and edit it), I would also like to offer my own explanation:

Pokemon are cleverly disguised (robotic, animatronic, whatever) things sent by aliens and/or other humans in order to preform experiments on things, and it's all an insanely massive scam in which the sufficiently advanced aliens fool equipment and tests with false data in order to preserve the secret and continue to obtain data. The 'Fairy' update was/is going to be a badly retconned-in addition to the experiment in order to add elements and new data.

However, after the addition of the Fairies, /everyone/ knew they'd always been there, they just had this funny feeling of /not remembering/, but that's nothing, right? The only people who believe in that sort of stuff are just crackpot conspiracy theorists on the edges of society, always spouting gibberish about alien conspiracies and Fairy types not being there. I mean, what /sane/ person would listen to /that?/
