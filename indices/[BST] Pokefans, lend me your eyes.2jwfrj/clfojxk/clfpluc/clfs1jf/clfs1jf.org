  If it's really 1000 years, I imagine what would actually happen in a world like our own is that people would assume the ancient records were simply mistaken about the existence of a Fairy type, its properties, and the pokemon assigned to it before considering the idea that the rules actually changed. You could have some staunch traditionalist insist upon it.

Yeah, that's kind of what I had in mind for the hint-dropping. A thousand years would put them back beyond the point of modern technology, and firmly in the scope of legends.

The idea of there being multiple Xernea works too, though that works best paired with a localization effect, which means there can still be stories of Clefairy exhibiting odd properties in other regions from time to time.
