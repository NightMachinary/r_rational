If you want to make things simple, you shouldn't go out of your way to include elements not present in the game your story is based on. If you really want to include, or at least comment on, the Fairy type in the story, I think a periodic event/localization effect is the way to go, since this time next month you'll be able to mention Hoenn in this context as well as Kalos. It looks like the Generation III remakes are going to calmly ignore this dilemma altogether, for the Fairy type and for Mega Evolutions.
