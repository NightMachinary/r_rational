Just a note, it is 3,000 years, not 1,000. At least according to AZ. I mean, even 300 years ago can easily become 3,000 years ago in myths and legends time, but if AZ was telling the truth, he has lived that whole time, so its unlikely /he/ would be wrong.

Unless being an immortal giant who nearly destroyed all life makes you go a little crazy...
