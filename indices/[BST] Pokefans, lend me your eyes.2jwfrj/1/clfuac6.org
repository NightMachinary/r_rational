I generally prefer to retcon things so that they were always there. In Generation 1, there were 150 known species of Pokémon - never mind the millenia old, civilization-defining interactions with other species a few hundred miles away. In Generation 2, Pokémon eggs were just discovered. Before that, Pokémon just... didn't reproduce, I guess?

The Pokémon series does this sort of thing all the time. You certainly /could/ explain it with the Xerneas thing, but that would make the issue of typing even more confusing than it already is. It would make "types" more fundamental to the universe than I think you want them to be. You shouldn't just wave a magic deer and turn on a latent type, just like you can't wave a magic wand and turn on a latent exoskeleton, whatever that would mean.

On the other hand, Fairy is basically pure magic, so if any type can be turned on and off, it would be Fairy. But if you want types to be emergent properties, then you'd have to specifically tell me that Fairy is different from organism-with-oil-bladder. And if Fairy actually is a real fundamental thing, how should I know that Rock is not? Can I trust that you won't pull out special rock-magic the same way you would pull out special fairy-magic?
