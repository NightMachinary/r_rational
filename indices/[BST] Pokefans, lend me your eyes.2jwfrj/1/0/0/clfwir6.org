Make fairy energy similar to Psychic/Ghost/Dark energy then but far less understood and subtle, to the point of not being yet known and used as a separate Type classification.

As to why their moves have different strengths, what Fairy-Type moves actually existed as Normal-Type in the original games? Maybe the trainer has to actually understand and be in tune with whatever Fairy energy is to effectively use it in a way that somehow disturbs Dragons, disrupts the counterpoint Dark energy, surpasses the defenses granted by Ghost energy, confuses complicated Fighting moves and affects hard but porous Rock a bit more than expected?

Harder would be to explain why no one noticed those moves being less effective when it comes to combustion capable Pok√©mon or those with natural immunities to Poison (often because they themselves contain such). Maybe the weakness is subtle and the effects haven't been studied enough because of the rarity of such encounters? Something to do with volatile chemicals?

In any case there seem to be only three second generation moves to change from Normal to Fairy.

Much harder still are the defensive traits though. I can't come up with anything easy and sensible for those changes at the moment.

At worst you just forget those and act as if they were just Normal types, maybe with a few very conditional exceptions that seem to crop up more and more often, culminating to whatever triggers Xerneas awakening?
