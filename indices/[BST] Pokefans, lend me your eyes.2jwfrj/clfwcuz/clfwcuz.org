I would suggest just going with the Xernas explanation. Possibly putting in sources for other kinds of Extra-Physics energy as well? Ex, other legendary Pokemon, like, mew or something, for psychic, etc. (I don't know all the legendary Pokemon and don't know the types properly, Ok? Don't judge me!)

This sort of thing would be a bit better of a handwave thing than 'this type of energy's source is known but all the other far more common ones aren't.'
