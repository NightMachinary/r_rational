Natural fear can be a part of it. If a predator who relies on breathing flame, Arcanine, comes into the territory of something with the ability to quench those flames, Wartortle, and prevent new fires from being started, you might expect the Fire-Breather to be wary of those Water-Breathing creatures. Whereas a Raticate knows it can still bite a Wartortle, whether it's wet or not.
