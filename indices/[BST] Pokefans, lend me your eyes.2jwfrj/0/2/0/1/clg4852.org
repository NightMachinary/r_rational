Part of it is that the typing matchups are much more mechanical than the games can demonstrate.

Water isn't strong against an arcanine the same way it's strong against a slugma. With the latter, "it does more damage" makes sense. But with the former, the reason a water type has an advantage is that its attacks can cancel out the fire type's, which means it has to resort to purely physical attacks while the water type can use its special attacks too.

As for the fire coming from the fur, arcanine can combust their fur the way rapidash can their hair, but it doesn't necessarily hurt to get it quenched. Though it is likely very distracting and uncomfortable.
