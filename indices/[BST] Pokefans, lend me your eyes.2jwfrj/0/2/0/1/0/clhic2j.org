Even considering the various fringe cases where type matchups do not behave as deterministically as it happens in the games, I find it curious that we haven't seen a more deterministic and well thought example of type matchups yet.

If the inhabitants obtain even some 17 cases of clear type differences and impacts and make with them a linear system it woud be trivial to compute the full type chart. With so many Pokémon it should be relatively trivial to get a statistic indication of a general graph, and then the discussion would move more towards each Pokémon's type classification.

I can't help but feel that someone like Bill has gotten the hard data from N official and registered Pokémon battles and wastes quite a bit of time classifying type matchups.
