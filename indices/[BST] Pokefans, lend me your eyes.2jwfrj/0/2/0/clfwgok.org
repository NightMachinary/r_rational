So if it's a descriptions of emergent properties that means in a way you almost /have/ to depart from game canon at various points - For example, a hydro pump should absolutely decimate a Slugma, but there's no particular reason an Arcanine should care any more than a Raticate if it takes a water jet anywhere that's not directly to the fire-pipe, unless you're going to say that the fire stems from the fur somehow.

So while I think the fairy sub-plot is fun and worth doing, you're already sufficiently far away from canon to get away with almost anything you want without people feeling it's "wrong".
