I don't know which one would work better with your story, but I have to say the explanation you came up with is fun and clever.

My impression is that your fictional civilization doesn't quite understand typing yet (like that confusion between poison and grass types between blue and red), but if your civilization contains people constantly battling pokemon for sport and practical purposes, it seems like even if no one was doing science a sudden change would be a pretty significant event, and people would know and wonder about it.

Do you see pokemon types as being physics-style laws (as in, the laws governing the universe specifically mention pokemon types) or more descriptions of emergent properties? (for example, the notion that water is strong against fire somehow being a result of the fact that water cuts off combustion from oxygen as an oxidizing agent, would make the water vs. fire relationship emerge from a different set of rules)
