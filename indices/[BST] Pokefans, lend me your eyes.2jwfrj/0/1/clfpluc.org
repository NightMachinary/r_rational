If you are comfortable with stretching the canon a bit more, you /could/ have the later-Generation Fairy types present ...except they lose the Fairy type, or are transformed into Normal type just like Togepi, Clefairy, and jigglypuff if they are pure-fairy type. That would allow you to use the cool explanation while keeping any conspicuous fairy types you had in mind for plot in the story. It would be a cool little "wait, what? that's normal type?" moment for the reader, which would happen to have a perfectly good explanation.

You don't actually have to answer the physics/emergent question, but this provides an interesting opportunity for the /characters/ to consider the distinction. After all, many of the legendary pokemon are considered gods. It's fitting for them to alter big laws, and the challenges that posed to those who are trying to figure out which laws are universal constants and which are just local peculiarities.

For example, if Fairy type appears and disappears (in sync with Xerneas's hibernation habits, although I don't know whether the characters are aware of Xerneas or not) it means that Type law must on certain other factors, and that we don't know the whole story.

If it's really 1000 years, I imagine what would /actually/ happen in a world like our own is that people would assume the ancient records were simply mistaken about the existence of a Fairy type, its properties, and the pokemon assigned to it before considering the idea that the rules actually changed. You could have some staunch traditionalist insist upon it.

If you want to get around /that/, then there are multiple Xernea, they have a localized effect, and there were no fairies in earlier versions because the Xernea weren't nearby. That's generally a model that works for all legendary pokemon - there could be more than one, but they are rare and powerful so a local mythology develops around them. (We do much the same with our own animals, despite them not being powerful).
