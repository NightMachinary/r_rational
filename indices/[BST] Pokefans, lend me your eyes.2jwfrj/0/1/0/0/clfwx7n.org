In general, I think the world makes a lot more sense if there are multiple legendaries, although they don't necessarily have to be in the ecosystem or reproduce like the others.

Pokemon like Mewtwo can get a pass for uniqueness, but it's kind hard to design a universe where some individual Pokemon is /actually/ the sole embodiment of Big Concepts like Life, God, Space, Time or whatever, and then not have weird, universe ending implications when a trainer catches them or they get defeated by some Gastly with destiny bond.
