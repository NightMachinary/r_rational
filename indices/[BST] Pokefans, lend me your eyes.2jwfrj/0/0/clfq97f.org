Red in the story does cast doubt on "The Type Chart" meme, saying it is mostly just cultural baggage from the early days of pokemon, and that it is the actual reality of "Water physically prevents fire" that created it.

Which is why the only problem Daystar faces is rationalizing a "Fairy Type" pokemon's sudden immunity to dragon fire, not the type itself.
