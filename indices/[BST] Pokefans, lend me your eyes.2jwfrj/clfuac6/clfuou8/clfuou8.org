Yeah, there's a definite division between the types that are emergent properties and those that aren't.

As you said, the Fairy type is basically mystical: that's part of why I made Daisy's clefairy show abilities with so much of a "wow" factor, to ease in the idea that Red might not be completely correct in his belief that the types are *all* merely descriptive.

Dragon energy, as well as Psychic/Ghost/Dark energy, are the other things that, as "Types," clearly stand apart from physics as we know it, but I'm also going into those last three quite a bit this chapter, so I'm curious to find out how well you think the description of them walks the line.
