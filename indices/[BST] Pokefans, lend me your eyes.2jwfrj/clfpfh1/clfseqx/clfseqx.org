  If at all possible, you might want to wait until ORAS comes out. I'm getting a feeling that XY & ORAS are actually a part of a sort of "universe reset" timeline, and ORAS's story might lend something to that. Especially with the Hoopa side-plot.

I'm definitely going to be interested in ORAS's story, since they take place at the same time :) I plan to keep the focus of my story firmly on Kanto, but the events in Hoenn will make waves (so to speak) far and wide, and there might be an interlude or two that takes place there.

  Sylveon, for example. Any random affectionate trainer who teaches their Eevee charm could concievably evolve it into a Sylveon, but for some-one reason this only happens in Kalos.

Or only happens when a Xerneas is out of hibernation, and the rest of the time possible Sylveons remain dormant as Eevees and evolve into something else.

To be honest the whole method of evolving Sylveon is too gamey anyway, and I'm going to be tweaking some of the Eevee evolutions mechanics.

  Your Awakened Xerneas theory is good, but I can see one small problem. Moves like Moonlight, that were retconned fairy type. If "Fairy Magic" comes from Xerneas, then why do these moves still work exactly the same? And all the moves that are only fairy type, what happens to them?

Well this is actually another problem with the way the game arbitrarily classifies things: the Moon is given huge importance for Fairy pokemon, with moves like Moonlight and Moonblast, and pokemon like Clefairy praying/singing to the moon.

But pokemon that are inherently tied to the moon, like Lunatone or Cressalia, were not retconned as Fairy types. And Clefairy is actually the only Fairy type pokemon that learns Moonlight, while the rest are non-Fairy types.

So the typing of moves can be left to interpretation if it doesn't really make sense within Pokemon's own internal logic. For example, I'm not making "Bite" attacks dark type. It's one of those really illogical things that the game does for mechanical balancing reasons (when Dark was introduced there were virtually no moves for it, so they converted some existing ones).
