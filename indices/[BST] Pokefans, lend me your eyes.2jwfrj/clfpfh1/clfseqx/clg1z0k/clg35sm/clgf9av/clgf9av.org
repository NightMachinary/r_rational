I always imagined Fighting type as, like, ki stuff. Or just the whole Aura thing that really should have been a bigger thing than it was; there's really no reason it *couldn't* be used to +handwave+ explain the extra properties of all fighting-type moves. Even Counter and Detect, which make enough sense as martial arts techniques, make just a little bit less sense in the Pok√©mon world, and it couldn't really hurt to say "Aura is why it works on sea serpents and space aliens in equal measure"
