If at all possible, you might want to wait until ORAS comes out. I'm getting a feeling that XY & ORAS are actually a part of a sort of "universe reset" timeline, and ORAS's story might lend something to that. Especially with the Hoopa side-plot.

In the immediate sense however, it could be said that Kalosian Jigglypuff are Fairy Type, while Kantoan, etc., Jigglypuff are just Normal. You could link it back to Xerneas, and the war 3000 years ago, perhaps had a regional effect which gave those pokemon special powers.

However, since ORAS is technically contemporaneous with the Kanto games, and those games will have Mega-Evolutions and Fairy types, which were "discovered" upwards of 15 years later in XY, it might be better to just take the same approach Gamefreak does, and just make new things, always things.

Edit: Sylveon, for example. Any random affectionate trainer who teaches their Eevee charm could concievably evolve it into a Sylveon, but for some-one reason this only happens in Kalos.

Edit 2: Your Awakened Xerneas theory is good, but I can see one small problem. Moves like Moonlight, that were retconned fairy type. If "Fairy Magic" comes from Xerneas, then why do these moves still work exactly the same? And all the moves that are only fairy type, what happens to them?
