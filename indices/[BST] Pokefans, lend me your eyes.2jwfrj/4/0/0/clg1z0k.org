I've heard that the dark type is meant to be interpreted as dirty fighting/dishonour. At least, the physical side of it. That's why fighting is good against it (honourable justice prevails), and why dark is good against psychic (all the telekinesis in the world won't save you if you don't see the hit coming).\\
It's also why dark is bad against steel - underhanded tricks won't help you punch through metal.

In this sense, it's clear that Bite is a dark attack, alongside the likes of sucker punch, thief and feint attack.

edit: uh, really like your story by the way :>\\
It's very clear that you've thought carefully about the pokemon world, and come up with some awesome ideas for it. Fight on!
