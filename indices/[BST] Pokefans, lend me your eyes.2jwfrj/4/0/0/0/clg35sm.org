Yeah, that explanation works a lot better for the physical moves rather than the special ones, but even then it just doesn't make much sense why a move like Bite would, say, pierce through a steel pokemon's hide, or harm a ghost, when normal teeth wouldn't. Also "Fighting" as honor/light works a lot better in Japanese culture than elsewhere I think :)

And thank you, I'm glad you're enjoying it!
