Second [[/u/Geminii]]; you aren't writing a DC Lantern story, so skip their fluff and make it original.

A couple questions:

- Why should all members of a particular color faction have the same goals?
- You make a point that DC comics doesn't exist but Marvel does. Why? I can see "DC never did a Green Lantern comic" or "superhero comics were never a thing" but why ban /just/ DC?\\
