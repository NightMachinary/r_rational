I guess I don't know enough about Lantern lore to know about good/evil alignment. I had just assumed that the "emotional spectrum" was alignment neutral, similar to how the characters in Inside Out are alignment neutral (there it's Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger). Placing emotions on an alignment axis seems ... artificial to me, and I think I'd like it better as a long-standing alliance of convenience than something true to the universe.

I'm most curious about the replacement of Fear with Apathy. The canon counter to Fear is Willpower, but maybe something like "Caution" or "Hesitance" would be a better opposite than Apathy? Also, how does "Control" differ from "Willpower"?

Edit: As a general comment, I think reducing the DC universe down to one particular element is usually a good thing, since it allows for far greater consistency and a better exploration of whatever your thesis is. If you're just taking the Kitchen Sink world that is DC, there are too many questions that need answering and too many complicating factors.
