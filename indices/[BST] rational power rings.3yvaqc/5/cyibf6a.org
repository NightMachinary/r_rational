I'd love to read this story, but I think you've changed enough that you're justified in divorcing it from DC canon entirely and making an original series. Fan-fiction is frowned on in literary circles, and it would probably be easier for a reader to accept your story as a completely new space-fantasy setting than an offshoot of DC's universe.

That then frees you up to inject all sorts of crazy ideas without worrying about contradicting DC lore.

I'd like some elaboration on what the different emotions mean - just a short sentence explaining the role of each. For example, what's the difference between Love and Compassion, and between Willpower and Control?
