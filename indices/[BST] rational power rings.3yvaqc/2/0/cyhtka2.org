The main reason to remove all DC comics is simplicity. DC has so many crossovers with things like the justice league and the darkest night story-lines that simply removing the Lanterns would leave lots of weird gaps. I can see leaving in some hero's like batman and superman who can relatively easily be split from DC by not having them join these groups but I'll probably do this on a case by case basis and just say their all part of Marvel. Over time maybe the factions will grow but at the beginning the idea is that each ring type will gain one user and therefore differences in the faction won't matter to begin. Also generally it's probably safe to assume if someone chooses to make another ring and give it to someone they would only give it to someone with a similar ideology to themselves
