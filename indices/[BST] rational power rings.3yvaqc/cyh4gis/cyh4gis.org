Given the amount of DC lore you're tossing out, it might be easier to go the whole way and not have the two factions be 'Lanterns' with 'rings', but just two multispecies factions with some other kind of devices or granted effect, unless you're going to have a mandatory/major plot twist revolve around a canon weakness of the Lantern rings.
