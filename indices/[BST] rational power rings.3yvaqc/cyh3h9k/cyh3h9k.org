This sounds a lot like Babylon 5, with the Vorlons versus the Shadows. It also sounds like the problem with being a Protector, from Niven's Known Space.

It also sounds a lot like "Would you rather be happy, or free?" - which always has the weird other meaning that being free means you'll make bad choices and not be happy.

It also sounds like the Chaos lanterns exist solely in opposition to the Order lanterns.

Which is dumb. Planets are big. Like, really big. With some notable exceptions that really shouldn't make a difference in the self-will-ness of individuals, what happens on one continent really doesn't have much effect on another.

But you have an excellent answer up in the title - Rings of Rationality. Work it like a combo Death Note / Rational LOTR - Some possibly random people, unknown to each other, get a cool magic item, and that item lets you compute your Path to Victory. Maybe also empowers you to skip some of the physical steps.

Notably, does not help you determine what Victory actually /means/.
