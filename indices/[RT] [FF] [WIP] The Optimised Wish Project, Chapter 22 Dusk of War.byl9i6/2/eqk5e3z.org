Baba's first scene opens with her saying divination is a tricky business. Then later she has a vision that seems to imply Mai's master is Kami, but we know her master is actually Piccolo. Piccolo is Kami's split off evil half, so her divination powers might be confused or misleading her? Unless this is implying Mai is going to switch sides later, but that seems really unlikely right now.
