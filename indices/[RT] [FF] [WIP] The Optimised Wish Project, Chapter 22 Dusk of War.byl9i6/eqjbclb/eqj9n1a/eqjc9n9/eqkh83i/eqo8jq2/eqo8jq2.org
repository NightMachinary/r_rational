Well, it's not a /specific/ training, if Krillin can take a punch from a similarly powered fighter without dying, he can take a bullet; the amount of force involved is more or less the same (and a fighter with good technique could also concentrate it in a similarly small area). The "I haven't trained you for this" bit referred more to psychological preparation, as in, to be steeled to react to something that unexpected and reckless. Like how you could be an Olympic fencer but still lose in a real duel if the opponent will just suddenly kick sand in your face or use some other dirty trick before stabbing you.
