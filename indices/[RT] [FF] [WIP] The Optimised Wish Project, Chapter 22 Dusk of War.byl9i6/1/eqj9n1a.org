So Yamcha is (mostly) bulletproof, but Krillin is not? I would place Krillin as more powerful than Yamcha, but it seems training at Capsule Corp toughened him up more than I thought.

Maybe it was a higher caliber? Can't find explicit mention of what the weapons are, other than them being one-handed guns.

Or maybe Krillin would have tanked the bullet, and Muten was just showing off.
