Krillin could have tanked it, but there's a few factors. First, a blow taken while you're off guard can hurt more. You need to be "powered up" to maximise defense (though even relaxed they never get back to regular human levels). Second, it still hurts. Roughly at this point I'd say: handgun => hurts like being hit with a metal bar could for you or me, high speed/caliber ammo from a rifle => stabs but remains superficial, and something like the grenade would have done some serious damage. Muten wasn't about to let his student be hit like that, even if he knew it wouldn't have /killed/ him.

Re: the guns, I'm not an expert nor I know how much the power can vary within handgun models (aside for the legendary 44 Magnum...). I'm thinking of these as something like your basic Beretta M9, or at least, their in-world equivalent.
