I'm not sure I understand what are you trying to show. My argument was more about expected utility: if you decide for all people who believe they are Jesus, /including real Jesus/, then you should continue saving mankind instead of taking medication.

(assuming that taking medication is harmful to real Jesus and that there is a non-negligible probability of Jesus existing. I don't believe in both of them, but willing to assume those for the sake of argument).
