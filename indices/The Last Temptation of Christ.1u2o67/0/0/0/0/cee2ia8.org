I was trying to show how you would decide the questions of "Am I sane?" and "Am I Jesus?". I don't think TDT really comes into it, since it can be decided whether or not you actually are Jesus: you don't have to decide for a whole class of maybe-Jesus-guys, just yourself.

  My argument was more about expected utility: if you decide for all people who believe they are Jesus, including real Jesus, then you should continue saving mankind instead of taking medication.

Problem being that 99.999% of the time, your actions as a psychotic maniac are actually harmful to others and don't save mankind at all.
