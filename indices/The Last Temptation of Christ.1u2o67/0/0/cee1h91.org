  It's a bit hard to swallow, but it seems that if you are TDT agent, and (maybe, mistakenly) believe that you a person who is going to accomplish something very important, you should disregard any doubts and act on assumptions that you are sane.

I don't see how the old maxim to /Believe in the you who believes in yourself/ actually applies here.

The basic reasoning problem here is to consider hypothesis P(Am Jesus | Evidence). Note that your belief that you're Jesus is not /a priori/ evidence of psychosis, except insofar as psychotics are likely to believe they're Jesus Christ. P(Believe I'm Jesus | Psychotic) * P(Psychotic) = P(Psychotic | Believe I'm Jesus) * P(Believe I'm Jesus).

So actually, we want P(Psychotic | Believe I'm Jesus) / P(Believe in Jesus | Psychotic). If the former is 99,999/100,000, then what's the latter? What fraction of psychotics believe they're Jesus? We could thus calculate a low probability of being psychotic and have to evaluate the Jesus Hypothesis at the object level, consider P(I'm Jesus | Available Evidence), which would then involve considering the mountain and the Devil /in favor/, considering the quality of my knowledge of what constitutes being Jesus (the strongest argument available for my being Jesus is that I /don't know his story because I'm still living it/), and considering the medication as evidence against.
