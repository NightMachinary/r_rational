  Then again, is "not remembering" really the best evidence?
#+end_quote

There's a difference between "not remembering" in the sense of having forgotten and "not remembering" in the sense of events still being in your subjective future. Forgettings still leave a causal "hole" in your other memories, a missing factor in events you can remember. Future events simply haven't had any causal influence on you yet.

  Though that's a strong point. I wonder what the Devil's rebuttal would have been.

It would have been fun to see our Maybe!Jesus ask the Maybe!Devil, "Do /you/ know how I will have handled this temptation?" The Devil, if we say he's our Omega figure, then has to maintain a very /careful/ informational ambiguity, because we've put /him/ on the spot of acting timelessly. If he doesn't act timelessly in this situation, he'll reveal whether we're Jesus or not.
