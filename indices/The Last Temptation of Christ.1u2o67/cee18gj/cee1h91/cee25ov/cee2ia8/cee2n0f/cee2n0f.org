  you don't have to decide for a whole class of maybe-Jesus-guys, just yourself.

The point is that the rational decision theory of 100,000 insane guys and Jesus, given identical (deluded) inputs, must necessarily come to the same conclusion. That's what makes them a TDT set - the devil essentially acts as Omega in this story, equalizing available inputs.

Though that's a strong point. I wonder what the Devil's rebuttal would have been. Then again, is "not remembering" really the best evidence?
