The answer to that would probably be, a person *can* exit without a contract. We know the gate was designed to be escaped; it would make little sense that the creators would allow a bound primordial to exact a price from the intended user in this way.

Rather than betraying the rest of them, I suspect that Silverlake actually used her expertise in dimensionalism and apparent knowledge of primordials to finagle a way through. And I honestly couldn't blame her- the alternative was a form of death by erasure. I can't vouch for her sense of loyalty, but she might be capable of more easily ending the restarts now that she is outside of them. I suppose the question then becomes, can she act quickly enough (with respect to time dilation) to release the others before it is too late?
