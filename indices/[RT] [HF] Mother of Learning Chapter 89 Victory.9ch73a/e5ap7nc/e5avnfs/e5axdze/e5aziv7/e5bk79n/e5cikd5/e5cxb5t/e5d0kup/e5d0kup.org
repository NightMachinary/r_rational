This is just speculation for my part, but I have a hunch that the time loop is a mechanism for draining the primordial's power. It's a built-in function of his prison.

Also, we don't really have a clear idea about the true number of restarts that have occurred. It's entirely possible that in aggregate, the loops are still taking place for a substantial portion of the month they are supposed to emulate. Or even, that the end of the loops coincides with the end of the month itself.

We'll just have to find out. There isn't enough information to make any kind of accurate prediction.
