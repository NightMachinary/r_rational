  This was where blood magic came into play. It allowed a mage to anchor the spell not only to their mana reserves, but to their life force as well. The resulting connection was deep and potent - potent enough that the user's descendants had a chance to inherit the ability in question as a bloodline.

Said this chapter, so it already sounds a lot like a bloodline to me. I'm just fuzzy on the distinction whether it can only be considered a "bloodline" only if the soul is involved (i.e. it won't be a "bloodline" for Zorian/Zach/Damian but it would be considered one for their descendants that inherit it - which kinda brings up the question of how it manages to touch the children's soul. Something during conception?), or if the form it's shown as-is in this chapter is already considered a bloodline. Which should mean that a reset would wipe out the newly gained abilities, I think, since it was established before that a reset restores the life force to a before-timeloop normal. Which in turn made me wonder if they couldn't have set aside the last three days or so of each loop to actually do heavy experimentation, instead of just Zorian learning the theory work.
