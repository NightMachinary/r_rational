I was honestly surprised that Zorian rejected Panaxeth's offer so quickly. I'd figure he'd at least consider it and maybe try to haggle for something looser. Being able to work on breaking through to the time loop by messing with it from the outside might easier then trying to break out of it from the inside.

Who knows, maybe Silverlake will do just that and begrudgingly lend some aid from the outside.
