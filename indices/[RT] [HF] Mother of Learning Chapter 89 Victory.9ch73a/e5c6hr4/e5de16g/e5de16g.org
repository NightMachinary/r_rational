"Next Silverlake" as in "a skilled mage" or "an antagonistic, selfish asshole who almost literally sold her soul to an immortal godmonster"?

That said, I think Kirielle is going to become a mage if nothing fatal happens. She's very interested in that, and Zorian is more than happy to teach her. But that's for the future, and I don't see any reason at all why they'd try to use time dilation to train her of all the people instead of letting her progress in the normal world.
