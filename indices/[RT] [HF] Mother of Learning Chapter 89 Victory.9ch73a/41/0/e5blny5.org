Do you think Silverlake has been removed from the time loop back to the real world at this point? The fact that she disappeared makes me think it might be the case. I am also real curious about what happens in the next loop. Based on whether she is soul killed or just reset, we would get strong evidence of whether or not Veyers is RR.
