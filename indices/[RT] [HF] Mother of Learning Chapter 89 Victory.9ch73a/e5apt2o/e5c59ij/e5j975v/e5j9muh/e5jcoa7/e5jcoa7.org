Well, Zorien called Aleric in and brought the whole army in on the important mansion that was the layover for the invasion. Once that was taken out the whole thing got called off. And that was Zorien acting alone. Now that they've got an absolutely massive team shutting down the invasion by getting their country's military at the issue early should be even easier.

And that's not even considering the vastly improved level of skills that everyone who's used the timeloop has, along with the knowledge of foresight.

Based on feats, Zorien at this point in the time loop would probably make short work of Red Robes by himself, or at the very least be able to hold his own until a whole team of archmages could take him down.

Unless new players show up like gods and angles who start fighting directly I don't see the invasion being much of an issue. Maybe Panthrax could pull something, but the author's already stated in the comments that the end of the third arc is going to be very shortly after they exit the timeloop. Maybe if there was a full fourth act already worked into the plot, and not just something the author decided to tack on to show the aftermath, I would see something like that happening. As it is though the end of the time loop seems to mark the end of the most significant challenge of the story.
