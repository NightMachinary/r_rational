If that was her goal she wouldn't have disappeared, she'd pretend to work with them while picking off the temps as they go. She's pretty smart and always plays close to the vest. Why out herself at this moment?

panaxeth isn't gonna let her go do stuff, because then she'll be able to try the other ideas they had cooked up... Which means she might not /need/ his help. That's why he wanted an oath right this second.

I doubt you can soul kill a controller anyway. And if she kills all the temps, zach and zorian could just, yanno, /leave/ the loop completely. Before this I would have worried that the guardian wouldn't accept zorian as a controller, but this ch shows how completely different the markers are, they'd both be fine~

if they gotta fight silverlake... Meh, they have half a month before the loop ends and all the key parts. She can't take the two of them in combat.
