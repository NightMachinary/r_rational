My thoery: the ritual freeing the primordial actually taints the gate, this caused the gate to activate, the primordial choose a "champion" who didn't actually have a marker at all but who he was resetting manually, that he would release into the real world after his training bringing a savior to the cult of the dragon who would grow it and help course correct it towards whatever long game he has in mind.

When zorain stopped the the ritual the one time it actually killed red robe, explaining why he was so weak to lose to a gun, so rather then risk redoing his training again with the loop ending rather soon the primordial simply took his prophet to the real world with the power he had thinking it was worth the risk he was underpowered.... It wasn't so now he needs another high risk prophet to guide his cult towards his exit play and silver lake was a fine choice for that offer.

Testible prediction: only those with high dimensionalism skills were offered, ideally those directly part of the glass sphere they made as it got the big guys attention.
