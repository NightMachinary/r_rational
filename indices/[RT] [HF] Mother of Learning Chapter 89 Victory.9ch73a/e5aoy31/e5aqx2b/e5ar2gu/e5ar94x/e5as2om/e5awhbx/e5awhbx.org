I think RR leaving was logical and an important part of the novels progression.

It's on you if you don't think the mystery matters.

RR was able to shrug off an entire Aranean ambush while still being weak to psychics. I think his identity and motives are going to be an important part of the final arc.

If Red Robe is a Red Herring it'd make me laugh.
