  If anything it'd be easier to reproduce that outside the loop as that was before Zorian and Zack learned the vast majority of the valuable information and skills they now possess

Nope, because they lost all the tactical information the aranea matriarch had collected when Zorian's memory packet decayed, and the enemy is going to be able to summon powerful demons outside the time loop. Information collected since then is incomplete since it doesn't account for Red Robe's actions, assuming he's still alive, or the demon summoning.
