You may think I still entertain that RR might be the true marker holder. I say it doesn't matter. Panaxeth imply that RR is not a true marker holder, and that's it. No relation with what characters in story may think. No relation with what readers may think. Especially no relation with what readers may think.

It follow steps I didn't expand as to why I can say Panaxeth implied so. But basically, the possession process that must be undergone by all non-true marker holder is terribly difficult. Even if the body they're trying to possess is their own, which has one-of-a-kind compatibility, they already has a soul in it. On top of that, they themselves are soul without brain, bound to be unthinking and unfeeling. Imagine a chance of an unthinking soul possessed a perfectly healthy occupied body, I'd like to think it's infinitesimally low.

That's why, toward all non-true marker holder, Panaxeth offered to incarnate: no need to bother with possession process, your survival guaranteed, just like the holder of true marker.
