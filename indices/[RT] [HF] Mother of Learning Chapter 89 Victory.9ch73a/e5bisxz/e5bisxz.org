Sometimes its good for the expected betrayer to be the betrayer instead of trying to surprise us, it would be stupid if it was Taivan or something like that. Again author shows unique way of showing power. Instead smashing and explosion, we see influence and knowledge, the primordial being able to exert influence outside of its prison is both believable and impressive.

Silverlake made a dumb move, she now has all of the cast against her. They are also free to raid her home at will for info, she is also competing against Red Robe too.
