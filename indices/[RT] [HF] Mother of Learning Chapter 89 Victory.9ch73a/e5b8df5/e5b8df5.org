Damn, that was a good chapter.

I am shocked that only Silverlake apparently took the deal, it sounds like there are plenty of other temporary loopers (many that are not even necessarily named characters).

Interesting that the primordial threatens death if a person reneges on the deal. He/she is trapped in the dimensional prison. How can they harm people that are outside of that exactly?

The team apparently now have full admin rights for the loop. I wonder if there is an overwrite in there to give people a permanent marker or something similar. Maybe that is how Red Robe got it in the first place?
