Regardless. She was always bad news. Only the mc never decided to see it properly. Either trick her into helping you and remove her marker, because she's a great risk already; or don't enlist her help, figure it out otherwise. Even if she hadn't betrayed them then and they'd gotten out of the loop, she would have likely used her gained experience to do some shady shit outside. Her personality was clear as sun from day one. What pisses me off is that I knew it, and I hoped the story would just disappoint me, but what do you know, lol. I'm certain there were many other choices. I only read the next chapter to confirm the betrayal, and there the mc goes into this bs spiral of reasons he had to add her to the group and that he wouldn't have, had he expected something like this. Well, you don't expect shit like this. You just expect the behavior of a person, and her expected behavior needed no explanation.
