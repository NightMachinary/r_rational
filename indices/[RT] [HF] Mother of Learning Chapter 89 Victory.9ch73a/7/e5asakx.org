I am very much okay with this, Silverlake is so much more of a threatening antagonist than RR that I am very excited to see her act, I imagine we will see them escaping the loop somehow very soon. do not believe that Panaxeth could stop them, however it is likely going to take another restart, which will terminate all of the current temporary markers, so I think they are going to have to leave at the very last minute. The conflict outside is going to be mayhem, the group that escapes is going to be up against Silverlake and likely RR backed by the cult of the Dragon Below and the Ibasaan Invaders (which means QI).
