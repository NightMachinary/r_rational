Note quite.

The regular method depends on having a soul-less body outside the loop. Only the original looper (Zack) can exit using that method.

RR tried it while not having left his body vacant on the outside to be reclaimed. Which is the same position Zorian and the temporary looper find themselves in which is why the primordial offered to "incarnate" them, that is manufacture a body for their soul outside the loop.

This tracks with what Zorian said about their options where he was pretty sure they could get their souls out this loop, whereas a walk out solution was low probability but probably also possible with sufficiently advanced bypassing of the intended system.
