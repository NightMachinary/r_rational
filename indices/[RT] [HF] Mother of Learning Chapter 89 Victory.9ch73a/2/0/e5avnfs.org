I think Panaxeth has to be lying. The gate was barred when Z&Z first entered the gate. If RR didn't leave, that means that the gate is barred by default, which doesn't make sense. I am highly doubtful that RR managed to get all the Key pieces without Zach noticing, so the gate was probably unbarred at some point without the Key. If RR didn't leave, why would the gate be barred, because Panaxeth has no motivation to do it, unless he was lying about being unable to transport people to the real world when the gate is barred as well. So RR probably did leave, which barred the gate.
