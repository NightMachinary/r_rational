That analogy doesn't really work when the entity has already opened communication with the "ant".

I mean, if it's bothering to comunicate with you that means it has a goal you can affect which will be best served by you changing your behavior (even if that goal is just amuse itself by messing with you). At which point it has every incentive to say whatever it thinks will get the desired behavior; whether that is revealing a truth you didn't know an letting you act in your own best interest or lying to get you to act against your best interest depend entirely on the situation.
