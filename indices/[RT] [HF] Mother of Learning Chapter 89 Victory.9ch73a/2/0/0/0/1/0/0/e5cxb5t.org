It was implied that the timeloop is almost instant in a few places,

first when ghost serpent first explained the loop to them in ch 53:

#+begin_quote
  The triangle is the world of In-Between. It exists between the moments, constantly destroyed and recreated anew. A lifetime condensed in a moment. We are all trapped in this place, phantoms created for the Branded Ones like you to learn from and test themselves against. When the fires that fuel the world of In-Between run out, we will all fade away into the void... except for the Branded One, who will go to the End, to live through this month one last time
#+end_quote

Then zorian explains it to zach in 54:

#+begin_quote
  have no proof, but hear me out. It is clear that, in order for this whole setup to work, we have to be under an insane amount of temporal acceleration right now. Otherwise, how could only a moment pass in the real world while we spend decades or even centuries in this... looping world?"
#+end_quote

Zach then explains it to xvim and alanic in ch58:

#+begin_quote
  "The copy of the world exists in its own pocket dimension that is under tremendous time dilation. From the point of the copy-people living in this copy-world, the original world is frozen between moments. A hundred years passes in a fraction of a second.
#+end_quote

Anyway, if that's not how it goes, then that's at least how the characters think it does.
