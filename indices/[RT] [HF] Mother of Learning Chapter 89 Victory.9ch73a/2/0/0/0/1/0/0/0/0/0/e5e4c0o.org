I'm not sure. Maybe such a sensitive and complex undertaking requires specific, repeatable conditions. Having all the planets oriented in the same direction might be a control against interference from multiple gravitational vectors, a hacky solution to the n-body problem.

Also, the summer festival is supposed to coincide with the alignment, upon which the loops would have been initiated normally. For some reason, the loops happened a month early. I'm not sure why (perhaps because the primordial was going to be released before the alignment?) but I would wager that this is a contributing reason for the instability of the loops this go-around.

  If you only want to drain the primordial's power then you should just initiate the Sovereign Gate whenever.

What if you want to harness it as a battery for other purposes? There is a lot that we just don't know, especially about the gods. I look forward to seeing how the story unfolds.
