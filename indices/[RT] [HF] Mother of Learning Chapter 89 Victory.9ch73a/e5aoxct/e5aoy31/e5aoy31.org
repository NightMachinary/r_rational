WHAT A TWIST

Though to be fair, Silverlake was always portrayed as a self-obsessed schemer.

Do you think Red Robe is actually dead? It would feel like a bit of a let down, but Silverlake as the Big Bad could also work. Her character has been given a lot of development and we know she's a fearsome opponent, even without the assistance of a primordial.
