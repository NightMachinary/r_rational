I kind of think RR would be a let down of a final opponent anyways. He's no match for Zach in combat and couldn't even subdue Zorian effectively. If they came across him now, he wouldn't even know to have QI for backup, and it would be the shortest fight in the story possibly including the encounter with the Eye beast.

I don't think he's dead, since that wouldn't allow for any resolution to who he is. Panexeth may have made the same deal with him, but RR probably did leave the loop, because the gate was barred.
