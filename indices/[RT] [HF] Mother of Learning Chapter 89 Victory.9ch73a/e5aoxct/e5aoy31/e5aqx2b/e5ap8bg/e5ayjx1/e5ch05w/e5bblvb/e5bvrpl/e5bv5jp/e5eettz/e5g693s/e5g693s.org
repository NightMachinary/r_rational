Personally, I feel like they're basically doomed by the fact that we skipped over the whole five loops; we actually have more knowledge of and investment in baseline Taiven than in looper!Taiven, at this point.

(That said, I could still see Zorian pulling out some sort of memory packet gambit to come up with a way to basically merge them all with their outside-the-loop versions.)
