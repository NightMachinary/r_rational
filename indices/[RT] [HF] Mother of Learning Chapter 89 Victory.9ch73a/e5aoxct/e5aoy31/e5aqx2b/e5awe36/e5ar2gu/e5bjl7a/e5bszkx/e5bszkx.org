I am curious as to how they plan to stop the invasion in the real world. They did so in the past by accident when they launched the frontal assault to get the gate, but I don't recall any specific efforts towards diffusing the invasion without such an attack. There's also the issue that the real invaders will be able to call on demons and other spirits for backup, which they obviously can't account for while in the loop.
