You're right, it doesn't really sit well with me either. But the only rational and reasonable way those questions could be answered, with things as they stood prior to RR's death, involved Zorian mind-jacking the equivalent of a Villain's Monologue from RR.

That... wouldn't really be satisfying either, in my opinion.

RR bailed too early. He was never enough of a threat. His mystique kind of lost importance after Z&Z could take on Quatach-Ichl. The mystery stopped mattering.

Silverlake is a compromise, but it's one I can live with.
