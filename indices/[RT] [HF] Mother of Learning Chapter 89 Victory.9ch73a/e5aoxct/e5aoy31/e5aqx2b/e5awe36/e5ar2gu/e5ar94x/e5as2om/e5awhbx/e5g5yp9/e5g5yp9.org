Yeah, I'm still disappointed that Red Robe left after act 1 - I get it, sure, but I just feel like once there wasn't an enemy time traveler forcing caution and keeping things on their toes, the story's just kind of drifted downhill. (Especially as the scale exploded and the whole “closed circle mystery” aspect where brute-forcing the problems was impossible and the real strategy was to build versatility and understanding of what's happening collapsed. I feel like the way we timeskipped over the two biggest chances to focus on character-building again in the last few chapters is really indicative.)

I mean, it's still a good story, don't get me wrong, but the first act was up there with the potential to be one of the best time travel stories I'd ever read, while at this point it mostly just feels like a decent one.
