Oh fuck.

That's actually a really good twist with Red Robe not mattering at all. (Unless Panaxeth is lying which is a possibility). Silverlake is a fundamentally greedy person, she has a lot of information, and she already wants to work with Quatach Ichl. Now she has to, to make sure the invasion succeeds, or at least the primordial escapes.

What a cliffhanger though.
