Excellent Chapter!

I was really torn between wanting to see how they would capture each piece of the key within a month and actually seeing the story progress. On one hand we would have gotten to read some cool battle scenes but, the story already has plenty of those and it is certainly better for the story to progress.

This totally leaves room for a sequel right? Zach and Zorian can leave the timeloop, maybe with others, and then the next story will be about capturing Red Robe and Silverlake and stopping them.
