Next reset, if their is one (Would be hilarious if it just ends), the group can finally investigate the full silverlake house. dig into her recipes and everything. I do agree with everyone that they are now forced to get one more ancient mage, and that it may have to be QI, but that does not sound so rationalist to me. Definitely a desperate move.
