The situation is so fucked up. From what Panaxeth said (assuming no lies) it seems they cannot leave "alive" aka with their bodies. So I assume their souls can leave. For Zach no issue (has soulless body), for Zorian ethical conundrum (most probably will merge both souls), same situation for Alanic, others cannot leave at all...

Assuming they leave at this very moment their best course of actions, damage control, would actually be to try to outrun Silverlake to QI and join him, help with invasion with condition that no primordial is summoned. New series of splinter wars and massacre at academy seems to be favorable option to primordial getting free. That is assuming QI would prefer new splinter was without primordial to just new splinter wars. Which I assume is the case, because I doubt that he would be willing to serve anyone, otherwise it's just nearly invincible threat for the future.

If they leave now, don't join QI and Silverlake gets chummy with QI they are fucked, so fucked. It's essentially goodbye to all their friends and family and constant pursuit from 2 nearly ageless beings. Like if they don't know where QI's phylactery is or they can't soul jar his soul they are permanently screwed.

Assuming they don't leave loop now - by that they merely lose support of woke Alanic outside loop. They should figure out how to deal with QI permamently - aka find where his phylactery is. Otherwise they stand 0 chance. Actually Silverlake on her own vs Z&Z is not that scary. It's QI that brings the real danger. So once they get a method to deal with him they should be safe.

I don't think RR was brought in by QI. It seems plausible to me that in one of initial repeats Zach decided to actually watch the ceremony in which Panoxeth is released and Panoxeth saw a chance and went for it. Panoxeth partially copied Zach's soul mark onto one of the cultists with promise of strength, wealth, etc... So I assume RR is woke outside the loop, thought not sure if with a separate body.

Also it seems plausible that outside the loop they might get some support from celestial beings - angels, maybe some god will appear.

Anyway so many possibilities, so many unknowns and I'm so hyped for the continuation.
