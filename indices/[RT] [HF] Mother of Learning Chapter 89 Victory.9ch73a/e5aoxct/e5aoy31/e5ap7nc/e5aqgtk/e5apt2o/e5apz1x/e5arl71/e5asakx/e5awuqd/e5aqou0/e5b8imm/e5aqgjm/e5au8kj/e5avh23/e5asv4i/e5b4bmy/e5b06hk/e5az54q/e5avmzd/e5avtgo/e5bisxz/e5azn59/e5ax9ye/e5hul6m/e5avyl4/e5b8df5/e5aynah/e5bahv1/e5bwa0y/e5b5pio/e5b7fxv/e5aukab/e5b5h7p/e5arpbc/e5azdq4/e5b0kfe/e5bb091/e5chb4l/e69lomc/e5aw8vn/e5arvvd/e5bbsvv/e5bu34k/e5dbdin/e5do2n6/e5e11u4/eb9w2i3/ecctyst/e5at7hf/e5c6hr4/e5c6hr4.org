alright, this might be a bit of a stretch but hear me out.

what if kierielle becomes a new silver lake? This chapter hinted at it again, the fingers and stuff, the grandmother was also a witch, she aspires to become a mage and this chapter hinted that with the palace orb they could get a whole bunch of time. with a bit of help from zorian to train her, it shouldn't be impossible to at least get a semi proficient kierielle.
