Should have ditched her before leaving. They had all the power in their hands and misused it. She was bound to create trouble sooner or later. She has proven that she cares more about her goals than anyone's safety or stability. That kind of person is not the kind you take with you when escaping something like the loop. Use her then remove her marker. That's what sound logic says in my opinion.
