I think the physical exit plan uses their skills and previous plans more. If they get out through the gate, most people wouldn't be able to make it in the real world. It would use Zorian's soul magic abilities, but wouldn't use his dimensionalism or Primordial knowledge. Much more story time has been spent on Primordial stuff, pocket dimensions, etc. than has been spent on non-defensive soul magic. Everyone aside from Kael and Lukav not making it along with Z&Z would be disappointing as well.
