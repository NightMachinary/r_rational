Seriously, no one is infuriated that the witch was very obviously untrustworthy and our mc decided to be braindead and ignore that, trusting her with too much. Should have removed her marker near the end. She's earned it several times already. Honestly, I'm pretty much dropping it after this. I don't even rant like this often, but a good story goes to shit like this and I feel a lot of my time is wasted. God.

Sorry for the rant again, just needed to vent.
