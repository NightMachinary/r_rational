My theory is that Panaxeth is lying about killing RR, and possibly about contacting him at all. The gate was barred, and it doesn't make sense for it to be barred unless RR left. Why would Panaxeth bar the gate if it killed RR before he could leave? Panaxeth may not have contacted RR because if he couldn't convince him to make the contract, he would be on the lookout for people who did take it, and Panaxeth simply waited for another opportunity.
