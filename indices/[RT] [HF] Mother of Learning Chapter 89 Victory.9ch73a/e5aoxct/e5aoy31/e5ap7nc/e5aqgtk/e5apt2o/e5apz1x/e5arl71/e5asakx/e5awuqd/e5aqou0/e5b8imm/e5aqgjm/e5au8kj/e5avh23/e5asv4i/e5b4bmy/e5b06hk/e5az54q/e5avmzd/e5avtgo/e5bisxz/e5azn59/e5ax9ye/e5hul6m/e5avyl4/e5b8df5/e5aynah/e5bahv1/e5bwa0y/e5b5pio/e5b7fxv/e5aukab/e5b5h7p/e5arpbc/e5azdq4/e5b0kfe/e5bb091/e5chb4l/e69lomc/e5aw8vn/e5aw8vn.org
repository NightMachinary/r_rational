Im pretty confused right now by everything surrounding Red Robe (did he have the key or just got to the guardian with a hacked marker?)

"You will never get out of here alive without me," it told him. Its voice acquired a human-like quality by this point, and most of the eyes were gone. "The other person didn't either."

Im reading a lot of comments taking this to mean he said no to the help, then tryed to get out and died, but how does that play with the Guardian saying that the controller left the loop? If he did scape with help from the primordial that frase is still true, and makes more sense in the story, even having RR still in the loop makes more sense.

Leaving that aside now we need to see what happens with Zack, can he get out this loop? will he?
