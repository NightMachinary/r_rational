I disagree that this matter is not a matter of agreement. While I agree the work would rise a whole level with voices brought to several characters, I disagree quotable phrase to be a measure of greatness.

Princess bride was immensely enjoyable movie with many quotable lines, but I was not invested. Classic, but not great. As for your example, I was invested ASOIAF, great writing there no doubt! What's KKC? I don't like Wildbow's fiction but I acknowledge it deserve its acclaim. Wandering Inn? Really? The author focused on word count, allowing herself to be exhausted by her writing effort. She's not even allowing herself some break to rest or sharpen her metaphorical claw. Every time I read them I rushed to the end because passages are sparse of meaning. Emotions were tried to be deep with little success (melancholia only works if used sparingly). Characters distinction is superficial. Conservation of detail is kinked. Wandering Inn is a frustrating piece of fiction because it doesn't allow me to savor every paragraph. It benefited more from editorial works than MoL or this subreddit's other darling Practical Guide to Evil or Worth the Candle. Much more! Forgive me to let you read my extreme dislike. It's almost a year since the last time I read it, but it proved that I need more time to move on from being annoyed that that piece kept getting recommended again and again.

Yeah, my reply should be only the first paragraph. Sorry for being taunted.
