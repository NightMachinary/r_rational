That paragraph took Zorian bias, so it's natural for Zach to be excluded since Zorian think Zach is the holder of true marker. He wouldn't need possession method. His body would be empty. If that paragraph didn't take Zorian bias, yes, Zach will have a good chance of surviving the possession process.

Xvim would see little benefit getting out of the loop. The knowledge of loop existence and imminent Cyoria's destruction is minor convenience. He would think that his greatest contribution is helping Zorian inside the time loop.

About enhancement being reset, I think, that's because there's unknown variable before them being etched on soul. Them not being satisfied resulted said enhancement reset between restart. That's why Zorian is leery; what if experimental enchantment satisfied those variable, so that he must live with it? I guess, advise from Morlocks allowed him to rule out some of possible variables; allowing him to practice more extensively.
