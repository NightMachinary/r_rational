My hypothesis is that Red Robe didn't need the key because the gate was initially unbarred. He needed Panaxeth in order to leave with his own body intact though since the Red Robe in the other world still had a soul. Also, Panaxeth never said that he killed Red Robe, he simply said that Red Robe didn't escape without his help. That could be interpreted as Red Robe dying or as him accepting Panaxeth's offer.

Panaxeth didn't bar the gate. The gate is barred as a natural result of leaving the time loops.
