I never said anything about diction or verbosity. And while sure if you value those things more then The Mother of Learning isn't the best. I will admit some characters may not have as a distinct voice as they should or could; but I do think that a lot of them do have distinct voices.

While QI, Paxaneth, and the Taramatula Family don't have as distinct and foreign voices one could expect. I think Zorian, Silverlake, Xvim, Kirielle, Taiven, Spear of Resolve, and especially the Ghost Serpent have very distinct voices in my mind. But hey, to each their own.

Edit: minor grammar changes.
