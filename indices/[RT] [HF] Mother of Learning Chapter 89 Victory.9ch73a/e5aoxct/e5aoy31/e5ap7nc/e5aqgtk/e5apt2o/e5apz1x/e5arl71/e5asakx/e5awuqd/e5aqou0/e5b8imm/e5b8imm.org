Soooo, if Panaxeth has some agency within the Gate, this can explain the origin of RR (not that RR is very relevant at this point). The main objection to RR being (person of your choice) was that the marker alteration project always seemed an extremely difficult task, and RR was a pretty lousy mage. The marker is confirmed to be a tough nut to crack in this very chapter. However, Panaxeth pretty much solves all the difficult parts for the Red Robe. I remember Zorian though RR was strangely invested in optimizing the invasion. Well, it is explained if he was recruited by Panaxeth from the very beginning! It also means that RR can be anyone, even the Boranova guy. Their initial qualifications don't matter, what matters is that some circumstance by which Panaxeth was able to make its offer, and those are pretty much author fiat.
