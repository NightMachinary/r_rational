I'm boggled by this, guys. I mean, logic? Was trusting her logic to begin with? I would have removed her marker before meeting the guardian anyway. She's earned that and proven her untrustworthiness several times, hasn't she? You couldn't trust her after coming out of the loop even if the primodial hadn't appeared, and I'm surprised she didn't try to ambush Zack at some point and get marker resembling that of Zorian, or even do something like what Red Robe did. It almost causes me physical pain that I knew this was all gonna happen several chapters in advance(primodial aside). I was pretty much certain Silverlake was going betray them somehow or do something for her interests and let them rot.
