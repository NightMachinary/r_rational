i only read a couple chapters of altered carbon, but found its prose and literary style to be almost better than the amazing world building. same with dhalgren. perdido street station. solaris. maybe even hyperion (the fall of).

there's at least a handful of speculative novels off the top of my head that have incredible prose, though they also tend to have crazy awesome worlds so i guess not the /only/ appeal.
