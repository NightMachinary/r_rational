Personally, my question is - is Silverlake the only apparent traitor of the group? Or are there more... subtle ones?

Are we Battlestar Galactica right now, guessing who's the Cylon and who's not?

One way or another, nobody103 continues to impress with his chapters again and again.

EDIT: Also, I believe QI is joining the forces of good! QI has always been a morally ambiguous - well, personally I wouldn't even call it ambiguous, he plays by a surprisingly tight moral compass if you pay close attention to it - person, and for all the obvious "he's the one who's trying to release the primordial from the beginning!" MoL has been twists and turns at every corner. Who knows if QI may change his mind?
