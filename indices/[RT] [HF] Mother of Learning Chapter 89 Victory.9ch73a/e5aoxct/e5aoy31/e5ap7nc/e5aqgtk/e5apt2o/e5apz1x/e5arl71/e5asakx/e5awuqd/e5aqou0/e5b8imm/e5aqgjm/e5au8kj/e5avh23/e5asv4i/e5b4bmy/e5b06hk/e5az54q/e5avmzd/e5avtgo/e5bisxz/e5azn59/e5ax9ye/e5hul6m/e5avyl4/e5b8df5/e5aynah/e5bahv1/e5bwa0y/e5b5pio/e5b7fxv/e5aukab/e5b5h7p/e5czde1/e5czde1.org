I'm pretty sure that panaxeth had a hand in the timeloop starting. Not angels.... Because remember, it started a month earlier than it should have, which is why it's much shorter than the '11 lifetimes' spoke of in legends. It was supposed to piggyback off the planetary alignment thing.

And it starting /now/ is suspiciously close to their invasion plans.
