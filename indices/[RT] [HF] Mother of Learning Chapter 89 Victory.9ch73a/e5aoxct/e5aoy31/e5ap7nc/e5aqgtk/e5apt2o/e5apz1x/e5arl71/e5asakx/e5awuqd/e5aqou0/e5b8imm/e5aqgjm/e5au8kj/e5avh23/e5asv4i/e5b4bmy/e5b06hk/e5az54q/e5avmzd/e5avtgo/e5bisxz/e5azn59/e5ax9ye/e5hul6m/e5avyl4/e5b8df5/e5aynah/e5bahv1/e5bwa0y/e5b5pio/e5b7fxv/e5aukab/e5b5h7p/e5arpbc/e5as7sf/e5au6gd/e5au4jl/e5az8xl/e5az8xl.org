I understand the instinct to think so - I'm pretty sure some other languages have cases where an internal verb is supposed to be in "default form" regardless of the overall sentence's tense. That said, I'm pretty sure that in English a simple past tense means all verbs that are otherwise unconjugated has to be in past tense. For an example I hope is sufficient, the sentence (fabricated on the spot):

#+begin_quote
  He couldn't, no matter how much he wants to
#+end_quote

pulls up the same kind of gut instinct judgment on "wants to", even though it's a little bit more apparent here that it's the wrong tense. (Or at least, I hope it's apparent.)
