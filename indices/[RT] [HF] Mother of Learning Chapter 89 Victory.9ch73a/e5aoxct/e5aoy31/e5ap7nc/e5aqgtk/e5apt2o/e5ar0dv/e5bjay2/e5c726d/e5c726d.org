Here's the quotes:

  I am considering some kind of continuation after the story is done, but that would be more of a direct continuation of the current plot. I've yet to consider one with entirely new characters or ones developing people like Zorian. I'm highly unlikely to write a prequel, though, since I'm not terribly fond of them as a premise.

And

  To be honest, I wouldn't even try to create plot as involved as the current one for this hypothetical sequel. It would be more of a portrayal of the results and consequences of the main story -- a sort of fourth arc where we see how the various characters are dealing with things, how the setting reacts to everything that had happened, that sort of thing. Not quite slice of life but definitely not as â€˜epic' or long as the current storyline.

  Anyway, it's still under consideration. I don't want to invest too much thought in this until the story is done. Don't count your chickens until they hatch and all that.
