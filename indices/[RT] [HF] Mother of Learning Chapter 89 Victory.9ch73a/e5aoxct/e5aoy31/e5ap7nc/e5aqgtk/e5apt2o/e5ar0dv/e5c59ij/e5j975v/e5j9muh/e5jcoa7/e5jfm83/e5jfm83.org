Fair point; I'd forgotten about that reset. Although bringing in the army to take out the mansion works if you don't get counter-ambushed by an enemy army that's been warned in advance, which Red Robe can arrange. He doesn't even need to think of it, just as long as he is forthcoming with his co-conspirators, Ibasan intelligence would know enough to watch their holdings.

There's no reason to believe that team evil won't be just as well informed as Z&Z once the time loop ends. And without future knowledge, Z&Z aren't enough to turn the tide on their own. As good as Zach and Zorien are, they are both nothing compared to a QI that's been given adequate warning against them. They're barely able to beat him with tons of allies and ambush tactics on their side. Turn the tables the other way and they die very quickly.

Or silverlake, who's far more ruthless than either of Z&Z. She'd be happy to work with QI and would have no qualms with doing whatever it takes to win. It's a whole new dimension when Zorien can't move freely because Kirielle has been kidnapped.
