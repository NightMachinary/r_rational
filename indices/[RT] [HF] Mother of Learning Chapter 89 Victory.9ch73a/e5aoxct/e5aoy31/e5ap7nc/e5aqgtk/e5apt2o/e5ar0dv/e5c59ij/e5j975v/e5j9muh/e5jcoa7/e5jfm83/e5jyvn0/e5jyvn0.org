Silverlakes experience with the invasion is limited to five restarts, and Red Robes perfected the invasion plan back when he only needed to deal with Zach. Just adding Zorian or Xvim to the time loop is a massive change, to say nothing about dozens of loopers, many of whom are major players in their own right. Already a small-scale conspiracy with Zorian and Stellar Spear that Strikes into the Heart of the Matter is enough of a problem that he decided to abort the time loop. What happens when the spiders are just one of hundreds of groups the time loopers bring into play? The board is completely flipped. The only way I could see them actually failing at this point is if Panaxeth pulled some stuff, which he very well might, especially with Silverlake in play. But since this is the end of the story I doubt the author is going to do the whole "Then Panaxeth wins!" thing.

I disagree with QI being some sort of unstoppable threat though. They have several methods of dealing with him now, at least temporarily, and they've successfully gotten the crown at least three times, though based on the way it's talked about in the chapter it seems to suggest that they've done it far more often.
