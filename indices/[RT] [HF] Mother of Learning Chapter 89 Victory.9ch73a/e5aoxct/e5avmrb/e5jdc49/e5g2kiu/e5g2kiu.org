Is it unambiguously clear that Silverlake made the wrong choice? If we assume that Zorian and co are doomed to fail, which seems likely without out of universe knowledge that he's the protagonist of a story, then the outcome of Silverlake not taking the deal is that the invasion proceeds as plan and the primordial is released regardless. At least this way she has the chance to influence events positively, find a way to renege on the deal somehow, or, minimally, survive where she otherwise would not have.

We might be best served by interpreting her actions as pragmatic, rather than treasonous.
