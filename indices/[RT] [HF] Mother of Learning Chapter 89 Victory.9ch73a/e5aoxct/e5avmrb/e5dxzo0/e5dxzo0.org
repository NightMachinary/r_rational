  She literally sent zorian to his death for his first mission

Only if he was very foolish (by her standards) or very desperate. It was more of a fuck-off-and-don't-bother-me-again mission.

That does mean she stole his labour with no intention of actually helping him out. But that's the height of her confirmed on-screen evil. (Which is why Z&Z willingly associated with her.)
