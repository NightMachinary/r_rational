Doubt it as the first time she met Kael, she ignored him outright in favor for Alanic. I wonder if zorian is gonna stay behind to do some training to deal with silverlake. Or even if they can escape at all since pla said they cannot escape without his help. Still they answers who helped red robe get out since many thought it was the lich who assisted red robe in escaping the loop.

Edit: I feel like silverlake would kidnap kana if she had a chance to.
