And /that/ was more about her just not recognizing Kael in between the years they haven't seen each other. It was mentioned in chpt 83 that she recognized him since and tried talking to him. Though I can definitely see her outright kidnapping Kana.

Also, I don't think Panaxeth helped Red Robe for the majority of the loops - if it was capable of editing temporary markers into permanent ones, it'd be doing a whole lot more muck-ups. And it probably couldn't contact Red Robe until he was good enough to access the room with the Controller. At least until that point, Quatach-Ichl is still the most likely one to have helped Red Robe.
