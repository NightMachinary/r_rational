Best chapter in quite a while. The culmination of lots of different projects that have been going on for substantial portions of the story. I love the bait and switch of the title, since you would think initially that it refers to Z&Z's projects rather than Panexeth.

The good news is that the project to physically step out of the time loop should be unaffected. If Panexeth has the ability to kill people directly, he evidently didn't bother to do so for the rest of the loopers. If the gate is effectively rebarred, this would be the method they have to use now. Harder without Silverlake, but potentially the inclusion of the crown used by Zorian would make up for it.
