It's not really a matter of disagreement, simply a fact. You can't even compare MoL's level of diction, verbosity, and depth of voice to serious published fantasy like ASOIAF or the KKC. Or even other web serials like Worm/Ward or Wandering Inn. The grammer/writing quality is workable/workmanlike at best. You need only ask yourself how many quotable phrases have come out of this work. Answer is - not many. If any at all, as far as I know.

It works, but it isn't great. I routinely see far, far worse stories with magnitudes better writing quality than this one, which is a real damn shame. It really does hold the story back from the level of acclaim it would otherwise have.
