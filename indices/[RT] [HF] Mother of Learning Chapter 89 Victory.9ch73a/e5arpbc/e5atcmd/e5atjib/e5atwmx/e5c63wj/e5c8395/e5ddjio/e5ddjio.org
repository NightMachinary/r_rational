i still get confused about who is speaking in wandering inn. i can go back and puzzle it out, but it happens to me a couple times a chapter. kind of bothers me. some weird insistence on NEVER including a reporting verb, or even the descriptive clauses in the same paragraph! the dialogue is always its own paragraph and i can't even tell which line of dialogue goes with which physical action.

use of markup is definitely cool.
