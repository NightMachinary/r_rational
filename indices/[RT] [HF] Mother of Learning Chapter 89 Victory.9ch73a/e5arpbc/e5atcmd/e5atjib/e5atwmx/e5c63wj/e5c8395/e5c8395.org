Starts out kinda that way, but improves a lot as it goes on. But Wandering Inn's writing stands out less in prose, and more in the immersive mechanics of writing itself. The author is actually the best I've seen at using whitespace, font styles, and repetitive idioms to create immersion. She has a very very good mechanical/structural style, which I've learned a lot from.
