Mother of Learning sounds fine to me, but serials like Practical Guide to Evil and Worth the Candle very obviously have stronger writing on a technical level.

Mother of Learning kind of reminds me of Brandon Sanderson's works: the plotting and world-building are strong, the prose is weaker, and there's not a ton of humor.
