Unsouled is too weird for me to describe, beyond saying "what if the Bible was real, and the Apollo space program broke the universe?" It's weird as fuck, technically falling under 'bible-punk.' Yes, I'd recommend. It's too unique not to recommend. Never seen anything even remotely like it, in any genre.

Helps that the writing is as good as any I've seen, on a technical level.
