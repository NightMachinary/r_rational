Three months late, and I can't believe I was so distracted by Silverlake I forgot about the truly important things. Namely, this:

  Looking to the side, he saw Kael with a large yellow root stuffed in his mouth.

  Taiven gave Kael a strange, possibly disapproving look.

  "What?" Kael complained, chewing loudly. The sound it produced reminded Zorian of someone eating a raw carrot.

  "How can you eat that thing?" she asked him.

  "It's really tasty," he told her matter-of-factly.

  "It's a wild root you washed in a nearby river," she protested. "That cannot possibly be safe or hygienic. Plus, I can smell it from here and it doesn't smell like something you should be eating..."

  Kael gave her a challenging look before biting into the root again and chewing even louder.

The best plant I can think of that fits the description is dock. Grows in a clearing, big yellow root, edible, smells bad, and I imagine it'd be crunchy. The only thing it doesn't fit is "really tasty", though it probably is an acquired taste. Also, those things are a pain to dig up. Maybe magic helps. Huh, I never thought about it before, but it totally makes sense for Kael to know a spell for digging up roots.
