So I wanted to talk about this passage:

#+begin_quote
  People who had zero experience with soul magic would find it impossible to get good enough at it to survive the soul transferal and successfully possess their body. People who were well versed in soul magic, even before the time loop, would probably be annihilated by the originals if they tried to possess them. Aside from Zorian, only Kael, Xvim and Lukav had a good chance of pulling that off. And Xvim, much like Kael, has already ruled out the idea 'stealing his own life away from himself'.
#+end_quote

At first I was wondering about Alanic and Silverlake not being included, but then the second sentence registered as "If they were too good at soul magic before the time loop, the original was fully capable of terminating the copy trying to take over them". So if I read that right, this method is only realistic for people who honed their soul magic skill sufficiently, had room for significant improvement, and had a base that would lend well to quick improvement, right? In which case I guess it makes sense Alanic and Silverlake would be out but Kael and Lukav would be in (and Zorian too, of course). But why not Zach? I thought he was also working on his soul magic over the many restarts.

Also, I kinda didn't see Xvim as the type to refuse getting out of the loop for non-pragmatic reasons.

Did blood magic/ingrained magical abilities also have some way to be carved into the soul too, by the way? It kinda seemed to me, in previous chapters, that Zorian and Zach were leery about it because it would affect them through subsequent restarts, but in this chapter it just said that the enhancement rituals would be anchored onto the user's mana pool and life force, both of which I'm pretty sure recover to normal every loop.

Other than that...the twist at the end was great. Glad to see Panaxeth wasn't able to create an immediate game over, even while upping the ante like that. Though by the same token I really wish Zorian could've fished more information out of it - like what exactly it wants to /do/ when it came out, and what guarantee it could give to Zorian that it wouldn't kill him when it's free, if Zorian had actually agreed to its deal.
