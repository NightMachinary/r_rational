Primordial involvement changes scope/perspective on some of the events we were told previously:

The cataclysm which turned fertile land into desert might have been the first large issue caused by SG degradation. The primordial who was tied in the capital tried to escape the prison. Situation went nuclear. SG was given for Zach family safekeeping, not to be used again.

The cause behind the weeping could have been Panaxeth (he needed to wipe out the Noveda family which allowed SG started again). SG is apparently assists in the escape in some sort of fashion. Since he is flesh-warper, he could easily create toxins/infection to set up the stage for current events.

RR is weird. He couldn't enter the space if he was using modified marker (unless Panaxeth pulled him into that space). It does not make any sense to be any other that primordial puppet (to coordinate ritual to free him besides other things).
