  Zorian watched in growing horror as the Guardian of the Threshold suddenly started twitching and stuttering as if it was having a some kind of seizure. His head rolled around at impossible angles, rotating a full 360 degrees, his entire torso squirming and bulging as if something was trying to burst out of it.

  He had a very bad feeling about this.

  "What the hell is happening?" someone asked behind him.

  "I don't know," Zach said, frowning. "This has never happened befo--"

  Everything suddenly became quiet. At first Zorian though Zach had just stopped speaking because he noticed or realized something important, but when he glanced towards him he found Zach gone.

  Everyone but Zorian was gone. It was just him, a madly twitching Guardian of the Threshold and a quiet, featureless black void all around them.

  He immediately tried to return to his body, but failed.

  Shit... Well, at least the Guardian of the Threshold was starting to calm down. He was twitching less, and no longer twisted him head and limbs at impossible angles. Maybe--

  A multitude of eyes suddenly snapped open all over Guardian of the Threshold's body, blinking rapidly for a few moments before focusing straight at Zorian. Each one was different. Different sizes, different color, different internal structure. Some of them had multiple irises. Some of them glowed. Some of them were multifaceted, like those of an insect. Some of them made his mind feel numb just looking at them.

Subverting the gate helper function is something the loop strongly tries to prevent, and has substantial obvious side effects.
