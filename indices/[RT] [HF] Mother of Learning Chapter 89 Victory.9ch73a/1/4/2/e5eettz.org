Well taiven's existential crisis is silly. She dies close to the beginning of the loop if no one interferes. So do alanic and Lukav for that matter. And zorian dies at the end of the month anyway~

As for avoiding existential crisis's in general, they can't get out without silverlake, Zorian said as much this chapter. So all the temporary loopers are going to lose their memories.

I'm kind of glad actually. The ramifications of so many loopers would put targets on zach and zorian's backs. A lot of these people aren't really /that/ trustworthy. Especially daimen's team.
