I think the lawyer was introduced to Zach by Veyers, after all we know (from the very chapter we meet the lawyer) that Zach talked to a bunch of lawyers about his guardian's thievery.

This is why RR soulkilled Veyers and wiped Zach's memory of him, RR didn't want Zach to ever come looking for him again.
