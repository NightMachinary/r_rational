Zorian managed a tactical defeat of the invasion with a sabotage campaign run by the Araena before he was collaborating with Zack. That's what led to RR deciding to leave the loop.

If anything it'd be easier to reproduce that outside the loop as that was before Zorian and Zack learned the vast majority of the valuable information and skills they now possess, and even assuming RR made it out, he did so with hugely outdated knowledge of Z&Z's capabilities (they weren't even collaborating at that time).

​

Prior to Silverlake's defection the invasions would have been pretty easily dealt with.
