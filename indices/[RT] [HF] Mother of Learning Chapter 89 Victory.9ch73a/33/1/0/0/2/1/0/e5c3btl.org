I should have said 'best written webserial that I've read.' I still need to get around to Wandering Inn, and I just started Practical.

I think Wildbow is an excellent writer, but Worm/Twig/Pact are bloated. Amazing stories with creative twists, but large portions are the POV characters running in circles with their thoughts.

Unsouled is interesting and fun, but I would not hold that up against Rothfuss or Martin (maybe his fight scenes).

Since you seem to enjoy dialogue, try 'John Dies at the End' by David Wong or 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' by Scott Lynch.
