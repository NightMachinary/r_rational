Is this the only web serial you've read or something, Worm aside?

First, Worm is better written. I haven't read it in one pass-through in years and can still remember a good few quotable phrases. Wildbow, unlike Nobody, is able to write characteristically distinct characters whose differences translate into different styles of dialogue (see, interludes). Then, for other web serials, you've got +Unsouled+ Unsong, Wandering Inn, and HPMOR. Unsouled and HPMOR in particular are at awe-inspiring levels of technical writing at one point or another.
