The author's basic writing skills are kinda lousy - amazing story, but I see a lot of this, and a lot of typos. He'd benefit from a serious editor. A more serious editor than mere grammatical stuff - he needs help to bring distinct 'voices' to characters like Qi and Paxaneth. These ancient, ancient beings just talk in the same language as all the rest of the characters.
