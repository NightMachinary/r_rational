You know I just had a thought. If Panaxeth is an allmighty primordial with flesh warping abilities why didn't they just force Zorian and all loopers take the contract. Why does the magic require consent of any form? Is Panaxeth restricted by something or is there some powerful magic that can't do anything without consent?
