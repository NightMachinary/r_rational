Why did the angels start the time loop knowing not only that it was damaged but that the primordial responsible for the time loop was the same one being released? Were they really that desperate to overlook such an obvious point of failure.

Something tells me that it was activated by someone else, but the evidence points to it being the angels (forewarning the Sulrothum & Zach's blessing). Maybe Panaxeth just took an opportunity to hijack it...

In ch60, Zorian & Zach saw an orb of blood that reacted when the ritual failed. Maybe Panaxeth used this as a vector to communicate with Red Robe once he got a temporary marker? Xe made a contract with Red Robe, who was committed to freeing xem anyways. Panaxeth used what little control he had to let Red Robe leave the loop as the "controller", which barred the gate. When Zorian & Zach unbarred the gate, Panaxeth took the opportunity to recruit another lackey to ensure his freedom.

Though, that brings up another mystery. What does the repeated attempts to unseal Panaxeth within the time loop (which IS Panaxeth) actually do? Does it damage the time loop? Does it temporarily release Panaxeth until the safeguards shut the loop down?
