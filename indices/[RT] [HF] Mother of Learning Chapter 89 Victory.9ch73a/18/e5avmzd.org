I don't want to hold back my praise for this chapter after my criticism in two separate occassions, because this chapter is GREAT! We are aware of two things, the time pressure against temp looper and Silverlake inevitable betrayal. This chapter capitalize the two brilliantly! Starting with establishing the undercurrent of unease at Zorian-Taiven-Kael fun little excursion, strengthened by after mansion orb creation by Silverlake. We are primed for whatever author decided to give us about that issue. Then come surprise Panaxeth. Silverlake timely betrayal not only allowed us to say, "Curse you Silverlake for your ...," but also elevated the tension of time pressure, from previously unease to panic and helplessness. From previously only affect the temp looper, to now also affect the two controller. Brilliant!

Saw several spelling mistakes, but eh, what are they in front of great writing?

With this, the first part of the next chapter would be most awaited/wanted/anticipated. We will demand resolutions for following issues, (1) Will controller, especially Zorian, have issue leaving the loop even with most assured method, namely having the key and possess their old body? Panaxeth claim of him not being able to leave alive was ominous. (2) Will boring a dimensional passage through Panaxeth's prison still a possible avenue? Previously it is stated with 30% success chance. It was before we know Panaxeth is watching closely. (3) Will the escape of temp looper still possible at all? Silverlake's gone with her ability to make soul-perception potion. With no means of training, temp looper are doomed.

And we're curious about the following issue: (1) What will happen with Silverlake inside the time loop? Become a meat puppet at the next restart? (That if Zorian and Zach could not escape at this iteration, forced to try again, or simply decide to do so) (2) Did Red Robe really gone? Not even outside time loop due to Panaxeth doing? (3) Is Panaxeth acting as Guardian of the Treshold? Gate being made from mutilated primordial with nearby primordial acting as guardian is interesting prospect.

Thank you author for this chapter. I count 2 hours of entertainment from reading this chapter, participating on simpler comment, and writing this comment. I believe I will find pleasure from participating on more weighty comment for hours, if not days, to come.
