Bwa-ha-ha-ha, so many hidden final boss potential revealed in this chapter. So worth the wait.

So now the team is barred, pun intended, from using the full key option for the exit (unless they want to form the contract +and become magi+). Which leaves them with brute forcing the way out. In 13 restarts. Against a Primordial. The pressure!
