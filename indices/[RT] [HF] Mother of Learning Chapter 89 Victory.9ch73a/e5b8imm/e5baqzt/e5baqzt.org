This! I'd like to imagine the Divines cut a deal with the Primordials: "Convince controller we choose to peruse Sovereign Gate to help you escaped. We won't bother you if you escaped this way."

And one of Primordials successfully escaped its prison. Only to find the world it escaped to is another layer of prison, now complete with copies of angels and demon. The Divines is outside of it, closely watching, for a chance to learn the weakness of their prisons.
