When I read the text, I didn't get the impression that Pan stopped RR from leaving, but that RR could NOT leave without Pan.

  "You will never get out of here alive without me," it told him. Its voice acquired a human-like quality by this point, and most of the eyes were gone. "The other person didn't either."

My interpretation is that RR would not have been able to leave without Pan intervention, not that Pan actively stopped RR from leaving the time loop.

I'm sure all our questions will be answered in the future though!
