I really liked this chapter. Great look into Masego's head, especially when we got to see his mental representations of his friends. Cat threading the needle through the dialogue with that pure-researcher fragment of him was tense as fuck, and I was impressed by how quickly she zeroed in on the right buttons to push while he was in that state. And when his humanity returned at the end! That made me feel emotions.
