I have the same problem, but thankfully I was able to use [[http://www.nextdimension.org/bmrf/HL_BMRF_LambdaReactorCore.jpg][a Half-Life level]] as a template to help me imagine, just recoloured white and gold.

As a side note I've imagined the inside of my own head several times, with a furnace at the lower level representing my spirit/emotions, with the higher level housing the library (memories) and control room (thought).

Emotions, meanwhile, are substances that build up as a result of the state of mind and the things happening to me - the destructive magma of anger, the suffocating water of sadness/depression, the scars of shame, the bright light of happiness/pride. These all interact with the aforementioned systems in different ways, with anger flaring up my spirit and demanding to be vented, depression interpreting and tainting sensor data in a negative light, as well as damping down my spirit (making it a useful countermeasure to anger), and shame poisoning memories. Happiness is a rare but extremely valuable light, cleaning away corruption and restoring memories to less painful versions, at the cost of inflating my ego.
