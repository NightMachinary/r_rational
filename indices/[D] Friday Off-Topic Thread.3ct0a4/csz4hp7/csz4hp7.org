OK, here's a somewhat on-topic question:

I read [[/u/alexanderwales]] latest story about the AI box problem, which was interesting. In fact, before discovering [[/r/rational]] I wrote a small play on the same scenario (different twist, but nothing too left field).

So, does everyone write one of those stories at some point?
