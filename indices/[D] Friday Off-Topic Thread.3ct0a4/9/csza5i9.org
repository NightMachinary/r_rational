Well, today I managed to get into a proper Coding Flow at work and bang out some low-level networking API. W00t!

I also hypothesized on the train to work that causal-role concepts could be implemented computationally as something like existential types. The nasty part then, is learning the existential package types themselves, and learning injectors from feature-governed concepts to causal-role concepts.

I've been getting some practical things done this week, like taxes. Oh, and actually moving forward with studying real analysis, and starting a speed-read of a textbook in denotational semantics to pick up that one kind of PL semantics I've /not/ done before.

Why? Because by combining domain theory with probabilistic programming with Calude's anytime algorithm for the halting problem, I started sketching out an actual language design with a friend this week. If I can manage to lift my ideas for distributions over (total) inductive types into domain-land via Calude's result... we'll have something /really interesting/ on our hands.

I'm really, really hoping this will work. If it does, it should be, let us speak academese and understate, /publishable/.

If we don't understate, I actually had a hot-blooded rant prepared -- the kind where you can't tell if that guy's the hero or villain or just fucking crazy. I just feel like I've been bitten by overstating my results before I've got them too often to go into hot-blooded ranting mode yet.
