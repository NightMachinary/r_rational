Sorry, I didn't mean to be jargony, let me unpack that.

By "low trust" I mean the general expectation of institutions like courts, police officers, and other government offices is that the individuals inside will abuse their power to extract bribes, protect the politically powerful, and otherwise fail to execute their duties in a just and impartial manner.

By "high trust" I mean the reverse, that the society considers it an unusual exception for civil servants and law enforcement to accept bribes or use their position in a self-serving way rather than execute the bureaucracy or laws they are expected to enforce.

The environments are self-perpetutating. In a low-trust environment ndividuals are incentivized to pay bribes or break rules for the powerful, but the overall society would be much more successful if no one did. If the expectation is that officials are not corrupt, there are plenty of resources available to punish the few who defect.

I have heard of tactics like [[http://www.economist.com/news/international/21591198-increasingly-popular-weapon-fight-against-corruption-fake-money-small-change][worthless bills]] to shame/intimidate officials who try to extract bribes as part of trying to move from a low-trust equilibrium to a high-trust one. I know there's much more out there from folks who've worked on and thought about this, but I haven't researched it. This seems like a topic [[/r/rational]] might really dig into.
