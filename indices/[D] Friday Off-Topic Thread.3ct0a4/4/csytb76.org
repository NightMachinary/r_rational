I recently have been reading Ayn Rand's books on writing - The Art of Fiction and The Art of Nonfiction (both are pretty awesome by the way) - and you know what I've realized? I loved HPMOR for many of the same reasons I loved Atlas Shrugged.

I know that it sounds controversial, and I'm aware that a lot of people here, including Eliezer, dislike Ayn Rand. But hear me out.

The love for reason/rationality, the idea of trying to understand the world through logic, learning the proper techniques of thinking, the very similar sense of sanity and clear, sharp thinking, attracted me to both books.

A lot of people criticize AR for, "better than you" "arrogant" attitude from her characters, and I find it funny that many people say the same things about Harry. I'm not sure if "better than you" is a right description though. To me it sounds more like confidence in their own judgement, superior intelligemce, and ability to form their own opinions while disregarding other people's thoughts and social conventions. Or "[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete][Arete]]", that is, characters seeking excellence in themselves and appreciating it in others, while holding those who are lacking it with disdain. To me, of course, that attitude is very attractive, in both Harry and Rearden.

Both books also have characters with superhero-like intelligence and will, using their superior mental faculties, fighting morons who are in charge. Many criticize AS for unrealistically perfect heroes, but what they mean to me, is the expression of author's ideals on how humans should think and be like. Which, I think, is the case with Harry as well.

People say John Galt's speech is too long and "preachy" but, just as Harry's thoughts on death reflecting author's philosophy, I found it one of the best parts of the book.

The main difference in philosophy that I see, is that AR's characters are egoists, and Harry is an altruist. But you know what? Even though her ideas on selfishness get the most discussion, because they are the most controversial, I think that her main and most important ideas were about rationality and thinking for yourself, relying on your own judgement.

I have never read anywhere a clear, rational explanation about what is so horrible about AS, from what I can tell it just makes some people angry, while other people immediately fall in love with it. Many intelligent people like hating on AR, or saying that they've "outgrown" her books, and I don't understand why.

I absolutely loved both HPMOR and AS, both of them have been incredibly influential in my life, and are in my top 2 list of the best books I've ever read. And I was surprised to discover that, as different as they are, I loved them for many similar reasons.

So I'm interested in your thoughts on the topic.

P.S.

There's another, separate thought I would also like to discuss, related to the altruism vs egoism debate.

I would argue that at least once, Harry behaved irrationally, because of the altruism. When he was fighting against Wizengamot for Hermione, he threatened to sacrifice himself to destroy Azkaban, which got Dumbledor to back down. The alternative was to use a Dementor to fight the members of Wizengamot(maybe he wouldn't even have to kill them, just hold them hostage until he and Hermione escaped).

If Dumbledor wouldn't cave, Harry would (probably) end up killing himself, when he had an option to fight the Wizengamot. It wasn't hard to predict that his life, even then, was more valuable than the lives of all the members of Wizengamot put together. If he would sacrifice himself instead of Wizengamot, at the end, Quirrelmort would end up winning, not to mention that Harry wouldn't defeat death, thus saving countless lives, and doing who knows how many awesome things he did after the end of the book.

He acted altruistic and heroic, but no way it was rational to value the lives of Lucius and the like over his own, and if he was less lucky, that choice would lead to a much greater evil than killing a bunch of death eaters and creepy government officials.

So if anyone has some cool arguments on egoism vs altruism debate, I would like to talk about that too.

P.P.S.

The Art of Fiction and The Art of Nonfiction are really great. Available on audible too. I'm learning to write rationalist stories, and it is pretty hard, and these 2 books have a lot of very awesome and helpful ideas.
