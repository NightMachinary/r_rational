Hrm.. this seems to point to a broader problem: Readers shouldn't be moved by stories of the form of "this is how things turned out, so this is how you should expect them to turn out in future", they should need "this is how things /would/ turn out, no matter what, because I've set the story up not just to illustrate a possibility but to demonstrate a transferable inevitability". For instance, nobody should walk away from /Worm/ with the impression that it has been demonstrated that humanity always triumps over its adversaries, they should recognize that Taylor just got lucky. If the message of the book was that good always triumphs, that should ring hollow, it should seem empty. It should positively resonate under the glares of all of the less fortunate godless timelines where the likely thing happened and Taylor died like five times over and [[#s][worm spoiler]]. This is how a rationalist should read things. So, was Atlas Shrugged in the former category or what?
