  I have never read anywhere a clear, rational explanation about what is so horrible about AS, from what I can tell it just makes some people angry, while other people immediately fall in love with it. Many intelligent people like hating on AR, or saying that they've "outgrown" her books, and I don't understand why.

Using a protagonist and/or a story for spouting off philosophy, especially /political/ philosophy, can often seem like cheating. I don't know if you've ever read the /Left Behind/ books, but they're an extreme example of the problem that /Atlas Shrugged/ and to a lesser extent /HPMOR/ have. (Granted, the /Left Behind/ series has many problems, some of which almost seem unique in the history of the written word.)

The problem is that if you're the one writing, you can do whatever you want with the world. If you want to show people that all corporate executives are slimy sub-humans, you can just write one in. Presto, the personification of capitalist evil now exists for you to mock, and he can sputter at the anarchist protagonist giving a long speech on how we need to tear down all systems of control. Or you can make an atheist professor who is completely befuddled by the Christian undergrad who comes into a philosophy course believing that God exists. Because you control both sides of the argument, it's easy for "your side" to come out ahead. You can warp and twist the actions, statements, and motivations so that your side wins. It's like an extended conversation you'd have with yourself in the shower; winning is easy, because you're playing against yourself.

(There are literary arguments to be made against /Atlas Shrugged/, such as the presence of a lengthy speech in the middle of it, and the ways in which narrative is sacrificed for political dialogue, as well as some of the prose choices and characterizations. But I think those are mostly secondary.)

A properly written book can enrapture you, so that you don't start questioning it until it's over, and sometimes not even then. When people say that they "outgrew" /Atlas Shrugged/, what they probably mean is that the spell of the book finally wore off, and seen in the light of day ... political philosophy aside, it's not a book that most people will find a multi-year enduring appeal in. For many people, it's a book that curdles in your brain, given time - like the opposite of nostalgia.
