Just out of curiosity, why does using a character to advocate the author's beliefs count as a negative for you?

Much like Atlas Shrugged, HPMoR really exposed me to a lot of beliefs that I had never heard of before and so I really count that part as a plus in addition to the rest of the story. (It did start to seem a bit like a self-insert which makes me take it less seriously but after the first section of HPMoR I felt like he largely got past that.)
