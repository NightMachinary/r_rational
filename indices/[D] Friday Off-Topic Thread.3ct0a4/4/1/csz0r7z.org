I consider Harry's strong advocacy for EY's personal beliefs in HPMOR to be a negative, rather than a positive. Pointing out that Harry does this, not just John Galt, doesn't make me think better of John Galt.

That being said, for all I know /Atlas Shrugged/ is an excellent novel. I'm not in the category of people who would benefit from reading it, and have no interest in learning about AR's politics. I think I've figured out what I want to from Libertarian theory and taken the best parts of it into my own beliefs. Doing so did not require reading that novel.
