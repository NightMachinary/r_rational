.. No. Seriously, if you need random numbers on a regular basis, keep dice in your pocket, or install a prng on your phone. You can't execute a pseudo-random number generator in your head, and while one could work out a technique to get random numbers from whatever chaotic phenomenon happens to be in view (.. like the clouds.) it would be inferior to just carrying dice.
