Well. Your first interaction was disagreeing with him (which usually makes people at the very least displeased, if not outright angry) and then insulting him. Now, from my point of view, I don't find what you said to be very insulting. That "kind of" takes a lot of the heat out of the insult, for me.

But it's hard to convey tone on the internet. And we can't tell people how to feel. So do I think Nepene is being a bit touchy? Yes. If it were me, I'd probably laugh at him and call him something insulting. Because I don't personally like people that extrapolate more out of what I said than what I meant (even if it's not entirely their fault, depending on the wording)

But oh well. Unless one of you is stalking the other, just ignore him. I can almost promise you he doesn't have the time to continue getting into it, if you leave him be. And you've lost one more e-friend. Oh, the horror.

P.S Despite the overall tone conveyed, this comment was intended as honest advice.
