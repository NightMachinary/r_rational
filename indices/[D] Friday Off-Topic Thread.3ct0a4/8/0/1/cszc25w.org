I'm confused by

#+begin_quote
  If a student has more than a couple B's in their core courses, they'll probably be ignored.
#+end_quote

Does this mean that grad schools expect mostly As in the core classes or getting Cs or lower in the core classes is an automatic disqualification? Because I'm now slightly worried about my intro classes that I got Bs in. :P

It sounds like if I do well in my current research group and get a paper published with my name on it in October (not certain, but a high possibility), as well as a good recommendation letter from the project leader, that will put me at the level to be a serious contender, correct?

Thanks so much for helping me with your advice!
