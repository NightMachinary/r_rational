When I was a TA, and it came time to handing out grades, I felt they were inflated. After spending the semester with the students, I felt some of A's should have been B's and some of the B's should have been C's.

In the old days, a lot of engineers became professional engineers after graduation by taking an exam. But I don't want to talk about the exam, I want to talk about the oath professional engineers take, the one whose first line is along the lines of, "I will hold paramount public safety," similar to doctors and their Hippocratic Oath. During my first real job, I found a sign error in a transformation matrix, and my boss sat me down and said, "One day, someone will use this [handheld sonar to find mines]. If you screw up, they could die. So are you really sure?" So I went back and double-checked the math and said, yeah, the angle is rotating the wrong way, and he agreed. There are some people we gave B's to that I would be uncomfortable putting in such a position because they had, at best, a tenuous grasp on the material and their work was sloppy. And they'll take their B and think they're good enough and keep plugging away toward their degree. I don't set grade policy.

Grade inflation happens. Institutions inflate grades so that their graduates have easier time competing for jobs. Ivy leagues in particular say they admit the cream of the crop, so their students shouldn't be penalized for their classmates being awesome. Studies show that professors who give higher grades get higher reviews, which helps them get raises and keep their jobs. And students aren't going to complain about higher grades, and generation Y feel particular entitled. If all the major actors have an incentive to keep inflating grades, who's going to stop it?

The school that has best weathered the decades-long trend of grade inflation is MIT, where a 3.0 there is equivalent to a 4.0 anywhere else. But they have the reputation to do that because they are such an outlier.
