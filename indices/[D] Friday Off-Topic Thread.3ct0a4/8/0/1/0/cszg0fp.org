Unless your school is much different, the average GPA for a course is about 3.0, maybe a bit lower for basic sequence classes and a bit higher for major sequence classes. But a 3.0 is a B. B is average. Grad schools aren't really interested someone who's just average. C raises serious red flags and better be accompanied by a reason, like medical issues.

The B's may be overlooked if you get A's from here on. The narrative it describes would be something like, "I might have had a rocky start, but in these more advanced classes that really matter, I'm rock solid."

But, yeah, get your name on a paper, preferably first or second author (I worked in engineering circles, not sure how things are in your field), and a letter from your project lead saying something like "I wish he was staying here" or "best student I've had in X years" or "picked up Y quickly and was soon making good contributions to the project" or "in the top Z% of students I've known," concrete details and comparisons to help gauge your ability. Those will help a good deal.
