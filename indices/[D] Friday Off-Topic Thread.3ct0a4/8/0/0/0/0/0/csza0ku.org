Digression: about 5-6 years into my Ph.D., when I realized that publish-or-perish academia is not my calling, I realized I still enjoy teaching and making people smarter (which is probably why I'm hanging out on [[/r/rational]]).

Anyway, I took a class on mentoring in higher education. That class' advice would be to find another mentor. There is an initial cost to switching advisors (time spent figuring out a new project; department politics akin to dating your ex's roommate). The plus side: better mental health because the path to your Ph.D. is clearer, maybe graduating faster if your current progress is really slow. Of course, line up the new advisor before breaking it off with your old one. Maybe do a project with the new one to see how $X$ year working with them will go.

Things to look for in an advisor:

- Clearly, you want them to be open to the question you want to work on. Failing that, you want one who has a project that interests you.

- A good working relationship. This includes things like can you get guidance when you need it and are the deadlines and deliverables reasonable. (Remember that relationships work both ways, so as you get help and funding, think about what they are getting out of you.)

- After you graduate, you'll be known as their student, meaning your reputations will reflect upon each other. It is in both of your interests that you do well after graduation, so having an advisor who can introduce you to key people and help with job placement helps (though if you were like me, graduating was a more immediate concern).

Take the above with a grain of salt as that was the opinion of one book, written by a professor and student who my class was pretty sure were banging while they wrote the book, which might color their perception of student-mentor relationships.
