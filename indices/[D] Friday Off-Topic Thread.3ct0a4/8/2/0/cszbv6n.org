Oh don't worry, my adviser (who I'm so lucky to have) is nudging me towards studying some more Logic (first-order and more) and Probability (specifically Bayesian stuff) to support the calculus, linear algebra, and a class on complexity analysis of algorithms. Do you think I'm missing anything for AI research? Thanks for the advice!
