I'd actually read up on real analysis and measure theory to support the probability and statistics work. I've often been frustrated to find that I'm reading a statistics paper, and it was written by /mathematicians/, so instead of just stating their theorems in terms of "elementary" probability theory (ie: probability as taught to undergraduate non-math majors learning statistics), they drop into the measure-theoretic axiomatization of probability. Then, by the end of the paper, I'm not at all sure what they've done, because measure theory comes at the bloody end of the bloody second semester of real analysis.

Topology or abstract algebra might also help with the Logic, but that might also be going a /bit/ far.

And computability theory, to help you get a grip on the grammars and automata used to study computational models of natural and artificial languages.
