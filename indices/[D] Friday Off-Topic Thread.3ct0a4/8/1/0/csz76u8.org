  And, from the flip side, you'll avoid landing in a field you are bored with. One of the saddest things I remember from grad school was talking to an undergrad (junior) who was majoring in mechanical engineering and just realized he was not interested in motors at all.

This.

Let's say it's junior year and you realize your major doesn't interest you. Is the path of least resistance to just stick to it a couple more years, get your degree, and get out? Get out to where, a job involving motors? If you're at a big university, they've got classes on everything under the sun. Go find something that you want to make a career out of.
