My advice is very old and out of date, probably. Research where you apply.

At least browse to the departments you are interested and see what areas the Profs are researching. If you can say "Well, I did my paper on X, which is a related to your research Y" that's a big leg up.

Remember, you are going to be their scut-monkey.

They'd rather get a trained monkey rather than watch you fling poo for a year.

And, from the flip side, you'll avoid landing in a field you are bored with. One of the saddest things I remember from grad school was talking to an undergrad (junior) who was majoring in mechanical engineering and just realized he was not interested in motors at all.
