As someone who read it, I can massively agree. I think one of the most interesting parts about it was how it broke down the culture of each nation and inserted a man-sized dose of realism into the entire thing. His take on how spirituality affects their world was also really good. I preferred it more than the canon portrayal of spirituality in AtLA because, let's be honest, based on the things the spirits in AtlA could accomplish, they would definitely be more than a footnote in their respective cultures (as they are in AtlA, the Water Tribe being the exception)

Edit: Also. The realistic take on Aang's character [[#s][]] was AWESOME.
