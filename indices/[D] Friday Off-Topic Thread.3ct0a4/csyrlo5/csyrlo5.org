This is fanfiction, so semi-related, but I've never brought it up here.

If you've watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, and are here which gives pretty good odds you're also into fanfiction to some degree, you should probably go read Embers, by Vathara. Here's a link to the first chapter: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/]]

Edit x2: Link is fixed, go read it.

It's a pretty darn good illustration of how major and sometimes subtle differences in cultures can cause huge rifts and lead to conflict. Also, the only A:TLA fanfic that I could picture the characters saying all the things written.
