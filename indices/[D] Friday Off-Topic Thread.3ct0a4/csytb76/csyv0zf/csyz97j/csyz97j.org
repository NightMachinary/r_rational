Well, that is definitely a clear and rational explanation.

I guess I never had a problem with the philosophy because that is what attracted me to AR's books in the first place. Some books are to entertain, some are to make a point, some are both. The purpose of Atlas Shrugged was to express Ayn Rand's philosophy, and I think she nailed it. She explicitly says that her book is about her philosophy, and that she choses events("concretes") to illustrate it, that was the whole point.

Because I read AS for the philosophy(although I loved her writing as well), John Galt's speech was one of my favorite parts.

Also I wouldn't say that it is really /political/ philosophy. I mean she obviously talks about politics, but I've read AS as a book about personal philosophy, about thinking clearly, and looking at the world from a different angle than I was brought up with. It was really liberating and made a lot of sense to me.

Thank you for a thoughtful reply, even though I disagree, I think I understand what you mean.
