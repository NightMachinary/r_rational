So... I'm currently dealing with depression and am also one of those trans youths that live with but are not out to their parents. I've been thinking of asking for advice here for awhile, I know that that has nothing to do with the purpose of this community but the trans subreddits just... I don't know. I just feel like I actually have a philosophy in common with the people here and I need original thoughts and not the standard template of hotlines and assurances. Honestly this is one of the main reasons I wanted to start an irc, to talk about things with this group that are not just rational fic. I'm not even sure what I'm asking for here, I just really need some acknowledgement right now. Also, are there any other trans regulars or at least lurkers?
