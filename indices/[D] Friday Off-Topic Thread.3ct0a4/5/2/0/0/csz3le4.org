I'm working on my PhD in computer vision and AI perception models. I can see how the progress towards online learning and models that can meaningfully absorb more computing power could lead to AGI (or not), but frankly I don't think we're anywhere near and won't be for decades, never mind a self-improving AGI. Just as likely, the latest state-of-the-art algorithms will just end up as another chapter in an AI textbook.

If anything, once more progress is made towards AGI, I look forward to MIRI and the like either producing real results or finally being exposed as useless intellectual masturbation.
