Banned from [[/r/rational]]. Participating in /pol/ is ok. Explicitly endorsing /pol/'s positions (ie: "gas the kikes, race war now", etc.) on [[/r/rational]] would be... well, let's hope the user-base is sensible enough to spot that explicit hate-spam shouldn't even need to be mentioned in the rules, since the mods are sensible enough to wait until such is actually posted before taking action.
