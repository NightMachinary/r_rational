It's pretty common for people to start with computer science + psychology with the intent of studying machine intelligence. It's a very normal path.

I'd recommend computer science + statistics more highly if you really want to push for machine intelligence though. Statistics deals with uncertainty and large quantities of data. What machine learning problem doesn't involve either of those? An already solved one.

I also recommend computer science and computer science + anything to everyone. Whatever it is you want to do, you'll get more of it done with a computer. And be paid more.
