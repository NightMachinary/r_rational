A few years back I was at a course where demonstrated I vs E, N vs S and T vs F quite vividly, and J vs P okay (likely due to time pressure).

They split us up into groups for each, and for example for I vs E the groups had to put up ideas for weekend activities. The Is were all quiet inside weekend reading books etc., while the Es were all about parties, noise and lots of people. The facilitators then showed various other ways this affects how you should interact with the opposite type.

I found the exercise very useful overall.
