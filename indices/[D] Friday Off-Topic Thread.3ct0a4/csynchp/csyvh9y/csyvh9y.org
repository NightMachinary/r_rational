I would definitely advise to go with machine intelligence.

First, the most obvious thing, is that AI and ML will be more and more valuable over time, these are very "hot" topics that will give you a lot of leverage(and $$). They are also applicable in almost any field, so you will be able to work on solving interesting problems, with almost anything you want - robotics, neuroscience, computer graphics, internet, bio, it's useful everywhere and with arrival of the internet of things and such will be even more so. Psychology - not so much.

Second, working with AI and ML is one of the best possible ways to influence the world right now. These are rapidly evolving fields, there will be many cool discoveries in the following years. These fields have space for several Einsteins/Teslas/Turings. Will you make some important discovery in psychology? Meh.

Also, machine intelligence is a real science that will actually make you better at thinking. In my personal opinion psychology is closer to liberal arts than to "real" sciences like math and physics. Neuroscience is important and will make a lot of progress in understanding the nature of thinking and human mind, machine intelligence too. Psychology to neuroscience is what alchemy is to chemistry.
