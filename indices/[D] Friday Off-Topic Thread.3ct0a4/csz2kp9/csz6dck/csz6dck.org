Meh. Just another day of Moloch making everyone unhappy.

The relationship between admins and mods probably is horrible, and maybe it will improve now. But once the rage machine spun up, it wouldn't be stopped; and the amount of hate expressed towards Pao is... just to be expected, I guess.

In general, I don't think she had another choice, I don't think she was at fault at all, and I feel somewhat sorry for her.
