The timing is terrible: giving in to tantrums only teaches them that throwing a tantrum /works/.

If this was going to happen, it should have been a few months from now when reddit has calmed down a bit. Coming this soon after the [[/r/fatpeoplehate]] banning and the sheer volume of hatred that inspired.... I don't like the message that sends. I don't want anyone to think that the abuse that Pao received is an effective or acceptable means of advocating for change.

That said, I don't blame her for leaving now. I wouldn't put up with that kind of treatment.
