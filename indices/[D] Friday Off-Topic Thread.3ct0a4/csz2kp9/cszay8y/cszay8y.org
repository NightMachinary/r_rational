She shut down some vile subreddits, mistakenly tried to post something from her inbox, and was a woman in power. Somehow this made her Satan. Basic pattern recognition says that the last of those offenses was the more egregious one.

The reactionary elements of this website are getting worse, and it worries me that this is a reflection of our society. The correlation with reddit getting bigger and discussions getting more misogynistic could be explained by wider society having more misogynists than are normally visible, and that worries me. There are other possible explanations, I just worry about this one.

Her resignation message hinted that there are aggressive goals for reddit's growth and monetization in the near future. People will freak out about the monetization part, of course. I'm more concerned that the board still wants to push for growth in the user base when growth so far has made this place more vile over time.
