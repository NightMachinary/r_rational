The relationship between reddit and admins was somewhat poor. The relationship between users and admins has been poorer. This has been true for a long time. I'm a mod in secret mod subreddits, and on those I've seen complaints going back four years.

Pao became the target of a lot of that hate, and that was amplified by some poor decisions she made.

The person responsible for the recent ama incident in question got far less hate.
