  something I didn't pick up on from the Reddit comments I saw about her

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3cetav/i_made_a_wordcloud_of_the_signatures_on_the/csuwej6][Most commonly repeated comments in the change.org petition]].

Look, when people use words like "bitch" and "cunt" to describe someone, that's misogyny. Those are gendered slurs - it's not like calling someone "asshole" or "fuckhead" which are merely uncivil. Choosing those words indicates that their gender is important to your hatred.

Also, the offense that kicked this whole thing off was banning [[/r/fatpeoplehate]]. The previous (male) administration got away with banning the much more popular [[/r/jailbait]] and [[/r/creepshots]] without weeks of front paged death threats.

I know people are pretty head-in-the-sand about these things, but this is a rationalist subreddit. You should be able to take a phrase like, "People on reddit will look harder for excuses to hate women than they will for men," and judge its correctness based on its predictive power.
