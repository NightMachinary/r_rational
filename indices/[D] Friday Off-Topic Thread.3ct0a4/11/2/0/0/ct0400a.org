Warning: this article was basically rewritten after it was published and popularized ([[http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html]]). Not sure which version you read!

It's plausible that Pao was an easier to hate scapegoat because of her gender and race. Definitely her discrimination suit was a part of it.
