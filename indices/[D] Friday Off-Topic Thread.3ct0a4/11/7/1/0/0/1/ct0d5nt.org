Someone in reddit's upper management certainly screwed up with the firing of Victoria: subreddits who host AMAs and the guests they'd invited both got left in the cold with no communication and no transition plan, and had to cancel things while they worked it out. Victoria was apparently crucial to that process. The whole "subreddits going private as a protest" thing started with [[/r/IAMA]] going private simply because they didn't know how they'd continue on without her.

However, I'm not sure there's evidence that Pao herself was directly responsible. But as CEO of reddit at the time, she certainly took the blame.
