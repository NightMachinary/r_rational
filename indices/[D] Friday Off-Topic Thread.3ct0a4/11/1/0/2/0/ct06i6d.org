I can see why you came to this comparison, but I really hate it. That was an period where that population was in rough shape economically, people were starting to feel desperate (and betrayed after the Treaty of Versailles) and a time when information traveled in a much different way... this is a situation where I saw many of posts near the top of the thread being the voices of reason, the people involved were sitting relaxed at home in front of their computers, and in the end the main "rebellion" and only thing that everyone agreed on was that the mod/admin relationship needs work (and then a majority that thought Victoria shouldn't have been fired). In contrast, only a minority of users (Reddit has something like 12 million users monthly, where thousands of people signed against Pao and probably some more thousands felt the same) fell into the Pao hate and then signed a petition asking for Pao's resignation (which doesn't even come close to war/war crimes/genocide or even ostracization of an entire ethnic group).

I think a better answer is that there are also a lot of commentators who gave pretty persuasive posts arguing against her, like this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3curfb/cmv_reddit_will_go_in_exactly_the_same_direction/cszdmwi][one]]. I could see people being swayed by this. I don't necessarily agree with it, but after researching it a bit I think I overestimated the Pao hate and also it's a whole lot easier thing to happen than the rise of the Nazi party.
