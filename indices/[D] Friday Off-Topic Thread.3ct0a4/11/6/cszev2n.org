The whole episode (and GamerGate in general) has made me a little more leery of using Reddit; I can't say I can do much about it myself, though. I dared to set up /v/NarutoFanfiction on Voat, but it's even more dead than [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]] is, and there obviously isn't a live /v/rational there yet, either.
