Perfect! I'm spending August on some serious self-study to give myself some more background knowledge to handle the higher-level classes coming up next semester.

I'll probably spend every other day on prepping for the GREs and the off days on refreshing linear algebra and your recommendations. Introduction to Theory of Computation was last year's class, so thanks for making me feel better about having that done already. ;)
