You don't really need to prep much for the GREs. Most people I know who had good grades in their high-level undergrad classes actually just walked in and aced their GREs without much effort. Even me!

(Seriously, the GRE is actually somewhat easier than the SAT, as proven by my scoring well into the 700s on GRE math.)
