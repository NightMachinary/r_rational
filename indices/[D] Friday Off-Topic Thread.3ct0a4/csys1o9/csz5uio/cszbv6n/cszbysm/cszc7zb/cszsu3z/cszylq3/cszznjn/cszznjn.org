Check how many points each question is worth. If it takes 1-2 mistakes to get a 790 instead of an 800, hey, diminishing returns.

I got a 740 or thereabouts back in the day, to my own surprise. Since you're better prepared and more dedicated than I was, you should be able to hit diminishing returns/random error scores pretty quickly.
