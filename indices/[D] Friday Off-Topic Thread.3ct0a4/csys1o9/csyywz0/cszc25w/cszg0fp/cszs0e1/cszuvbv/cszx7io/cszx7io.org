Yes, I hear your vast array of explanations and excuses for grade inflation. I just think that if you're actually sitting on a graduate committee, before saying that students who get a mixture of Bs and As rather than pure As are too mediocre to admit, you should try actually checking the departmental averages.

I might be butthurt, but back when I went to undergrad (which, admittedly, was four years ago), a mixture of Bs-and-As was sufficient to graduate with honors, and in the science and engineering departments required actual work to attain.

Also, the place I did my MSc was an MIT-level grade deflater, in which it was generally assumed that only 40-50 percent of students should pass each course's final exam with a >=65% on their first attempt (they did receive a second attempt... but it was sometimes actually /more/ difficult), and a 69% average grade on said exams indicated a particularly easy course.

I have some rather severe views on the pedagogical honesty and quality involved in /both/ grade inflation /and/ deflation.
