So something reassuring: My department, at least, did not accept anyone it thought couldn't hack it. That means if you receive an acceptance letter, it's a vote of confidence that in /N/ years they'll be calling you Dr. Transfuturist. They don't intend to waste years of your time or their time to see if you bear fruit.

I have heard some schools that accept more Ph.D. candidates than they can take and use the prelim/qual exams to filter them out. If that concerns you, research what proportion of admissions get Ph.D., masters, or just leave.

A Ph.D. is about a 6-year commitment during your 20's. It's not something you do on a whim. And getting into a big name school is not something you decide to do junior year and spend one summer working on, nor should it be. But if you're serious, you'll probably spend your undergrad and summers exploring your chosen field, getting to understand what are the big unanswered questions and the tools in your toolbox and getting your hands dirty. That's basically what I said above: show that you're serious by working toward it and produce something of value.
