Still, I finished my MSc this past year (was never on a PhD track due to being in a system where direct-to-PhD didn't exist) and you've given /me/ anxiety and impostor syndrome.

Oh, no, wait, being a grad-student and realizing I had the wrong advisor and realizing it takes forever for my advisor's research with his students to get published because it's /crap/ and realizing I'd missed out on math prereqs and having my papers rejected did that.

Halp.
