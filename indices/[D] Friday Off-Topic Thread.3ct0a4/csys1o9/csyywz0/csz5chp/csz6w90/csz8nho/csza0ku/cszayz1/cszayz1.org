Well as I said, I was working in a system where a direct-to-PhD track didn't exist, which I had committed to because I wasn't absolutely sure about that advisor and was afraid the school was kinda screwing with me. Spoilers: they were.

So technically, I successfully finished a research MSc, with a thesis. I just have to write in with some paperwork and pay fees. "Hurrah."

Non-technically, while I did work my advisor seems to mostly approve of, his lab and his students have a consistently difficult time getting published, and while I'm good at writing in general, I'm /shitty/ at writing professional, mature-looking papers that pass peer review. Everything I submit is basically ridiculed.

Your advice is good, but I still feel kinda lost and incompetent. I am finished and work in an industrial job now to pay rent (working in project-based R&D with mostly other ex-academics, even), so I now have time to study all the things I missed in undergrad (and didn't have the prereqs for in grad school). I'm doing that, and trying to find the time to put my MS thesis work in publishable form over and over until we can get it published /somewhere/.

But I still actually feel pretty lost and depressed about my own basic incompetence at doing /really good/ research and getting it published. Publications are everything! I /want/ my advisor to get publications out of my time as a student! That's the /point/ of academia! I just wish I was better at it.
