As a grad student in UC Berkeley, I assisted my mentor, who was on the subcommittee for our field (signals and systems, within the Electrical Engineering / Computer Science department). In short: I filtered out a lot of applicants, we discussed the rest to find a short list, he and other professors came together to decide who to make offers to (including discussing how much funding they had to spare). That was just for our field, but I think the department/college just checked off what was decided.

Disclaimer: I served on the committee around the start of the recession. I was admitted to Berkeley when tech companies and engineering departments were swimming in cash. I very likely would not have been accepted if I had applied 5 years later. Ultimately, I found out that research isn't my thing.

*If you read one paragraph:* know what the department wants. At Berkeley, it's all about research potential. I imagine that other research intensive institutions are similar. People who didn't make our list: the guy who started and ran his own audio speaker company (he's probably better off at Stanford anyway); the person who's main accomplishment was president of the engineering society; the collegiate-level track star, despite his coach saying how hard he worked. People who did make the cut: people who demonstrated that they have been working toward a career in research for years by working at labs and internships, working on projects, getting their names on papers and posters. That said, authorship is not required. We had a fair number of people whose paper was under review; or they worked on a project that would be turned into a poster/paper, but that would occur after their summer was up. Basically, does the applicant have experience with research and show promise by contributing to a project? (And by publications, I mean in international peer-reviewed journals, not the Chennai journal for signal processing, sorry.)

*Recommendation letters:* Let me describe 75% of the recommendations we read. "X was in my class Y. He/She earned an A. He/She seems nice and is interested in grad school. (Left unsaid: based off a couple short conversations we had while they ingratiated themselves because we never talked before they needed a letter of recommendation.)" These letters were immediately ignored. If all of the letters were like this, the student generally was too. Again, know what the department wants. If it is a research university, they want to hear from people who supervised the research, what they contributed to the project, how fast they got up to speed, etc. We read letters from industry with a grain of salt because, unless the manager has a Ph.D., they probably don't know what a Ph.D. program is looking for.

*Home institution:* For international institutions, unless the school has a strong established reputation, there is too much uncertainty as to the quality of the students. Similarly for smaller US schools. Students can try to argue they are a diamond in the rough, but why does a big name school need to take a risk when there are applicants from prestigious schools that excelled among their peer group? Does this mean students from an unknown school have no chance? No, but they have an uphill climb. They should find an internship at an established lab to show they have the chops for the big leagues.

*Grades:* If a student has more than a couple B's in their core courses, they'll probably be ignored. The reasoning is that, if they're not doing that well among their peers, maybe the grad school should be considering those students instead. Also, students should take enough of the core classes before the grad school application is due. A transcript where most of the core classes don't have a grade because they're in their senior year indicates the student put off or is slow building toward their supposed intended career. If your home institution does not have a strong reputation, the bar is even higher.

*GRE scores:* We mostly ignored these. Okay, if the applicant had a 600 math, they were eliminated immediately. But 760-800 math is as common as dirt, so it doesn't differentiate the applicant from others. Anecdotally, someone told me the reason they were accepted into University Kentucky was because of an 800 logic score, so take my words with a grain of salt. But realistically, everyone applying to MIT grad school probably has an 800 math, maybe 780 if it was a bad day. (I was so annoyed by my 780 logic score.)

*Miscellaneous:* To be honest, we did not read the statement of purpose. A student can say they want to research, but what is more telling is if they took steps to work toward that goal.

Things like minority status and extracurriculars added a tilt value, but I don't remember any instance in two years where they moved someone from "no" to "yes."

There's probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. If you have questions, let me know.
