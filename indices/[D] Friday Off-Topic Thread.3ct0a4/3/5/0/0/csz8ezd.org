Lmao. I'm weird because I'm here as in on this thread, here as in on this subreddit or am I weird because I'm here on Earth, whereas most other places in the universe can't support our known definition of life, making me a statistical anomaly if we're talking about the general universe (although i sense there's something about the Anthropic Principle I misused here) :P
