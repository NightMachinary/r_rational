The amount of extraordinary things I've tried includes (but is not limited to):

- Naruto Ninjutsu (Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu being my favorite, have had the handseals memorized and perfected for about 7 years now)

- /Hadoken/

- /Kamehameha/

- Super Saiyan Transformation

- Bicycle Kick (Lu Kang, Mortal Kombat)

- A variety of transformations (usually in which I transform from my normal self into a favored character or creature.)

- Imagining myself being killed by an unknown supernatural agent and healing /a la/ Wolverine (This one's odd because I treat the unknown agent as intelligent, so he keeps learning and trying to surpass my healing factor with a variety of techniques. He's stymied by the fact that he's ultimately imaginary).

- Flying (inspired by DBZ, Superman and a thousand other things)

- Corrupted by supernatural demonic energy that's slowly spreading throughout my body (Currently encompasses my entire left arm, both eyes and the part of my chest where my heart is. This corruption is indicated by a variety of imagined runic sigils)

- The energy above is also counterpart to the energy of my right arm, which is based in nature, specifically derived from wind and wolves (essentially a Werewolf arm)

- Multiple created personas in my mind (Currently there are two, but over my entire life, there's easily been at least 5 at any one time)

Point of order: I'm well aware that all of the above is purely fictional and any effects they have are purely induced by the psychological stock I put into them. And even then, they'll have no real effects other than altering my behavior.

TL;DR: *I'm a weird mofo.*
