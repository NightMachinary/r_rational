I want to fly by shooting energy from my legs. Somehow, that doesn't hurt my suspension of disbelief as much as anything else.

I'm too heavy for bird-wings, the aerodynamics are all wrong. Telekinesis still needs something to push against, conservation of momentum is pretty much inviolate. But I know my legs can hold my weight and I go running a lot.

Silly, but that's the point of this thread, isn't it?
