Since no one else mentioned it, aren't there some massive issues with Myers-Briggs personality tests, especially in both a) self-reporting and b) inconsistent results which is why it isn't used professionally?

I can see the merit in some sort of test but especially with the community that forms I feel that most people consider themselves X, Y, Z and then answer questions to match that rather than answer honestly. Any sort of test really should be at least not self administered and with questions that are not so very often badly worded and misconstruable.

For the record I cannot remember though I have taken and enjoyed taking the tests before, morality and personality tests can at least lead for some good discussion among peers even if the results aren't worth anything.
