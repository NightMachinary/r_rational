The test is not repeatable, really. (This is a pet peeve of mine. I once yelled at my CEO in public because he spent a rather large sum of money to have us all take those tests and discuss the meaning. But it could be worse, I'm told graphology is used in parts of Canada....)

I think we can all agree that there are personality types, but I have not personally been impressed with any of the tests to determine them.

The tests exist (and this is a general hypothesis) in the same way that degrees exist. If a hire doesn't work out, everyone just shrugs and says "Well, the test/degree said to hire them" instead of looking into why the hire failed.

There was an article today about how interviewing and hiring is ripe for some money-ball style data and that's just starting to happen, I view these tests as the alchemy that may someday lead to chemistry.
