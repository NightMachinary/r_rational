I'm INTJ, though I don't put a bunch of stock in it. I mean ... it's a categorization system, so might be useful in certain ways, but I'm not sure that personality typing provides much in the way of useful information to a person. It's sort of like asking if someone is a Zoe or a Zelda; yes, we can divide people up like that, but it's not clear that there's a real point to this (or that we /can/ divide people up using simple binaries, since I would assume that many people fall in between extremes). This is something that I've argued with my sister over a number of times.
