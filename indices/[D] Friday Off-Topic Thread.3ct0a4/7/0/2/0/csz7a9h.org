I don't know TOO much about the tests, but isn't that exercise you described pretty much just a reversal of it? Like those tests ask you questions like "What activity would you do on the weekend" and "What's the best way to spend your vacation?". And to get your letter, you have to answer them in a certain way. In your scenario, it sounds like they paired you up into what your letters already were, and then asked you questions typically found on the test. So of course the data it produces would be congruent. Or am I missing something?
