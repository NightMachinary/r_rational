I like the SlateStarCodex post on MBTI: [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/]]

It doesn't refute or address all the points you made, but it does answer some objections a lot of folks (including me) have against it. Namely, that it's nonscientific, and also that it implies a bimodal distribution for personality traits.
