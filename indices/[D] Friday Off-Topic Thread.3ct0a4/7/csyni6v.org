I've been reading about personality types a lot recently---both MBTI and Enneagram. Does anybody know their own type? I'd be interested to see what the split is between F and T here, as I imagine it'd lean towards T.

Or maybe nobody here puts any stock in personality types beyond an amusing diversion. If so, why?
