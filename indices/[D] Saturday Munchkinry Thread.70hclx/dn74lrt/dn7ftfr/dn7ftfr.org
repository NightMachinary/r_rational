One now (to be replaced with one from the soonest possible point where I'm fully rested/fed/warm/safe). This is for keeping. Foreverish.

One rolling save at the start of the year, and one at the start of the week. (Or maybe at the start of this week and last week) Go through life learning, generally enjoying myself and occasionally resetting to fix a large problem that happened within the two short term saves. At some point (death from old age?) reset to the initial save. Hopefully my future knowledge and experience will help me out, assuming i can keep in mind that the C++17 standard doesn't include the DWIM keyword and Bluetooth 4.0 can't stream to my retina.

Rinse and repeat as long as needed until I've fixed humanity or concluded that I can't achieve that.
