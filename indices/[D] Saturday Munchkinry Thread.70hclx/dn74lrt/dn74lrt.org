You have three save points. Upon death, or falling into an incapacitated state from which you will not recover at all or will not recover within a year, you are immediately taken to a spot to reload.

You can overwrite these save points at any point during your run, like a video game file. However, going back to an earlier save voids any later saves. Go back two weeks and your save last week is dead.

How do you distribute your saves? One weekly one you can easily reload to. Multiple monthly ones?
