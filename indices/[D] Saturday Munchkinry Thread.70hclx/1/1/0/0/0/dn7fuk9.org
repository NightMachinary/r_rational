Definitely world-building not munchkin questions, unless you're planning on doing some sort of werewolf abortion for profit :)

There's no anti-transformation methods: you are either in "wolf cycle" (turn into wolf every few weeks) or out of "wolf cycle" (don't turn into a wolf, ever, until wolf cycle is entered).

There are ways to put yourself into wolf cycle, and ways to take you out of it, but they tend to be very demanding of time and mental/physical energy. Most werewolves enter wolf cycle and then stay there because leaving wolf cycle is virtually impossible due to the amount of effort required. Most reliable way to enter wolf cycle is to be bitten by a werewolf (in human or wolf form), and this is irreversable.

RE pregnancy: transformation keeps your human body in hammerspace effectively (happens using 4D), so the womb with baby and all would probably be in suspended animation. I assume this might result in your gestation taking a bit longer than normal depending on how much of the pregnancy you spend in wolf form, but it probably wouldn't add more than an extra month so wouldn't be something that doctors would find too weird.

Wolf gestation is about two months so assuming 10 transformations a year of 3 days each, you're looking at 2 years of calendar time to give birth to a litter of pups.

Mind the plaything of the body: I want the "human mind" to have ultimate control, and the "wolf brain" is just a shell that is used as a conduit to that human mind. But this conflicts with my idea that e.g. dementia is cured while you are in wolf form. So there's probably a more complicated relationship at work.
