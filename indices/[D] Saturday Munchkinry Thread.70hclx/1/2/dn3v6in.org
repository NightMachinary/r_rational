As far as the wolf body being healthy, does this mean wounds are not preserved when you transform? Ie, if you get stabbed with a knife as a human, then transform to a wolf, the wolf doesn't have a stab wound. Then does the wound return when you turn back into a human as if no time has passed? Otherwise this would be free healing like in Animorphs. Similarly, if you get stabbed as a wolf then transform is your human form stab-free? And several weeks later when you transform again do you get a new healthy wolf body or would it still have the stab wound?

Assuming you don't have free healing to your human body, the only advantage I can see from this is the ability to commit crimes without being caught. If, for some reason, you wanted to kill someone, you could track his movements, find a time/place where he's going to be relatively isolated and lines up with your wolf time, and then go kill him as a wolf. Forensics will find a dead body with wolf bites and if there are witnesses they'll report that a wolf killed him. There will likely be a search for a rogue wolf, but there won't be a murder investigation and if you've prepared right you can hide until you're a human again and nobody will know (except potentially people who know about werewolves).

I don't think you could make a habit of it, and I'm not sure it's particularly profitable. If you hired out as an assassin you'd have to prove you're a werewolf (or claim to have a trained wolf) in order to verify the kill, which would make you potentially traceable by or through your client. You could also try other crimes such as burglary as a wolf, but that's going to be harder and raise a lot more suspicions.
