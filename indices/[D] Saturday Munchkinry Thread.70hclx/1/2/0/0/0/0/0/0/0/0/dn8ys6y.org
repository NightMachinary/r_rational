The wolf copy would presumably age at whatever rate the Atlanteans thought a wolf copy should age - so a young werewolf having a 'puppy' form which then ages with him (i.e. slower than a real wolf) to mature wolf and then stops aging is not unreasonable.

If it's nanites, then they don't need to take all of the mass for the wolf side from his body. A lot of it can be taken from the atmosphere - at least those parts made of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, which is most of it. (Not that that's likely to make too much difference in his daily life).

It's also quite possible that the nanites are working exactly as designed... but in the intervening millennia, everyone's simply forgotten how to trigger the intentional change, which is supposed to involve saying a complex phrase while standing in a certain unlikely posture.
