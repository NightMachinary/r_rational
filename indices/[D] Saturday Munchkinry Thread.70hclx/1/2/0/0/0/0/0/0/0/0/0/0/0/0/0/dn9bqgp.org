  He could probably even manage (with some difficulty) with an ordinary keyboard/mouse

He'd probably have a little snout cover made that has a small point at the end that can be used to hunt and peck on the keyboard. Or perhaps something for the paws, but I think canines are far more dexterous with their snouts so it'd probably be the ways to go.

I like quite a lot of this, though some of the details will require localisation (e.g. home-schooling is apparently a thing where I'm from but I've never heard of anyone ever actually doing it; a house generally costs 10-15 years salary, etc). But the broad strokes are great!

Then /again/, he could be an orphan (gogo tragic backstory?) and have inherited his parents' fully paid off house. More outsider stuff: he had to fend for himself pretty young (say he had a single mother and then when Zach is age 14 she gets a chronic illness - MS or ALS or something - and he spends a lot of his time caring for her, and she dies when he's 18 or 19). Just when everything finally starts getting OK for him again, BAM, he starts transforming into a wolf every few months and he realises that he's never going to be anything approaching normal.

It is important to me that the character have an affinity for animals, but it might be more interesting if he had pet birds, big aviary, etc rather than the more traditional "werewolves have an affinity for dogs and then it all makes sense hurr hurr". Then again, adopting some big grey dogs would give him good cover.

  Has a dog collar (with tag) in his closet, to prevent embarrassing incidents like that time he was found (human-shaped and naked) in the dog pound.

omg! Though the thought of a ranger just casually trapping a /wolf/ is pretty intense.

  he could also be a motivational speaker, or any other job that works mostly by appointment. He just has to avoid scheduling appointments at certain times.

I might think more through this nascent idea you gave me about his Sick Mother. Perhaps he's a charity worker? A recent survivor winner was a homeless shelter manager by occupation, and something like that could work well: if he founded the organisation, he could just piss off for a few days at a time. And the homeless are pretty misunderstood.

Hmmm. I have a friend who used to be a drug and alcohol abuse counselor at a prison. I might go ask what sort of prison adjacent jobs there are. Zach seems like the sort of person who might be a good parole officer, "person who educates prisoners in life skills", etc. (Actually I think my cousin works educating prisoners.... so yep... Zach is probably involved with prison somehow, and THAT is how Our Heroes have links to the underworld, and probably Fiona could have set him up there).

Actually I think some of our local prisons have programmes where they teach prisoners how to train dogs and stuff. That'd be right up Zach's alley.

Thanks so much for your comments! You give me such breakthroughs somehow :)
