  Ie, if you get stabbed with a knife as a human, then transform to a wolf, the wolf doesn't have a stab wound. Then does the wound return when you turn back into a human as if no time has passed?

It would come as if no time has passed. Even if it was an Animorphs-like healing factor, the slight randomness means you can't depend on it to get you out of a sticky situation.

  Similarly, if you get stabbed as a wolf then transform is your human form stab-free? And several weeks later when you transform again do you get a new healthy wolf body or would it still have the stab wound?
#+end_quote

Wolf body would have the stab wound, nice and fresh.

(Due to the way transformation works - through the two bodies being linked via the 4th dimension and basically the transformation "forcing" the wolf/human body to move "up"/"down" relative to 3D space - the human body is linked to the wolf body. This means that the human body is effectively in suspended animation, and so is the wolf body when it is not "visible".)

Other thought was that that the 4D space the human/wolf protrudes into when it's not "visible" allows the body to heal in the meantime, die of blood loss, etc, but then by the time you've been a werewolf for 20 years your wolf body should be decrepit and aged rather than young and feisty, so suspended animation is probably better.
