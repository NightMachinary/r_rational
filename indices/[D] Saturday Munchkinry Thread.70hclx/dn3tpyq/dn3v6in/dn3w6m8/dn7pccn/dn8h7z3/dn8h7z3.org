If the human body can heal/bleed out/etc when not visible, Wolf Body should age when not visible because of symmetry?

I get what you're saying, though: the wolf body is a 4D biological construct that is attached to a human body in meta-space, so why does it need to age at the same rate as a regular wolf? Good point. I /do/ like the idea of human!you getting a neck wound, happening to transform almost immediately, and then the wolf passes out from blood loss with no obvious scratch. (more likely: succumbing to internal injuries received in human form. I wonder if the wolf would cough up blood?).
