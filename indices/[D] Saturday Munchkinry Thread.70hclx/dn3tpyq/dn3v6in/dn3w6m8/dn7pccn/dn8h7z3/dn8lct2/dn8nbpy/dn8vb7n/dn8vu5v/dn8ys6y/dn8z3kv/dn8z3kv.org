Oh, DUH. Thank you. That makes things easier. Cheers!

The other stuff is good food for thought. Need to figure out what my wolf story is going to be /about/, but that's high level "how do I write?" level stuff. I have two main WW characters (Zach and Fiona), and I was thinking of having Zach be a supernatural vet like Fiona is a supernatural lawyer: but I am wondering if there's a more interesting job / niche in society for Zach to occupy than being a vet. Especially since the ensemble cast already includes an emergency room physician, so you'd already have a character capable of doing what Zach could reasonable be expected to do (basic first aid).
