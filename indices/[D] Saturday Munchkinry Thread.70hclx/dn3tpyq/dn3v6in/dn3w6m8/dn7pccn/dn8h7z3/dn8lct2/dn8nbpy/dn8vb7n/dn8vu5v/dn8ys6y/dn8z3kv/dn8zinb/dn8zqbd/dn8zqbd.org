Police dog unit is interesting. One of the main characters is a police officer, so that could either work for or against the idea (of course /she/ will never get a novel written about /her/ so maybe she's not a main enough character?). Zach is 10 years older than her though.

Yeah, it's where we run into trouble, even with the vet thing. Fiona at least is a lawyer who works alone and not currently in wolf cycle mode besides; Zach will be in wolf cycle mode the whole time so he's going to need an appropriately flexible job.

(When I call in sick I do it via email, so Zach could probably do that with a suitably modified keyboard/mouse).

That was one of the things I thought of for him, but I'm not sure he'd be good at it. Zach is full of sunshine and rainbows, comes across as naive (but isn't overly), and is probably autistic to some degree. His character has always been about being aloof, isolated, and misunderstood so that's where I kind of want to go with him.

The vet thing worked because it was him relating with animals "instead of" people.

Data analyst (aka generic computer desk job) might be a good choice for him, but I /do/ like interesting professions.
