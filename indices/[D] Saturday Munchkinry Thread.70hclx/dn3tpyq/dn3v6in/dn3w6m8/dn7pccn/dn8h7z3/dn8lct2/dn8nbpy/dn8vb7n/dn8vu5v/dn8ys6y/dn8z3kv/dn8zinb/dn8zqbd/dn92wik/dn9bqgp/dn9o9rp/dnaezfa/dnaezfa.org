  He's not a canine. He's a human mind in a canine shape, and I think the average unicorn would find it easier to type with paws than with nose.

Yeah, I suppose it depends. Our dog has a thing called a "cleverpet" which is a console that dispenses food when pads are pressed. She prefers to use her nose instead of her paw by a large margin and is more accurate with her nose. But dogs can be trained to be accurate with paws, so perhaps it would be more intuitive for a human to use paws.

  Because if he lives alone, he really only needs a teeny tiny one-room place, and I imagine that might only cost eight years' salary...

Not really. You can't get one bedrooms unless they're apartments, and I'd think someone with a wolf-transforming-at-random condition would need more privacy than that. [[https://reiwa.com.au/9-88-the-ramble-booragoon-3971218/][Here's an example]] of a two bedroom place for sale at the moment - which, you're right, comes out to 8 years salary. But if I have him work in a prison, he'll probably be living in the town near the prison where things are a [[https://reiwa.com.au/14-clayden-street-wooroloo-3921027/][lot more affordable]], even for a huge block.

  Can dogs tell that wolf-him is still him from the scent? If so, they're going to continually assume that other humans also turn into dogs when they're not looking. If not, then once a month they're going to band together to chase away the stranger.

Hmmm. He'd probably smell different, but I'd imagine the dogs would get used to it. He probably rehabilitates and rehomes dogs on his property, so he might have quite a few. He'd have everything set on automatic feeders so an ill-timed change doesn't screw everything up, though.

  Though, a counsellor who's absent three days a month might be a problem - aren't counsellors supposed to be pretty permanently on emergency call? I don't really know.

I had a long chat session with Former Prison Worker Friend and got a bunch of useful information. Resettlement Officers basically run programmes to help prisoners have life skills, organise things with other organisations ("field trips", training, etc), give job related counselling, etc. In small prisons (like Wooroloo Prison Farm, where he works), Resettlement Officers basically do a bit of everything and are kind of jacks of all trades. So he'd be able to run a "give prisoners dogs to train and look after" programme no sweat. The job also runs like a pretty normal government job here, so you get a decent number of days off (and the ability to "buy" more, so Zach would do that if the allotted 20 per year doesn't cover all his changes), plus good sick leave and other benefits. Otherwise it's a pretty standard 8-4 sort of job.

His stories about the prison system also gave me a lot of little hooks - although Zach won't be required to dress to more than basic professional standards, guards tend to look down on people who don't "shine their shoes and iron every crease", so his green hair and nose ring would probably not make him a fan. Prisoners really rely on routine so Zach taking frequent days off, even if they're scheduled in advance, would piss them off. It's hard to get anything done in a prison because everything is so regimentally scheduled: you have to have the prisons out at a certain time for counts, they get a 15 minute smoke break, etc, so a 2 hour class really only gives you 80 minutes of usable time. Not sure how Zach would feel about that: he's very positive and full of energy so I'm not sure whether he'd be more "I am making a difference in the system, yay!" or if he'd be more "i hate this system i can't make a difference". I think the former because he's so optimistic...

(Now I'm wondering if Zach would get a note from a werewolf psychiatrist/doctor saying he has a condition that means he needs regular days off. I have a friend who is a psychiatrist, I should ask him if there's a condition that could work. Otherwise, a world like ours but with werewolves would probably have a fake mental illness requiring days of isolation that was invented for the purpose of concealing werewolves...)
