  He'd probably have a little snout cover made that has a small point at the end that can be used to hunt and peck on the keyboard.
#+end_quote

...okay, yeah, a specialised tool makes sense. (Or a pen he holds in his mouth).

#+begin_quote
  Or perhaps something for the paws, but I think canines are far more dexterous with their snouts so it'd probably be the ways to go.
#+end_quote

He's not a canine. He's a human mind in a canine shape, and I think the average unicorn would find it easier to type with paws than with nose.

Simple to test, though - is it easier to type with fists or with a pen held in your mouth?

(Of course, he'll likely be a slow typist either way. Email or reddit won't notice, but no real-time chatrooms as a wolf)

  a house generally costs 10-15 years salary
#+end_quote

How big a house? Because if he lives alone, he really only needs a teeny tiny one-room place, and I imagine that might only cost eight years' salary...

Or maybe he hasn't paid off his house completely yet. Maybe he's still making regular mortgage payments.

#+begin_quote
  Then /again/, he could be an orphan (gogo tragic backstory?) and have inherited his parents' fully paid off house. More outsider stuff: he had to fend for himself pretty young (say he had a single mother and then when Zach is age 14 she gets a chronic illness - MS or ALS or something - and he spends a lot of his time caring for her, and she dies when he's 18 or 19). Just when everything finally starts getting OK for him again, BAM, he starts transforming into a wolf every few months and he realises that he's never going to be anything approaching normal.
#+end_quote

...okay, yeah, that also fits.

#+begin_quote
  Then again, adopting some big grey dogs would give him good cover.
#+end_quote

Can dogs tell that wolf-him is still him from the scent? If so, they're going to continually assume that other humans also turn into dogs when they're not looking. If not, then once a month they're going to band together to chase away the stranger.

#+begin_quote
  Though the thought of a ranger just casually trapping a /wolf/ is pretty intense.
#+end_quote

I assume that dog pounds have /some/ way to deal with large canines. Possibly involving tranquilliser darts, I'm not sure.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmm. I have a friend who used to be a drug and alcohol abuse counselor at a prison. I might go ask what sort of prison adjacent jobs there are. Zach seems like the sort of person who might be a good parole officer, "person who educates prisoners in life skills", etc. (Actually I think my cousin works educating prisoners.... so yep... Zach is probably involved with prison somehow, and THAT is how Our Heroes have links to the underworld, and probably Fiona could have set him up there).
#+end_quote

Yeah, that could certainly work. (Though, a counsellor who's absent three days a month might be a problem - aren't counsellors supposed to be pretty permanently on emergency call? I don't really know.)
