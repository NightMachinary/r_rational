  (When I call in sick I do it via email, so Zach could probably do that with a suitably modified keyboard/mouse).

...point. He could probably even manage (with some difficulty) with an ordinary keyboard/mouse, as long as one doesn't mind getting emails that klookl kjike thbis. (Which only reinforces the idea that he's feeling at less than a hundred percent).

  His character has always been about being aloof, isolated, and misunderstood so that's where I kind of want to go with him.
#+end_quote

Home-schooled. Self-employed. Lives alone, owns his own house (and has replaced all the taps with paw-friendly ones). Once a month, buys a few days' supply of dried meat or other foods that don't require cooking. The neighbours think he has a dog, but no-one's ever caught more than a glimpse of it (though fur can occasionally be seen on his carpet).

Has a dog collar (with tag) in his closet, to prevent embarrassing incidents like that time he was found (human-shaped and naked) in the dog pound. (He may have charges of beastiality on his record as a result, and if so, he /really/ doesn't want people finding out and so will try to avoid anything that involves a background check - and if anyone does find out, he'll immediately claim that it was all a stupid misunderstanding, but has trouble explaining exactly what he was doing in the dog pound without any clothes).

Hmmm... he could also be a motivational speaker, or any other job that works mostly by appointment. He just has to avoid scheduling appointments at certain times.
