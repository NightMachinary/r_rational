Hmm. If we go into the real nuts and bolts of the world, since everything ultimately runs on atlantean nanites and 4D physics/geometry, werewolves are probably the result of something useful/intentional "going buggy" and resulting in these semi-predictable transformation cycles happening. (Probably the original intent was to allow transformation at-will, I guess).

So the human side would be fully human (except for the nanites, which /somehow/ don't show up on blood tests?), wolf side would likely be a "3D printed wolf body", so would have wolf-ish DNA.

I can't imagine transformation cycles being "activated" for at least 2 or 3 years after birth, so there's time for the wolf body to be created (at the very least, a pup for a 4 year old to transform into - though that would break the "doesn't age" thing, but then again, assuming the nanites are constantly working on the wolf body, you probably have something more like an animorphs-style ageless wolf).

The wolf copy would require the afflicted person to eat enough food to create it, but depending on the lower bound for wolf cycle age (I'd want it to be like 12 or so), getting the raw material to make that wouldn't be too bad. Though if that wolf was put in a very accurate calorie measuring room it might give bad results - but people would assume a poorly sealed room or something before they'd assume that the human was able to spirit away mass by eating it.
