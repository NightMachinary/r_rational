Uhm, well, you have the powers of a wolf, plus intelligence. Uber Canine unit is the obvious application of that. If there is no masquerade, I would expect this to be the standard career path - Hire a round dozen weres, and their cycles have sufficiently little overlap that a nation of a few million can reliably always have a shifted were on duty. Wolves have even /better/ senses of smell than bloodhounds, so that is worth the investment in tracking down explosives, people and drugs. Off-cycle, well, you are being paid anyway, so congratulations, have a job as a regular police officer.

With a masquerade, oh boy are we looking at a challenge now. You cannot keep a regular job. Employers will not be happy with that cycle of unavailability with no plausible reason. You cant even call in sick! So, self-employment is the only game in town. If you want your condition to be an asset, bountyhunter and a co-conspirator is the best bet. Or less legally, tracking down drug operations and robbing them blind.
