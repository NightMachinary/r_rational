One of my werewolves /does/ have a regular job, but he's got a government job with a lot of days off and he's very lucky that his cycle of werewolf changing is very predictable. It also is very hard on him because he works in a prison and the prisoners don't like people who fuck with routine, and the guards /really/ don't like people who don't dress conservatively and who they consider unreliable.

I don't know about everyone else but when I am sick and need to take work off, I send my employer an email. I could see a werewolf being prepared for this with some sort of thing they can wear on their snout/foot to give them a stylus-sized protuberance for pressing keyboard or phone buttons, and a couple of email templates ("Dear $NAME, unfortunately I am unwell and won't be at work today, from $NAME" is literally what every sickness email I send ever says...)
