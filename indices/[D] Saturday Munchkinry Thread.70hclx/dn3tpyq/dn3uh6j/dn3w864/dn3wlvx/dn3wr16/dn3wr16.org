Funny you mention it - there's a few other things that make My Werewolves unique. They do actually have a religion/cult built on top of it in the Western world (really: a group of nuns).

Why the religion/cult values secrecy over perhaps getting worldwide legitimacy/help for its members is perhaps a bit much to swallow (unless they tried it before and it went badly, or they're scared of vampires or something).

I'll have to think about it. I could make them an order of magnitude rarer (3 in 1,000,000), but I don't think that would really fix the problem.
