Nobody's posted yet? I'll put something down!

Let's make the weakest version of werewolves I can*, and see how people can munchkin it:

- The "werewolf" part is just turning into a big wolf. You're not the size of a bear or anything and you don't have like impressive gnashing fangs or healing or anything.

- One advantage of being a wolf: your wolf body is perfectly healthy so e.g. if you're wheelchair bound your wolf body can walk, if you've got dementia your wolf body is lucid. (I am /not sure/ what this would mean for a human with OCD, schizophrenia, Deafness or autism, especially since with the latter two many people with these conditions don't consider them to be a lacking but just part of normal human variation and fiercely object to attempts to treat them)

- You can't control it and it is not related to the moon, though you change every 3-6 weeks

- You're a wolf for 3-5 days, not just at night

- You can predict it somewhat because it happens on a somewhat predictable cycle, usually you can predict the day you transform but you can't get it down to the hour or anything (so you can't use the power to be The Best Magician by timing your transformation)

- You can't talk or have psychic powers when you're in wolf form or anything, you are just a wolf with a human mind (but you could easily communicate with an alphabet mat or similar)

- When you're a human you have slightly improved sense of taste/smell and you can identify other werewolves by their smell (this only happens after you know you're a werewolf and thus know that "weird smell A" is "werewolf smell")

- Werewolfness is genetic and activated randomly during your life (as in, one day without warning you'll start going through the regular werewolf cycle of changes - though in some cases the regular transformations stop only to start again), though you can force a genetic werewolf to start changing every few weeks by biting them

- Werewolfness doesn't really run in families because it's super rare: rate is about 3 in 100,000

- Standard urban fantasy setting (Present Day and the world looks normal but there are secretly vampires, centaurs, etc all around the place)

^{* this may or may not be more or less how My Werewolves work}
