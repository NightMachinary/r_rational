The obligatory Ranma 1/2 question:

What happens with the foetus during the transformation? Will the prospective mother have a human foetus in her wolf womb, and vice versa? Will the transformation pause, i.e. you remain whatever you're pregnant with until birth? Will your body abort every pregnancy as soon as you transform?

As a follow up, if there are anti-transformation methods like the supposed pregnancy in wolf worm, does your sentience degrade (meaning, mind is a plaything of the body the longer time they differ)? Are there anti-transformation methods, and which direction do they work?

Hm... all my questions are world building rather than munchkining...
