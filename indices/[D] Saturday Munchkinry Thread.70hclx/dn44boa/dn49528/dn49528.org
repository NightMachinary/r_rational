The best powers are of course, the powers that let you choose powers.

So number #1 Power:

- Wish: wish for all powers
- Power of Your Choice: choose Wish

If you can't have above:

- Rewind Time
- Single-Save-Point Rewind
- Redo Past Minute

The reason is because these powers will allow you to choose whichever powers you desire. Because you have the ability to rewind time, you can simply roll for powers, and if you don't like the results, rewind time back and reroll.

Possible substitutes for one of the above:

- Second Chances: If this let's you reroll.
- Curse with Unluckiness: If this lets you make an enemy, curse them with unluckniess, then roll for the rest of your powers. Since they are your enemy, it would be very unlucky for them if you get the powers you want, so this would give you the powers you want.

After that, you want to have the powers that are actually useful for your goals. Again, number #1 Power:

- Wish: wish for your goal to be fulfilled
- Power of Your Choice: choose Wish

Honestly Wish is just broken, along with all powers that would help you choose Wish.
