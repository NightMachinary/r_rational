The next tier of powers are defensive ones. After all, having powers doesn't mean anything if you're too dead/incapacitated to use them.

Among the remaining powers, the most powerful one seems to be:

- Invulnerability: of course. Invulnerable = not vulnerable. You can't be hurt in any way whatsoever. No surprise attacks, no starvation, even if you get sucked into a black hole or the universe runs out of energy you're still okay.

Next are the powers that give partial invulnerability:

- Immortality: A step down from invulnerability. You can't die, but you can still be incapacitated. You could put into eternal sleep, or tortured so badly that you can't think and can't use your powers, or succumb to diseases that rob you of all your mental/physical functions, while your power still keeps you technically alive.

- Swift Justice: This is actually an extremely powerful defensive ability, because it makes you immune to all intentional harm. If anyone so much as tries to hurt you, they are met with swift justice for "attempted (crime)" or "conspiracy to (crime)", which should incapacitate them before you are even harmed. This won't save you from unintended harm though. Manslaughter might arrest the people responsible, but only after you're already hurt. It also won't do anything against non-living sources of harm, like natural disasters and disease and the heat death of the universe.

Then the powers that aren't very good, but still somewhat ok for defense:

- Freeze Time Everywhere / Self Intangibility / Barrier Sphere: As long as these powers are active, you can't be hurt by other people/objects since they are all frozen / intangible / blocked by the barrier. The problem is, you can probably still starve to death, so you need to deactivate now and then, leaving you vulnerable during these times.
- Advance Warning / See Possible Futures: Let's you detect danger so you can avoid them. Doesn't help if those dangers are unavoidable though, which many of them will be. Also very restrictive since you would constantly be forced to take actions to avoid danger.
- Blameshifting: A much, much weaker version of Swift Justice, makes anyone that wants to harm you choose to harm someone else instead. The problem is, you could still get hit by collateral damage.
- Possess Body: Somewhat like Blameshifting, but you need to choose people carefully since they may have their own enemies.

And then, because it would be incredibly boring to be the only one left alive when the universe ends, you need a power to combat the heat death of the universe. (Or *Power Sharing* to keep other people alive.) Ideally, you want a power that generates as much energy as possible, so pick one of the following:

- Conjure any existing item: Conjure mass fast.
- Nearby-item replication: Replicate mass fast.
- Transmute Elements: Transmute nuclear waste back into uranium/plutonium, allowing you to reuse them in nuclear power plants. You may need some of the above defensive abilities to handle nuclear waste though.
- Chain Lightning: Directly create electricity. This is better than Lightning strike, which wouldn't work if you aren't on Earth (or within some atmosphere.)
- Element Bending / Telekinesis: This should allow you to spin turbines for energy.
