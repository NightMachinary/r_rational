Request for clarification:

- I can have up to three concurrent save points running, or can make up to three over the course of my lifetime?
- I remember the abandoned timeline?
- Is my body reset, or will I accumulate exhaustion? (In other words, will repeating the same day multiple times lead to sleep deprivation, or will exhaustion start with the level I was at at the time of the safe point?

With hindsight of my current me, I'd have set a safe point at the beginning of every class, at every morning, and once a week during my school life, probably, and I'd repeat lessons I don't get the first time around, but in general have every lesson at least twice.

Easy methods to get money would be the obligatory mention of the Randi Price, if you want to incur the downsides of your powers becoming public knowledge (of sorts).

Harder methods would be all the time travel munchkinry already known, like cracking arbitrarily large prime factorisation and such.
