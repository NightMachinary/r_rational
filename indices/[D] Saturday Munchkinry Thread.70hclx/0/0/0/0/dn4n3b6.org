I don't think swift justice would make you immune to all intentional harm, just from illegal harm. If the government decides to come after you, or declares you a wanted criminal, or you leave its jurisdiction and are in the territory of a different government with different laws or no government at all, then attacking you would no longer be illegal. These are all unlikely to occur if you're just being an ordinary citizen, but if you're a dude with super powers and people know about it then they become more likely.
