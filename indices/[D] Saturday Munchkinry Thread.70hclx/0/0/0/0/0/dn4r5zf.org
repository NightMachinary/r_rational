  I don't think swift justice would make you immune to all intentional harm, just from illegal harm.

I guess the question here is, what is the "justice" in "swift justice" referring to? Some moral concept of justice? Or a country's specific laws? Both of these are actually really exploitable.

If it is some moral concept of justice, then it would make you immune to all intentional harm. If it's a country specific justice... what happens if the country passes new laws? If you could somehow bribe the government officials into passing arbitrary laws, then "Swift Justice" would become really powerful really fast.
