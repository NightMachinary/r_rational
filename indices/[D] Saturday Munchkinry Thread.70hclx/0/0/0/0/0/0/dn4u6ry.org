In the case where it's some moral concept, and we assume it's some fixed set of values that most people consider reasonable, I wouldn't call that "exploitable" because it's just powerful and you don't really need to do anything to cause it to be powerful. I think it would still have some limitations; if it considers self-defense to be justifiable then people who you attack first would be able to attack you back. Or if you commit a crime it might allow violence in order to bring you to justice (would it trigger against you yourself in order to accomplish swift justice if you do something wrong?) It'd still be powerful assuming you aren't evil.

The legal one would be exploitable as you describe.
