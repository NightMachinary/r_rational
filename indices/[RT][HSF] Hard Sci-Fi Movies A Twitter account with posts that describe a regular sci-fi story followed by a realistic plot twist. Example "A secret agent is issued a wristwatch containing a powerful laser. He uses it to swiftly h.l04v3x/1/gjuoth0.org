I don't understand the dislike of the political ones. There's some genuinely great savage humor in there. (Well, I guess I can understand it from certain angles, such as "I don't like thinking about this because my primary coping mechanism is avoidance, not humor". It's just that my primary coping mechanism is in fact humor.)

If anything, it's the most anodyne/least-referential ones that fall flat for me. The Tour de France joke is great because of what it skewers and because of the context of the joke, and the kumquats one is great because of the broader (political!) context of Christian naturalism and opposition to GMOs; the "dead are returning to life" one isn't particularly funny because there's no /there/ there, the bomb defuse decoding one isn't particularly funny because rivet counting isn't all that funny.

(That said, the message encoded in pi one is my absolute favorite in part because it's the kind of joke I save up for when my daughter is old enough to appreciate it, and by appreciate I mean hate me for it.)
