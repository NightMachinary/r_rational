Apart from the aforementioned [[https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/n5xT2RJy2fWxCA3eH/politics-and-awful-art]["Politics and Awful Art"]], where political jokes are held to a lower standard than non-political jokes, there's also the problem that you will only like the political tweets if you happen to agree with the author's politics. If you support Donald Trump and George Zimmerman, you won't find "A con-artist uses reality television and the intelligence apparatus of a foreign autocracy to win the Presidency of the United States" or "In a violent America, select individuals may pursue, judge and execute people on the spot. They are known as Neighborhood Watch Coordinators" very funny. Whereas everyone on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] can agree that "When a test pilot crashes his plane, scientists decide to rebuild him. They have the technology. Their efforts allow an open-casket funeral" and "A wealthy playboy scientist invents a powerful robotic suit for the military. The suit proves invaluable in quickly unloading cargo" are hilarious regardless of their opinions on /The Six Million Dollar Man/ and /Iron Man/.
