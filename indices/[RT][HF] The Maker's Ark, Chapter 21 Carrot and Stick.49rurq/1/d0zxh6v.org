I'm enjoying just as much as the earlier works. I don't fully understand the Lizard rules, although I'm not sure if I'm supposed to. Still, it's interesting to see a society get rebuilt by force majeur. As to why Black Swan wasn't monitoring -- she was focused on something else? It's been too long since I read earlier chapters. so I'm not not sure what that might be. Alternatively, maybe DASI shielded the room because she didn't want Black Swan messing things up.
