  By destroying some of their memories before exiting the brain, or

  By creeping into their head as they slept, then staying dormant, not taking any actions, only observing.

My intent as author is that the first would be very difficult---a Yeerk piloting the brain is like a human operating a Mac or driving a car; some operations are very easy and others extremely difficult. It's much easier for a Yeerk to simply physically injure someone than to remove a specific memory. I'd expect removing a specific memory to be near-impossible (or like the sort of skill that Phillipe Petit has; a Yeerk could plausibly spend many many years perfecting the skill in a single brain, or something).

I believe the second would be hard because there's pain and damage when a Yeerk crawls in, but let's say the person was drugged or blackout drunk---then yeah, I think the combination of their ability to soothe away the pain signals without the person ever knowing that they /should/ be in pain, plus just lurking quietly in the brain, ought to do it.

I also think it's possible to have something like a very small shard of Yeerk in your head, that will trigger a simple action given a simple stimulus, but is otherwise essentially undetectable (except by something like cancer-sniffing dog).
