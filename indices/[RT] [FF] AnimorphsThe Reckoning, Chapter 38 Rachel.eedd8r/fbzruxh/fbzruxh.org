Minor suggestion here (and I feel bad making a nitpick when I've never found the time to sit down and express my effusive praise for the story), but this part:

"And so I'd followed Dr. Koskinen into another room and laid my hands on a strange girl's arm, acquiring her. Then I'd dressed myself in clothes from the lost and found and followed him down to his car."

jars the attentive reader because it sounds like she gets dressed and gets in the car, where she's in morph, immediately following the acquisition - without waiting hours for the technology to make its first analysis. You do seem to have taken this into account when you give a five-hour timeframe later, but in the moment it seems like a continuity error.
