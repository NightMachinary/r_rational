All right, Rachel seems to have segfaulted into the Crayak/Ellimist database. That last scene...I'm not sure what exactly it means, but those definitely aren't Rachel's memories, Rachel had no idea that Ax is Helium now.

Note that she hears Marco speak in ten voices, and there's a bunch of morph clones of him running around. Also note that Cassie is in that scene, and if dead Rachel is still in the cloud to be downloaded, it implies that Cassie is, too. It might be that she stumbled into the area where /everyone's/ memories are being stored. Certainly seems to have done a number on her, either way.
