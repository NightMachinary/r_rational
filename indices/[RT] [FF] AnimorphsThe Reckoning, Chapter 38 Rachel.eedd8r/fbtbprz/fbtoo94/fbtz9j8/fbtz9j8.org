  In my head, Marco rolled his eyes, his expression a mixture of exasperation and pity.

Girl, you have some serious self-esteem issues.

  I frowned. It was hard to be sure, but the outlets looked different---weren't the usual two-lines-and-a-half-moon-face that I was used to. Each spot was its own circular depression, with two tiny round holes spaced about an inch apart, and there was a large, old-fashioned switch at the end---

For those wondering, [[https://static.fnac-static.com/multimedia/Images/8A/8A/63/7B/8086410-1505-1540-1/tsp20180425104612/Multiprise-electrique-6-prises-1-50m-blanche.jpg#c2d90e88-7b68-4392-9734-645d8bfbfaf5][this]] is likely what Rachel is staring at.

The description lacks a mention of the ground connector, though (the small metal stick on each socket).

  I'd read somewhere that chess grandmasters are more likely to lose to a total novice than to, like, a chess blue belt, because the novices violate rules and expectations that are so fundamental and basic that the grandmasters have no way to anticipate them, no experience coping with them.

I get the simile Rachel is making, but that's not actually true.

Novices in chess make very similar mistakes, that are very easy to capitalize on (eg they get their queen out too early, and put it in a position where it can easily be taken), and they are very bad at capitalizing on any mistake a grandmaster might make.

Also, chess is a game where the first ~10 few moves are extremely important and essentially determine how the rest of the game will go; a novice player will either do mostly random moves (eg getting the knights out before the pawns, moving non-central pawns first) or mirror their opponents moves, while the grandmaster will be building a strong position that will give them a lot of offensive possibilities.

  But there was also the way that she seemed to have caught feelings for Marco

Don't you dare question that ship, past!Rachel! Why, future!Rachel knew what she was doing and her relationship with Marco was totally valid and not unhealthy at all!

  “So there you go,” he said bitterly. “Two months and four hundred sixty-one Euros. How much you want to bet the plans aren't even real?”

Oh, so it's a future distant enough that NASA has put seismic sensors on the moon, but the Euro hasn't collapsed yet? That miiiight age poorly.

(kidding; I'm not saying the Euro is doomed to collapse next financial crisis; but it's a possibility)
