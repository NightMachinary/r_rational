Wait, 2023 as in the future? I'm confused. Apart from general "I feel like I would have noticed that by now", I have a memory of Marco giving the price of Bitcoin at a time that was past when that chapter was published. And I don't think several years have passed in-universe. Am I misremembering?

  “There was this guest speaker from America---she was meeting with some bigwig in Estonia and came up for the day as a personal favor to Mr. Sotala.  She had these mental techniques, little step-by-step algorithms to help you think through your plans, figure out what you really want and how best to get it, avoid pitfalls, stuff like that.  It was funny---she kept calling the pitfalls ‘failure modes.'  We had to translate for the little ones.”
