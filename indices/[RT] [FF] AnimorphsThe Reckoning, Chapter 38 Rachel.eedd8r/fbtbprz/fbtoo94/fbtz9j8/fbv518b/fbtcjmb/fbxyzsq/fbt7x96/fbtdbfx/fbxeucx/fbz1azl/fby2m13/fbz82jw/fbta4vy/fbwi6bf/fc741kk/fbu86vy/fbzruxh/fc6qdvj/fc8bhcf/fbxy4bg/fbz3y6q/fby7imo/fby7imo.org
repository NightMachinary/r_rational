Rachel getting visions like that is weird, and we don't know why that's happening but it's safe to assume that it's related to Rachel's general weirdness. She wasn't part of the Ellimist's prophecy, she isn't seen as a namable person by the Chee, etc.

Memory injection happening during demorph has happened before, every timestop/Ellimist interaction has been through that. The morphing tech moves the mind from meat to some sort of Z-space emulator (and puts the body in stasis) and unmorphing involves moving that mindstate back into the meat brain.
