Only getting to read these a couple days after they've been posted leaves me without much to say except "It was gud!"

But I do love the lament of the self-aware NPC. And I liked how you've captured Rachel's ability to explain her revelations, like the difference between saving Ante and giving him a life. It's a lot deeper tie to the spirit of canon than just the plot premise, and in this case, an improvement over when they'd meet some random kid in Alaska or Australia or whatever.
