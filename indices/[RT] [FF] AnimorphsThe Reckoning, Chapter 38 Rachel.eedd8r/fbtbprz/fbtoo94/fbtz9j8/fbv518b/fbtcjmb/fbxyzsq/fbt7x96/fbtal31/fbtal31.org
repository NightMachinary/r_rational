I'm curious to see whether that type of intra-Z-plane combat is feasible. The concept of direction and distance seems alien to the Z-plane, as there are numerous simultaneous Z-plane users that never seem to have spacial overlap problems. The Z-space virus at least seems to have formalized a rule that you dont hit your targets in Z-space itself, you destabilize the targets that link to Z-space, using Z-space as a vector. That, at least, sticks to Z-space as a dimensionless void, not a place where you can directly physically find and whack people.
