Oh, huh. It's chapter [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/22292552][25/33]], and yeah, Marco doesn't actually give a date at all. I think when that chapter came out I must have compared to the real-world price at the time that I read it. (My memory is that the price was higher in-story, and I interpreted that as being pushed up by everything that had happened.)
