In the source material I believe that there was some incident where two objects in z-space interacted... [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(novel)][here it is]].

  Just as the Animorphs volunteer for the mission, Marco disappears, causing a panic among Ax, Jake, and Cassie. After explaining their problem to the Andalites, the Andalite scientists theorize that the Animorphs' unexplained disappearances are the result of a "snapback" effect, meaning that when the Animorphs disappear, they are reappearing either on Earth or in Z-Space, the latter possibility causing fear among Ax, Jake, and Cassie.
