Well, now that I've finally finished it, for what it's worth /I/ think this chapter definitely had a reason to be as long as it did, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

One of the reasons I find getting back into this story a little confusing at the start of each chapter is that it's not just a long time between events and characters PoVs, but also because of times like this, when the character isn't actually in the right "timeline" as the rest of the story. This was handled well, however, and I love how the glimpses into alternate-future-Rachel and the effect that had on current-Rachel allowed you to bring up the concept of the Sculptor, and I think you executed on that wonderfully.

Also I'm glad you found a way to not show the animal actually die, and this made me look up what the material might actually have been, and I'm not sure if this is the one you pictured the teacher using but apparently a material that can withstand thermite has the badass name of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlite][starlite]], which allows for something called a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtm_xOtw_r0][starlite crucible]] to actually be a real thing.
