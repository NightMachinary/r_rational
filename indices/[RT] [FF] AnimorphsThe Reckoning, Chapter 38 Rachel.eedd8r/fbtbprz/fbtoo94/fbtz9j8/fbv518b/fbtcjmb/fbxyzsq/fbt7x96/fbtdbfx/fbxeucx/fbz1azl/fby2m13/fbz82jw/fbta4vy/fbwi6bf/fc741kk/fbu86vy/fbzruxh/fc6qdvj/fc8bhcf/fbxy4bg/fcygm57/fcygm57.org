With all the other subtle nods to canon (Marco cutting off Helium as he tries to explain Hork-Bajir linguistics a couple chapters ago <3), there's one I've been looking out for: Rachel makes a critical choice that could sway the E/C game. Throughout the later books in canon, Rachel has a standing offer from Crayak: Immortality, awesome power, and eternity as Crayak's right-hand girl, and all she has to do is kill Jake. Given that the game is supposed to be about setting up situations where important events hinge on the kids' choices, and that if she hadn't talked Ante back from the brink the cube would likely be lost (no one to translate Finnish for Garret-morph at the bank), I wonder if the whole "which kind of person do I want to be?" sequence was meant to be a parallel to that?
