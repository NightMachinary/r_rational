A slower, more laid back chapter! I like that we get some perspective on what the rest of the world has been doing in response to all the chaos.

  The Yeerk pool, Tidwell and Illim--- ....

  That was all I could remember.
#+end_quote

One of the most unique things about this fic is how the characters periodically get reset to previous versions, completely undoing the character development that happened since. I'm not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, this means there are real, permanent consequences when things go wrong. On the other hand, it's frustrating as a reader having things constantly undone. In this chapter there's a nice balance because Rachel is getting memories from her other self, and is able to see the path that she would have walked down and deliberately steer herself in a different direction. I've never seen that kind of dynamic explored in fiction before in quite this way, and it's really cool, but still frustrating.

The way Rachel is getting these memories doesn't quite make sense to me. I get that when she demorphs, there's something about the residual yeerk tissue still in her brain that is transferring information as it slowly dies. But why is she getting her own memories? I assume that you get the memories of the person who morphed into you and stayed past the time limit. But this version of Rachel came from a cancer patient morphing her, right? Why wouldn't she get the cancer patient's memories? I guess there's just some information leak from other versions of herself in the morphing tech's storage system, somehow. (So then couldn't she get the memories of any morpher from any time and place?)

  There's exactly one review of this story on Goodreads that's longer than a sentence! It comes from user Mark and features many memorable sentences like "the author uses this as a vehicle to mine others' notstalgia for their own self-indulgence and misses what made the originals so appealing" and "themes of loss, dehumanization, and the morality of war aren't really carried over" and "the other changes are just fine, I guess, but don't really serve any purpose in my opinion...at best, they make the main characters somewhat one-dimensional"

Well, I strongly disagree with this reviewer, of course. I suppose people who aren't familiar with rationalist tropes tend to have these sorts of problems with rational fics, but I think the worldbuilding here is genius and awesome. I do think that this fic /feels/ very different from the originals. When I started reading this, I went back and reread some of the original Animorphs books, and I could barely get through them because the characters were so immature and anti-rationalist by comparison. The major themes of loss, dehumanization, and the morality of war /do/ carry over, I think, but in an incredibly weird and unique way that only a rationalist fanfiction of the already weird Animorphs could possibly have done. Everything about mind sharing / voluntary controllers / character resets / character cloning makes complete sense in-universe and is also completely unique in fiction (to this extent), as far as I'm aware.

  Nothing.  There was nothing I could do.  I couldn't change it, I couldn't fix it, I had no idea what to do next.  I was alone, and weak, and I had no morphs and no information---

  /Then LET IT GO./

  I took another deep breath.

  /Just let it go./

/Let it goooooo, let it GOOOOOOO, turn away and slam the dooooor, I don't care what they're going to say, let the stooorm raaage on, the cold never bothered me anywaaaaay/

  “Rachel---will you be going to school with Ante?”
#+end_quote

Can't believe she's going back after what happened last time she went to school, but oh well, I guess the risk is much lower this time.

  “‘Act now,'” the anchor repeated.  “‘Act now.  If all has gone according to plan, Telor's sacrifice has bought humanity temporary military supremacy within this system.  In addition to the destruction of the mothership and three of its remaining Bug fighters, we estimate an eighty-five percent chance that Visser Three himself has been rendered temporarily ineffective, and a fifteen percent chance that he has been eliminated outright.
#+end_quote

Nice - the Animorphs aren't the only "main characters" at play in this war. Though I wouldn't bet on Visser 3 being made ineffective.

  The cube can transfer the morphing power to five individuals every thirteen seconds!  Twenty people a minute, a thousand people an hour, a hundred and fifty thousand per week!  You could have given every soldier in Finland this power, in the months you've kept it to yourself!”

  “We've kept it safe from the /Yeerks,”/ I snarled
#+end_quote

I mean, he's not wrong - they could recruit so many more people than what they've done. They really should step up their mass-recruiting game again - not to a thousand people per hour, for security reasons, but still, a new auxiliary Animorphs team every few days would be nice, like what they were doing before the TPK.

  /The walls seemed to shimmer, to flex---changing colors, changing shape, one moment flat unpolished metal, the next smooth beige plastic.  There were lights, shifting and flickering---beeps and clicks, radio voices---a viewscreen like the one on the starship Enterprise, showing---/ ....

  /‹Yes, or no,› thundered the voice of the Visser, from where he stood, surrounded by Marines all pointing their guns at him---no, he was on the viewscreen---both?/
#+end_quote

Okay, wow, what on /earth/ is this vision, because it's definitely not something that happened [yet]. A flash forward? A memory from an alternate timeline? Visser One mentioned time travel previously, so I'm guessing this has something to do with time travel and with the divergence point between the Reckoning universe and the original. But beyond that I have /no clue/ where this plot is going.
