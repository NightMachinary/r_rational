Since I went back to check Elfangor's wording, I noticed something - he credits the speed of subsequent acquisitions to the shared ancestry of life on Earth, which implies alien species would not be so quick to process. It seems a fair-enough theory to assume having acquired anything provides some partial speed advantage, which makes it plausible Jake was able to morph his dog quickly enough for a shower to be a natural cover and not a 13 year old running the house at midnight. It does seem to still be an issue with the Marcos in the monster mash, where they swap to their first native morph with such speed and urgency the Marco already demorphed and available to cover them gets left behind to watch himself die. Hahah, sorry to treat the story like some kind of adversarial puzzle! I'm just kind of obsessed with it... I'll find the time someday to write some paragraphs about why
