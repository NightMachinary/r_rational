fantastic chapter, thanks for writing!

I'm not totally sure but I think that last bit is Rachel finally getting really fucked up from the seizures?

No idea about that last flashback either but since Cassie is there, I think it might have to do with the alternate universes thing hinted at in the last chapter. There was also a flashback in the middle I didn't recognize at all (and found nothing when searching for it), the one about cutting off her arm.
