No joke, though.

Just like "parkour" is a new thing because it combines ancient elements in a particular, specific way, but all of the pieces of parkour have existed forever ...

... so too is "goal factoring" not reeeeaaaalllly a discovery or an invention, as much as it's just a crystallization or a recombination. But the true Platonic ideal that lies /underneath/ goal factoring is /hella/ a guerilla warfare skill.
