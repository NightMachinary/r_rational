Well, fuck. Telor sacrificed themself. Wow.

I was /not/ expecting that. At least part of them is preserved through Terra, but still. Wow.

And WTF is up with Rachel. Just like, WTF. Immune to prophecy, weird with the Chee, and somehow getting memories from both the past of this timeline and apparently some sort of alternate timeline... Is that a scene from canon?

I'd like to point out that Rachel shouldn't know that she'd "never see Cassie again" since she doesn't know that all the cassie morph-holders died, but considering how much she seems to know things she shouldn't like Ax->Helium that might actually be intentional.
