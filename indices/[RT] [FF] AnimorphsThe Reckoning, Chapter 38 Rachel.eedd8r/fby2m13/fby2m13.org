I can't remember if it was a megamorphs or the choose your own adventure one but I recall Cassie having visions like that last one in one of the 'extra' books because the timeline had changed and she 'grounded the timeline' or something. I speculate that Rachel may have something similar going on here, adding that last vision to the bit about being the extra animorph invisible to ellimicrayak.
