My guess at translating Rachel's mid-stroke thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  Try but numb hand up bump cube at least, more face word Ante, Garrett, head spin floor burning blur blur blur gaussian?
#+end_quote

"Try to demorph the hand that's holding the cube first. Ugh, why is my face demorphing first? I see Ante and Garrett. If I'm gonna die I need to at least get the cube out of this morph."

#+begin_quote
  calm
#+end_quote

"Okay, I think I did it."

#+begin_quote
  CALM? CALM?
#+end_quote

"OKAY?? I'm still dying!"

#+begin_quote
  Mouth. Face. Hand. Eyes. Verb? Hurts---
#+end_quote

"Demorphing these parts. Ow."

#+begin_quote
  Ante “okay, g̴̠̈r̶̲̊â̵͜b̵͜͠ ̴̺̚h̵̰͠é̷ͅr̸̦̀---” Garrett touch wait cube cube cube
#+end_quote

"Garrett's reaching for me. /Gotta demorph that cube./

#+begin_quote
  “Got it r̴͇̽a̵̖̤͛̄̚c̷̘͍̥͒̾̓h̷̼͈͝e̷̡͙̅l̶̨̺̼̋͒̌”
#+end_quote

"Got it, Rachel."

#+begin_quote
  Spinning black no
#+end_quote

Sleepy time.

That's probably the most optimistic interpretation possible; it means Garrett's alive and they have the cube. In the context of what the avatar said, "The whole point is for you to be put in situations where your decisions are philosophically relevant...", it's interesting that this vision involves V3 offering the kids some kind of choice, with the boys all agreeing and Cassie trying to stop them.
