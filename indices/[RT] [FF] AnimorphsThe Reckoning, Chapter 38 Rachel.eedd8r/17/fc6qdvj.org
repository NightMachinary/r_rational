Here's my guess: Telor didn't really destroy the ship, Esplin did. I really wanted to think that maybe V1 was coerced into giving up those codes she was talking about last chapter, but if that was the case why wouldn't the Animorphs take credit for it? That would be a major moral boost and Marco would know humanity would need it.

Also is Rachel all the way stroked out or can she recover? Don't do Rachel like that man, that's fucked up.
