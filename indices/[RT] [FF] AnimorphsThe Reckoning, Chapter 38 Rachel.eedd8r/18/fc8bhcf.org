  In another, somebody had taken five or six snapshots out of a crossfade between Marco and a charging bull, and edited them together into a crude representation of morphing.

When this fic decides to be snarky at canon, boy it does not hold back. I really think that's what's missed the most if you haven't read the source material -- all those moments where r!Animorphs is just completely vicious about something that was, tbh, kind stupid in the original. Visser 3's Disney-andalite reveal was another moment like that, that stood out for how pointed it was. I really like those moments, but they're also slightly jarring.

Other things I appreciate in this fic: the text is fully inside the perspective of the protagonist. I really think this is something that divides the okay fiction from the great fiction, and I think this fic does it excellently. The positioning of the flashbacks to match demorphing and the end sequence where you're inside the perspective of her stroke really drive it home, this chapter. It might sound like a simple, entry-level thing, but I think it's harder than it looks, and a lot of fiction, even serious published paper fiction, will slip into author perspective at times. It also centres character thought processes, which is something I enjoy in rationalfic.
