Here's a fun thought: could a Yeerk infest someone without their knowing it?

Either

1. By destroying some of their memories before exiting the brain, or

2. By creeping into their head as they slept, then staying dormant, not taking any actions, only observing.

Of course, 2 would likely be comparable to paralysis. Humans don't have the willpower for it. But Yeerks might, particularly if specialized for such a role when created by their source pool.

Given the seizure, it's clear something is wrong with Rachel. This is probably an overambitious guess, but I wonder if this is not a true Rachel, but a Rachel constructed from interactions other Animorphs have had in their heads with her. That would explain the regular intrusion of imagined voices onto her inner monologue - particularly Marco. Perhaps the Ellimist is unable to model her in any other way, and he is responsible for this? Typically he would massage the resurrected backups to work better than they ought to, but for Rachel he cannot?

We really need an explanation for why the Chee can't see Rachel properly. And that has to involve either time travel, the Ellimist or Crayak meddling, or something beyond even those two. The last is my favorite. Some intrinsic weakness in the simulation process they use, that is then propagated to Chee-tech based on theirs? A choice of one participant to hide their own actions from their future self?

  Contempt, or compassion. Disdain, or admiration. I could feel the choice inside of me, the two potential paths, two blueprints of two very different Rachels, one impatient and cynical, the other empathetic and forgiving. I could be the sort of person who looked at Ante and saw only his naïveté, his insufficiency, his overall meaninglessness in the grand scheme of things---

  Or I could see the other thing.

  Porque no los dos?

  No. I wasn't strong enough.

Good job anticipating my objection, TK.

  And then I realized that I was thinking---that I was thinking, the now-Rachel, the Rachel who was demorphing, who was right now in the middle of a seizure-vision, I'd never come awake during one before---

Does Z-space exist outside normal spacetime? We could get some [[https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1936-borges-ahistoryofeternity.pdf][Borges]] situations going here.

No idea about the last scene's meaning. Maybe something to do with how Visser exists across z-space now? Some kind of Ms. Frizzle shenanigans where the Animorphs go the the Elemental Plane of Z to battle him in his own domain?
