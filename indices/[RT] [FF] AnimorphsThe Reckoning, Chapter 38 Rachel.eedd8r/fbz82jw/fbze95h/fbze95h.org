  I wonder if Seerow ever even considered the resurrection/cloning use case.

This is personal headcanon, even though I'm the author (fic deliberately left open to alternate interpretations here), but imo he absolutely did not consider it, in part because of time pressure, and in part because his thoughts were still deeply influenced by the Andalite conception of the Path, making this somewhat unthinkable.
