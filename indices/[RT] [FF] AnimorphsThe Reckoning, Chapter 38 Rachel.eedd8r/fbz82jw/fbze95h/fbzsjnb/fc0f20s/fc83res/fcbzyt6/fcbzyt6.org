Yeah. I don't as-yet imagine we'll see much of Seerow (he's kind of like Grindelwald or Godric in HPMOR; trying to hint that he has a fully fleshed out backstory but not actually likely to put it on screen). But I conceive of him as extremely driven and extremely tunnel-visioned in a way that makes him look a lot like Riddle on the outside.
