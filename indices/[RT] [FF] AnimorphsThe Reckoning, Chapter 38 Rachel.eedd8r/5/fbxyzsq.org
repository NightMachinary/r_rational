Another great chapter. This one felt like it's own little movie, kinda Bourne-ish haha. Love that Rachel immediately works the problem upon waking up in an unfamiliar environment.

Curious about the seisure visions. I checked, and it doesn't look like old Rachel died in morph or anything like that, so I don't think it's purely morph tech behaving strangely. Plus the whole future vision at the end kinda rules that out.

Poor opsec on Tobias's part with the whole Koskinen thing, though I'm not sure what else he could have done. Good thing Koskinen underestimated them. I'm curious whether morph clones maintain the ability to blow up the cube.

Sorry the writeup is so brief, I just caught up on the new updates, need time to process. I may have more feedback to feed the beast later.

And finally, wrong chapter but too late for the original thread, the Marco death scene in chapter 37 legitimately made me cry. So good onya TK17
