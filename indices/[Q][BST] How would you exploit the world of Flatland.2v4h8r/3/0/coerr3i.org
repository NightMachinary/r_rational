They never go into detail about that because such talk is "improper" for the satire of Victorian society.

There is something about number of sides your male ancestors have influencing the male children, but whatever equation they use, irregular shapes are formed in scenarios when women from a family of squares marry a male pentagon or with some other number of sides other than four which is why they have classes based on number of sizes to avoid such deformity. Deformations get less common for larger number of sides with a loss in the quantity of sides occurring instead.
