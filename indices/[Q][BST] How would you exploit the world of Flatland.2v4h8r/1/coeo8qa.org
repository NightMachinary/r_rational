Do flatlanders only have one eye apiece?

Any 2d being with two eyes would have depth perception and two points of reference, and thus could clearly make out a line segmaent and the direction she was pointing regardless of the angle just as well as we can make judgments about the directions of sticks and the positioning of walls and other planes...
