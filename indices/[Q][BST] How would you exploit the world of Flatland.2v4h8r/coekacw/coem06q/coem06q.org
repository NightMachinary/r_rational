Depending on how far sphere can see above Flatland, his ability to spot danger, incoming armies, or an errant member of the lower class or women (women are very difficult to see when head on, and very sharp as they are a point). Depending on how easily he can communicate this information, this could mean at minimum a prospering society with no injury that wins every war to at best a society that doesn't have to sequester women because the other shapes are safe from them.

His ability to discern a shape's true identity would mean that paint would no longer be a way of deceiving the upper class, and could be used to promote art in Flatland, as an alternative for war, and would also be a way to make women and other lower, pointier classes more visible, reducing accidents and prolonging lifespan.

Additionally, without the fear of the sharper (lower) shapes hurting a rounder (nobler) shape, thanks to the all seeing eye of the Sphere, research could safely be conducted to see to what extent these shapes (and women) are genuinely of lesser intelligence, of if that was simply a function of less education, social norms, and conditioning. This could revolutionize Flatland and is basically the endgame. Equality for all shapes.

Unfortunately, because sphere would have to give the illusion of growing larger as he aged (I think?), he would need to either start out with very little sight (with his point intersecting above him) or start out as a basically all seeing child genius and grow less and less able to see that which is hidden to Flatlanders as time went on. Because Flatlanders revere circles already, I don't think he'll need to use the 3rd dimensional vision he has to worm his way into power, so he's probably better off waiting to grow into it and then keeping it at medium power the whole time.

TL;DR: Use the third dimension to create a safety stopgap to diminish the danger of interacting with shaper shapes and women, use this opportunity to encourage the arts and research, eventually arrive at a flourishing democratic egalitarian artistic utopia that also wins every battle thanks to 3rd dimensional sight.
