Flatland society is actually pretty horrible --- at the level of advancement where the book is written especially. There'd be lots of things you'd want to /improve/, but I don't know if anything is particularly munchkinable... at least from inside.

The sphere, of course, can enter any locked vault, can be incredibly useful for surveillance using the third dimension, can read people's minds, can mirror the orientation of anything (e.g. make a left shoe a right shoe by rotating it through the third dimension), and can, as far as the Flatland perspective is concerned, change size...

So: have the Sphere become Chief Circle.

Not by hostile takeover or anything---that would be fought against---just have him masquerade as an ordinary person of Circular class.

Preferably from birth, appearing in a delivery room masquerading as a newborn Flatlander so he can have the benefit of a pedigree and so forth and "growing up" from there. By means of his talents (to be kept secret, of course, given their verbotenheit) he can become Chief Circle in time and start overhauling that backward society.

In particular: fund research at the Circular Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium to make the process of enhancing Polygons into Circles safer and cheap enough that even an Isosceles could do it. Introduce that therapy as an alternative to execution for people born irregular (and perhaps eventually destigmatize irregularity altogether). Find ways to improve the condition of women...
