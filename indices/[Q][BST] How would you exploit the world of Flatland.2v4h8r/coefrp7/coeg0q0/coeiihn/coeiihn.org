Hmm... I might ask the sphere to carry people to different levels - with enough space in between levels for the sphere to comfortably fit between. I'd experiment with transplanting different demographics to different areas, and seeing whether more egalitarian social structures emerge once circles aren't in charge anymore.

The thing is, this seems more like being Jimmy Olsen than Superman. It's different to munchkin.
