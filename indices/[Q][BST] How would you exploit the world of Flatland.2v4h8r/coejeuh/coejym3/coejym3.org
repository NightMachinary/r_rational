Flatland goes into this. Basically, it's like a 4 dimensional object would look in our 3 dimensional world: a constantly changing series of cross sections. In the sphere's case, it would be a point widening to ever larger circles and then shrinking to a point again.

But since 2 dimensional beings can only see in 1 dimension, the sphere looks to them like a point widening to a line and then shrinking back to a point.
