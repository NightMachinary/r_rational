  How do they reproduce? Copy-and-paste reflection of the male over the female axis? That would make the offspring a mirror-clone of the father. Or do they add their equations together and then take the derivative?

Each generation has one more side than the last: the son of a Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon is a Hexagon. (This is called "the Law of Nature".) With Isosceles triangles it appears this is not the case, but instead that the exercise of intelligence(!) can widen a triangle's angle and that of its descendants, and the eugenist society tries to breed wider triangle lines together---I believe this is the only point where the angularity of a woman's parents is suggested to have an effect---until they reach equilaterality, at which point Square sons are possible.

With women, there is no visible effect, and indeed no way to tell directly if a woman is "irregular" in an underlying way, so they keep detailed records of whether they or their ancestors have any history of giving birth to Irregular children. If they do, regular Polygons, out of fear of irregularity or relapses in angle size, tend to avoid them. (At the Circular level this is less of a worry in choosing mates, as they already have high status that doesn't need to be augmented by more-sided offspring, and as a result there are fewer viable births, though those that do may have dozens of sides more than their fathers.)

  That might explain why triangles don't reproduce with squares, etc, since the stigma against "deformed" or "irregular" shapes.

More likely because they'd both be male. :=)

  If all the shapes and lines and dots are sentient, then how can anyone own any property? If it rains from the north, is the rain also sentient? Or are line segments and single points only sentient in their own separate universes?

All the sentient beings in Flatland are polygons and lines, but not all such shapes are sentient. They have inanimate objects, they have writing, they build pentagonal houses.

In Lineland I don't believe there are any objects, only people, but that's a separate universe (which may in fact only be a dream).
