The lines are female and the polygons are male, and they can have kids? How do they reproduce? Copy-and-paste reflection of the male over the female axis? That would make the offspring a mirror-clone of the father. Or do they add their equations together and then take the derivative? That might explain why triangles don't reproduce with squares, etc, since the stigma against "deformed" or "irregular" shapes. Also, what do the merchants sell? If all the shapes and lines and dots are sentient, then how can anyone own any property? If it rains from the north, is the rain also sentient? Or are line segments and single points only sentient in their own separate universes?
