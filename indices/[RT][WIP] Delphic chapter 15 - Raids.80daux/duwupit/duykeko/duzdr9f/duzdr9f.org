So, FDR survives through to complete his 4th term, and without having inherited the Presidency and won WW2 Truman loses to Dewey.

I would think in that case that Warren as VP would be more likely to succeed Dewey than Eisenhower. I'd also expect Dewey to get two terms. Truman only served one "extra" term since he was riding out FDR's last term, but a popular President riding on presumably the same wave of massive post war economic growth would be likely to win re-election I think, especially not against an primary challenge from Eisenhower. Did, perhaps, something go very amiss during Dewey's Presidency? If that's the case, likely to be international and probably a Soviet threat if it didn't backlash onto the Republicans like I would expect a domestic scandal to. Perhaps early Soviet supers aiding in militaristic expansion? A Korean War that went quickly and decisively against the Americans?

Notable that JFK serves 3 terms as does Clinton, so the 22nd Amendment doesn't exist. That plus four Kennedy's suggests that Delphic-verse America is much more comfortable with dynastic, long-serving power than is real America. Plus, the absence of Nixon and the presumed lack of a Lewinsky scandal for Clinton suggests that trust in government would be overall much higher than it is presently.

All that makes Delphic's use of reticence to cooperate fully with the government as a screen to hide his powers probably more suspicious to the feds than it would be IRL, which might be what prompts the CIA to send someone after him.

The degree to which the American feds are tip-toeing around the Canadian ones in the Lamarck investigation, though, prompts me to do some egregious theory-crafting and wonder if the Korean War went decisively against the Americans prompting less unilateral action throughout the Cold War and more of a reliance on NATO and other alliances. The failure to reach the moon also signals an inability to attain decisive nuclear strike superiority. America becomes more of a first-among-equals in the 1st world rather than a preeminent superpower. FDR's success in WW2 combined with America having less ability to push liberal democracy as the only alternative to communist dictatorships allows a flourishing, or at least less of a decline in the Great Man theory of history. This, combined with the emergence of superpowers results in an uneasy acceptance of a hierarchical, oligarchic society that remains a democracy on the surface but still very obviously favors the privileged and the powerful.

Kennedy isn't assassinated, which means there isn't as much political will both for the Apollo program, but also the Civil Rights, Voting Rights, and Fair Housing acts. They're eventually passed, but racial lines crystallize as part of the new American hierarchy, hence Hector and Paris' being hyper-sensitive and aware of it, despite IRL Detroit being ~85% black, and also Vill's tacit endorsement of profiling and her sensitivity to drawing attention to racial lines.

Also lends credence to Hector's desire to accumulate mass wealth without specific plans for it, as the issues surrounding wealth inequality and social class in America are likely even worse in the Delphic-verse.
