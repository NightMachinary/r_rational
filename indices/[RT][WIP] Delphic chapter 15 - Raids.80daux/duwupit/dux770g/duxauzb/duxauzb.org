For me, personally, I think that's a perfect level of author feedback - pointing out the textual answer to a question without suggesting anything that it might point to.

One of the things that occasionally grinds at me in rational fiction is the frequency with which "puzzles" are embedded that require details from far back in the story to make sense of. That kinda, maybe, sorta works in fully published works of fiction where you might consume them over a period of days or weeks, but in serials where the relevant info might have been dropped months or years ago it creates something of a barrier to entry for fully appreciating the work.

I definitely understand the desire not to raise the reader's alert by foreshadowing something both early in the work and then again five minutes before it happens, a la "Previously On..." segments that open up TV shows, but appreciate not having to skim through everything published up until this point to answer a question.

Thanks!
