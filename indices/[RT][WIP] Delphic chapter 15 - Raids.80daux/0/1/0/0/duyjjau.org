I agree with you on dropping clues months ago. Particularly with respect to world-building stuff like this, my plan is certainly to restate important points or hidden assumptions if (when?) it becomes relevant to the plot.

If it ever feels like I'm reaching back unreasonably far to drive forward the plot, I will appreciate hearing that concern from the readers, and will humbly try to fix it.
