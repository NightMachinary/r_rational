This reminded me a lot of that part in the webcomic Freefall when one of the main characters is trying to solve a mystery while suffering induced anterograde amnesia.

One of the primary Questions SCP makes me ask is, what is causing all those anomalies, and this is looking to be trying to be at least a partial answer to the question.

Is 3125 the same entity as the one in "Unforgettable"? They seemed to be extremely similar in theory, extradimensional entities which use memes as focal points for the human world, but in practice they behaved rather differently, one was creating tentacles and things, the other was just making meat puppets of anyone who had the wrong idea.

I also wonder, what evolutionary pressure could push for such antimemetic beings? Could a being have an antimemetic effect so strong that they forget their own existance, yet still function somehow?
