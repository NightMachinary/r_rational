  Is 3125 the same entity as the one in "Unforgettable"?
#+end_quote

This is directly answered:

"Every competent antimemetics research project finds SCP-3125's fingerprints sooner or later. It manifests all over the world, in thousands of different forms. Most of them aren't even anomalous. Some of them we already have catalogued separately in the main database. A very small number of them are even in containment. Impossibly virulent cults, broken arithmetic, *invisible spiders as tall as skyscrapers*, people born with extra organs which nobody can see. That's the raw data. Those manifestations are troublesome enough to deal with in their own right..."

The "invisible spiders" links to Unforgettable. My interpretation is that, just like how a cube can cast a square or hexagonal shadow, the spiders are one of 3125's shadows.
