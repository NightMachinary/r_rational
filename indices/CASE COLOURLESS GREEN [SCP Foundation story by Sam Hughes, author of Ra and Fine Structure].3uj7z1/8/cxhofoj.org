Initially, I didn't process the phrase immediately following /"Kim looks confused and worried for a second"/, and had a sudden thought that perhaps the page was self-editing.

Then I thought it would be super great to have some SCP entries/stories self-edit as you read them (e.g., as part of one paragraph, have a reference to a previous paragraph which has changed since you read it). You could check the currently-read position by looking at what words are being highlighted (I almost always highlight when I read on a device with a mouse), or what's not currently being displayed on screen (especially useful for a mobile device).
