  One thing I didn't like is that he causally tied all the SCPs from previous stories together --- even if it seems to have been planned so from start.

He does say in the comments that he doesn't want to do too much of that. (Emphasis in the original.)

  SCP-3125 itself /hasn't/ been directly mentioned before, but many of its manifestations have. However, *SCP-3125 is definitely not the source of /all/ antimemetic phenomena*, any more than the Earth is the source of all gravity. In my view this kind of catchall explanation shrinks the universe and makes it less interesting. It also constrains the storytelling possibilities as we move forward. There need to be other ways to get antimemes, otherwise that's just dull and it ties everybody's hands.

  (Did you notice that SCP-3125 is a monster which eats people who try to find a common origin for too many other SCPs? This is deliberate!)
