  Asynchronous research --- whereby the research topic is forgotten entirely between iterations, and rediscovered over and over --- is a perfectly standard practice in the Antimemetics division

Then why aren't there more amnesiac study rooms? One possible explanation: Anyone who gets that hardcore about antimemetics research eventually leaks information and gets eaten by SCP-3125.

One must also ask why there arn't cells in the foundation where permanent staff live and study infohazards continuously, where much information goes in but only very limited amounts come out. The containment protocols for SCP-3125 require that NO information can come out but I think this is excessive, clearly highly costly, and not even technically possible - every time an antimemetics staff member walks out of there they get quite a lot of information, information that the SCP does not kill everything it comes into contact with, that it does not leave marks, that it does not drain energy etc, even if that information is not recorded. A single bit to be transmitted by the visiting researcher stating whether the SCP is still active, or a uint8 setting the schedule for the next visit, would have been extremely useful and I believe it's possible to set solid but not overly restrictive limits on the amount of information that can be passed through such outputs over time.
