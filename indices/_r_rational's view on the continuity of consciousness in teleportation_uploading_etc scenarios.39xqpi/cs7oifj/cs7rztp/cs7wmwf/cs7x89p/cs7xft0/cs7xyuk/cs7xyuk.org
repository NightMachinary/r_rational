I guess different viewpoints on what constitutes an individual consciousness. I don't see "continuity" as being a meaningful metric. Every moment the current me ceases to exist and is replaced by a future me, but since we are nearly identical, I'm alright with that, and don't consider it "dying". Its just like if you (carefully) froze your brain and then thawed it. You'd still be alive.
