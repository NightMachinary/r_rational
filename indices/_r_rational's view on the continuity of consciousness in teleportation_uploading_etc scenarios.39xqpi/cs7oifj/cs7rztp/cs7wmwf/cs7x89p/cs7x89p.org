Well obviously we would arrange the simulation to match the same initial state as the processes in your brain were at the time of upload/transfer. For example if we were copying a computer, we wouldn't just make an identical micro-chip, we would start it up running the same processes with the same memory state (otherwise I wouldn't consider it a perfect copy).
