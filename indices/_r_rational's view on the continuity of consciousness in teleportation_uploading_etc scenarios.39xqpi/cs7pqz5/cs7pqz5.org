  Do you use this teleporter?
#+end_quote

Do I become a first adopter of new, potentially very dangerous tech *products? Obviously not.

Do I /ever/ use it? Still an emphatic no.

It is logical, in a sense, for people not to care about the original versions of other people getting killed since they get a perfect copy to continue interacting with, but it is *very* irrational for me to not care about such things in relation to myself. And others in relation to their suicided originals, as well, but I have long given up on this level of rational thought from most people.

  What if they scanned your brain onto a computer?
#+end_quote

Non-destructively? Sure. Obviously that's a good thing.

Look under your chair. You get a me, and you get a me, and you get a me: everyone gets a me!

Otherwise, obviously not. That's still suicide.

  What do you do if you're the consciousness left behind?
#+end_quote

Assuming non-destructive uploading? Nod and do what my plan for the day was all along. I knew that was going to happen, because that's /all that can ever happen in that scenario/. Some really poorly thought-out body-horror sci-fi might tell fantastic stories to the contrary, but that doesn't affect how *reality* works.

I wouldn't ever become a teleport clone, because I am my brain *and* the history of regular electrochemical processes that lead it to its present state, and which will continue into the future for some time to come. Sure, someone will wake up at the destination, but they'll know what happened just as well as I do. I think a small, brief rejoicing of more me in the world is likely, on both ends, but it's not some big existential crisis. Looking at it any other way is some wishy-washy, soft sci-fi magical thinking.

The continuity of processing substrate plus the continuously updating and modifying programs in an operational brain is all any fundamental identity /can/ be. You are the past-present-future program /and/ the past-present-future physical substrate it is running on. Everything else is, at best, pseudo-religious technobabble and self-comforting mechanisms which can and should be shaved off with Occam's razor.

Don't unnecessicarily multiply entities, and certainly don't kill the original just because your misapplied pseudo-rational, neo-altruistic reasoning results in dumb ideas about personal identity.

Some /carefully/ designed forms of additive hardware uploading--where the original brain substrate becomes a less and less important percentage of total processing potential--are the only safe ways to upload.

Anything else is the gift of a brand new person to the future, possibly with a sad little suicide thrown in.
