  What if they scanned your brain onto a computer?

  Non-destructively? Sure. Obviously that's a good thing.

  Otherwise, obviously not. That's still suicide.

Sure, but what's so terrible about suicide in that case?

Suppose you're going to die in 60 years if you don't get brain-uploaded now, and your brain-uploaded version gets to live 60 trillion years if you do. Even if suicide is somewhat bad, you might still choose to sacrifice yourself so that your brain-uploaded version may live.

And if you accept that, consider that your body contains a massive amount of negentropy which can power your simulated self for simulated millennia. If entropy can't be reversed, you would have the choice to keep your old self alive, or to sacrifice it in order to extend your brain-uploaded version's life by thousands of years per year lost to suicide.
