  If your answer to the question of what action is optimal returns *suicide*, you aren't rational. Despite whatever dark little thought games internet intellectual tough-guys play to prove how altruistic and sexable they are, reality has no exceptions.

*Put up or shut up.* I'll give you $100 if I can't find someone whose suicide (deliberate destruction of self) was rational within a week of you accepting, and you donate $10000 to MIRI in my name if I can. If no exceptions exist, there's no chance of you losing the $10000, is there?

As for why the stakes are that high: that's to make it so you actually care about being right.

  Anything can be justified by saying the new task schedule and resource allotment will benefit from the sacrifice of the old order.

  Death is the loss of everything someone is and has been.

Except, in this case, literally everything they are and have been, since no atoms are lost (not that those are relevant) and no information is lost if a backup exists.
