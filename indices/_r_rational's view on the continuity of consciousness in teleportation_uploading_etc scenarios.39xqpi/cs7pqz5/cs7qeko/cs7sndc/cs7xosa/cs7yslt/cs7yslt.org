Fuck off. You're not even doing it right. I wouldn't drive an hour to spit on you for that much, especially not with that sort of weaselly risk profile on the other side. Certainly not with your apparent ability to think rationally.

Rationally debate or get the fuck out of the pool. I don't have time for your sophomoric internet dick-measuring wastes of time.

  I don't follow and you don't seem to explain.

Read the other replies to me. I can't be arsed to link any further, given how you're treating this debate.

#+begin_quote
  Please be more exact.

You and your ilk don't value continued existence of intelligent beings, and only value the functional output of their processes. Thus, you will murder anything if that results in exact copies of processes, even if the original process and substrate don't continue with a casually uninterrupted chain.

You monsters.

A person is not matter running a program which can be copied at will, even with a magically perfect process. *A person is the specific continuing collective process of the matter and the program running on it.* The same way rearranging every electrochemical connection in the brain kills a person, so does simply copying information (even perfectly) from them and then destroying their body. You've got a nice clone that does the same things, but you still killed a living, thinking person to do it.

They don't "wake up" in the clone, or some other trashy sci-fi nonsense. Not that you've said so, but that's pretty typical a delusion for futurists to have, even subconsciously.

But if all you care about is having something that does the same things, why should it matter? Self-preservation. Obviously. Because /you/ will die if you do that.
