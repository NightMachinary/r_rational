  I'm fine with raising the stakes. How does $1,000 / $100,000 sound to you? If you don't have the money lying around, I'm fine if you pay at least $5,000 now and pay 4% interest rate over whatever you don't pay.

It sounds like, at best, a complex and misunderstood internet dick-waving competition, not an attempt to discover the nature of reality through rational dialog. I was around when that was invented in these online circles. It was made as a technique to shut-up whiny internet rationalist kids and their terribly unlikely theories. No one told them that, and some people seriously used it later on, but it was always consensual when used that way, not some weird point of order.

I am massively offended to have it used on me here, something I thought I made clear. Your continued misuse of it makes it even more offensive. This is my problem not yours, the offense I take, but I don't see any compelling advantage in slogging forward regardless.

I'm not learning anything new and I consider you not to be arguing in good faith because of that and other inabilities to debate clearly, such as failing to echo back the points I've been making in an honest and clear-cut way to avoid confusion and digression on either side.

You know, how friendly debate is typically run instead of internet peecocking.

Yeah, I think we're done here.
