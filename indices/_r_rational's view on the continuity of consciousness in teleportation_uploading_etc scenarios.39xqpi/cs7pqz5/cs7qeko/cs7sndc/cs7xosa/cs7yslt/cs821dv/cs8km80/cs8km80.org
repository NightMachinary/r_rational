  I'm fine with raising the stakes. How does $1,000 / $100,000 sound to you? If you don't have the money lying around, I'm fine if you pay at least $5,000 now and pay 4% interest rate over whatever you don't pay.

I'm with [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] on this constituting dick-waving. Neither of you is making a prediction that can be checked by a third party doing a physical experiment in the near-term, so there's no point trying to beef up your position by signaling a willingness to bet.
