  I am massively offended to have it used on me here, something I thought I made clear.

Oh yeah, I was nerd-sniped for that. You said you wouldn't want $100 for driving an hour and spitting on me, but with the price of gas and vehicle maintenance that's about $60 for an hour's work where you learn nothing, which is a pretty mediocre deal for me and probably many others in the [[/r/rational]] community as well. I was so distracted by how the insult didn't make sense that I forgot to wonder what prompted it.
