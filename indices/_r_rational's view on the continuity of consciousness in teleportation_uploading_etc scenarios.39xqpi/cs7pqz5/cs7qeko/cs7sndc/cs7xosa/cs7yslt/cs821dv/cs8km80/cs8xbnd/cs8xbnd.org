  Neither of you is making a prediction that can be checked by a third party doing a physical experiment in the near-term

Words have meaning. Even if they aren't exact, they create testable expectations and "suicide is never rational" is a reasonably clear prediction which can be falsified by demonstrating that people tend to value other lives as more valuable than their own in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection#Hamilton.27s_rule][ev-psych theory]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Fox#Military_service][fact]], and thought experiment. I would be surprised if you wouldn't consider this sufficient third-party-verifiable evidence that I'm correct, at least for casual discussion.

Is that what he meant with "weaselly risk profile"? Vagueness? I agree increasing the stakes isn't a good way to deal with vagueness, and I'd wanted to make the terms more clear if he had agreed to bet on them or said something I recognised as wanting to go into more detail, but I saw neither.

It isn't my intent to wave my dick or even to give (more than a few percent of) casual viewers the impression that I'm waving my dick, so would you please explain what I did wrong/missed in this case?
