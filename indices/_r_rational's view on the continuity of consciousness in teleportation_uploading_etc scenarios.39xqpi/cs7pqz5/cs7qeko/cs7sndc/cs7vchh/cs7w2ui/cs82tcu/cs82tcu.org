Can't we be okay with suicide, but not okay with murder?

For humans running faulty software, it's a good idea to make a rule that says "Never murder other people, even when it seems to produce a net benefit."

I don't think that the same rule is necessary for "Never kill yourself, even when it seems to produce a net benefit." /Barring cases of psychological disorder/, we already have a pretty hard psychological injunction against that, and so (again, barring cases of extreme depression, &c) if you judge self-sacrifice to be a worthwhile action, then by all means go for it.

If I were presented with sufficient evidence that offing myself would promote my terminal value more effectively than my continued existence, then I might examine and re-examine it really, really hard, because that'd be a very surprising piece of information, but after I had done sufficient work in confirming it, then yeah, I would off myself.

EDIT: Fixed a typo.
