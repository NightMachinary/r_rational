  I'll at least read a reply, though don't be offended if I don't comment again myself.

No problem.

I apologize for that. I would have searched for some examples that did not directly involve suicide, but expressed the same point, if I had known.

Essentially, I don't think that it's practical to have multiple terminal values because then you're stuck in a jam when they come into conflict (if they will never conflict in any possible scenario, then more likely they're the same value with two names). I like paintings, and I like biodiversity, and I like (certain kinds of) food. I do /not/ like any of the possible nightmare wireheading scenarios which await anyone who genuinely values hedons in particular, because I want paintings and biodiversity and delicious food much, much more than I want orgasmium.

You could try to cover these things under the umbrella value of Beauty, but "beauty" is a term that has to refer to another value before it can have any meaning. So I decided to go with complexity, which as a word in general has a lot of possible meanings and so might be most quickly defined through comparisons:

- Multicultural societies are more complex than monocultural societies.

- The Lord of the Rings is more complex than Peter Rabbit.

- You, having learned something, are more complex than you, before you learned that thing.

- A universe with 10 hedons and 10 dolors is more complex than a universe with 20 hedons and 0 dolors.

What is Beautiful is Good, and what is Complex is Beautiful.

Within certain bounds, at least. Complexity that is incomprehensible is no better than, and possibly in some ways worse than, undifferentiated simplicity. Both are noise on the airwaves. But of course I also have an interest in increasing our capacity to comprehend the complex.

In this system, hedons are no more valuable than dolors, except for the fact that we are, you could say, addicted to them, and people can be permanently damaged or at least temporarily impaired if they don't get enough hedons in the long term or get too many dolors. It would be nice to fix that, but we would obviously have to be very careful about it.

Also, perhaps unfortunately, humans are also instrumental values, since I don't think it's feasible to hold multiple terminal values. We're awesome things in my system because we are like engines of complexity, producing a whole bunch of it just by, well, /being/.

  How can you fulfill not wanting to die tomorrow rationally if you suddenly have "die for awesome murder-clone" added into the mix?

I identify a person by zir personality, memories, &c &c. If my best friend's mind were to be switched with the mind of someone else, then I would continue my interactions with my-friend-in-someone-else's-body, no matter how quickly or slowly the transition happened.

(Now, it might be that physical differences between the bodies might cause a change in my friend's personality such that our relationship could no longer be maintained, but the same could be said of brain injuries and the like)

If my friend were to suffer complete amnesia, then my response would be exactly the same as if she had physically died. If my friend were uploaded to a computer then, no matter how quickly or destructively it happened, I would identify the upload as my best friend. And if she went through a teleporter that did not require the destruction of the original body, and so there were two of my friend, then I would, as that just implied, consider both of them to be my best friend. That may eventually cease to be true in the future, but that would be so even without teleporters entering the picture.

I care about (at the risk of oversimplifying) the particular brain-state or personality snapshot as it exists in that time and place. It's been argued that, strictly speaking, people are thus dying from moment to moment according to this system. That seems to be true, but from moment to moment each successive identity is similar enough that I have no problem with continuing to update the status of "best friend" to this series of identities. I am not only her friend, but hope that the identities which follow this one will be friends with the identities which follow her present identity.

In the long run it's easier to see the difference. I don't care about fifteen-year-old me and I consider him to a different person. Assuming no time shenanigans to the effect that a change to Past Me would result in a change to Present Me, I have no more concern for Past Me than I do for any other person (and perhaps a little bit less, because Past Me was an asshole and I assume people to be nice until proven otherwise).

The desire to not die tomorrow might, in my conception of identity, be better expressed as the desire to be replaced by something better than myself tomorrow, rather than nothing at all.

(To be clear, though, I don't advocate forcing people to do things, and if I were somehow given the reins to the world then you'd be left to do as you pleased, and upload or teleport or not, as you chose)

  This and other comments suggests a state of self-worth that I feel is dangerous.
#+end_quote

Possibly. I remain open to the possibility that it may be the result of a mental illness, since it /is/ rather odd and I can see how it might be easier to hold some or all of these ideas by experiencing, say, depersonalization disorder. I'd prefer to have more than assumptions, though, so for the time being I feel comfortable with remaining where I am in belief-space.
