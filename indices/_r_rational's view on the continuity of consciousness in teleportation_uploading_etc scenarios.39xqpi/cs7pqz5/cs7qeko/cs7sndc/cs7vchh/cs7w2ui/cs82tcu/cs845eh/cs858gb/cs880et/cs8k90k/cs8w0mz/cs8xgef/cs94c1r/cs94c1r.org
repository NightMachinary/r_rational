This is just pretty typical transhumanist dinner party fodder. Nothing happening in this sub that I'm aware of. But calculations have been done elsewhere regarding post-singularity, cross-galaxy survivor parties. RSVPing gets messy for software minds and involves statistical predictions, and it's hard to set a date without FTL.

I've still got weird I haven't even used left but I think this might be getting off topic, even with the uploading-related nature of the discussion.
