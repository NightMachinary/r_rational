Ok, there's a difference between self-sacrifice for the sake of /another person who's concretely there and needs you/, and just killing yourself out of some abstract conceptualization that the world is better off without you. A firefighter or other emergency worker also functions as part of a team whose training, equipment, and policies deliberately /minimize/ the chance of Heroic Sacrifices as a part of minimizing total casualties -- that's what professionalism /is/ for emergency workers. (Actually, "get stuff right ahead of time - with training, equipment, and policy - so that heroism becomes /unnecessary/" is a fairly good definition of professionalism overall.)

The former happens reasonably often. The latter is almost always a symptom of depression, to such an extent that it's worth enforcing a Corrupted Meat Injunction on taking the latter seriously.
