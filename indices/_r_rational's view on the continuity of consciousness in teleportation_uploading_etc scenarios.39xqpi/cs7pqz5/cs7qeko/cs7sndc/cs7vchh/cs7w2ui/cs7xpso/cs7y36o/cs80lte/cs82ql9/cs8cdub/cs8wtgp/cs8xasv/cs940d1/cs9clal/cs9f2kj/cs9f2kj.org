I wrote something really long in reply. It was boring. I deleted it, saved everyone a bunch of time. You're all welcome.

Here:

#+begin_quote
  For you to care, with your abstract, high-level brain, about some property of a particle, that property of the particle has to exist in the first place.
#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote
  ... But to derive from that that particles have identity is a vast step too far, which is not supported by any evidence and in fact contradicted by quantum physics.
#+end_quote

Don't.

#+begin_quote
  ...

  So, since particles do not have this property in a physical sense, anything built from particles can also not have this property in a physical sense.
#+end_quote

Stop, please.

This entire thread of logic is incorrect. You worked that from both sides at once, making a strawman of my argument in the process. When I mentioned bits of matter, I wasn't referring to fundamental particles, I was referring to the human brain as a complete physical process.

I agree, no particle has this property of identity, but collections of matter in space-time do. That is what is not copied in a suicide-clone teleporter. That is why destroying /your/ brain, the only thing scientifically proven to produce a human mind, in this way kills /you/.

There is just a brand new mind in a new brain. It doesn't inherit the identity of the old brain simply because it is copied from the same information. The new brain has a different space-time history and thus identity from the original collection of matter, which continues to have its own space-time identity. The new brain thus contains a new, differently-identifiable mind.

Also, your reasoning is flawed and your use of the quantum nature of particles is incorrect. Especially that last step.

#+begin_quote
  And, personally speaking, considering an upload continuous with your flesh-self is hella useful. :)
#+end_quote

This is your failure. You prefer this view of the nature of the physical aspects of the human mind, one not supported /at all/ by science, because it pleases you. You nurture a poorly constructed ontology to make yourself feel better, and present it as a textdump because you need to spend a lot of time talking around its weak points.

Bad rational thinker. No cookie. Now please stop vomiting pop-science quantum theory onto my inbox. Go and q-sin no more.
