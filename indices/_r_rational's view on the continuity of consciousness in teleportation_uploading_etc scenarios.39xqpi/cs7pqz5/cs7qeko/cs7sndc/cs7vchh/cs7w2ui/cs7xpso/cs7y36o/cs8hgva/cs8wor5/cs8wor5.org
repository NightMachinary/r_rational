  Admittedly, in my version it's a cyberpunk ultracapitalist dark-scifi-future, because for some strange reason a lot of tech/scifi people are still allergic to egalitarianism even when the rest of the world is finally moving on from trying to make life imitate Snow Crash.

You're telling me you're not excited to see every single citizen become an entrepreneur contractor in a bright new hyper-competitive marketplace where an increasing quantity of resources are spent shoring up personal defenses against other actors' "fair and competitive practices"? You don't think the Randian threat of the poor rising up against excessive abuse will continue to be a logical keystone to social policies when mindcontrol, purpose-grown, and artificial/uploaded lifeforms can literally be reprogrammed not to demand so-called natural and civil rights?

What a pessimist.

As for the rest, I largely agree. I think a unsurprisingly small number of strong proponents of information-as-self would actually walk into the /24-Hour FedEx/Suicide Kinkos/ were it to appear tomorrow. And even those holding my position would do so as a seemingly truly inescapable last result. Such is the nature of internet techno-philosowanking.
