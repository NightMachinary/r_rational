Are you under the impression that continuous processes of changing electrochemical functions acting on a semi-static brain can't be simulated/emulated?

Or is it that your definition of self is non-local? That you can be told everything about an entire time-segment of a person down to the movement of the electrons (quantum mechanics notwithstanding), and not tell if they are your friend or a mere /duplicate/ with little moral value?

Or are you highly confident that an essential part of someone's identity is stored in continuously changing patterns which are lost using the uploading/duplicating methods you assume I'm talking about?

I would guess option 2. Which is what [[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1][the comic linked by the most upvoted post]] addresses. More particularly the "It's no different from being knocked unconscious or falling asleep?" bit.

  I swear, if I have to live on the run from a bunch of serial teleport murderers in a dark sci-fi future, I'm blaming you idiots.

Don't worry. The (f)AI will be good enough at its job that you won't have to run. :)
