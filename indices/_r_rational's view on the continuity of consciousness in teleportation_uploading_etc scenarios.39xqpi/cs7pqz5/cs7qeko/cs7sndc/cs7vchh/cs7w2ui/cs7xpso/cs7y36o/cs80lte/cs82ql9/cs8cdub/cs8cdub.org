I just want to second the other commenter and point out that there's an experiment called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment][quantum eraser]] that would not be physically possible if particles had causal history.

We don't live in a world that has a factual past. We live in a world that is the superposition of /all/ pasts that have led to it. There is no "fact of the matter" which past is "actually" ours.
