I am confident that one bit of matter is different from another, even if functionally identical. They have different *causal history and location, for example. This is independant of any theory of mind I mind have.

If one brain hasn't been running a brain software process for the temporal history of that informational result, it isn't the same brain as originally collected that informational result. You can have two brains, different collections of matter, with the same information. The brain with the original causal history is the original brain. A person is a brain (for now).

As the brain is the person, you need a causal link between processes on the brain matter in one location and in a second location. Gradual replacement is thus permitted in this model. Otherwise, anything that might be called consciousness is guaranteed to be lost to the original.
