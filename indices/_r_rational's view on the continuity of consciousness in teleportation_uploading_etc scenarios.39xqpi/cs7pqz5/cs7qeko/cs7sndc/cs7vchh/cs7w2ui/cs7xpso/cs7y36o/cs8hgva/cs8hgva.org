  I swear, if I have to live on the run from a bunch of serial teleport murderers in a dark sci-fi future, I'm blaming you idiots.

OHMYGOD, now you know how I feel /all the time!/ Admittedly, in my version it's a cyberpunk ultracapitalist dark-scifi-future, because for some strange reason a lot of tech/scifi people are still allergic to egalitarianism even when the rest of the world is /finally/ moving on from trying to make life imitate /Snow Crash/.

Frankly if I'm 90-something years old and dying, and there's no /other/ mode of life extension available, then leaving behind a "copy" to live on after me as a kind of clone-child is pretty ok. Especially if I get to design the successor first.

Still not as preferable as getting a proper scientific literature explaining what continuity of consciousness /really does mean/ and being able to answer the questions with definitive experimental evidence so that I can obtain some way of staying alive /as me/, but alas, such is scifi philosophizing.
