Macro effects cannot have properties that are irreducible to micro effects.

If particles cannot have history, people cannot have history in a physical sense. People can have history in an /abstract/ sense, but abstract history can cross the upload barrier just fine. Not because uploading can be done perfectly if you track quantum information, but because the existence of certain quantum effects demonstrates that it is physically impossible that particle history has relevance at all.
