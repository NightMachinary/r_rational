  The new brain has a different space-time history

*THERE IS NO SUCH THING*.

Show me ONE.

ONE.

Law of physics that changes its behavior based on "space-time history".

Getting a bit pissed at being called a crackpot here.

It is literally impossible that your brain cares about /actual/ "space-time history"; because that doesn't exist in the territory, it is impossible for your map to be entangled (*NOT IN THE QUANTUM SENSE, DON'T EVEN START*) with it! At best it cares about an abstraction of space-time history.

It's like caring about whether God wants you to eat pork. Since there /is/ no God; it is factually impossible for Him to want anything! Your belief is not about an actual thing that actually exists!

( Upvoted anyway, just for "It was boring. I deleted it". )

PS: Look, let's short-circuit this. Do you have a friend who you trust and who's a physicist, and can you give me their phone number/skype id? I think it'd be easier to convince them, and then they can convince you.
