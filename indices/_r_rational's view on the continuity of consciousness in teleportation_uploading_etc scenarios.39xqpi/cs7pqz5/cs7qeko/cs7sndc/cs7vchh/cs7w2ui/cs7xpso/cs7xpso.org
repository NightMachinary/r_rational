  Why not murder-clone seven billion flesh and blood people to allow a hundred trillion digital people to live faster, better lives at the same cost?

Consent is one thing, though in my opinion if people would consent when properly informed, you don't need to wait for them to physically move their lip-flaps in order to express consent. (This rule only applies to rational superbeings who can accurately predict if people would consent. Humans would just trick themselves into believing consent would be given).

And I would guess that people would all consent when properly informed. (If they understood quantum mechanics, reductionism, and the structure of the human mind).

The other is unknown unknowns. Nothing in known physics or theoretical physics that I know of indicates that something would go wrong, but this kind of thing often goes wrong because of weird reasons.

  The only way to fight it is this. Point out how much magical thinking and fuzzy-headed idiocy is involved in thinking your murder-clone is just as good to have around as you.

So actually do so?
