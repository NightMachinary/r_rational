  You're telling me you're not excited to see every single citizen become an entrepreneur contractor in a bright new hyper-competitive marketplace where an increasing quantity of resources are spent shoring up personal defenses against other actors' "fair and competitive practices"? ...

  What a pessimist.

Yeah. I'm such a pessimist that I can't help but look forward only to a communist era in which compassionate, intelligent AI Minds replace the blunt, brutal machinations of the state (including the often even blunter and more brutal machinations of dumb computers), and people associate freely based on common interests and solidarity, and things like fun and love are considered the really important things in life.

I have an extremely dark worldview.
