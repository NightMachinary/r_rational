It feels like we're talking past each other.

I'm not saying that quantum physics proves that continuity with an upload is definitely the case. That'd be quantum woo.

I'm saying quantum physics proves that at the lowest level, the physical level of individual particles, physics is not capable of giving you what it seemed you wanted - a way to care about the "actual history" of a "specific particle" - because quantum physics very particularly does not track any such thing as a "specific particle" /at all/.

For you to care, with your abstract, high-level brain, about some property of a particle, that property of the particle has to exist in the first place. It has to be in the territory before your map can meaningfully refer to it. When we talk of the history of an item, we're talking about a very complex amalgamation of physical, social and legal properties, which has a tendency of breaking down when faced with unusual situations, such as the oft-cited Ship of Theseus. What we are /not/ talking about, however, is any sort of particle-wise identity that stretches across time, because we /cannot/ be talking /about/ that, because it /does not exist at all/. There is no "about" to be talked about in the territory.

Now, physics obviously conserves certain quantities, so that for certain timeframes it can look like particles have permanence. But to derive from that that particles have /identity/ is a vast step too far, which is not supported by any evidence and in fact contradicted by quantum physics. Seriously, have you even [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/r5/the_quantum_physics_sequence/][read the Sequences]]? ;)

So, since particles do not have this property in a physical sense, anything built from particles can also not have this property /in a physical sense/. You have to be abstracting over something else, such as some notion of permanence or uniqueness or legal ownership (as in the Ship of Theseus) and wrapping up all the problems under the simplifying notion of "the same". But [[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html][all abstractions are leaky]], and you have to keep in mind that you're considering something that's based on Usefulness more than Truth. And, personally speaking, considering an upload continuous with your flesh-self is hella useful. :)

Now, you can, if you like, /construct/, in your head, a notion of an electron as a distinct particle with identity. And you can watch this distinct particle fly towards a silver mirror, and get simultaneously reflected and not reflected, and simultaneously fly through two slits in a small metal plate, and then this one particle which is in two positions somehow ends up in a single position which is somewhere that neither of the two positions the particle was just in should have allowed it to end up, and by this point you should have smoke coming out your ears and smelling faintly of ozone. Which should amply demonstrate to you that the initial assumption of the distinct particle was unworkable, and remind us all that while we can construct whatever we like in our heads, reality is not in fact obliged to care. Reality (apparently) runs on quantum physics, not on imagination, and /quantum physics is local/, however inconvenient that is for our maps.

And so it follows, since you cannot care about specific particles in reality, not because of any logical argument but because "specific particles" happens to be a thing that does not /exist/ in reality, you can at best care about configurations of particles. Which happens to be something that sounds significantly more amenable to uploading than specific particles, so that's convenient.

In a world where a particle's causal history sometimes had physical effects, would I think differently? I think I'd still want to have the same /preference/ - that an upload is as valuable as a fleshbody for continuation, but it would be much harder for me to argue this point, even to myself. It's plausible and convenient to count people with the same configuration as selves, but we happen to live in the rhetorically /really convenient/ world where it's actually /physically incoherent/ to do otherwise.
