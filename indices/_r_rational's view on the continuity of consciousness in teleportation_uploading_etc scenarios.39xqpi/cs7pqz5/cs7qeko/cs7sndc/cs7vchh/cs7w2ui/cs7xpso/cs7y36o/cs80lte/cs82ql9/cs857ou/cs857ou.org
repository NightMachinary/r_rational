  I am confident that one bit of matter is different from another, even if functionally identical. They have different *causal history and location, for example.

Good. You've set yourself up for falsification, and the universe sees fit to award you with your assumption being provably incorrect, giving you a learning opportunity.

Bits of matter have no causal history. Everything is blobs of amplitude of quantum fields. An electron which came from A to B via C will interfere with an electron which came via D (if they have the same phase) in exactly the same way as it interferes when it's split into two halves which take both routes.

Position is indeed a piece of information, same as time. However, since people don't die every femtosecond or as the planet rotates, position is not morally relevant.

  If one brain hasn't been running a brain software process for the temporal history of that informational result, it isn't the same brain as originally collected that informational result.

Assuming you mean "if one brain is created in the exact state as another, it isn't the same brain":

Factually, quantum mechanically incorrect. Both brains are identical and if they could maintain quantum coherence they would interfere just as surely as simple electrons. This does take some extrapolation from available data: so far we haven't been able to maintain quantum coherence on objects larger than single molecules, but it's theoretically possible.

Well, that is if they're quantum mechanically identical. Same phase on every quark, same photons and phonons and everything. Merely containing the same person is luckily a much laxer standard, but the important thing is that history is irrelevant to present identity. Now, since you are the same person as you are a second from now when all your spins are out of whack, you are also the same person as someone who is only slightly different from someone with an entirely different history from you but the same quantum mechanical state as you. Therefore you are identical to someone who was teleported back and forth too fast for you to notice.

Now consider that you would still be you if you physically walked from the entrance site of the teleporter to the exit site. In that case, you have physically changed more in every way than if you just teleported from one location to the other. Either you just shift the spatial coordinates of every cell in your body a little, or you literally replace half of them, shift the spatial coordinates by the same amount, and also the time coordinate by a lot.

  As the brain is the person, you need a causal link between processes on the brain matter in one location and in a second location.

How else would you expect to know what kind of person to create at the exit site?

  Otherwise, anything that might be called consciousness is guaranteed to be lost to the original.

Of course: the original is destroyed. Am I missing something here?
