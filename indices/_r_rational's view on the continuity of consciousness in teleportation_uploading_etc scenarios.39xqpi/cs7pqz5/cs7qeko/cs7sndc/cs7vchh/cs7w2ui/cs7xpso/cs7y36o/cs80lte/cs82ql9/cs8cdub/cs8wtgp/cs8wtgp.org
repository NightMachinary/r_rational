I'm talking about macro effects. That's part of my point, in fact. The parts making up the whole can alter in small ways, and do, and that doesn't change the functioning of the system to any great degree. But it has to be a physical part of that system to have any identity relationship with that system. Otherwise, it is simply a copy and should be identified as such.

That's why proponents of information as identity are so enamored with quantum effects. It is the only way they see to get around the identity problem of murdering the original in destructive copy scenarios. And it falls flat when it actually comes to real world examples, still requiring things like perfect informational awareness. The bane of rational models everywhere.
