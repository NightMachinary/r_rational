If the personal answer is to sacrifice one's life for a better, longer-lived version of that person, what inherent value is actually being placed on continued existence of any single person by a society consisting of such-minded individuals?

If continuance isn't valued at its most basic point, singular individual consciousnesses and self identities, then why not murder-clone those wasters of energy and use their physical or informational resources to do something more efficient? Why not murder-clone seven billion flesh and blood people to allow a hundred trillion digital people to live faster, better lives at the same cost? They'll be copies of the old ones, and might be made to not even notice their new simulated lives--ones that have no continuous physical and informational relationship to the dead bodies left behind.

This line of thought, that all processes that function the same are equivalent, is the dumbest thing I've seen since religion, and for many of the same reasons. And it is just as dangerous to my being, as technology advances and idiots who think this way come into power, shaping laws, social mores, and technology.

The only way to fight it is this. Point out how much magical thinking and fuzzy-headed idiocy is involved in thinking your murder-clone is just as good to have around as you. Otherwise, some day they'll try to murder-clone you, sure that your +spirit+ informational process will live on in the +afterlife+ clone.
