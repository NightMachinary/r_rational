James Patrick Kelly, /Think Like a Dinosaur/.

Greg Egan, just about anything before the Clockwork Rocket series.

John Barnes, /A Million Open Doors/ and sequels.

Vernor Vinge, /Just Peace/, where you don't destroy the original.

There's another novel involving a duplicative teleportation with a title that's "something star" by blish or aldiss or hoyle or one of those guys that I can't recall.
