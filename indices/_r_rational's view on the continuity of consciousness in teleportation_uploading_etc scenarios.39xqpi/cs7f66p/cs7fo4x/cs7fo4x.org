Greg Egan wrote a lot of good stuff exploring what it means to be you. Things like the consequences to cloning your consciousness and then deleting the clone (what if you end up as the clone), what happens when your digital consciousness is being copied (it goes through states where it is partially copied), or what happens when you are replaced by a computer brain that thinks exactly like you (or maybe not quite exactly).
