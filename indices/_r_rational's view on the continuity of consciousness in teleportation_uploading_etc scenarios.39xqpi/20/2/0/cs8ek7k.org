Because I love living. I have a personal subjective experience created by my btain, that is who I am. It doesn't matter if my brain is being simulated by a computer somewhere, an identical copy of my consciousness will be created.

I suppose for everyone else that won't matter; they won't see any difference. But on the inside there is a difference. My subjective experience would end when I'm disingetrated or whatever. I'll die. What's the point of immortality when you'd don't even get to experience it?
