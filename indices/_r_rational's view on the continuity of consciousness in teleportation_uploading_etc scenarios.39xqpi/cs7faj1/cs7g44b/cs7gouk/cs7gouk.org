It's a good point that due to the fundamental nature of humanity having always existed on a more, shall we say, visceral medium that hundreds of thousands of small changes happen constantly. From that point of the view the line becomes quite difficult to distinguish when you compare you uploaded and you unuploaded. After a radical event in your life you might compare that to the death of your previous self far more than a small change in the uploads behaviour.
