  Copies are cool. I think I could get on quite well with my doppelg√§nger. We'd consider it rude to ask which of us is the real one.

It's a question that bothers me greatly because when discussing clones and the such people can't get it out of their head that they are the original. I tend to do something like "You go in a dark room and fall asleep, when you wake up there are two of you" so that they might finally realise that the clone is replica.

A runaway cloning machine would be a problem for a lot of people based on some of their attitudes towards a "lesser" clone whereas I'm with you on the boat that I hope to be committed to going so far as to die to save two+ of my clones.
