My sense of self is based also on /functional/ continuity. It can't be only purely physical you also have to take into consideration the electrical component . I want to avoid "zero moments" , i define them as moments in when there's a break in the continuum of brain activity.

About teleportation you have both breaks, the physical one is obvious the functional one is less apparent. I use this example to explain myself : think about a hypotetical computer that can keep all his cache loaded even when not powered. You do your thing, turn it down , copy all the things to another machine and boot it up. You as an external observer would see no difference whatsoever from the outside but continuity has been broken .

Now bringing this to human beings, we never break continuity. Sure we arent conscious all the time but from bith to death you have a system that is in a permanent state of flow. Any process that's disruptive breaks the continuity, destroying the consciousness.

I highly doubt we will ever have to worry about disruptive teleportation, even if it would be feasible by the point we are at that level there will be far better options.

My end comment is that we lack knowledge, the processes in the brain are still highly unknown so i can easily be wrong but with the knowledge at the moment at our disposal consciousness is an arising phenomena and by definition it's caused by many lower level phenomenas this implies that if you shut them down you shut consciousness down, and since the ammount of possible consciousnesses per given brain is infinite (yes it is an assumption, but not a far fetched one : "you" could not have ever existed, there could be someone completly identical to you in your stead ; the universe would objectively be the same) when you restart them you cannot be certain that you restart the old consciousnesses , sure the new one would genuinely believe to be it.

I may be paranoid, and i have no problems admitting that but isn't it the most rational thing to do? Preservation of subjectivity from a subjective point of view is the end goal of any kind of immortalism. I'm for substitutive uploading, no else. And by the way, i see it way more feasible than the destructive route.

Sorry for the huge rant but i wanted to be complete. I'm open to any criticism (i would be more than happy to be wrong)
