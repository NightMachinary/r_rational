I have two problems with this argument (I think).

- First the idea of identity relying on continuum is worrying to me. What if in 50 or 100 years we discover that time is discrete? Does this disprove consciousness (or continuity of consciousness)?

- Second is related to the first, but continuity is a very fragile thing. How can you know that super-powerful alien beings aren't stopping all electrochemical activity in your brain every time you sleep? Or even just once? You (presumably) feel like the same person you were yesterday but how can you ever know? I prefer to base my decisions on what is "me" on whether it feels like me both to itself and to others.
