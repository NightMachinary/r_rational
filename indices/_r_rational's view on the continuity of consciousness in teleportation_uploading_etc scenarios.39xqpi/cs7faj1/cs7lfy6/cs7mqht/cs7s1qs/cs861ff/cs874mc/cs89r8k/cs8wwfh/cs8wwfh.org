  Interesting. I'd consider myself the process being performed by my brain, rather than the brain itself.

Then you have a lot of proving to do. The current scientific model is that the matter thinking of itself is your brain, not the pattern that matter makes. Anything flying in the face of that holds the burden of proof.

You're concluding that you must be /just/ the software, the information, seemingly because otherwise you can't get what you want. Which is deeply irrational reasoning.
