  What if in 50 or 100 years we discover that time is discreet?

The point isn't that time has some special property. The physical matter that makes up the brain and originally ran the copied state used on the clone has no causal brain relationship with the new brain matter. Anything that could be self is in the human brain.

The new clone brain isn't the original brain, even if it is loaded with a software configuration that is exactly the same. It is a new person. If you killed the original brain, you killed that person because they were their brain. Very straight forward.

Neurons change and die, but they were still part of a functioning system, closely related and part of a continuing process. Taking a snapshot of that informational structure and then claiming a clone programmed with it is the same person is just stupid, and ignores how physical processes work. It is part of a seductive tech-dream lie people are telling themselves, one carefully designed to make uploading seem easier and more approachable to better stave away the terrors of death. Ironic (in the original sense) that this meme could very well result in such "thinkers" killing themselves, giving the world a much more efficient copy of their mind.

In short, if the original brain is destroyed as part of some one-to-one copying, you've only copied information to make a murder-clone. It's that simple. Calling the information divorced from the physical substrate it was running on the person and ignoring the destruction of a thinking, living physical being is intentionally misunderstanding the complex process that is the human brain. Or blindly ignoring the rights of individual intelligent beings in favor of some optimized informational strategy. Either way, really fucking evil.

  How can you know that super-powerful alien beings aren't stopping all electrochemical activity in your brain every time you sleep?

Occam's razor. No proof, and reality can be explained just as well without that. The rest is all nihilistic Psych 101 nonsense that makes the very discussion moot. And is totally unproven, untestable, and unuseful in the real world.
