I'm a transhumanist and i don't go for that concept.

My explanation is fairly easy and i think the logic is sound :

Your consciousness is not only the cells and atoms in your brain : it is the continuous biological and electrical processes that happen. They never stop , even when you sleep there's no interruption in your brain firing.

In my humble opinion if you stop the processes and then re-start them somewhere else *they have not the same unbroken continuum* , there's someone else that is complety convinced to be you because the brains are identical.

And anyway since i really really really want to become immortal i would rather avoid any kind of potential risk.

Anyway i don't understand why such concepts are equated with sleep.. Sleep is a loss of awareness but there's not any kind of disruption of the normal processes.
