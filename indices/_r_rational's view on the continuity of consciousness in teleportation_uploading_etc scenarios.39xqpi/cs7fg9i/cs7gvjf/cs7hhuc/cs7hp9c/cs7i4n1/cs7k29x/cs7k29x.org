Time-looped computing solves that issue for the most part, if we ever get stable wormholes that connect two different points in time. It's still a finite amount of computation, and a time-looped system that sends information back to itself would complete the calculation instantly from the perspective of an outsider. So it's not out of the realm of scifi.
