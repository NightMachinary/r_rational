If it were perfect, then sure, I'd use it. However, you have to put a lot of trust in people if you're talking about the core of your being.

If someone intercepts the transmission, they have their own private copy of you. If someone makes a copy of your brain-state, they have their own private copy of you /and/ can probably make their own edits to it. That's the sort of stuff that I find truly horrifying; not the continuity of consciousness stuff, which (to me) isn't that distinct from sleeping and then waking up.
