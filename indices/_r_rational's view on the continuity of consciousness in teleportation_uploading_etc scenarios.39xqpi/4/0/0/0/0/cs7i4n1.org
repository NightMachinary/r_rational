The human brain has [[https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=number%20of%20neurons%20in%20the%20human%20brain][100 billion neurons]] and [[https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=number+of+neuronal+connections+in+the+brain][100 trillion connections]]. If we assume that neurons are interchangable, and that each neuron has 1000 connections, then ... there's some math to be done there, but I'm pretty sure the answer is that it's always going to be prohibitively expensive to just try to simulate a specific human brain by brute force.

If someone wants to know my opinion on custard, they're going to have to ask me, dammit.

Edit: The naive math is just 100,000,000,000^{1,000} which is the same as 1 Ã— 10^{11000} but obviously there are going to be some brain configurations that aren't valid, and some that are so close as to be functionally identical. Still, there are only 1 x 10^{80} atoms in the universe, so ...
