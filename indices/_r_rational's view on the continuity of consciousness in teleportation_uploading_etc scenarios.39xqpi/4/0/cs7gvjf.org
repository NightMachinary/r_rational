I think the only goal in the future is that there would be no personal motivation, at the end of the day I can't see another way to stop such a thing as the power of personal computing grows if it ever reaches a point where people can simulate other people you've already lost that battle. Whether it ends up being you simulated or a random person someone is going to be under the control of someone else.
