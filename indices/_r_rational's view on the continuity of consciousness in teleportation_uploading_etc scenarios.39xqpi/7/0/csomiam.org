  if I'm going to be copied, and one of the copies will then be killed, shouldn't I anticipate a 50% chance of dying?

No, you should anticipate a near 0% chance of dying, barring malfunction of the machine. Mario doesn't really /die/ when he falls off a cliff, he has extra lives to keep going. You should anticipate a 100% chance of losing an extra life. You should view this as a death-warp to a desired destination, with a 1up placed nearby to the source.

If the death isn't painless or instant though, that does change matters significantly.
