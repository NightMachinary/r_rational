My instinct is that it's fine - and, in practice, I predict that I and most other people would do it - but ...

Here's the thing. AFAICT, the right way to deal with being copied is to view /both/ copies as "really you"; if you're going to be copied, and one of the copies will be given a cookie, you should anticipate a 50% chance of receiving a cookie. (We can kinda-sorta empirically test this via the Sleeping Beauty problem.)

Which means ... if I'm going to be copied, and one of the copies will then be /killed/, shouldn't I anticipate a 50% chance of dying?

That's clearly true in the case of one copy being killed by Unnecessarily Painful Slow Death Rays. But is it true if they're killed instantly? Apparently, from a quantum mechanics standpoint, that question is incoherent (which seems intuitive to me; I don't worry that having the atoms in my body replaced over time will kill me, so I don't /seem/ to care about the atoms.)

If I've used this machine fifty times, and I know for a fact it kills me instantly in the process of scanning me, what should I anticipate going in for the 51st time?

I *remember* emerging seemlessly at the destination, but that would be /equally true/ if it killed me via Unnecessarily slow Painful Death Rays. So should I anticipate a 50% chance of everything going black, the same way I would anticipate a 50% chance of Unnecessarily Slow Painful Death if that was what would happen to me?

Again, I don't think this would stop me from doing it. But it would bother the heck out of me. Hell, it bothers me right now.
