I agree that those leaks aren't accidents, but I doubt that it's according to the celebrities' intent most of the time. Rather, celebrities determine that they can't do anything to stop it, especially as their publicists insist that being angry about it won't help.

The victims here are invariably women. Women being angry are assumed to be overreacting and bitchy. One episode of that can ruin a person's career, if that person is a public figure. And there's this impression that giving any response is just pandering to trolls, bringing more attention to something you'd rather hide -- Streisand effect bait.

So a few people capitalize on it because it's that or abandon their public career, and most try to ignore it, and one or two speak out against it, typically to little effect.

Then people like you assume that, because some people have profited in the end from their partners deliberately distributing pornographic images of them without their consent, the majority of people in similar situations got their deliberately in order to increase their fame.

It reminds me of the parable in the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/][Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided]] article, just one step further removed. It's implausible that a person would deserve having images of her having sex in private distributed without her permission, but the victim must somehow have gotten what she deserved, so people come up with a story that she actually chose to send them around. And once that story makes the rounds, other people have it as a cached thought that they can apply to situations that look similar.
