I think that the book "The Golden Age" handled this relatively well. And lightly bridges a concept I have been thinking about. In the book each person has a prime with seconds, thirds etcetera which are copies of the prime. Seconds are effectively you and hold a trusted position but do not technically share your property rights. Although you are expected/required to support your clones.

My belief is that the concept of person that we use today is a special case due to the nature of human physiology. Continuity of consciousness is considered important because humans see it as the de facto standard when in fact we really only have the appearance of continuity as it is.

I think a hydra is a good representation of what the timelines of consciousness in a transhumance are like or something like git if you are familiar with version control. Where there are multiple conscious branches of each person which can merge back together and believe that merging back together is a normal behavior. If you wanted to visit another solar system you could send a radio message of you mind to Alpha Centauri, have that "clone" of yourself adventure there and when he got bored he would "push" the changes that occurred in his mind back to the original head. Then the clone in alpha centauri could chose to shut himself down or continue on in alpha centauri while pushing updates back home periodically. On Earth you would send a radio message to alpha centauri and several years later get a message back with your adventures. The original mind would then look over the memories and evaluate the evolution in the clone's belief system and keep whatever it wanted.

My answer is that both the original and the clone are "me". A person is not an unbroken stream of consciousness but a collection of memories, choices, and beliefs colored by its choice of operating system or means of embodiment.

I have been thinking on this for a while, and thoughts on it would be useful to expand my thinking.
