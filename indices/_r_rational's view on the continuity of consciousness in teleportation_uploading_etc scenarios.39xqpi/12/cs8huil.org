What experiments can falsify different theories of continuity of identity?

Oh, you think this is "pure" philosophy? No, there's a cognitive structure implementing the measure-predicate that returns the extent to which any possible rebuild, upload, teleport-output, or clone /is you/. You need to know what that predicate says, and how it can be correctly updated to deal with new ontological models in which more abstract, intuitive concepts don't appear.

DEAL WITH IT.
