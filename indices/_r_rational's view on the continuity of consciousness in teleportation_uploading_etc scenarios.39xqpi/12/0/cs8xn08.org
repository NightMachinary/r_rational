Agreed. I hate the very idea of the precautionary principle or suggesting anything similar, but the risks involved in this idea demand at least some actual science to happen first. Some actual supporting evidence instead of string-theory-esque hand-waving and nonempirical hypothesis stacking.

Current neuroscience as I understand it falls squarely in the "physical substrate and its operations is self" camp. Which makes this a suicide booth, regardless of any informational copying process, as that substrate is destroyed.
