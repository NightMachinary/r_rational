  Even if suicide is somewhat bad, you might still choose to sacrifice yourself so that your brain-uploaded version may live.

This is the techno-altruism trap. Accept it and the value of the individual to society becomes zero. Anything can be justified by saying the new task schedule and resource allotment will benefit from the sacrifice of the old order. It is the path to one of the darkest possible future digital hells.

If your answer to the question of what action is optimal returns *suicide*, you aren't rational. Despite whatever dark little thought games internet intellectual tough-guys play to prove how altruistic and sexable they are, reality has no exceptions. Death is the loss of everything someone is and has been. Anything else is a comforting lie people tell themselves, one that isn't supported by science and objective reality. Having another copy */at the cost of the original/ only matters to the most selfish and solipsistic.
