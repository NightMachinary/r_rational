I was somewhat offended by your description of your opponents' thinking as "whatever dark little thought games internet intellectual tough-guys play". I have no problem with offensive language or offensive debates, so I took your lack of decorum as an indication that you have no problem with roughhousing. I am sorry I assumed you wouldn't be a hypocrite.

  It was made as a technique to shut-up whiny internet rationalist kids and their terribly unlikely theories.

Correct. I'm sorry you're not a kid anymore but still behaving like that, but eh, maybe you're tired or something.

  No one told them that, and some people seriously used it later on, but it was always consensual when used that way,

Are you implying you are unable to consent?

When I posted the bet I saw four main possibilities, in decreasing order of preference:

1. You accept the deal, MIRI gets $10k or $100k, you learn a hard lesson in humility, and there's a 0.00001% greater chance humanity isn't killed by unfriendly AI.

2. You acknowledge that you're being overly confident when saying "suicide is irrational, no exceptions", and we can continue the discussion while you have been prompted to find arguments against your own theories.

3. You accept the deal, but chicken out. I win status, and a fraud gets exposed.

4. You demonstrate irrationality by claiming certainty while simultaneously refusing a bet which would have a serious profit margin if you were as certain as you say or even think you are.
