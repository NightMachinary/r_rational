  This is the techno-altruism trap. Accept it and the value of the individual to society becomes zero. Anything can be justified by saying the new task schedule and resource allotment will benefit from the sacrifice of the old order. It is the path to one of the darkest possible future digital hells.

You're mixing the factual question of /whether/ the individual continues (and in what form they might /prefer/ to continue or not, based on their full-information, full-rationality volition) with the moral question of whether we should sacrifice individuals for some greater good that somehow doesn't contain that person.

I'm uncertain about the first question, pending additional evidence, but return a strong "FUCK NO" on the second one.
