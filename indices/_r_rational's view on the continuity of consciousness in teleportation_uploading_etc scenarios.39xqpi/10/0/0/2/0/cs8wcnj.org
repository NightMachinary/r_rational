You can have your own preferences as to the morality of sacrificing instances of individual intelligences for efficiency's sake, but it has been shown time and again that when the individual is expected to sacrifice a certain way in a private decisions, society at large quickly makes that choice mandatory to weed out defectors attempting to play hawk games with those personal costs. Complete loss of social standing and ostracization is the typically the lightest punishment for such infractions.

Continuity of physical substrate and the issue of individual identity is linked to this issue: if it is assumed individuals are nothing but informational resources, perfect copies are going to be just as good as originals and likely much better in many ways. Any optimizing social order will have members demanding specific horrific results because of that meme.
