  We do not routinely ask individuals to extinguish themselves entirely under almost all circumstances.

True. But the western world and culture is less than a hundred years old, in current form. We're just getting to the point where resources get scarce and outside threats become scary enough to drive change. Sacrifices of lesser levels are still demanded by society for children and family, for ideologies, for religion. These are mostly of time and money, the level at which most civilians face risk nowadays. Religious ideas of sacrifice still permiate, with the idea of giving up life for the greater good just under the surface of popular culture even in secular nations.

Almost all empires have had ritual self-sacrifice in non-wartime situations. Several Chinese empires, Indo-European ones, several iterations of Roman ones, Native American unions, South American federations. All demanded intense personal sacrifices to improve the state of society in various ways, from elders walking into the wilderness in times of starvation, to ritual blood sacrifices, to suicides to prevent political retaliation on entire bloodlines (which seldom actually were honored or voluntary in any way). I don't see those social pressures and traditions as having been countered by any widespread post-enlightenment cultural movements. If anything, nationalism has made it worse.

So if society doesn't see it as extinguishing a life, and only moving information, voices against this sort of thing will be shouted down or at best intentionally misunderstood and ignored. It isn't like they're killing anyone, right?

  What sort of social order has started out by disregarding the volition of its own members?
#+end_quote

Every government ever. Even "pure" democracies limited the voting right to part of their group of individuals they claimed power over, and more modern ones reduce the volition of the individual and their direct effect on government policy to make sure society runs smoothly and panics don't cause huge swings in direction.

This murder-copying would be a demand on the level of mandatory school vaccinations, from the point of view of someone looking at self as information only. Not that vaccinations aren't a good thing, obviously.
