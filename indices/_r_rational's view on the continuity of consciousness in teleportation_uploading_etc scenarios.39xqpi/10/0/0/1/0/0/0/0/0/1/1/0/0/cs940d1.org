  Macro effects cannot have properties that are irreducible to micro effects.
#+end_quote

Irrelevant. You were trying to argue the other way, which is scientifically proven not to work. Some macro level quantum effects can be measured, but that has nothing to do with this wild over reaching. Quantum hand-waving and logical misapprehensions won't save your bad epistemology.

#+begin_quote
  If particles cannot have history, people cannot have history in a physical sense.
#+end_quote

This does not follow. Please return to reality, where macro-level causes have macro-level effects than can be measured, studied, and predicted.

#+begin_quote
  the existence of certain quantum effects demonstrates that it is physically impossible that particle history has relevance at all.
#+end_quote

Prove this outrageous claim exists in any way on a macro level. If this is what your opinion hinges on, I think I see the problem. A bad case of quantum magical thinking.
