  I think a unsurprisingly small number of strong proponents of information-as-self would actually walk into the 24-Hour FedEx/Suicide Kinkos were it to appear tomorrow.

That depends entirely on how it is marketed. A significant number of people have /already/ expressed a desire to perform exactly the act you describe /right now/, when no such thing is actually possible. In fact, some of them have expressed the desire to do it /yesterday/. You might claim that they're saying something in Far Mode they won't support in Near Mode, but again, Near Mode can be subjected to various forms of persuasion, most of which are not even threats and a good many of which are pleasant enticements.

To steal from an LW post, sure, you can say that the simulated tropical paradise is /false/, that it will happen to /some other person/ in a morally important way, and that it's all really just suicide, but as long as it's /marketed/ as "Tropical paradise! Sea breeze! Lemonade! Sunshine!", there will be significant buy-in. And of course, by your own hypothetical, the remnant-successors of the victims won't actually be able to tell it didn't work. Those remnant-successors won't be the same person, but they /will/ remember the original person, and they /will/ be enjoying the beach.

Of course, this is what makes the whole thing troublesome: how would you be able to test whether some concept of personal identity is preserved /without/ resorting to philosophical intuition and argument, and /without/ killing yourself just to see if you wind up dead?

To which I would say: I'd be cautious of trying it /without/ such a test, but I'd be suspicious of someone who refused to accept a test that showed it did work. The thing to do with a question is turn it into hypotheses, and the thing to do with hypotheses is to test them.
