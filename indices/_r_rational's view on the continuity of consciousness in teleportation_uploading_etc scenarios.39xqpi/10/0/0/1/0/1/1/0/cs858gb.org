Heh. First of all, thanks for your coherent and reasonable response. I don't encounter that nearly often enough.

I think that the biggest issue is that we have differing value systems. You care pretty heavily about your personal stream of consciousness (or so it seems-- I apologize if I've misunderstood), whereas I... don't. People in general, /including/ myself, only have instrumental value in my system.

If I were trying to signal then I'd be doing a pretty bad job, because my value system isn't very pretty. It could justify, for example, creating a world with all of the horrible things that we are so familiar with here. Happiness is as instrumental as sadness, and at the end of the day the only reason that happiness generally wins out is too many dolors, or a lack of sufficient hedons, or a bad ratio of dolors to hedons, can break people, and broken people aren't very useful.

None of that is likely to win me boning points, even if I cared about those to begin with.

Isn't rationality dependent on what your goals are to begin with?

  Suicide is not a calm and collected "because my mind baby will be so awesome" situation for a sane and rational person.

I'm not so sure. Granted, if the situation didn't require a death on this end of the line, then I'd probably be cool with there being one of me on this end of the line and one of me on the other. If teleportation did require it, though, then I won't mind much or at all (I admit that it'll be probably weird the first few times).

But if, for some reason, teleportation requires that there be only one of me at the end, then I don't really care that much about the continuity.

  How is this possible? How could you be sure your mind and informational situation were this sound?

Killing myself for the purpose of donating my organs to particular people whose combined usefulness is, I believe, greater than my own. It's an unlikely example, but I think that it's able to exist in the same universe as the classic trolley problem, and the point is to illustrate that my own existence is of finite value.

  Your very ability to form maps is likely compromised, and the terrain is probably not, in fact, full of snakes, but harmless bunnies.

This is a great sentence.
