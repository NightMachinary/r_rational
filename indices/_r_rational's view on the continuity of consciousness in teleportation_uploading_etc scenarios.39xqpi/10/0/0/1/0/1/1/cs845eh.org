  Can't we be okay with suicide, but not okay with murder?

Absolutely not. Never, ever. It is a right everyone ought to have in a free society, even permanently insane people (or, sadly, especially), but it isn't rational. Ever.

You can never have enough information to prove your decision is correct given the result of self-termination. Such goals are pretty much definitionally not rational and indicative of a major cognitive error.

  if you judge self-sacrifice to be a worthwhile action, then by all means go for it.

If this happens, you are almost certainly necessarily already under such incredible psychological duress that you can't be considered sane. Either pain, the threat of such, or a fate you for some reason believe is worse than death is occurring.

Sure, maybe you want to give your life as a sacrifice to aid others, but that is a maximum danger last resort; pulling the lever to cause the train to hit you and not ten other people. Suicide is not a calm and collected "because my mind baby will be so awesome" situation for a sane and rational person.

  because that'd be a very surprising piece of information, but after had done sufficient work in confirming it, then yeah, I would off myself.

How is this possible? How could you be sure your mind and informational situation were this sound? If you are surprised enough to suddenly consider this, you're already doing something wrong. You were surprised because you didn't have a sufficiently informed or detailed map of reality. Your very ability to form maps is likely compromised, and the terrain is probably not, in fact, full of snakes, but harmless bunnies.

Not suiciding because of sudden revelations, even ones long considered after that realization, should be a basic no-brainer rational pre-decision. The numbers to make this rational in the real world would require such tortured, selfishly self-destructive goals as to make the entire thing a complete mess from the get-go.

This isn't a social competition to see who can say the most self-sacrificing thing to better attract a mate. This is a rational discussion between people who aren't friends and won't ever bone. Don't drag in those showy signaling affects, please. I'm fucking tired of that. Please consider what you're saying carefully and logically. And get off my lawn, intellectually speaking.
