Wouldn't that, say, be a rule against being a firefighter, since you would then be accepting a certain chance of death for the sake of some cause which you think is more important?

The difference between being a firefighter and jumping off a cliff is in the probability that you will die at any particular point in time, so of course you'd want a substantially higher payout from a 100% chance of death than from a much smaller chance of death. You're still putting your life up on the table though.

(I am heartened by your ALLCAPS, though)
