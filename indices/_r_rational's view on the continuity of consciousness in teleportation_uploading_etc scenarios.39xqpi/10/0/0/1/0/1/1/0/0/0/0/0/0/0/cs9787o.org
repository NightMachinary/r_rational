Hm. I feel like minds would be, (figurative) pound for (figurative) pound, more complex than the same matter arranged in another combination. Short of being able to definitively calculate the complexity of this, that, and every other thing, though, it might be safer to tie the complexity to conscious minds and look to increase the complexity of those minds and of their experiences.
