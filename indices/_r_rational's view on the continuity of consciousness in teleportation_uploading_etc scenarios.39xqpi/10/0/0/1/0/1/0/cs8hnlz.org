  I don't think that the same rule is necessary for "Never kill yourself, even when it seems to produce a net benefit." Barring cases of psychological disorder, we already have a pretty hard psychological injunction against that, and so (again, barring cases of extreme depression, &c) if you judge self-sacrifice to be a worthwhile action, then by all means go for it.

CASES OF EXTREME DEPRESSION ARE NOT THAT RARE. MAKE THIS RULE OR ELSE.
