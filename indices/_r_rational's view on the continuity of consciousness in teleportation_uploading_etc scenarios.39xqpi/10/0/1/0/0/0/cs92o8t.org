  "how much of my /natural/ lifespan as my /original/ self have I exhausted."
#+end_quote

What does the natural state of affairs have to do with anything?

#+begin_quote
  The second one can live quite long, but if we assume that I just am the first one, then I should care about my lifespan as the original, not out of any lack of "altruism" towards the next version, but precisely because if the two are separate individuals, then they're ethically equal and the one who's already vastly better-off should accept a trade-off to help the worse-off.

I agree with (my interpretation of) everything up to "ethically equal". I don't see where the second conclusion comes from. Since the two are ethically equal, second per second, there is a trillion-to-one preference for uploading, which manages to get a trillion times as many seconds out of the same amount of resources.
