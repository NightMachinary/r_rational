We could say that our nearest simian ancestor is 99.99999999% identical to us (or pick any relative who shares your DNA who isn't actually you.) My point is that there's an illusion of precision that I wouldn't risk. That 0.000000001% difference as it turns out, IS ME.

Just because I'm thinking about a thought experiment's flaw in defining it "perfectly" and "100%" doesn't mean I'm not willing to engage in it.

I mean, it'd be fun to teleport, but if the mechanism involved a computer scanning me and them disintegrating a version of me, I wouldn't do it. No matter how small the error bars may be, it's not worth it... in a mundane scenario. If the Earth were exploding and it's the only method of escape and everyone is using it and it's been observed by me to be safe, then I won't be an old die-hard about the risks.

[edit:] after some more consideration, I realized that we are disputing definitions. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/np/disputing_definitions/]] I'm pushing back against the simplistic nature of the thought experiment and breaking it down into some of the practical components that CS/EE majors may not realize about how our wetware differs from the circuitry of certainty. You're asking if I had an exact clone of myself, would that be me. Indisputably, yes. I recognize how our fundamental building blocks of mass and energy are just orderly patterns that "magically" could be duplicated and teleported and I would be both versions of me in two different places. I do study the pathology of people for a living, so forgive me if I just expect such a device no matter how well-intentioned, to go horribly wrong in real life. (But who knows, we used to think that humans couldn't live in space or fly too high in the sky because science!danger! And that must be a bias of mine, to assume risks where they may not exist.)
