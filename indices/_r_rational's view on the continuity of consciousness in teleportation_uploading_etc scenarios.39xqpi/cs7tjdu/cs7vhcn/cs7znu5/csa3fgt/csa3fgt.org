I don't know about our ancestors but if you're talking about bonobo the number is 98.7%, which means you'd be off by a factor of 1.3 billion. That is very very wrong. 0.000000001% /actually ain't shit/ on the scales of the genome or the brain. Although I imagine you could do a fair bit of damage if you were able to change 6 specific codons in the human genome, 6 random ones? Really? You think that would do something?
