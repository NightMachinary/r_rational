  I do study the pathology of people for a living, so forgive me if I just expect such a device no matter how well-intentioned, to go horribly wrong in real life. (But who knows, we used to think that humans couldn't live in space or fly too high in the sky because science!danger! And that must be a bias of mine, to assume risks where they may not exist.)

Essentially, before operating a teleporter, we should do mice experiments or something to figure out what the risks are, and where we can put the safety rails to minimize them.
