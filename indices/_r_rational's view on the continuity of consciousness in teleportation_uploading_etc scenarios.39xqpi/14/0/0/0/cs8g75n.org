Is the 99.99999999% figure being applied to the entire physical system (including bones, blood, muscles, fat, digestive system, etc) or to the brain (the only bit I personally care about for the purposes of this discussion?) Because, unless I'm mistaken, the brain contains 100 billion neurons and 99.99999999% of 100 billion is 10. I can't find the numbers but I'd be willing to bet that's fewer than is lost in the average concussion. That being the case, I'd be far more comfortable with an upload of six sigma fidelity than a baseball bat to the head.
