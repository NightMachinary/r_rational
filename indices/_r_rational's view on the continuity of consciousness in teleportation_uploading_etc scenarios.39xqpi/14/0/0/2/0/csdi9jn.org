I made up a number to make a point and maybe I should've been more precise in keeping it on at least a micro or nano level rather than a pico/femto level of precision. If we consider "6 changes" to the genome in each cell in our body as well as disruption/displacement of our microtubules, microfilaments, DNA strands... as well as other connective tissues... then yes, six random changes per cell in my body amount to significant amounts of changes.

If we equate it with milliREM, I would tolerate a transporter machine that equates to levels similar to background radiation or an airplane trip around the world. Much more than that would expose me to too much stochastic risk.
