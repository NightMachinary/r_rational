I'm speaking as someone who is in the medical field and has studied neurology to the point where I can discuss the most common pathways and teach medical students.

There's a HUGE difference between 99.99999999999999% you and 100% you. That 10^{-Xth} difference may be all it takes between being you and someone who is depressed, or psychotic, or in chronic pain, or anything else that we consider to be purely mental.

We can't make a machine, label it 100% perfect, and expect flawless continuity.

Most likely, the first people who are teleported will have a stroke because you can't build organic structures that have grown with time the same way you'd program a 3D printer to try and replicate it, layer by layer.

Even if you get the physical structure correct, with all of the neurons in the correct locations, how are you going to replicate the exact same electrochemical gradient and internal packaging of neurotransmitters? The wrong number of sodium-potassium pumps or calcium channels will render dendrites ineffective and others will be reinforced instead, altering the delicate patterns of thought-stands we have woven.

Even if we get that right, how will we "know" that our "knowing" is true? Devastating neurological disorders can be accompanied with the brain's inability to notice that anything is wrong. Any attempts to convince them otherwise just increases agitation and fixation on the wrong idea. Examples: read about hemineglect in stroke patients, delusions for psychotic patients, confabulation for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in alcoholics.
