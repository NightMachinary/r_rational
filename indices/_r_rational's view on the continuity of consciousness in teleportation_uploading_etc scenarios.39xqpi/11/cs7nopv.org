To some extent it depends on your preferences. You are 100% totally allowed to prefer universes in which the pattern-that-is-you stays in the same physical format all the time.

It's interesting that this preference is only possible for people who care about the entire course a universe takes, rather than just snapshots in time - if you only care about the state of the universe at each given time, then it no longer makes sense to talk about an "original." But humans are not known for having simple desires.

I think the "what do you do if you're left behind" question is pretty trivial - just do what you would do anyhow. Like, eat a sandwich or something, and then go talk to friends or family. I'm a little worried about duplication on consequentialist grounds - I don't expect it to be a big benefit for me (not me now, nor either of future me), and it takes up resources and makes things a bit more complicated.
