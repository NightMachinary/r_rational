One condition: The subatomitizational-mushimizer must be instant and painless, or the iteration of myself being mushed must be otherwise rendered free of consciousness before being destroyed. I won't abide by any iterations of myself (or anyone else for that matter) suffering intense mortal pain from the simple use of public transport, no matter how much the next iteration of myself won't know about it.

That condition given? Sure.
