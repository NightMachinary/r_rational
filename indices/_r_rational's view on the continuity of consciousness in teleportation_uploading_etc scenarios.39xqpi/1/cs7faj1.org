Yeah, I think the pro-transhuman crowd will go for "the teleport clone is still the same person". It's almost a prerequisite for talking about immortality or enhanced intelligence or human life outside the narrow range of temperatures and pressures we evolved in. Or any other cool sci-fi ideas like that. (For comparison's sake, you should ask this question on [[/r/scifi]] and see how they like the idea.)

Uploads open a /massive/ can of worms that AIs or teleportation individually do not. For example, small errors in the upload's brain chemistry - due to imperfections in the simulation - might change a person's mind enough that I would no longer consider them the same person.

Copies are cool. I think I could get on quite well with my doppelg√§nger. We'd consider it rude to ask which of us is the real one.
