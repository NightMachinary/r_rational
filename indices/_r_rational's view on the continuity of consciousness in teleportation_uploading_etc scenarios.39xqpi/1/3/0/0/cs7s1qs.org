First, you suggest serial, single neuron brain damage plus functional repair and replacement on brain-functional time scales. Remember, in this model new takes over old by continuing to function in the same way, not by simply having the same state as when replacement occurred.

The way this one goes is, it can't be death of personal identity because that level of die-off happens all the time. The brain naturally reroutes and uses redundancies and broad activation networks to fix this issue all the time. Repeating the process shouldn't be any different.

Damage is done. Very minor. It is instantly repaired, faster than any cognitive process could notice. Faster than the brain naturally functions. Matter and energy from the original is replaced. Maybe it is perfect, continuing one electrical beat to the next, with chemical decays already mapped out. Maybe a single signal state is lost. Maybe a dozen. That's fine, as far as it goes. We know small losses and activation issues happen all the time. For consciousness, personal identity in this sense, to mean anything at all, death of self can't be constantly occurring at this scale. That's logical.

Then you're saying, why not take all that brain damage really fast, with no time to electrochemically integrate old with new over time. Replace it all perfectly, but don't give the old time to send a single signal state to the new. That's where the problem with the model lies.

*The replacements are still brain damage.*

There is no time for integration of new parts into the original neural network. There is *damage* and then *repair* in the "slow replacement" model. That's not happening in the faster model. It can't happen in the fast model. It happens faster than the brain works.

That isn't just an emotional factor, which is what that flawed argument is attempting to ferret out. Yes, I've seen this one before, and it doesn't hold up. You are reducing the personal identity to a single moment in time, not a continuing process. You are removing matter and energy and replacing it and asking why it isn't the same, without thinking about what that means for the system.

Yes, the new brain would function the same afterward in the fast model, but it wouldn't be the same person because it did happen so fast. You'd have killed the original process-substrate and replaced it with another, not done a sub-natural-brain-damage level replacement over time.

That's the point of continuous process being identity. If you replace the brain faster than the brain functions, by necessity you'll be doing so with new chemical states (simulated or otherwise) and electrical charges from outside the original brain structure in addition to new matter.

If that is all we are, matter and energy, replacing both all at once faster than natural repair, rerouting, and signaling happens already means, by physical necessity, the death of the original structure. There was no processing being continued from old matter and energy to new. You're just pumping the old blood around a clone brain, with no continuing physical process in common with the original.

Just because I don't have a rate at which neuronal replacement would be acceptable and not murdering someone doesn't mean it can't be worked out. I'd suggest starting at something less than levels similar to brain damage which causes measurable cognitive malfunctions, but faster than background loss. That will only slightly kill someone over and over again, and very slowly replace the damage with functional bits that will be used by the much larger originals as a continuing process.
