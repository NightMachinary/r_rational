Cite some neuroscience on brain damage, information theory on complex systems changing over time, theoretical physics on matter state duplication, even a logical argument showing a likely scenario. Not a bunch of "I feel" and "what's the harm" when it comes to destroying a human brain. Otherwise, cute ideas lose out to known proven scientific models.
