  Then you have a lot of proving to do. The current scientific model is that the matter thinking of itself is your brain, not the pattern that matter makes.

And what "scientific model" is that?

Of course my brain is made of matter, there's nothing else it could be. But my brain doesn't think of itself. When I introspect, I don't think "Hmm, neuron #65336 is a little slow today" or "I don't like these atoms I'm made of, I should get some new ones". I think "I'm feeling sad lately" or "I'm not thinking enough about my friends". My /thoughts/ are self-referential and self-aware. My brain is not, except where it's a substrate for my thoughts.

Sleep interrupts your conscious awareness, but you don't consider that to be death. The atoms of your brain are replaced every few weeks, but you don't consider that to be a slow death. How convenient for you that evolution should have created a form of life that naturally dies only once! Does it provide some sort of reproductive advantage?

Why exactly is being killed-and-recreated a bad thing, anyway? Death is bad because of the loss of memories, because it makes your loved ones sad, because you might have benefited society if you were still alive, and other reasons like that... but if there's a near-identical copy of you, then none of those reasons apply any more. We are always being replaced by our future selves. If that's death, I've died (12 hours)/(Planck Time) times so far today.
