There is no software that is unexpressed in hardware states. Thinking otherwise is magical thinking at worst, and misapplication of complex math models at best. It is the process of your brain as a whole system that results in a sense of self. That is why thinking pure informational context equal to the original hardware system in identity is ignorant.
