What do you mean, "prove"? It's not a matter of checking what reality is, it's a matter of deciding what labels we want to apply to what.\\
Based on a pretty precise idea of what reality could be, I'm saying that I feel that this is different enough from our previous concept of death that many of our ideas and feelings about death don't apply any more. I really don't see what one could "prove" to change the other's position.
