It's usually associated with sleep because sleep is a normal part of most people's lives, and because it's actually a very good example.

Your sense of self is based around physical continuity? That's strange. Continuity can behave very counter-intuitively in extreme situations - many functions that can seem continuous are not, and vice-versa.

Suppose I replaced each of your neurons with a synthetic one that acts identically. One by one, over the course of hours or days, until your brain is entirely synthetic. That would be a continuous change, wouldn't it? But doing the same thing instantaneously is discontinuous. Now, what if the process takes a nanosecond? That's continuous again. But surely lightspeed delays make it impossible for me to scan and copy your entire brain in less than a nanosecond? How do you know a discontinuity is even something that can physically exist?
