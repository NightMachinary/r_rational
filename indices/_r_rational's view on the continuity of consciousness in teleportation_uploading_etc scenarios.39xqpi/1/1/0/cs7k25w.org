I think that "same person" tries to condense a real number into a boolean value. It glosses over a spectrum in search of a yes or a no. I'm 99.999% the same as I was yesterday. I'd be nearly as happy with my present self being replaced by that self as I would if I survived. I'm so different from myself twenty years ago that I would be indifferent as to whether I died or simply regressed twenty years.

Similarly, there are potentially versions of uploading that would result in a me that is similar enough to me today that I would prefer uploading now rather than risking death. There are potentially other versions where I'd rather wait and see if they improve them a bit.

But the means of change are important, too. I am generally happier with changes, even ones that aren't an improvement, that are a result of my experiences.
