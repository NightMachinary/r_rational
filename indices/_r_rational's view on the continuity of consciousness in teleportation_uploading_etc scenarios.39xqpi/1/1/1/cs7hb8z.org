Sorry, I misspoke. I don't mind becoming a different person, I'd just like to become a /better/ person. Since I was 10, I've learned skills and gained experiences which I wouldn't take that back if I had the option.

Also I've been through adolescence with all the brain chemistry changes that implies, but that's a normal and well-understood part of life. When I was 10 I /wanted/ to become an adult, even if I didn't really understand what it meant. I'd seen other adults and I wanted to do the things they did.

So, there are some changes I would make to my brain, and some I wouldn't. I don't ever drink myself into unconsciousness. I don't want to be hit in the head or otherwise brain-damaged. If there's a way to prevent Alzheimer's disease I'll take it. And uploading would be a much more faster and more complete change than any of those. Maybe after the long-term consequences had been studied in real-world situations for a long time, after I'd met other people before and after uploading and knew what changes to expect...

... I'm rambling, of course we know this is all science fiction and I'll never have to make the choice anyway.
