Communicate with care. Your statement was:

#+begin_quote
  celebrities have their sex tapes come out on "accident"
#+end_quote

Without any qualifiers, this is a generalization or a universal statement. If you don't want to add to the sexist misconception that all or the majority of "leaked" sex tapes are distributed on purpose by the celebrity, the /very/ least you should do is make it hypothetical or provide a qualifier.

That's not nearly enough to avoid promoting that misconception, but it does signal that you've spent half a second trying not to appear sexist.
