Fair enough; to me, it's not a universal, because it's like saying, "in the same way that people get hit by cars 'on accident' as part of an insurance scam". That doesn't imply (to me) that /all/ people who get hit by cars are doing it as part of an insurance scam, or that this is always (or even mostly) how people get hit by cars.

If what I meant wasn't clear from context though, that's on me. I'll offer a clarifying edit.
