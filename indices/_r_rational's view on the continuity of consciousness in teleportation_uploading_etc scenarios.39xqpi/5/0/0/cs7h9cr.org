Maybe not simulated torture for that long, but there are all the standard motivations:

- Theft. You have a copy of a person, you can probably extract their accounts and passwords, and take all their money (as well as use their credit).
- Retribution. You were arguing with someone online, and they were a dick to you, well now you can get a physical revenge.
- Obsession. Emma Watson can be your sex slave. You can run your fan theories by Brandon Sanderson. You can get your copy of Stephen King to write a book for you that no one else will ever see. Sure, they might not like it, but they'll come around, eventually. Or else.
- Lulz. Whenever I think about a technology, I think about what 4chan would do with it. In this case, probably finding ever-more-creative ways to inflict humiliation/pain/etc. on people whose security has been breached.
