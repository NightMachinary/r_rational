  No matter which route you prefer, the answer is clear: personal identity and continuity of consciousness are evolutionarily-helpful features of the map that have no concrete basis in the territory! A soufflé isn't a soufflé; a soufflé is a recipe - you!cryoniced, you!teleported, you!uploaded, you!positive-spin-branch, and you!negative-spin-branch are all just as "you" as you!tomorrow-morning or you!five-minutes-ago! No death involved!

Oh no. It gets worse. When you get right down to it, the particular recipe for personal identity that /matters/ is a matter of your own /preferences/. It's really all about which potential future versions of me I /want/ to be, which is actually /more/ interesting and disturbing: the highest-value potential future me's might be quite substantially different from present!me.

But there's also the psychology corner: personal identity = moral character/alignment, which is where our intuitive notion of identity actually seems to cash out in experiments.

Anyway, you win the contest! Pick your +poison+ prize!
