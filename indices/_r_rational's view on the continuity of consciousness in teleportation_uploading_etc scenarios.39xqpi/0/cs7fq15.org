In the philosophy corner ... [[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1][*EXISTENTIAL COMICSS* with a short but explanatory cartoooon!!!]]

In the science corner ... [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/r9/quantum_mechanics_and_personal_identity/][*EEEEEEEELIEZER YUDKOWSKY* with a super-long quantum essay series!!!!!]]

In the fantasy corner ... [[http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Souffl%C3%A9][*STEVEN MOFFATTTT* with a shitty, unjustified, one-sentence explantion!!!!!!!]]

No matter which route you prefer, *the answer is clear*: personal identity and continuity of consciousness are evolutionarily-helpful features of the map that have no concrete basis in the territory! A soufflé isn't a soufflé; a soufflé is a recipe - you/!cryoniced/, you/!teleported/, you/!uploaded/, you/!positive-spin-branch/, and you/!negative-spin-branch/ are all just as *"you"* as you/!tomorrow-morning/ or you/!five-minutes-ago/! No death involved!
