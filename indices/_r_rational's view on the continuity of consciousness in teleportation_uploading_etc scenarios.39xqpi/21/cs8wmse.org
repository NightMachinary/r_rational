If the universe is infinitely large, I'm guessing there's probably infinite 100% identical copies of me out there, although they'd almost certainly be very VERY far away. Does that mean I'm okay with dying as long as one of those copies survives?

HELL NO.

Am I okay with a form of teleportation in which a computer scans me, utterly annihilates me, then sends the 100% identical-to-me scan of me somewhere else to be replicated back into real life?

HELL NO, for exactly the same reason.
