  Does 'your masters' refer to the agency or to whoever gave them powers, I wonder?

I think it's more likely to refer to the CIA, or at least PALATINATE, than whatever entity might be responsible for the powers. If I remember right the only hint that there might even be a being behind the powers is a passage in Grace's chapter*, while even a cursory look into the CIA's history reveals a lot of involvement in sketchy and unethical shit.

*"as Grace pushes further it will seem as though there is something rising up all around her, pressing in on her and lurking beside her, driving her into claustrophobic paranoia." (might just be a sensory deprivation-induced hallucination)
