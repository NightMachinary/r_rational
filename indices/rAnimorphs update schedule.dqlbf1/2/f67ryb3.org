It's weird, I still remember finding out about this fic when it had 5 chapters and thinking "Wow, this looks super promising. I hope it keeps updating" like it was a few months ago.

This is easily the greatest work ever written on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] by anyone who isn't Alexander Wales. Keep going, you're getting there!
