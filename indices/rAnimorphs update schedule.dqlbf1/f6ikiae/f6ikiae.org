I guess I can dump a few questions

I also assume nobody is in this thread unless they have read at least like half the chapters

- why did not v3 acquire elfangor
- is ax using the term "Mararauders map" (ch 32) intentional (maybe he has it from tom?)?
- can thoughtspeak be directed at a person you do not know where is or never met but you know by e.g. name or have a vague idea who is? see v3 and tobias -- I assume that was private and not broadcast. What about if that person is in morph?
