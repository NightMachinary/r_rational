So the catalyst of this is that Black has not entered a pattern of 3.

We as readers know that the bard remarked that the knight was attempt two, giving judgement a shot after contrition failed. William wasn't as much an attempt to take down Catherine, as he was about liberating callow.

So i think the reason he can't get his pattern of 3 is cause the knight is about to enter the story of Callow, the current city being merely a prologue. If the story subverts his expectations, its going to be by killing him sooner, not later.
