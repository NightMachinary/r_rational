I think Black's really good at seeing the patterns in the stories and following their conclusions. But, I think the Squire is sort of forging her own story, and Black may be assuming just a tiny bit too much of how that story goes. I just don't see Cat becoming the Black Knight, she'll transcend or subvert the story instead. I think she has to, to complete her arc. As part of this she /has/ to exceed Black's expectations in a way she has as yet been unable to do. By it's very nature, Black is unable to anticipate Squire transcending his story.
