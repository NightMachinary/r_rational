I liked this chapter; Black's cold and unemotional analysis is always interesting; but I came away with a feeling like he is overlooking something. But I can't quite figure out what.

Possibilities that spring to mind, in no particular order:

- Alaya isn't who she was years ago, and that makes me think he can't predict her behavior as well as he thinks he can. Black's assumptions on her reaction to Cat's actions may be flawed.

- The Calamities (plus Scribe, the OG Calami-Groupie) don't factor into his analysis at all for how they'll act when Cat takes Black's Name. Of them all, only Captain has any affection toward Cat. If the others don't know of Black's impending death or his plans, they may turn on her as the one responsible.

- Speaking of Captain, holy death flags, Batman! I wonder if Black knows that he's setting her up for a potential trap. Actually, I wonder if he /planned/ it.

- Why does Black give himself 1-2 years? Like, I get why he figures he has to die sooner than expected. But why, specifically, that time frame? Is it the expected time frame until Procer invades, and thus White needs to die before that happens so the war in the Free Cities can be over first?

- I think that Daoine might draw closer to Cat/Callow as a result of the far invasion and Diabolist. Black's plan for slaughtering 40% of the population (also, isn't the casual calculation of /that/ horrifying?) may actually be made irrelevant. Plus, wouldn't culling them open up problems with the Bloom?

- The 6 month deadline for Diabolist being defeated is sure to happen, but I'm curious what Black considers "minimal casualties"? Summer has already burned two entire cities, and I can't see a healthy future for Liesse or its abundance of refugees. I could kinda understand if Black just meant /military/ casualties, but considering his emphasis on the importance of Callowan farming earlier in the story, I think he may be miscalculating how screwed Callow is between the fae and Diabolist.

- Thinking Tyrant will act like Black expects him to is just begging for trouble.

- I wonder if Black is missing something about the nature of the White Knight or the relationship between them. White can tap into past White Knights' lives; what if that disrupts the pattern of 3? Black is /positive/ he's going to die within 2 years; and while I agree it's likely, his certainty also makes that assumption the most likely thing he's got wrong.

- Also, I think most readers would be surprised if Cat takes the mantle of Black Knight. That's the other assumption Black seems certain about. While it's a stretch, I wonder if Cat takes up the mantle of White Knight? And that's why no pattern is established with Black; because his pattern will be against Cat. Though I still see her more likely as a Grey Knight. Or... Queen of Blades (though this is obviously a long shot).
