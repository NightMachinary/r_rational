I, too, liked this chapter. Very much. We've never seen this much detailed exposition of Black's motives and process. Amazing list of how things may not be as Black sees them. I suspect your point about Alaya is correct but I'm also drawn to your point about the other calamities and your last point about Black's relationship with White.

I think the author has stated that Queen of Blades isn't a Role.
