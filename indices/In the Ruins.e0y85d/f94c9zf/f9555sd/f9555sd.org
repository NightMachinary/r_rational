On the one hand, I can understand /why/ he writes that. From a rational perspective, there's a lot of evidence that social media is doing a lot of harm to our collective mental and emotional health. This is just a sort of "darkest timeline" of how bad it could get, kind of like what's shown in the comic Two-Step.

On the other hand, yeah, it's super annoying to have an entire branch of communication technology dismissed as the cause of the end of intellectualism. Like, that's a /people/ problem, not a source-of-conversation problem. I'd kind of like to see a parallel to this story where social media is what's enabling the surviving rationalist scientists to work together and put up some resistance against the downfall of the educated world. That'd be cool, even if it had basically the same tropes and arc to it.
