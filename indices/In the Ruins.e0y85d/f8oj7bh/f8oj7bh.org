One of the main plot devices is one of my favorite etudes in physics, which is enough of an excuse for me to write my pet approach to this in a comment. Physics and math below.

The use of velocity space goes back to Maxwell and Hamilton (see "/hodograph"/ on Wikipedia). One can actually derive the elliptical/parabolic/hyperbolic nature of the orbits from circularity of velocity orbits (see "Feynman's lost lecture", as a book, as an audio, or in 3blue1brown version on youtube). I like the following proof of the circularity of the hodograph (which I call "velocity-orbit"): the rate of change of velocity vector is dv/dt=a, which by inverse square law is -C r_hat / R^2 for a constant C. To parametrize the velocity trajectory by arc-length (as one does to study geometry of a plane/space curve) one needs to use parameter whose time derivative is L/R^2 for a constant L. Amazingly, this is true for the angle from the sun -- conservation of angular momentum implies "constant area sweeping rate" (see below for details) which means (d theta/dt)R^2=L, so (d theta/dt)=L/R^2. Hence the arc-length parameter for velocity orbits is proportional to the angle to the sun; we can confirm this by computing dv/d theta=dv/dt dt/d theta = [-C r_hat / R^2][R^2/L]= K r_hat, which indeed has constant length. The arc length-proportional parameterization is the one best adapted for computing the curvature of this velocity-orbit, which is then proportional to

|d/d theta ( dv/d theta)|= |d/d theta ( K r_hat)=|(constant) theta_hat|=constant!

Thus velocity orbit has constant curvature -- so the velocity-orbit is a circle.

Further details about area sweeping rate in polar coordinates: The constant area sweeping rate is Kepler's 2nd law, which is true for any central force and follows from conservation of angular momentum r x v. Indeed (rxv)'=vxv+rxa=0+0=0, so angular momentum is conserved. I leave interpretation of both rxv AND (d theta/dt)r^2 as area sweeping rate to you, but derive (d theta/dt)R^2 =L. Indeed, in polar r(t)=R(t) r_hat(t) (here r(t) is a vector, R(t) is the length of r(t), and r_hat(t) is the unit radius vector as before). Differentiating this we have v(t)=R' r_hat+R r_hat'; taking x r we have vxr=R r_hat' x r=R (d theta /dt) theta_hat x R r_hat=R^2 (d theta /dt) k_hat, so L=|vx r|=R^2 (d theta /dt) is a constant, as we wanted.

PS On Kepler's orbits one should really read Givental: [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40598-015-0030-6]].
