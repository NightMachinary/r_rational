Oooohh, don't forget this is the nephew [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/10/10/interlude-queens-gambit-declined/comment-page-1/][he's forced to murder]].

  There were no shades to their perspectives, and while they might fondly tolerate them in one sworn to the Choir of Mercy that indulgence should never be confused for approval. The Grey Pilgrim had first understood this when he'd smothered his young nephew in his sleep, knowing the boy was charismatic enough to unite the Dominion and lead to war against Procer. He'd tried, first, to reason with him. To show him the pursuit of old grudges through blood could not redeem a single thing.

  The young never listened, he'd learned. And so old fools like him had to smooth out the sharp edges of Creation.

I'm also a little confused about the timeline, I think the prince he's rescuing is the Exiled Prince and he's rescuing them from our Tyrant (kairos) but I was under the impression that this vignette is from a a longish time ago and kairos has only been Tyrant for a few years? Pilgrim is in his 60 or 70s present day, right? Or is it the prior Tyrant and if so do we know anything about them?
