  The Grey Pilgrim was in Helike, helping a young prince flee his murderous father.

I don't know if the king of Helike is ALWAYS a Tyrant but Helike is where our tyrant is from and we know he's not the first of his name so it seems likely that the "king" is Tyrant of somesort.

  The Bellerophan's eyes sharpened with interest as he swallowed another mouthful of wine. The Tyrant's seizing of the throne of Helike had been one of the most unexpected diplomatic development of the last decade, in the Free Cities, but precious little was known about. A boy that had been by all reports a nonentity before the coup had in a single day taken control of the city and the army, killed the king in his own bed and purged his nephew's supporters brutally. The nephew in question had fled the city with most of the young nobility and his surviving loyalists, becoming the Exiled Prince in the process.

+[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/page/33/][This passage]] seems to line up with the story, but like I said, the timeline confuses me. You're right parsimony does suggest its just referring to the previous tyrant but it would mean the same story beat happened twice in Helike a not too many years apart.+

Edit: Nevermind I misread, clearly referring to the previous rulers of Helike and not at all mixed up with our current story. People try and kill princelings alot I guess.
