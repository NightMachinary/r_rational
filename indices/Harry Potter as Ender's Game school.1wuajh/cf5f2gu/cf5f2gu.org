This is a Fanfiction that I found yesterday. I don't know if anyone here has read it, and it's not too rationalist, but it seems that literature links are frowned upon now at [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]].

This story's premise is that Dumbledore died right before Voldemort went to take out Harry, and named Snape the new Headmaster. Snape has reformed the school into a battle academy pretty much.

It is a very interesting, and quite fun read IMO. I like how Hermione and Harry interact in this story, and the story does have many similarities to Ender's Game. The classes are different, like now there's Battle Class and Strategy, and they do many more duels, but also battles like in HPMOR, with teams or squads. The imaginings of those aren't as creative as in HPMOR, but they're still good. Snape and some unknown character have mysterious plotting talks like Graff and whoever did in Ender's Game.

It's also definitely not a straight port of Ender's Game into the Harry Potter universe.
