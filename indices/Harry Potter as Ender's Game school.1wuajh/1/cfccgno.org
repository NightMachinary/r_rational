I found it difficult to read. It could almost be a grimdark meta-fic of HPMOR. I think the most difficult part was the fact that the characters and situations were similar enough to HPMOR to remind me, but written worse. It's by no means awful, but it doesn't have the crowing moments of awesome that HPMOR had for me, and as mentioned, the battles aren't as imaginative.

If you're not enjoying it by chapter 10 or so, I would not recommend continuing. I didn't find that it improved much, but it didn't get any worse (up to ch 33).
