Thanks for posting this, I had no idea the third book came out. I remember reading the original when it was serialized on pointlesswasteoftime.com, way back in 2001. I think the first book suffers a bit from the serial format in a few places, but it's overall one that I really enjoyed, and while it may not quite be rational by the criteria as laid out by the sidebar, it's definitely fits my "thinky fiction" criteria, because it's got a lot of thought put into it.
