I consider the /John Dies at the End/ book series to be a modern day version of HP Lovecraft. The third book in the series came out yesterday which is why I'm posting this now. Here's the summary of the first book:

  STOP.

  You should not have touched this book with your bare hands.

  NO, don't put it down. It's too late.

  They're watching you.

  My name is David Wong. My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours.

  You may not want to know about the things you'll read on these pages, about the sauce, about Korrok, about the invasion, and the future. But it's too late. You touched the book. You're in the game. You're under the eye.

  The only defense is knowledge. You need to read this book, to the end. Even the part with the bratwurst. Why? You just have to trust me.

  The important thing is this:

  The drug is called Soy Sauce and it gives users a window into another dimension.

  John and I never had the chance to say no.

  You still do.

  Unfortunately for us, if you make the right choice, we'll have a much harder time explaining how to fight off the otherworldly invasion currently threatening to enslave humanity.

  I'm sorry to have involved you in this, I really am. But as you read about these terrible events and the very dark epoch the world is about to enter as a result, it is crucial you keep one thing in mind:

  None of this is was my fault.

It's not what I would call rationalist, but it's one of the rare books that actually manages to convey a sense of what I call /cosmic horror/ to its readers (which was not something I felt when reading HP Lovecraft's stories).

There's a good amount of humor through out the books, but in some odd way the humor actually heightens the horror due to its contrast. It's similar to how [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows_humor#Examples][gallows humor]] becomes incredibly funny when you are facing the hangman's noose.
