Shouldn't [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/50764-laundry-files][/the Laundry Files/]] be a closer comparison to HP Lovecraft? I liked the JDatE books too, but they're too... goofy for that comparison.

Regarding the David Wong series, thanks for the heads up on the third book. I remember liking both of the first two, although the second fine did feel somewhat lacklustre compared to the original.

p.s. For anyone who hasn't watched the movie that's based on the first book, it's a pretty decent watch --- with suiting actors for the roles, etc.
