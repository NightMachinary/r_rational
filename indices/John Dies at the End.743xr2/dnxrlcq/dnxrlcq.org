  1. If an Angel Appears and Speaks to You

  Here, the risks are different---if a messenger from the Almighty actually bothers to contact you, it's probably not the best idea to just ignore it. So, obviously, the first step is to make sure it's an actual entity and not a dream you're having, which is surprisingly simple: just ask the angel a question that you yourself don't know the answer to but that you can verify later (like, “What's the square root of 123,456,789?” or “What will be the final score of every football game this Sunday?”). If their information is good, well, then you know you weren't dreaming and whatever prophecies or advice they gave you could indeed be valid. Of course they, too, could be imposters, so if they ask you to do something morally questionable---like stab your own child or something---you'll need to use your own judgment. Let's face it: if there is a god and he's the type to think it's unreasonable to refuse such a request, we're all screwed anyway.
