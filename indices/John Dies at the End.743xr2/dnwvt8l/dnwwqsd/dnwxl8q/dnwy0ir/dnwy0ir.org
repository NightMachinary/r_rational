Oh, jeez. The "unfuckable garbage" story is pretty bad--I don't know the context but it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where defending that comment would be justified. I'm a feminist myself, and it always bothers me when men vocally claim to be feminist but then use that as a shield for outright misogynistic behavior and refuse to listen to anyone who tells them they're doing it wrong. A couple of webcomic artists come immediately to mind.

I didn't get a misogynistic vibe from the books--well, at least not from the latest one, it's been a while since I read the previous two so I could be forgetting something. Maybe he's grown? Or maybe the process of editing an entire book gives him enough time to remove horrible shit from it that he'd think nothing of saying on the fly, I don't know.
