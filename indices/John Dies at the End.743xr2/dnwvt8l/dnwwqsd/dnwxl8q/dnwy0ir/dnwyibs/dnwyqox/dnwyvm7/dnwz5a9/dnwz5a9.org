Oh hey, nice find. I hope he goes through with that at some point, I'd read it.

I've actually been going through this AMA for the past couple minutes (hadn't found that specific comment until you linked it though) and he seems pretty chill here, at least. I don't know. I'd certainly like to think he's past all the horrible stuff you described, because I believe in redemption and personal growth and also because the world is better off when individual people become less shitty. Still, I'll have to keep my eyes open in case it all comes roaring back.
