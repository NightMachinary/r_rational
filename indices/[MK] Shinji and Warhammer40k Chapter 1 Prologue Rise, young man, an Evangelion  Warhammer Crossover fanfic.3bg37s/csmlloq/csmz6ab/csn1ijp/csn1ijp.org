I'm a little unclear why he wasn't getting in the robot in the first place. The obvious reason would be 'He is a teenager and is too busy having sex with the unexpected harem', except that I'm pretty sure he was not doing that, and also the harem were in their own mom-robots? You'd think some combination of "Man, that's a Giant Robot!" and "Oh god oh god we're all gonna die" would work for anything short of hormone-induced stupidity.

But I'll take a look in any case.
