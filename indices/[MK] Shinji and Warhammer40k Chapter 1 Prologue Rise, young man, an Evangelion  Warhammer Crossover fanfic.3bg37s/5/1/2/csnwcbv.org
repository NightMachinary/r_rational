Not just Fan Fiction. Most amateur entertainment writers have this problem. They get a great idea, and maybe it is legitimately a great idea. The story carries itself for many chapters, and then the writer realizes they had a great idea, but, uh, how does it end? Sometimes they just stare at the screen a few days and drop it, sometimes they continue it lamely. Sometimes, I'm sure, natural instincts supply a solution that's good enough to not be flat.

I know damn well I'm guilty of exactly that in my earliest writing, and I'm only starting to really understand how writing for entertainment actually /works./
