A lot of books have been written on how to write a story. I'd never read any of them, flying by the seat of my pants for over a million words, with hints and minimal guidance from other people. Then I bought a book about plot and structure - the author doesn't speak in literary mumbo-jumbo (except to poke at it now and then, and draw attention to what the literary jargon actually means), and it really opened my eyes. I really have high hopes for my next story after Set In Stone, and future Set In Stone books.

Not going to plug the plot and structure book here, again (I have mentioned it before, but I really feel uncomfortable constantly plugging it publically) but if you want the name of the book, send me a PM.
