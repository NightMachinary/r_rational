I do not remember if it was Niven canon, or from another author's short story in the universe, but at one point humanity met an extremely capable non-scream-and-leap covert operations kzin who was apparently a messenger for the Kzin empire. He indicated that the Kzin attacking humanity were basically the dregs of fringe nobility, their personnel untrained compared to Kzin official military forces. They were allowed to attack humanity because the only other way to keep them from causing havoc within the Kzin empire itself would be to engage in civil war. If humanity pressed an attack against the Kzin empire, all sorts of hell was going to break loose.

Bluff or reality?
