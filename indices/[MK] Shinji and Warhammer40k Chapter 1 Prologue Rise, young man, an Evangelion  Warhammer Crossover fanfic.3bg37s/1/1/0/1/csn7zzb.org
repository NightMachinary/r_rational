In the first episode, he very nearly dies to the angel well before he gets anywhere near the robot. Then he was a couple kilometers from an N^{2} mine, which is supposed to be as close to a nuke as you can get without actually using nuclear material.

Also keep in mind that he's been isolated from people for most of his life (i.e. 14 years!), his father abandoned him when he was quite young when his mom died, and he suffers from a catastrophic lack of self-confidence.

Then he's shown this fucking terrifyingly huge robot (which, as he is told in the very same scene he sees it, isn't a robot but a biological mecha), told there's a 0.0000000001% chance of him successfully activating it, /but please please make it work or we'll all die./

And /then/ dear ol dad comes back, says that he basically amounts to nothing, and tells him to get in the very same robot which killed his mother.
