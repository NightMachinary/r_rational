I'm reading up on em economies, and the ethics problem is nagging at the back of my brain.

The "owner" (head of the company, whatever) would pay more to those ems whom are more efficient, more loyal, require less rest and recreation, more skilled, etc., and thus those ems will have greater ability to create copies of themselves.

Thus, it appears as if market forces will create fully-loyal ems who live off subsistence wages with extreme loyalty.
