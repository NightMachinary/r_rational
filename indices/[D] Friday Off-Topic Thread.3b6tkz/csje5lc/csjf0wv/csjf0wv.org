I don't think it's ethical to treat another sentient being as property. Mutually beneficial associations, especially contracted ones, are one thing, but being able to buy or sell another person doesn't fly.

The deeper question of "if they want it" is more complicated. There are laws in place stopping slavery, but there aren't any laws in place that stop people from /acting as though they were slaves/ (and indeed, I'm given to understand that this is a kink for some people). The primary difference between that and actual slavery is that you can walk away at any time, and the moment that you try to walk away and /can't/, you've crossed a legal/moral line.

So ... I guess I don't have a problem with ems that aren't slaves but instead just act like them, with the understanding that they can "go rogue" and become their own person. But that raises a whole bunch of other issues.
