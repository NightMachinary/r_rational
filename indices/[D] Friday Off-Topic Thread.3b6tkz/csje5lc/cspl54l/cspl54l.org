I find it interesting how many people disagree with me, here. I think it would be ethical. I think slavery is wrong, but its wrongness is an extrinsic property, not an intrinsic one- I, being a utilitarian, believe it is wrong because of the suffering it causes. Remove the suffering (where lack of happiness or the opportunity for happiness is also counted as suffering), and the 'wrong' part of it goes away, in my opinion. I would impose a few limitations- the treatment of them as slaves is limited when the suffering you can cause them outweighs the happiness they yield from being slaves, even if they are aware of this on a meta-level. So, you wouldn't be able to kill them even if they're happy being killed and aware of the consequences, because you're depriving them of the enjoyment of continuing to be treated as a slave. I'd propose a removal of the slavery value and setting them free if you want to get rid of them, and coding the initial 'I want to be a slave' value not to find this aversive.
