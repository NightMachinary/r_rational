I'm not eaturbrainz, but do work that rewards uninterrupted attention (programming, writing). If I start a five-hour task and am interrupted an hour in, I am not 20% done, I am maybe 5% done, but probably so frustrated the actual number is 0% or less. Yes, less, because that frustration dissuades me from wanting to resume the task or start similar ones.

If you happen to have an attack for this problem I would really welcome any suggestions, references, leading questions, etc. :)
