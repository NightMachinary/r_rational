Hmm. An idea for an exercise that might overcome a mental limitation on incremental progress would be to pick a dozen Project Euler problems/writing prompts and work on them alternatingly, cycling to the next one every time a 2 minute timer runs out. Of course, it is thinkable that the brain is simply not made for that and doing this exercise might bring more harm than good...
