This reminds me of the time EY realized his failure to schedule his time is unusual. Why would you need to know in advance if you have 1 or 5 hours to study or write? Do you take an hour to get into the flow of things, and burn out after three? Because that sounds like a better problem to attack.

One idea to have discussions without fighting: Pass her a note saying "I fear just talking about this would end in a fight, so I'm passing this note. <insert request>". (I don't know whether this would help, but it sounds like the kind of thing that could, for which you would know whether it would, and might not think of it yourself.) (With the same qualifications: If she answers in person, ask for time to consider and/or write down how to reply.)
