I would absolutely try to profit off the newcomers. They're going to need someone to grease the wheels for them, someone to give them the lowdown on local politics and all that stuff, and even if I'm just some random dude, it might be possible to insert myself as the middleman. Obviously part of that is drumming up fear of the nearest mage; can't have the foreigners thinking that things are going to be a cakewalk, or what do they need me for?
