Consensual exploitation is always an awkward topic.

We /have/ physical examples of evolved minds that enjoy being enslaved: Working dog breeds. Not only were their bodies molded for fitness to particular tasks, frequently their brains were as well. Dogs have variously been bred for neediness, for suicidal loyalty, for compulsive attention.

I think that had we done the same via gene splicing rather than traditional husbandry, there might be more public concern... but the fundamental threshold has been crossed.

Let's say that I warp some ems until they are listless and miserable when they're /not/ being enslaved. Even if what I've done is unethical, is it unethical at that point to exclude those ems from the slavery their mental health depends on? Is it unethical to warp their minds again to undo the damage I've done? Does it matter whether they consent to the latter, given that they desire obey whatever a master commands?
