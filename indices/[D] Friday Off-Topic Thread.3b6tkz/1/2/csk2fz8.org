  Is it ethical to evolve ems that enjoy being enslaved?
#+end_quote

NO! Insofar as we intend "freedom" to mean anything, it most definitely means that the desires of a conscious, self-aware agent are /not/ formed entirely out of the desires of some other agent!

Mind, I do think that this heuristic I just yelled is too philosophical and meta-level to really work. As often happens, it's a matter of what /precisely/ you're talking about doing.

To give examples, slavery is very definitely wrong, but parenting is not, even though, in the process of giving birth, we definitely create an agent who is optimized to /relate somehow/ to their parent-agent (eg: the actual child and the actual parents). But the thing about children is, if they decide they don't like their relationship with their parents, they can walk away, rebel, or whatever once they grow up.

Of course, we also don't routinely expect children to murder their parents. This kind of House Elf Problem would come up if you were talking about slave-ems, real children, real slaves, or even FAIs -- in the latter case I can see why one would want the agent to be non-conscious.
