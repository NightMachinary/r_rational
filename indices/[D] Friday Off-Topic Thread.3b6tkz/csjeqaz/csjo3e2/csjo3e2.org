Pride, community-involvement, and public good will are intangible rewards. Higher order reasoning rarely gets involved in decisions involving them. Decisions like whether to contribute to last week's prompt.

Such rewards are, literally, priceless.

As soon as money is involved, logic comes barreling into the equation. Consciously or subconsciously, each writer can figure the hourly pay they might receive for their contribution or calculate an expected award based on statistical likelihood of their win. Success carries an explicit, concrete reward... and failure carries an explicit, concrete loss.

With ethereal rewards like status and esteem and subreddit flair, it's easy to feel magnanimous when someone else receives their due share. Regardless of who happens to receive the most votes, contribution was the true prize. With a cash prize, there is suddenly one tangible winner and a bunch of tangible losers.

So not only are contributors calculating exactly how much their work is worth, the competition is simultaneously fraught with new psychological risk.

So a large enough concrete reward will attract competitive authors who might not have felt inspired to contribute, but /any/ concrete reward risks driving away non-competitive authors who just thought it might be fun to write something.
