I don't know. If you write in order to feel good about yourself and your ability to write, then why would taking the option that you know, based on your inquiry into psychology, will make you feel worse - why would that be the rational choice? This becomes a meaningful fallacy if you take it too far, but human psychology is shaped a certain way, and trying to ignore the inbuilt systems for small things like this, decreasing your happiness in order to maximize a value like money, is going to leave you as a more efficient, less happy person.

I don't write for money. I write for satisfaction and happiness. And if getting a concrete reward decreases satisfaction, why would I write?

My suggestion would be to find a charity we can all get behind, and make the prize be a donation to that charity. We aren't in this for money, but everyone can recognize the social value of being responsible for a donation to charity.
