We've got it; if you see someone with a little yellow Post-It next to their name (which is currently only [[/u/Kerbal_NASA]], for [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a7ypf/weekly_challenge_portal_fantasy/csa8ikn][this post]]), they've won at least one challenge. Though I think the float is slightly not right, and it looks different on my personal sub (which I'm using as a test sub for CSS).

Edit: I think the float is caused by the lack of text; you can have text and flair, but Kerbal didn't have any text, so I didn't give him any. There's also a minor problem where if you alter your own flair, you'll lose your special winner sticker, but I don't know of a good way to get rid of that. (Kerbal, if you want to change your flair, just let me know.)
