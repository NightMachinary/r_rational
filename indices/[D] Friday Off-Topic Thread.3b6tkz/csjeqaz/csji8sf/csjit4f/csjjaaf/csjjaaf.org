Good point; I should work on the next week's challenge instead of this week's. Maybe make that a bit more explicit? Because I thought it was a work-on-it-this-week type of challenge.

Edit: also, I worked on a short story (~200-400 words) a day for a good nine months, but almost none of them were any good. So a 1 week period isn't impossible, but it may be that people are not confident in their writing for them to post.
