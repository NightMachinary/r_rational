I wouldn't write anything if the prompts were given a month ahead of time. I feel like the prize would go to the person who spent a month polishing their entry, and I'm not inclined to spend that much time and effort on a Reddit competition. A week's deadline makes it easier for me to drop in or drop out as the inspiration strikes me.
