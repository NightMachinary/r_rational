I'm working on an entry into the contest; it's taking a while during the weekday, though.

In addition, would it be more fair if we had a set submission period and set judging period, as in [[/r/vexillology]]? Thus, earlier submissions would not have a greater period of time to gather upvotes (but would also make these contests last longer, which may or may not be a good thing).
