One particularly good piece of advice is to take out some paper (or sit at a word processor, etc) and write (type) for 10-15 minutes. Just don't stop. If you can't think of what to say next, then type "I can't think of what to say next." If you make a typo, /don't correct it/, don't go back, just keep going. (This is called free-writing).

If you have a story idea, do that. By all means edit it once you are done, but at least you'll get in the habit of getting your words on paper. The rest comes later.

(And by all means, get a book on editing/grammar. That you can teach. But feel free to ignore it).
