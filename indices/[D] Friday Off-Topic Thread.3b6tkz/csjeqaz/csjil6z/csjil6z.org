Dan Ariely [[https://holdenlee.wordpress.com/2014/02/22/predictably-irrational/][talks about a similar phenomenon]] (scroll to item 4) in his /Predictably Irrational/: that people are willing to do more for free that for a (relatively) small sum of money.

The prediction would be, that if you were to hold a Challenge with monetary reward, but also compulsory anonimity of submissions (to remove the limited 'fame'), you'd get less participation than with no money. That would depend on the amount of money, of course, but we're talking about a relatively 'tame' prize in tens of dollars.
