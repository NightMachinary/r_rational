So, I'm looking for a rational/realistic response to my d&d group from the perspective of locals who have just been shown modern day technology (specifically, a uhaul, modern mountain bikes, paper and ball point pen, and waterproof clothing).

The two who stumbled across my three party members are humans in a fairly standard medium-magic d&d world, so they're familiar with magic but it isn't a daily occurrence, and these specific npcs have traveled beyond their own city, primarily as merchants. Their current reaction has largely been one of shock and then going along with the party's demands to travel with them to the nearest town due to underhanded intimidation (there was a large thunderstorm, and the team was in sort of possession of a barn that provided cover from it).

However, I'm at a bit of a loss from where to go from here. Sell information to the local noble? Try to profit off of the newcomers? Try to drum up fear of the nearest mage into putting them down?
