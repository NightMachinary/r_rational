  I'm aware of (contentious) research into things like blood donation that shows quantity and safety decrease with monetary compensation, and the answer to why that's the case seems like it must be social; if you take blood from a volunteer, you're paying them in "I feel good about myself" and "I can brag about this to others", whereas if you pay them you're reducing those intangibles.

People value relationships very, very highly, but money is the relationship-destroyer. Mind, it's not that money has some innate ability to sow discord into a healthy relationship. It's that money, in the sense of cash, is [[http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/08/what-is-debt-%E2%80%93-an-interview-with-economic-anthropologist-david-graeber.html][/designed/]] to facilitate relationship-free transactions, and even after thousands of years of money and 200 years of complex industrial economies, we still carry a strong association from daily experience that using money depersonalizes things

To wit: if I have sex with you, it might be because I love you. If I have sex with you and you pay me money afterwards, it sure as hell /isn't/ because I love you. Some things are more valuable when given as tokens of a relationship than when depersonalized, because a relationship token signals and maintains the existence of an ongoing, long-term relationship, while cash payment usually signals a one-time transaction based on non-shared self-interests.

This becomes especially important given that relationships are the fabric of society as a whole, at least according to my General Theory of Friendship Being More Magic Than People Account For. This theory states that people often act for prosocial reasons, but are trained to pretend to a kind of selfishness because Enlightened Self-Interest has become a kind of social religion in capitalist countries.
