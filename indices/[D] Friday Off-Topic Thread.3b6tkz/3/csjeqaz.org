The Weekly Challenge is making me think a lot about monetary incentives and social psychology. I would naively expect that a cash reward (especially a fairly sizable one, as these things go) would increase participation ... but this doesn't seem to have been the case. Because the prompts are given a week ahead of time, it can't be connected to the strength of the competition, only the perceived strength of the competition prior to any entries coming in. Or, because the prompts themselves are variable, it might be the difference in prompts instead. Anyway, it's one of those things that I don't really have enough data to make any conclusions on, but it's bothering me. (Which is not to say that if you've submitted a story I don't appreciate it.)

I'm aware of (contentious) research into things like blood donation that shows quantity and safety decrease with monetary compensation, and the answer to /why/ that's the case seems like it must be social; if you take blood from a volunteer, you're paying them in "I feel good about myself" and "I can brag about this to others", whereas if you pay them you're reducing those intangibles. People feel good about (maybe) saving a life, and when I gave blood it was for those social/emotional reasons. Maybe the solution is non-status threatening rewards; NPR donations are not payment for donation rewards, because there are easier and cheaper ways to buy a mug. All the NPR rewards are status-boosting ones; you get an NPR mug or tote, which is a symbol of donation more than it is a mug or tote (though it is still those things).

One of the other things that I've been thinking about lately is that for most of the things I think about (like this) there's someone out there who has this as their entire job. There's surely someone at every donation organization who's looking at donation maximization and thinking much harder about the problem than I am. But at the same time, I've worked for enough large companies to know that this might not actually be the case, and I've started to wonder how true that assumption really is. "Surely there must be X" has proven untrue enough times in the corporate world for me to have some skepticism about how well society actually works.
