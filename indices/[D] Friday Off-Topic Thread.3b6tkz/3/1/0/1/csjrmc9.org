You could put up the challenges a month ahead of time and have them posted on the sidebar. That should leave people plenty of time to write for the challenges they are interested in.

Or better yet you can put up ideas for challenges to a vote a month or so before the deadline. It would expose voters to the new topics ahead of time as well as giving them motivation to check what topics are coming up.
