My thought was that because the prompts are given a week in advance, everyone should be able to submit within a day of each other. I don't know whether it's unfeasible to create a work in a week? This challenge is modeled on [[/r/worldbuilding]]'s weekly challenges, which I was a huge fan of while they were running, and I always had next week's entry done within a few days of the prompt being announced. I'm somewhat atypical (highly active) as far as redditors go though. I don't know whether a week isn't enough time, or people don't access the internet enough to submit in a timely manner, or what else the case might be. (And I'm more interested/puzzled by the difference between this week and last.)

Possible solutions include switching the challenge to be bi-weekly or monthly, giving prompts two or three weeks ahead of time, or implementing a bot like [[/r/vexillology]] uses which can collect entries.

But again, sample size right now is one and a half challenges, so it's nearly impossible to draw a conclusion.
