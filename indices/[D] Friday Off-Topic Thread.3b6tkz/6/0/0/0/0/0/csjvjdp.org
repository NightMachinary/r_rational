It seems that there are two different things being conflated here. The "fallacy fallacy", which seems to be the same "argument from fallacy" you linked, is just a specific form of denying the antecedent. What I'm referring to, and what I think [[/u/PL_TOC]] is looking for, is generalizing the definition of a fallacy until it ceases to be a fallacy. Oftentimes I think fallacies are deliberately defined in broad, easy-to-generalize ways, which encourage this behavior.
