It depends on /how/ they're disagreeing with you! For example, if they're saying you're misdefining terms, that's No True Scotsman. If they're saying your ideas are going to have bad consequences in the future, that's Slippery Slope. If they're disagreeing with you and someone else who /you/ disagree with, that's The Centrist Fallacy.
