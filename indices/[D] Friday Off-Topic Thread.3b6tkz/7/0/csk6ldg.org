Is it reasonable to assume that she knows how much this will be with enough advanced notice that she could feasibly tell you without interrupting her workday?

If yes, then I would bring it up anyways, because more communication is better. You might want to phrase it in the form of a question (ie, "would this be something you could do?") rather than a complaint or accusation.

However, it's also possible that she either doesn't know when she will have overtime, or perhaps works in a job where either she doesn't have free use of her phone, or where halting what she is doing to tell you that she'll be late would cause her to take even longer to complete. In this situation, you might need to think of more outside resolutions, since it might not be reasonable in that case to expect her to inform you explicitly each time.
