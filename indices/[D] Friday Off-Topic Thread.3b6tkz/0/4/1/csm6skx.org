If pirating them was impossible, I would not be able to purchase all the books I feel like reading. I would attempt to find the books, maybe through a friend or in a used book shop but beyond that, no, it would be a book I would have to wait to read until I can purchase it.

But in a world where piracy exists, I don't see any reason why I should have to deal with this inconvenience, other than the moral argument which I've asked about here.

I haven't even mentioned the other issues I face, like how my country has banned PayPal (they've refused to follow certain statutory obligations) and how the banking system here has a stupid dual authentication that effectively blocks most cards on .com sites, I cannot purchase anything through the play store or iTunes for example.
