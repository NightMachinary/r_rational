  the benefits of more attention at the expense of not making any money

Then I suppose the people who give away their content and still make money from it don't exist, such as Penny arcade and so many other webcomics; Cory Doctorow who makes all his novels available for free download yet still sells lots of physical copies; and so on and so forth?

(As an aside, I'm currently downloading the latest episode of 'Star Trek Continues', have recently time-shifted an episode of My Little Pony as I was busy when it was broadcast, and format-shifted a book I own into ebook format as my ebook reader is smaller and more convenient than a hardcover printed edition, and have recently updated my 'watches' on Kickstarter and Patreon for certain content-producers I follow. Then maybe I'll engage in some [[http://yro.slashdot.org/story/04/08/11/0221253/using-copyright-to-suppress-political-speech][political speech]], refresh my memory on [[http://rufuspollock.org/papers/optimal_copyright.pdf][optimal copyright lengths]], and go over some [[http://www.datapacrat.com/sketches/quotes.html][quotes]] I've excerpted from published works to see if I can think of some new ones to add.)

  There has grown up in the minds of certain groups in this country the notion that because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with the duty of guaranteeing such profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest. This strange doctrine is not supported by statute or common law. Neither individuals nor corporations have any right to come into court and ask that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back.
