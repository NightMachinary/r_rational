I'm of two minds on the issue.

The Copyright Clause from the Constitution:

#+begin_quote
  To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.
#+end_quote

That's a pretty damned good reason to provide people with copyright, irrespective of any moral claim to the property. If authors don't have a way to get paid, they're not going to create as much. If I could write full time, I would do that, but because I have to hold down a job to pay the mortgage, my writing is limited. If /as a society/ we pay authors for their works, then we're going to end up with more (and better) works, /especially/ because editing is the more important part of writing, and editing is the kind of tedious drudge work that most people will only do with monetary incentive.

So in that sense, piracy is a tragedy of the commons issue. You are taking those books for free, in a way that's rational self-interest. You will never be punished for it. But if /everyone/ did that, we wouldn't have as much (or as good) of fiction. And there are some social reasons not to, like the author not liking it; generally, I think if you like a work, you should probably respect the author's wishes. Some authors care about piracy, some are just happy to have people reading and only publish because of the ancillary benefits (like professional editing and marketing departments).

So at the same time, I think that putting information out there and expecting people not to pirate it is ... well, not /stupid/, but you have to expect people to act in their own rational self-interest, especially in those cases where there's no chance that they'll get caught and no difference to them. There are a few ways to react to this; the Hollywood response has mostly been an aggressive one (DRM, litigation), while there are certain sections of geek/tech world where they've tried to embrace it. There's also a middle road where you accept that piracy is going to happen and just don't do that much about it, because there's not much that you /can/ do (which isn't to say that simply giving things away or as pay-what-you-want is necessarily correct).

For me personally, exposure is far more important than money, and not just because I think exposure is the path to money.
