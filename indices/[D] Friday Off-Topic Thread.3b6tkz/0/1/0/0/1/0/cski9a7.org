Things wrong with copyright:

It lasts too long. Modern copyright began with the Statute of Anne in 1710 (humorously enough, this was during the Golden Age of Piracy). Copyright lasted for fourteen years. Later, you were able to extend it for another fourteen years, so twenty-eight years total. The 20th century is basically a history of people extending copyright until it's infinite. Copyright /isn't actually infinite/, it's something like the life of the author plus seventy years, but there's going to be another extension once Mickey Mouse threatens to fall out of copyright, which is what's been happening for quite some time now.

It's also transferable. If I write something like /Shadows of the Limelight/, I hold the copyright. But I can also transfer that copyright to someone else, like my wife in the event of my death. Or an evil corporation. /Shadows/ doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things; other works matter considerably more. The "Happy Birthday" song is copyrighted, and this is detrimental to our culture. Mildred and Patty Hill are long-dead, and the copyright is owned by Warner Music. Far more worryingly, Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech is copyrighted. It's one of the most famous speeches in American history, and the people who own that copyright (who are not actually MLK Jr.) have been using it to gouge people who want to, you know, teach or learn about civil rights. Some authors are jackasses who would do these things anyway, but to a large extent copyright is used by corporations to shut down well-meaning and culturally beneficial uses by people who had no part in the actual creation.

Copyright applies to derivative works. Warner Brothers has every right to shut down /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/. It wouldn't be worth the time and PR costs to do it, but they could force hpmor.com to shut down, pull the work from ff.net, and aggressively attack all the mirrors. They're not going to do this, because it would be expensive to them, /but copyright means that they could/. (There are fair use exemptions and "transformative works", but there's still a large chilling effect.)

... you know, I was typing this up just from reading the above comment, but then I noticed there was already a conversation going on, and you already know all this stuff. We're probably in agreement; particular copyright laws might be stupid, too expansive, etc., but the core idea is probably sound?
