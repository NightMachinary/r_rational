  So I'm not sure on which side I come down, but I think a world where you can't do that, where you can't send somebody a book and then later sue them when they share it around, isn't automatically morally worse than one with copyright.

  I'm not saying it's automatically better, but I am asserting there's complexity here that you're ignoring, even for plain piracy.

There's a slight moral/legal distinction to be made here. I don't think it's moral for you to share my book when I asked you not to, but I'm not proposing that this is something that we need to (necessarily) legislate. I mean, I think adultery is immoral, but I don't think it should be illegal.

You're right that for most of what you're talking about, I would come down on the side of the consumers. I just view most of that as being distinct from plain piracy of the "I don't want to pay" variety, which I believe makes up the vast share of piracy in the Western world. The tendrils are important, but they're tendrils; they're not the core of the question. Many people who want to defend piracy will first go to the tendrils and attack /those/, because it's easier to make an argument against them. And then the hacked up tendrils get used as camouflage against the real core question.

  I do think it's plainly morally wrong to exclude the poor from cultural participation

I think we likely disagree on this. There's an /enormous/ amount of free culture out there. Not just all the stuff that's in the public domain, but all the stuff that's free on television, free on the radio, free from libraries, etc. Is it immoral for HBO to charge for episodes of Game of Thrones because people below a certain income can't afford the premium channel, the $15 a month or whatever for HBO Go, or the $3.49 per episode on iTunes? Is it my moral right to go download those episodes on Monday nights? (And just to be clear, I do pirate. I'm not taking a moral high ground here. It's free, convenient, and utterly without personal consequence, so while I try to pay for things and support the content creators I like, I don't try /that/ hard. I'm just also making the claim that this "plain piracy" is moral.)
