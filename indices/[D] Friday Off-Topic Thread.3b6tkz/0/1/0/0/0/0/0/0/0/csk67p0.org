  There's a slight moral/legal distinction to be made here. I don't think it's moral for you to share my book when I asked you not to, but I'm not proposing that this is something that we need to (necessarily) legislate. I mean, I think adultery is immoral, but I don't think it should be illegal.

Huh. In that case, I think we are in agreement.

  I just view most of that as being distinct from plain piracy of the "I don't want to pay" variety, which I believe makes up the vast share of piracy in the Western world.

That doesn't seem to match up with the enormous success of Steam or iTunes though - the message there seems to be, "people will do whatever is most convenient". Torrents just happen to be extremely convenient, especially when you're competing against over-DRM'd content, like games that literally stop crashing once you crack them.

  free on television

And of course, most American television series and movies are really difficult to get in a timely fashion, in good quality, in a format that runs under Linux. ([edit] Overseas to boot.) I can only speak for myself here, but torrents are available a few hours after broadcast, in HD, and work with mplayer. :shrug: What can I say, if there was an option to literally give the studio a reasonable amount of money in exchange for immunity from copyright claims, I'd probably do it. If there was a flatrate, I'd definitely get it. Unfortunately there isn't? Not sure what else I can say here - they are literally not offering me what I want: pay-as-you-go DRM-free HD downloads. I'm sure I'm not the only one either. And the premise "pay money to get less value than free alternatives" does not a compelling offer make. The studios, in their desire to control distribution, are only hurting themselves.

Are you ever gonna get rid of all piracy? No. On the other hand, [[https://torrentfreak.com/0-more-on-content-than-honest-consumers-130510/][the people who pirate the most also tend to be the people who buy the most]] (in one country, in one study...), which is certainly suggestive.

I think if you make buying content easy and convenient, and offer genuine added value, as Steam does, then most people who can pay will pay. And those who can't pay, well, they can still torrent games; after all, it's no loss to anyone.

I think the real question is: how much money is "available" on entertainment? How much would people increase their entertainment budgets if piracy was made impossible? And I suspect, though can't prove, that the answer to that is going to turn out to be: "not much".
