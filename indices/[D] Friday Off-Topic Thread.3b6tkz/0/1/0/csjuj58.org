Yeah but the counterpoint is copyright can be /judged/ by the Copyright Clause, since it sets goals for copyright to achieve, and we can ask "does copyright achieve these goals?"

For instance, I don't see how providing income to the heirs of an author "promotes the Progress of Science and useful Arts". I also don't see how shutting down remixes or fan works achieves this goal. Also, more controversially, I don't see how it promotes anything to punish people if they dare to consume more than the comparatively small volume of content they could actually afford to consume on minimum income.

Copyright seems more aimed at promoting income streams for middlemen.

Personally, I'm currently in favor of something like a nationwide personal copyright exemption flatrate, where you pay a fixed amount per month (maybe related to income level, distributed according to opt-in statistics about consumption, possibly in cooperation with sites like goodreads or last.fm that already track what you read or listen to) and in exchange get immunity to claims of non-commercial copyright violation for certain classes of media, ie. books, songs, movies etc. Though that's more of a hotfix; long-term I think projects like Creative Commons and Patreon can pave the way to cutting out the publishing industry entirely, which will let us scale back copyright terms with less pushback.
