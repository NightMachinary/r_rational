The copyright clause in the constitution is contingent on an empirical claim, which is that it promotes "the Progress of Science and useful Arts". Unfortunately, we don't seem to have good empirical evidence backing that claim -- it's speculation, and probably driven by self-interested parties in the publishing industry. Many very useful works (Newton, Leibniz, Galileo, etc.) predate copyright, and fiction probably shouldn't even qualify to begin with.

Then there's also a bit about "limited times", which isn't very true any more with century-plus copyright terms that extend the public domain version to a date beyond the lifetime of contemporaries.

In the example of an author sending me a private email to beta-read a manuscript, there is a chance I'd feel bound to their wishes out of respect for privacy. I'd also respect their desire to publish it all at once as a finished story, because it affects their image as an author. I'm not sure I would rule out publishing it under any and all circumstances. If the author died, and I had the only surviving copy, publishing a (possibly edited) version of it might make more sense. Overall the moral question there is more about the relationship I would have to the author, and the public perception issues that might arise.

But for an already published work, the dynamic is different. The author is seeking wider readership and recognition of their ideas/art. You can't really control which public sees your work when you do that. And telling people they can't copy it without a license seems just stupid -- the /brain/ copies it, that's what reading /is/, and culture is all about people sharing information/art between each other. The degree of control copyright attempts to assert over a work (including the manner in which it gets rewarded financially) just seems absurd.

So I favor the abolition of copyright. If people want to support authors, that's great -- send the author a check! If they want to make coercive laws that force people to reward authors, well that's what /taxes/ are for. This "limit the readership so the author can make a buck" thing is akin to buying candy under the rationale that you are supporting the sugar industry. It doesn't even /work/ most of the time -- most writers are unable to make enough money to pay for their effort at minimum wage, whereas a very small number of well-marketed franchise authors (or at least, their publishers) collect far more than the value of their work.

I would say that today's franchise-oriented market full of vacuous nostalgia movies (Transformers, Jurrassic World, The Muppets, Spiderman, Spiderman again, etc.) which would barely qualify as decent fanfiction, is the natural consequence of long-term copyrights that cover multiple generations.

Why not just let whoever writes the best fanfiction of the work make a movie of it? Because people are apparently gullible enough to believe that no good works would be written unless you hand out exclusive multi-generational control to whoever thought of it first and/or buys the rights from whoever did.
