I buy tons of books, but I don't hugely resent people who pirate. It's unreasonable to expect everyone to just resist the economic incentives based on personal virtue, when the current laws are completely unfeasible and unenforced.

So my vague hope is that piracy will contribute to the incentives for someone to eventually figure out a better way; I like Amazon's solution, for example. Kind of like Netflix did for film and tv.

(Incidentally, I also regularly "pirate" things I already have. It's just far better than having to scan or rip them myself, even when that's technically feasible. So I'm grateful to the pro-piracy culture out there for that resource.)

On the other hand, "information wants to be free" rhetoric is ridiculous. "They think they can own a /number/!"
