*A Bayesian creed?*

For some Plot purposes, I'm considering putting together a creed-like set of statements, which would be applicable to LW-style, Bayesian rationality. So far, I have something along the lines of:

- There is truth, and there is falsehood.
- Knowing the truth is important.
- There are different ways to tell the difference between what is true and what is false.
- Some ways work better than others.
- It is possible to figure out which ways work better.

... though I can't decide whether to throw in something at the beginning about 'solipsism isn't useful'. Or if there are other fundamental statements that should be included. Or if an entirely different formulation would be more relevant.

Anyone have any suggestions?
