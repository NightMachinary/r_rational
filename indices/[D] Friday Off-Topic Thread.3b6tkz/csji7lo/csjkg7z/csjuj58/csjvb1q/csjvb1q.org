Well, copyright itself is kind of crap. I can agree with that. Especially when it's copyright in its current incarnation that lasts for/ever/. Authors being paid for their work, so that they can create more and better work, is not crap (at least, I hope we can agree on that).

There are all sorts of ways that authors can potentially be paid, especially in the modern day:

- Work on commission. Kickstarter does this.
- Patronage. Patreon does this.
- Donations. Fairly easy to set up with PayPal, Google Payments, etc.
- Merchandise. Physical stuff that you can't really pirate, like physical books, t-shirts, posters, etc. Set up with Breadpig or something similar.

There's a significant question about whether these methods are sustainable or attainable for the average author looking to make some money. And when we're talking about piracy, that's not really the question that we're asking. What we're asking is this:

#+begin_quote
  If an author tells you to pay for something he's created, do you have the moral right to copy it from him without paying?
#+end_quote

I don't think you do. I think you /can/, and any author would be foolish to pretend there's a damned thing he can do about it, but I don't think that it's particularly moral. (That doesn't always stop me, but just because piracy is convenient and free doesn't mean that I'm going to claim that it's /right/.)
