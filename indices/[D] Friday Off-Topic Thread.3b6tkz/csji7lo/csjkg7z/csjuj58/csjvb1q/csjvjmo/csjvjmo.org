I edited my comment, btw!

Okay, first of all, the way you phrased it is weird.

What you mean is

#+begin_quote
  If an author tells you that you're not allowed to consume something he's created without paying them, do you have the moral right to consume it anyway?
#+end_quote

You're not copying /from the author/, you're copying from other people, and that is actually important.

The problem is that the question has tendrils. To enforce copyright properly, you can't just reduce it to not letting you take something that the author has. You also have to stop people from giving the content to others, viewing it at others' houses; ultimately, you could go so far as to allow authors to define whether their content can be stored in libraries! The problem is that you're trying to stretch the concept of physical scarcity to cover content that is endlessly reproducible; "Intellectual Property" is bullshit, it's all of it a question of /licensing/. And licensing requires the ability to put content out there while "fine-tuning" what happens to it; it's fundamentally a non-local process, and I think it's not obvious how far the moral right of the author should stretch there; considering how much of culture is a process of digestion and remixing and reproduction, should authors have the right to control how their content interacts with this process, even when it on net reduces the amount of culture created? Should Rowling have the right to forbid HPMOR? Certainly there are vast swathes of [[http://www.tlmc.eu/][cultural works]] which would simply not exist if the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Shanghai_Alice][original creator]]/s had decided to enforce their copyright to the full extent of the law. And in a pure utilitarian calculus, there's a point where the moral weight of the collected consumers simply outstrips the moral rights of the author, where the joy a song can bring to the world /outweighs/ the moral authority of the Author, who perhaps wants to limit its spread to authentic vinyl records.

So the moral side is complicated.

That's why I usually prefer to stick with the empirical side, where copyright is simply an incredibly poor way to fulfill its objective of promoting Science and the useful Arts.
