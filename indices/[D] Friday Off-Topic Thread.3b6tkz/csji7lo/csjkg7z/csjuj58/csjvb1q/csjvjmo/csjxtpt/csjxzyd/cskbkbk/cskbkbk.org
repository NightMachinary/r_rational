Pricing the culture I make doesn't exclude the poor from cultural participation. It excludes them from participating in /my/ culture, which I created, and apparently I want to exclude them, or else I wouldn't be charging a price they can't afford.

Charging people for food doesn't exclude the poor from eating. If people worry about it anyway and want to give the poor food stamps, then that would make a fine argument for book stamps. It wouldn't justify robbing grocery stores.
