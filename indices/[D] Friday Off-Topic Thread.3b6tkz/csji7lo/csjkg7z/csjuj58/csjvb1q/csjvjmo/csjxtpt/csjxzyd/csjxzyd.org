No yeah, what I'm saying is the moral side of things is a continuum, and some of the outgrowths stretch too far. For instance, for your ostensibly simple example: should you be able to email me a novelette while declaring that I'm not permitted to look at the attachment unless I agree to not spread it? (Shrink-wrap licenses.) Should you be able to email me a novelette while declaring that I'm not allowed to talk about it? (Journalist previews, NDAs.) To talk about it, but only positively? (Games reporting.) Should I be allowed to copy it to my laptop? To my Kindle? Should you be allowed to tell me I can listen to the audiobook on iPhones but not Android phones? (DRM.) Should you be able to make a copy available for free, then later decide that people are no longer allowed to share it? (Several web serials.) Should you be able to prevent me from writing fanfic of it? From selling fanfic of it? From selling fan art of it? From copying snippets of it? From lending it to my friends, as long as I don't look at it while they have it? (Libraries.) From reselling it? (Second-hand market.) These are all questions of copyright; even if you only consider the moral side, these questions have no clear /moral/ answer.

I agree that something like copyright is probably a good thing to have, but I don't think it's as simple as you paint it, and I do think piracy is on a continuum, it's not clearly demarcated from other things where you'd probably come down on the side of the consumers. And morally, there /is/ genuinely a situation where there might be millions of people who want to read a book but can't afford it, maybe because they're children or teens, maybe because they're on minimum wage or social benefits, and I do think it's plainly morally wrong to exclude the poor from cultural participation, and plainly idiotic to exclude the young. You're depicting it as a single transaction, and that makes it a "me vs. them" thing, but at those scales it's arguably a question of statistics.

So I'm not sure on which side I come down, but I think a world where you can't do that, where you can't send somebody a book and then later sue them when they share it around, isn't automatically morally /worse/ than one with copyright.

I'm not saying it's automatically better, but I am asserting there's complexity here that you're ignoring, even for plain piracy.
