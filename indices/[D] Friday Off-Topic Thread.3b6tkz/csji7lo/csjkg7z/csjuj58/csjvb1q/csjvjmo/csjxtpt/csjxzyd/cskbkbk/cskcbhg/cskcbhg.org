It's not your culture.

[edit]

Oh, but what, you created it so it's yours? Fine. Make your own culture.

But first, give back your language, your childhood memories, every book you ever read and every movie you ever watched.

What, you say, you can't do that because ideas don't work that way?

Gee. Almost like culture can't be meaningfully compared to property.

[edit] Do I think you should not able to profit from your intellectual labor? Hell no. But this smug "I made it, so it's mine" attitude denies the massive base of shared cultural knowledge that almost any intellectual work builds upon. Nobody writes in a vacuum.
