    Do I think you should not able to profit from your intellectual labor? Hell no.

But if you, say, try to deny black people service in your restaurant (hey, if you can compare intellectual property to food, I can compare piracy to black people), society might tell you to knock it off. Then if you say "fuck you society, this is my restaurant", society might gently remind you who provides the services that let the restaurant be built and operate in safety to begin with.

(Of course, to make the analogy really work we'd have to postulate that the food your restaurant produces can actually be multiplied by anybody for free, but if people do this then restaurant owners may randomly sue them for ridiculous amounts under misapplied laws.)
