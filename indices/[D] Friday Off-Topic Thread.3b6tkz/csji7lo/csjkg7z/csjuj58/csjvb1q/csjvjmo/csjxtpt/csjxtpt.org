I'm not trying to stretch the concept of physical scarcity /at all/. I'm not even really talking about copyright in the sense of the legal concept as it exists now.

What I mean is, if I e-mail you a new novelette I've written called "The Case of the Sleeping Beauties", and I ask you not to share it with anyone, do you think that you have a moral right to share it with other people?

This question has nothing to do with the legal aspects (though you would not have a legal right) or the social aspects (obviously I would be pretty pissed at you) or the physical capability (obviously there's nothing physically stopping you from copying the story to pastebin and posting it to reddit).

I think we agree that the author has /some/ moral right, even if it's not absolute. In the case where the product is readily available at a reasonable price, I think that morality falls on the side of not pirating. I'm a strong believer in things like fair use and derivative works, but the general case of piracy is far less defensible.

I mean, I put out content for free and tell people that I really appreciate it if they give me money for it. That's a reflection on the kind of world I want to live in, and the kind of relationship I want authors to have with readers /generally/. But I don't think that piracy, in the sense of "I want to not pay for this thing" is morally right, generally speaking.
