A quick question before I try engaging in this discussion further: Can you imagine anything that might change your mind on this topic? If so, what might that be?

(For a parallel question about evolution, one answer is "Rabbits in the Pre-Cambrian". If you've read the Sequences, or "Rationality: AI to Zombies", feel free to mention any particular aspects from them that come to mind.)

The reason I pose this question is that this subthread seems to be headed in the direction of "Politics is SPIDERS", which is one of the current formulations of the "Politics is the Mind-Killer" principle; and I'd rather not be Mind-Killed today, as I want to try to get some work done on my novel.
