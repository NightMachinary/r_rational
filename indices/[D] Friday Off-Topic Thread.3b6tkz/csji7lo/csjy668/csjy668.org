I can afford to buy books, therefore I do so. I'm aware a fair amount of my money is going to publishers, editors, distributors, etc when I do so, but I'm glad to subsidize that industry since it generally makes writing books more possible.

I realize that some people are not able to afford books, but for me, the main expense for a book is the time spent reading, not the cost of the book. When I drop $20 on a book it doesn't impact me as when I send hours and hours reading a book.
