I studied this stuff, I know the argument for producing zero marginal cost goods at zero price and why it's dumb as shit (no price means no signal of value to the market). It's an argument for making information not exist because you think you already have it ("Hey, I know /I/ want to pirate this."). Non-excludable just means that it's hard to protect your property, which, duh, no one would pirate if it was moral but difficult. But they definitely would pirate if it was immoral but easy.

Anyway, what I said in my comment was simply that if an author wants the benefits of more attention at the expense of not making any money, then that's a choice they can make. But it's really shitty to disregard the choice the author did make, on the assurance that, no, really, you should've chosen differently. If you're going to disregard people's choices because you think they're wrong, you might as well just admit you don't respect their property (try telling someone that you sold their car and bought them a new one because they bought the wrong one). Maybe you think the property shouldn't be property, and maybe you're definitely wrong about that, but it's /aggravating/ to be told that you're being disrespected for your own good.
