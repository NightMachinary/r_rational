There are certain differences between physical property and potentially copyrightable works, which lead to there being reasons for the two things being treated differently - the first is rivalrous and the second non-rivalrous (eg, two people can use the same informational good at the same time), plus the first is excludable and the second is non-excludable (eg, it's possible to keep someone else from using your physical property). ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#Terminology.2C_and_types_of_goods]] is probably as good a starting point as any to get into the theory.) Copyrights and patents are ways to try to legislatively turn non-excludable information into excludable information; DRM is a technologial attempt to turn non-rivalrous information into rivalrous information. There are all sorts of complications and nuances, but based on my previous experience, attempting to discuss the topic is as much SPIDERS as politics is, so I'll pause here to try to gauge your reaction, if any, to the basic framework described.
