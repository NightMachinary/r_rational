I'm an avowed Free Culture believer. Insofar as copyright helps to foster art and science, particularly art and science by people who earn a living wage making art and science, we should support copyright. Insofar as copyright makes a few IP-hoarding companies very rich while turning authors and artists into an exploited working class, fuck it.

But, insofar as we have copyright, it's worth respecting it by finding ways to buy directly from the authors, and it's also worth letting it end so that works can enter the public domain.
