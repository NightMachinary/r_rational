Speaking as a professional author with actual real-life books out there on which I am making enough real-life money to buy a cup of coffee once a week or so:

1. If you buy my book, that's great; you've helped me.
2. If you pirate my book and then leave a positive review on Reddit and tell other people that it's great so that some of them buy it...you have helped me a great deal more.
3. If you pirate my book and walk away without even mentioning it to anyone, you are a terrible person who should be thwapped with a flounder and sent to bed with no supper.

Note that if you read the book and don't like it, I don't expect you to say positive things; just don't pirate it and then say negative things.

Other authors don't feel this way; try to respect their wishes. Don't pirate Harlan Ellison's work because it makes him nuts. Mine? Feel free.

Basically: if you read a book and like it, give the author something, whether it be money or publicity.
