So [[/r/rational][r/rational]], how do you feel about piracy? Piracy in general and piracy of books in particular.

I ask because, I'll be honest here, I've pirated almost every book I've read. But I do this because of a lack of a decent library in my city and because I simply cannot afford the 4 or 5 books I read every month, some of which I don't even end up finishing.

But when I think about it from the perspective of the author, I would hate a pirate, especially one who pirates books that are just 2 or 3$ in e-book form.
