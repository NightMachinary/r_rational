OK, this is going to bug me if I don't bring it up:

Quesiton 4: "What sex were you assigned at birth?" is a stupid question.

You were not assigned a sex at birth. There was no choice. You developed with XX or XY chromosomes.

Now, GENDER is something that we can argue all day about, and people do fall on a spectrum of gender behaviours, but Sex is yes/no, Male/Female.

You were not /assigned/ your M/F operator at birth, you were literally born in configuration M / configuration F.
