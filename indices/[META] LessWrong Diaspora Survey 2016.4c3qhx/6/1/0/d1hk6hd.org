This is a self-righteous comment. I'd ask you to remove it, but I feel all would benefit if it was left as an example if how to be self-righteous.

Where do you get off on moderating a "rational" subreddit, and still resorting to simple-minded ad hominum attacks?

If you have an issue with my statement, fucking refute it. With like, facts. Don't just climb onto your high horse and go "ohohoho, look at those people who disagree with my opinion. Quaint savages, aren't they?"

How in the nine hells do you expect us to have a reasoned conversation like this?
