You want to get off that high horse? It seems to be digging into your ass.

Sex determining region Y, typically found on the Y chromosome, part of the protein binding process that helps determine if you get male or female sexual organs, and the malformation of the gene can cause syndromes where the organism has a typically male or female karyotype but the opposite genitals.

Since sexual characteristics play such a large part in the development of the brain (due in no small part to hormonal release), your sex is still determined by your plumbing, while your gender is a spectrum with traditionally masculine elements on one side and traditional female elements on the other.

Still a stupid question.
