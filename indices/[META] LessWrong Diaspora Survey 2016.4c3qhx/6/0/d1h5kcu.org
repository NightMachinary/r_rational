It is not a stupid question. For one thing, it determines your socialized gender with extreme accuracy, and for another thing, intersex people exist and sex characteristics are not wholly determined by chromosomes (if you do not know what SRY means you are unqualified to talk about biological sex with 0.9999 likelihood), nor do they fall into a binary.
