  there's no obiovus way to define biological sex for corner cases, and no reason to throw away data from them.

Functioning genitals are a pretty good indicator of X/Y, but I can see your point for intersex "ain't got anything that works" cases.

I would argue against labeling it as "assigned", because "assigned" both indicates the intentional removal of agency (I hereby assign you to be [thing]), as well as implying there was a choice in your biological makeup (which is currently untrue, though it may be true later when gene editing can be done to developing fetuses for designer babies).

I would say that a properly worded question 4 would be "Which biological sex were you identified as at birth?", because that's literally what happens when you come out of the hole; a doctor picks you up, checks the plumbing, and announces "It's a boy/girl/totadile!"
