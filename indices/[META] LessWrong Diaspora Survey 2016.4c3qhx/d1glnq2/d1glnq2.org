Although not really my cup of tea, I found the survey interesting. I learned something when I was asked to answer this question:

** With which of these meta-ethical views do you MOST identify?

*Non-cognitivism:* Moral statements don't express propositions and can neither be true nor false. "Murder is wrong" means something like "Boo murder!".

*Error theory:* Moral statements have a truth-value, but attempt to describe features of the world that don't exist. "Murder is wrong" and "Murder is right" are both false statements because moral rightness and wrongness aren't features that exist.

*Subjectivism:* Some moral statements are true, but not universally, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by non-universal opinions or prescriptions, and there is no non-attitudinal determinant of rightness and wrongness. "Murder is wrong" means something like "My culture has judged murder to be wrong" or "I've judged murder to be wrong".

*Substantive realism:* Some moral statements are true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by mind-independent moral properties. "Murder is wrong" means that murder has an objective mind-independent property of wrongness that we discover by empirical investigation, intuition, or some other method.

*Constructivism:* Some moral statements are true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by whether an agent would accept it if they were undergoing a process of rational deliberation. "Murder is wrong" can mean something like "Societal agreement to the rule 'do not murder' is instrumentally rational".

I guess I've never really thought in depth about meta-ethical views. I had an opportunity to think about how I thought today.
