Question: on the calibration questions it says to answer in percentages, and then asks pairs of question; a question, and then my subjective probability. How should I be answering these questions? Should I be answering mentally, giving my probability of how certain I am, and then my probability of how certain that probability is? Or should I answer the question and then give my probability of how certain I am?

Example 1: Am I smiling? (I'm not): 99

Subjective Probability: 99

Example 2: Am I smiling? (I'm not): No

Subjective Probability: 99
