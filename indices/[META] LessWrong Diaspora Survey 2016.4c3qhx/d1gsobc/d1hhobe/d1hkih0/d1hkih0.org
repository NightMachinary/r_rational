If XX and XY are the "most common" specimens, and the rest occur at a rate no lower then 1 in 500, going as high as 1 in 50,000, I would argue that at that point you can classify XX/XY as the norm, and the rest as aberrant variants of.

Having different genitalia from what your hormones say you should is a well-studied phenomena - it's referred to as "gender dysphoria" and is considered a condition to be treated, not a "well, sucks for you, weird gene person".

I don't see the relevance of bringing up differently-DNA body parts for this discussion. I was under the impression that, when we say (X)'s DNA, we mean "the majority of X's DNA sequence". Please clarify how this datum is related.
