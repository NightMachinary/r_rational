I think it'll be hard for them to implement laws without trolls taking advantage.

Eg.

- What if trolls spam law proposals?
- What if they vote against (or for) all new laws?

Especially since servers only support "several dozen players simultaneously", it seems like it'd be easy for trolls to rove between servers implementing unfair laws.
