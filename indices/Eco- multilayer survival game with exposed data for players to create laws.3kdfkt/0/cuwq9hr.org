Reminds me of wakfu, which tried something like that (shared, global economy that was influenced by player actions), but had to decrease its importance because griefers would just kill all sheep / cut all trees without replanting etc, preventing any other players from gathering the resources.

The law setting is going to be crucial, and whether this is actually playable depends on how sophisticated the law system is. Can you express a concept of ownership? Can you have laws selectively apply to some players but not others?

(edit: oh, actually both land ownership and criminal justice are stretch goals)

I think as a social experiment this looks quite cool. As a game... well, I'd be up for trying it, but I'm not too hopeful ;P
