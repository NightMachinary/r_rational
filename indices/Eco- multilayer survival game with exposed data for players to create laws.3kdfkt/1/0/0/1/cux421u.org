hmm I see your point if the data is too exposed then it's very clear what the issue is and what do to stop it. Do you think there should be less data shown, in your example if we just had the number of deaths and the amount of disease we would have a correlation but that's not proof its the cause.

One of the examples they gave was that if you were a lumberjack and had leveled up into that skill and had the right buildings. Would you not be biased against ay laws stopping form doing your chosen specialisation ?
