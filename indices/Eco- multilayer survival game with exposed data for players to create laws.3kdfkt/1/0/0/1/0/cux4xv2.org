Of course I'd be biased, but I don't think I'd be biased /enough/. If every forest animal is starving to death, then before long /I/ will starve to death. And I think that /only/ lumberjacks will be biased against such laws, and there shouldn't be enough lumberjacks to block those laws when every sane person can see the truth.

I think the concept could work well if there were almost no feedback at all. Pollution is invisible until well after everything is dead, and your only data are population estimates plus or minus 20% whenever you went out and checked. Which you didn't do before the problem because there was no reason to, so you don't know if anything has changed. That way, people can argue over whether problems even exist, or they can invent problems to spite industries they don't like, and different industries can credibly point fingers at each other with no super-detailed graph to solve the matter instantly. We don't know what killed the fish, but there are a lot less now than there used to be. The miners blame the fishermen and the fishermen blame the miners, and the shipping industry is whistling innocently while shredding the scorecards for how many shoals they plowed through for sport.
