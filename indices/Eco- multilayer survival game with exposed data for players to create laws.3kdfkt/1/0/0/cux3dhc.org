I'm not even talking about trolls. The blurb says that tragedy of the commons is the main conflict between players, but that's not really a problem when players can get so much information. Are fish disappearing due to overfishing or pollution or habitat disruption by ocean shipping? Well, here's a graph that shows disease as the primary cause of recent die-offs. Also, the water is black. Everyone agrees that fish disappearing is bad, and everyone agrees that pollution is responsible, and even selfish parties will vote in favor of obvious long-term benefits, or else get easily outvoted by the sane majority. Without trolls, I'm not sure if there can be any meaningful conflict in the system as it is described.
