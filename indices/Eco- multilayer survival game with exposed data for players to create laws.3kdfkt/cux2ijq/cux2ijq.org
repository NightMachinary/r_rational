The video makes it look like things go bad too fast and too obviously to be interesting. Cutting down one tree instantly kills the Earth for five meters in every direction and improper mining sends a wave of death across the land. Then you can look at a graph and see exactly how many deer were killed by hunting versus starvation versus predation.

The "laws" thing seems like it's supposed to explore an interesting friction regarding how conservative we should be, when exactly we should switch from seeking short-term gains to avoiding long-term losses, which of a dozen factors in a problem should be limited, and generally how to interact with a complex interconnected global ecosystem. But it looks like it's /actually/ exploring friction between sensible players and Captain Planet villains.
