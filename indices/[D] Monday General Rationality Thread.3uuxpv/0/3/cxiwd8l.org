You may be interested in [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148319/tragedy-looper][Tragedy Looper]], which tasks players with repeating the same scenario up to a maximum number of times learning what the scenario actually is as they go. It isn't quite /rule/ discovery, but it is discovery of /which rules are currently being applied/. Players then have to take their knowledge of what is happening and actually try to win the scenario.
