FYI (You probably know this, but others may not) Zendo is derived from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis_%28card_game%29][Eleusis]] by Robert Abbott. I think Abbott also designed a chess-like game where you don't know which of your pieces is which (but your opponent does) and you propose moves that are cancelled if illegal. So, that's similar to mastermind (known rules, hidden information) but as a two player chess game.

It turns out that designing interesting scoring to Eleusis is also interesting. I won't say it's difficult, but you have to be careful to make the scoring reward cleverness. You want to build a score system that rewards the rule designer for rules that take different people different amounts of time to decipher. (I've played with poor scoring systems, which might encourage rules designers to put in traps that cannot be determined until a certain time has passed, that's just annoying, and I assure you that people have real trouble grokking systems where rules have delays). None of which applies to your game, but it's interesting.
