  The larger problem is generating rules procedurally in such a way that the rules can be tested and figured out and still be entertaining, which would probably involve too much work.

I'm sure it's possible with the right constraints. For example, chess with new randomly generated pieces. There's quite a library of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece][fairy chess pieces]], with simple rules for generating more.
