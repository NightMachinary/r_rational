I had a dream last week where I lived back with my family (parents/sibling/grandparents) where I grew up. Halfway through the dream I died, and became a ghost. I had moderate poltergeisty powers to flip objects/cause wind bursts, etc. I could not speak, however. Dream me spent a good long while being torn between figuring out how to make my family really rich and going off looking for scientists. Awake me thinks that finding the scientists would probably have been the shortest route to improving life for those I care the most for, but at least dream ghost me was planning on /eventually/ revolutionizing the sciences.
