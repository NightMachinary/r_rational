The Batman is a superhero whose power is to impart wisdom and build super-gear. His power only works if nobody knows about it, but at the same time it feeds off their fear of it.

So he adopts a rich orphan kid and becomes his butler. He dresses the kid in memorable, bat-themed armour to avoid anyone consciously making the connection back to him, and sends him out to beat up bad guys.

His power is useful not only for enhancing the hero, it's also useful for success in business. By imparting wisdom and producing super-equipment for the engineers at their firm, he's able to turn the kid (and himself) from millionaire to billionaire rather quickly.

This only works when fueled by lots of bat-themed intimidation, so he has incentive to keep the kid active in his hobby. Some of that extra money is used to bribe villain actors to stage outlandish heists (which he is careful to prevent the hero from killing or seriously injuring by including a very strict code of ethics in the wisdom package). The police are also on payroll, of course, to prevent questions and so they will do things to enhance the brand, such as shining a Bat Signal on the clouds.
