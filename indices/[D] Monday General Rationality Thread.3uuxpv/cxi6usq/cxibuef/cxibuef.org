  Nine Men's Morris, though I don't think that's usable now that the Assassin's Creed games have increased exposure to it

  Over Thanksgiving I DMed a Hogwarts themed D&D game. As part of the Ravenclaw section, the players were tasked with playing a game against a ghostly opponent, with the catch being that they had no idea what the rules of the game were and could only gain knowledge through watching the opponent's moves or testing the result of some action.
