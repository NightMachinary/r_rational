[Meta]: Would it be worthwhile to suggest to the mods a new weekly thread, "I Want a Rational Version of X", in which all the threads which are more "Hey, wouldn't it be neat if someone wrote..." than "Here's something you can actually read" could be filed?

Also meta: How about adding a list of the standard weekly threads to the sidebar?
