What would you all recommend for completed works that are similar in tastes to the following? I love the length of web serials, but I'm craving closure. What stories have interesting world building, mechanics, and a fulfilling ending? I don't need a web serial format, a book is great too. Not all of these are Rational, but I do love rational works.

- A practical Guide
- Mother of Learning
- Worth the Candle
- Wandering Inn
- Stormlight Archives
- Worm/Twig

Thanks!
