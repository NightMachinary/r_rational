Joe Abercrombie's â€˜First Law' Trilogy. If you enjoy the character and dialogue of PGtE you're liable to especially enjoy this. Abercrombie has the best written characters in published fantasy except George Martin imo. The story is a great fantasy deconstruction though it sets itself up as a by the numbers fantasy before showing you otherwise.

Regarding closure, the trilogy is self contained but it doesn't resolve everything and there are further works set in the world.
