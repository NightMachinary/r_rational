I've recently binge-read Ada Palmer's Terra Ignota series --- well, the first three books of it. The fourth isn't due out for another year. I like the depth and complexity of its worldbuilding, and how that future is extrapolated from our present. The unreliable narrator schtick is neat for how it messes with the complexities of the plotting.

What do you have that's like that?
