Codex Alera is a neat fantasy series by Jim Butcher, set in a world with a magic system that I think this subreddit would really enjoy. A lot of the setting is revealed over the course of the series, so I'll be deliberately vague here: magic works by controlling nature spirits called 'Furies' that come in six flavours: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Wood, Metal. Each has straightforward aspects (if you have a fire affinity you can control fire) as well as one or more subtler abilities (if you have an earth affinity you can amplify your strength).

The first book has, in a lot of ways, a more traditional and less interesting plot than the rest of the series. It's still good, but if you find it decent rather than amazing, I'd recommend reading the second one as well to see if you prefer it. Over the course of the entire six-book series there's geopolitics, espionage, military campaigns, clandestine missions, a bunch of interesting magic and some really really nifty munchkinned solutions.
