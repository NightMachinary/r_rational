Okay, thanks for letting me know. Since you are saying that the books are very different, I might be misremembering the conversation with my sister. I might have assumed that she was suggesting similar books to read when she was just sharing her favorite authors. It was a fairly hectic conversation over the phone after all. Whoops.

Thanks for the feedback.
