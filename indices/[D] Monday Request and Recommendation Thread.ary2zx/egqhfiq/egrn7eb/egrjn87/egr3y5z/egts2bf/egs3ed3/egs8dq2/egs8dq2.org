I have a sister who read that series and she recommended a bunch of authors using similar themes (Gene Wolfe, Jo Walton, Robert Charles Wilson, and Kim Stanley Robinson) and then the book [[https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-Expanse-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0047Y171G][Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse #1]]).

I'm sorry to say that I haven't that book or very much by the authors she mentioned, so I can't really say whether I agree with her or not. The only reason that I could remember the authors she mentioned was because I was looking up the book to refresh my memory and found Ada Palmer's [[https://adapalmer.com/series/terra-ignota/][website]] that talked about the same thing.
