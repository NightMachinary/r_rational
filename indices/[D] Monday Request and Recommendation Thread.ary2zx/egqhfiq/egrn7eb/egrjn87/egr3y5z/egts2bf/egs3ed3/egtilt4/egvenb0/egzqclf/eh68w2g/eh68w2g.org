Something like a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4yvx3c/rt_a_rationalist_in_the_zombie_apocalypse/][rationalist in a zombie apocalypse]] here on this subreddit. Something short that gets across a few rational ideas or is just a good short story.

I am a big fan of Asimov's collection of short stories FYI.
