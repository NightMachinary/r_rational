I've bought a fair amount of ebooks on Amazon recently and I think most of them are books that a lot of people here would enjoy (heck I heard about most of them through here!).

The Preorders:

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJ3B6HN/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o03_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Underlord]] - The sixth book in the Cradle series which is described as a Western Xianxia series. A lot of people here don't really like the Xianxia genre and I agree with their criticisms of how many main characters are very villainous, under-developed enemies and female characters, the economies of cultivation aren't logical, poor scaling in conflict as you go from one city to interstellar in scope, and awkward prose. But I bring up all of these flaws to say that the Cradle series completely avoids all of the typical flaws in Xianxia and has a very smart character who sets out to cultivate smartly instead of bullheadedly.

And the sixth book is coming out in March! (Get the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076G8DVN6/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i4][box set]]. It has the first three books and is cheaper!)

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD46PQZ/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o01_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Exhalation]] - Who here hasn't heard of Ted Chiang, the master of short stories that perfectly appeal to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] crowd? The same guy that we literally use as an introduction to rational fiction. Well, if you enjoyed his first collection, [[https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang-ebook/dp/B0048EKOP0/ref=pd_cp_351_1?pd_rd_w=K0v1f&pf_rd_p=ef4dc990-a9ca-4945-ae0b-f8d549198ed6&pf_rd_r=A80PQ3JHJEM220FS09DV&pd_rd_r=f9e1a320-33d7-11e9-b538-4f27c7c0f394&pd_rd_wg=krXnF&pd_rd_i=B0048EKOP0&psc=1&refRID=A80PQ3JHJEM220FS09DV][Stories of Your Life and Others]], you'll love hearing that the second collection is coming out in....May! (Ugh....really May? I don't think I can wait that long!)

The books you can read right now!:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ary2zx/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/][The Beginner's Guide to Magical Licensing]] - Has a similar start to Unsong where a magical college-graduate, minimum-wage, sweat-shop worker stumbles on a powerful spell and sets out to start his own business competing with the powerful. The parts of the story that follows afterward makes a whole lot more logical sense than Unsong however. (Used to be online for free, but now you'll have to pay the price for your ignorance if you want to read it! (Nah, I [[http://starterserials.com/active/the-beginners-guide-to-magical-site-licensing/the-beginners-guide-to-magical-site-licensing/][lied]].))

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKBSZGF/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o04_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Six Sacred Swords]] - If you liked the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2][Arcane Ascension]] series, but wished there was more dungeonnering and less of school shenanigans, then look no further! In some ways it's a lot like reading a very good DnD session played by really savvy players who never follow the 'standard' way to solve problems.

The author of Six Sacred Swords made a recommendation for [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C75P1R6/][The Ruin of Kings]]. He said that it reads like a Locke Lamora-esque rogue protagonist, telling the story in a style similar to Kvothe, in a setting similar to Game of Thrones. I haven't bought the book yet, but the [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2019/02/05/updates-and-a-quick-recommendation/][review]] was interesting enough that I wanted to include it in my list of recommendations.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074M62D7Y/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o05_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Senlin Ascends]] - I haven't read this yet either, but skimming through it, I see some fair bit of social manipulation/combat that I think people here would like. Plus the Tower of Babel setting is something that appeals very strongly to me.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M5MJY8B/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o07_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Polyglot: NPC REVOLUTION]] - A lot of people here seem to really like LitRPG and Artificial Intelligence, but almost no one seem to ever question the implications of the NPCs in LitRPG stories having human-level intelligence.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LDFSPFW/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o07_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Small Medium: Big Trouble]] - It's by the same author who wrote [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078KGS4V4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1][Threadbare]] that people here really liked. Similar to Polygot where the NPC is the main character who needs to deal with players, but smaller scale in scope. There's a lot of fast-talking to convince selfish sociopaths to do what you say.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DYJTKN/ref=oh_aui_d_asin_title_o07_?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Q is for Quantum]] - I was going through my older ebook orders when I found this one. It's the single best introduction for quantum mechanics that I have ever read (not that I've read too many of those). It focuses on building an intuition for the subject and once you've read through the book, you will understand on a gut level what superposition /means/. Note that it's meant as an introduction for the subject, so don't expect it to cover everything, just what's need to get started learning about quantum mechanics. But I'd still recommend it to experts if only for a better way to explain their subject to their peers and laypeople.
