[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/77470/the-lunar-rebellion][The Lunar Rebellion]] by Chengar Qordath(My Little Pony). Set I think 800 years before the events of the show, it's about an attempted secession of Pegasi from Equestria that balloons into a full civil war. It's set in the author's wider Winningverse, which is a massive interconnected fanfic My Little Pony universe. The Winningverse tries to follow show canon generally, but has a massive amount of lore built up in basically all the areas the show doesn't explicitly cover, from the lives of background characters to how the government functions to a variety of magical monsters. I think The Lunar Rebellion is a good place to start, just don't read the comments section if you want to avoid spoilers since being that this is set 800 years in the past a lot of the future events have already been spoiled by other works in the universe.
