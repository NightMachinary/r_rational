After years of reading fanfiction, I've become almost unreasonably angry about the Stations of Canon, canon rehash, and the authors' general blind adherence to the original material, even when it's detrimental to the kind of story /they/ want to tell.

So, with that in mind, please recommend me fanfics that /completely/ disregard canonical events (and optionally the canonical setting as well) and just do their own thing. Preferably plot-focused action stories with a lot of (fresh) worldbuilding, but I'll take what I can get.

A couple of examples of what I have in mind:

Thanks in advance.
