The first story I thought of was, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]]. It's a Harry Potter fanfic about Ron who goes back in time when he dies to his birth. He's from the canon series and thinks that's the world he lives in, but not only is he wrong and is in an AU, but he also starts changing things to be wildly more strange starting with him being sorted into Slytherin.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/][My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected]] is also a good example. It basically takes a main character who is very unusual to the setting and he basically takes a hammer to the stations of canon. I mean, some canon events still occur, but every time the event starts they always proceed in a wildly different manner and the few exceptions just happen off-screen. (It's possible to read without any knowledge of the original works and still enjoy it).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] is a RWBY fanfic where the author takes the cast and dumps them in a RPG-like setting which means the canon line of events are completely ignored. Some of the author's other stories ignore canon too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11809400/1/Arc-Reaction][Arc Reaction]] is another RWBY fanfic by a different author who usually ignores the stations of canon as well. It's set after the first three seasons of RWBY (the later seasons were aired after the story was published) with a Jaune Arc who never went to Beacon, but is basically Iron Man.

I think I can suggest even more, but I would prefer that you ask for ones from a specific fandom that I can search through.
