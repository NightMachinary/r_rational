Glad to see that someone's enjoying my recommendations!

It's one of the stories in the list of recommendations that I posted above. I just didn't specify which one because the character in question being asexual is a major spoiler of an early plot point in the story.

/Cough/ Spoilers up ahead. Proceed with caution. /Cough/

The story that I was referring to is Monster Girl City: Ace Detective. After all, 'ace' can refer to someone who is asexual or to someone who is a detective. It's totally a cheesy pun that had me doubled over laughing when I realized it!
