Have you read Blindsight and Echopraxia? They have good near transhumanism body horror and lots of very plausible edrich going on. Don't read them if real existential horror will bother you, thou.

Less Bio and more Eldritch Horror, subtype dark comedy, you might try the laundry files. The body horror doesn't really start until the Apocalypse codex.

The second Baru Cormorant book has a bit of a biofantasy thing going that might be interesting
