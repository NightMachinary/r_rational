Echopraxia is the sequel to blindsight set on Earth and in the solar system, oh there are transhuman biological borganisms, you will want to read it. 'nuff said.

I'd read the Laundry files from the beginning for the comedy, but the eldritch dials up as it goes along. You've stepped in with the seventh book when the masquerade has been ripped wide open and the original characters are off the board, because they are too big and spooky to be in the story until they have to be big damn heroes in the next book (for the levels of heroic the series allows). If nothing else it might be fun to go see who the characters journey from humanity to whatever it is they become if only because fans like me were disappointed they barely appeared in the Nightmare stacks, or you could just jump into the Delirium brief but that would heavily spoiler some really good books previous books that get tied in.

Baru Cormorant first book was medieval fantasy/fiction exploring finance, colonialism, and politics in a world where something like China's bureaucracy is crossed with the british empire and focuses on a rebellious bureaucrat who wishes to destroy the empire that destroyed/civilized (ugh) her homeland by gaining power within it . There's a robust worldbuilding with some implausibly conditioned people. The second book is where more biopunk-ish elements cme in with one of the factions pursuing what may be cancer fueled immortality. The first book really impressed me and it's character is well described it's this discussion of what she'd say to other characters in fiction:[[https://www.tor.com/2015/08/27/how-baru-cormorant-would-overthrow-emperor-palpatine-kill-voldemort-and-stop-sauron/][How Baru Cormorant Would Overthrow Emperor Palpatine Kill Voldemort and stop Sauron]] The second book was kind of disappointing to me because it seems like it's abusing a lazy radiation trope but the rest of the world building is solid enough and there are enough hints that there will be an adequate explanation because this world seems to be quite old that I'll probably give it another two books to right itself, well that and I like to the main character.

I gave Semiosis a miss it looked like it might be fun, but it might be another Wool. My to read stack has been light lately so I might grab it some time soon. I've found it really hard to find suspension of disbelief satisfying biopunk stories after reading a lot of Watts, I've read most of Watts though and it's worth it.
