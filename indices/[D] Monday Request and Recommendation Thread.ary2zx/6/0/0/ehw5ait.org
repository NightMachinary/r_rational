I'm halfway through Blindsight. Have not heard of Echopraxia nor Baru Cormorant. Can I get a little synopsis for each series?

I read The Nightmare Stacks for laundry files but don't know where to go from there. Should I just read it from the beginning?

Have you read Semiosis? Do you feel like it falls in that category?
