I thought about that, but I have a hard time coming up with a timeline that makes sense. Magic would have to be out of commission since at least the Middle Ages, but it was a legitimate institution for thousands of years prior to that in nearly every civilization. Why would magic suddenly shut off for just over a thousand years and turn back on just as strong?

That's why I'm interested in the idea of immortals going mad. The first humans to discover magic became immortal and were worshipped as gods, but their children saw them all go insane from millennia of experiences so they rebelled and became the new rulers of the world. They thought themselves more civilized, including toward mortals, but eventually went mad themselves.

It was only recently that they came to this revelation and responded by hastily casting a spell that reset all of their memories. Now they only remember fragments about their past and powers, and have lost track of magic and monsters they'd locked away for safe-keeping. They're as hungry for lost knowledge as everyone else but even more afraid of it.

That allows for uber-powerful beings who are aloof and manipulative in a way that lends itself to supernatural adventures. They want people to find what they've lost because they don't remember anything about it and may not trust themselves with it. They have a lot of magical power but most of their memories are warnings against how they've used it.

EDIT: This could also explain the origin of the cults. Many old gods couldn't be completely destroyed, but only rendered powerless. There are a handful of humans that can hear their whispers through the cracks in their prison, where they've gone full Lovecraft. The immortals have been fighting back against these cults for centuries, but have suddenly stopped.
