This might be a good setting for cyclical magic. The power of magic waxes and wanes through the centuries, and after a long period of having almost completely left from the world, it's back in a big way. Old ruins are once again lit up with eldritch power, artifacts thought to be artistic curiosities are displaying their true powers, etc.

The major benefit of this approach is that there's a reason for remote tribes and defunct empires to have stuff worth seeking out: those things were built when magic was around and are now actually worth something again. It also creates some of the lost maps, lost knowledge, lost people, etc. and justifies a Scramble for Africa vibe. Knowledge gets lost because it becomes useless for a generation or two. And now magic is back, but people have airplanes and diesel engines, meaning that seeking out these lost treasures is much more likely to show a return on investment.

It /also/ gives a reason for the existence of secret societies and cults, since especially forward-thinking magical organizations would develop practices and traditions that would allow them to endure during dry spells when magic is gone from the Earth, waiting for its return (but a particularly long dry spell might decimate these organizations, who are composed almost entirely of people who have only heard stories of magic, and those who believe in spite of evidence are perhaps not the best candidates for furthering their organization's goals).
