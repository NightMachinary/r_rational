I feel compelled to devise a rational setting for pulpy adventures. The way I want the world to work is that lost knowledge and magic once sealed away is being rediscovered in the 1920s by wealthy industrialists, mad scientists, crime syndicates, and sinister cults. In response, a new movement of underdog heroes rise up to stop them with their wits, fists, and guts. Think a more noir Gargoyles meets a more dieselpunk Indiana Jones.

The key is coming up with a justification for why only now is everyone hunting for mythical treasure, lost civilizations, and fragments of occult knowledge to perform dark rituals or build magitech. I like the idea of ancient conspiracies of mages sealing away dark powers, only for their rule over humanity to collapse during World War I so now the muggles are starting to catch on and getting more proactive.

I want the magic system to be more ritualistic and impersonal, spells don't have much symbolism but plenty of rules and loopholes. I feel like taking inspiration from El Goonish Shive, where magic is an external force mages tap into to cast spells they /earn/ rather than /learn/ or develop themselves. EGS also has Immortals who reset their memories to avoid turning into Fair Folk, so that idea might be useful for the backstory.

So I need some help to take these broad ideas and rationalize them into a consistent mythology that the characters learn over time. I want the universe to be expansive, yet easily fragmented into small pieces that don't immediately effect each other. I don't need The Masquerade to stick or the effects of the supernatural to stay small after being released, just a reason why the setting starts that way so heroes can punch villains over it.
