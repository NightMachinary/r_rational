  Magic would have to be out of commission since at least the Middle Ages, but it was a legitimate institution for thousands of years prior to that in nearly every civilization

I'm going to try to make this work for you:

Being a legitimate institution doesn't mean being turned on continuously. Let's say that at the start start magic is around for 99 years every 100, so it's a fact of life. That one year magic doesn't work is called a "year of drought" or whatever, and maybe there's also a "festival year" where magic is stronger, once per century. It waxes and wanes slowly, perhaps being at a peak in 5000 BCE, 2000 BCE, 1 CE, and, I don't know, 800 CE.

After 800 CE the years without magic are the rule rather than the exception, but there's still, say, 20 out of every century (perhaps in 5 blocks of 4 years). Magic exists enough that people are aware of it, have seen magical things with their own eyes. The mage guilds are aware that magic is not reliable, sothey come up with illusions and mentalism to cover for them: so they're always able to make a rabbit come out of the hat, but sometimes they create the rabbit and more often the rabbit is hidden at the bottom, so to speak.

Finally, come, say, 1200 CE, magic is only around one year every century, or a few days, the institutions of mages almost completely collapse, and they stop trying: perhaps a high-powered century rocks up without any mages being aware enough of magic to do anything about it; or perhaps those mages are written off as cheap tricks.

Then in your setting, the magic comes back, and stays. Maybe c. 1850 CE, all of a sudden, the mage guilds start recovering their lost arts and the Heroes Who Punch Things start to take notice 70 years after that.

You can refine it further by saying that the magic that "works" is what changes, or changes in addition to whether magic itself works or not: in the 1600s, perhaps only reading entrails worked, so the handful of remote tribes that read entrails were living in a magical paradise whilst the rest of the world who had abandoned that practise suffered through famines they couldn't predict.

Finally, another option is something like the astrological "ages", which last 2,000 years, which allow you to skip all the time since Ancient Rome. Wikipedia says: /According to different astrologers' calculations, approximate dates for entering the Age of Aquarius range from AD 1447 (Terry MacKinnell) to AD 3597 (John Addey)/ - so you can chuck the Age of Aquarius's beginning in the 1900s with no problem. You can say that the previous age (Capricorn) was a magic-free age (handwave a reason, or perhaps say t hat magical ages and non-magical ages alternate: as long as your story lasts less than 2,000 years it doesn't matter) and that the age before that (Sagitarrius) was a magical age.
