Re: chemical persistence -- Depo-Provera is an intra-muscular injection so it diffuses out into the bloodstream more slowly over time. Either our liver detoxifies and excretes our waste into the GI tract, or our kidneys pump it out of nephrons into our urine. Nanites need a method to bypass both systems OR have a home base for replication within the body. The heart is not a good candidate unless it's stuck on the heart valves (aka endocarditis). the spleen would be a better fit; it's a humoral organ also located on the left side of the body, just below the rib cage. Perhaps vampires have to be staked in the spleen to interrupt their nanites and make them bleed out.
