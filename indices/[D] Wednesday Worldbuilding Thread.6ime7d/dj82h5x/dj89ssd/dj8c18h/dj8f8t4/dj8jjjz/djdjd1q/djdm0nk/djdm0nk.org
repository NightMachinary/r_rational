  Depo-Provera is an intra-muscular injection so it diffuses out into the bloodstream more slowly over time.

Ahh, crap.

However: vampire!byproducts could be inserted into the muscle tissue during the feeding process, though if that's the case, the preferred bite locations of vampires are not very muscley since they're where arteries hit the top (neck, wrist, elbow, inner thigh).

I don't like the idea of vampires passing nanites into the creatures they feed on, because it would kill the masquerade once pathology becomes routine as people would see blood in the microscopes.

Do you have any suggestions for how complex "drugs" can be introduced to the body so they can persist for ~30 days? I mean, there are some drugs that are taken e.g. orally that have long half-lifes, right? I know they vary a lot by person, but still...

  The heart is not a good candidate unless it's stuck on the heart valves (aka endocarditis). the spleen would be a better fit

Hmmm. My vampire creation ritual involved a vampire vomiting a horrific black sludge into e.g. the aorta of a recently dead individual. It's not pretty and it's not guaranteed, but it works a lot of the time.

The idea is that vampires were created by an advanced civilisation ("Atlantis"), and they were usually propagated surgically. Much like with cane toads and Jurassic Park, the Atlanteans underestimated the vampires and they were able to come up with a rough and dirty equivilent of the surgical procedure, involving, like I said, vomiting vampire propagating sludge into a corpse, and that is how vampires became self-sustaining and an all around plague.

But there's no reason it has to be the heart; the spleen could work instead. Though from a quick image search, it doesn't look like the spleen has a "giant tube you can direct your vomit into" like the heart does. But there's no reason that the vampires can't be Wrong About The Heart being the best place to use for propagation; perhaps the spleen would be better, and the heart is just OK. The success rate is on the order of 30-50%, more if the corpse is from an otherwise healthy person. (Part of the failure rate is the nanites taking a DNA snapshot from e.g. tumor tissue rather than healthy tissue, so they don't have a "good" DNA template to base their replication on)

At the end of the day, none of the living vampires are old enough to know their true origins, so their knowledge of their nature is a game of telephone and they are wrong about a lot of things.

So: the heart works fine for propagation, but if you want to stake a vampire, you have to hit them in the spleen. When it comes time for it, I can imagine carefully describing the location of the spleen, and have the Hunter say "I hit him in the heart with my crossbow", just to get the readers mad. But she'd probably know the difference since the spleen is actually a decent way away.... Maybe a scene where she first meets a vampire, aims for the heart, misses, hits the spleen, but the vampire falls? Hmmmm....

Thanks for your post! It was very interesting :)
