Hmmm, that could work, actually: I've have to talk to my husband (mathematician with special interest in higher dimensional shapes) to see if it could work. It might interfere with my aesthetic desire to have the forms joined at only the heart, though. But it does minimise the number of forms very nicely.

Then again, 4D shapes are impossible to visualise /anyway/, so not being able to visualise a vampire "leaning" into 4D to "pick them up" is kind of expected....
