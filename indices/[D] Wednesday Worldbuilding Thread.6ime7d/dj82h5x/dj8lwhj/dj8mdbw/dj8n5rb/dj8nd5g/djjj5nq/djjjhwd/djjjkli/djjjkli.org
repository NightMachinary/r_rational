If it's possible, then that opens up a lot of room for body horror (if that's your thing) and also gives vampires lots of tricks to learn and employ. I imagine that "pulling" fangs would be instinctive or at least easily-learned, but pulling on other stuff might be more difficult on average (and yet, for the clever vampire, full of possibilities).
