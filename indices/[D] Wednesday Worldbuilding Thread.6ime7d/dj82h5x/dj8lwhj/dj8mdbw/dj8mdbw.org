That's definitely a new one, and very elaborate!

I'm having trouble visualising it, so I'd love it if you could give me a hand!

These muscular appendages: are they on the roof of the mouth? The inside of the jaw/facial muscles?

"Clustered prehensile teeth" - I don't understand. Do you mean on a microscopic scale, the fangs might look kind of like [[http://www.cabletrade.com.au/CtgImg/Fibre%20Optic%20Cable.jpg][fibre optic cables]] ?

How does the muscular tissue being hollow take an effect? The pressure in an artery is high enough that the vampire doesn't need to provide suction, and the blood just goes down the throat into the lungs so the human respiratory system does that fine (... I've just realised vampires could snort blood to drink it, if they felt the urge.)

Like, I guess where I'm having trouble is, what actually is the muscular appendage that allows the "fractal" teethlets to move?

And if I was designing something that drank blood, I'm not sure I'd go to the effort of making those fancy fangs when I could just make the incisors (front teeth) a bit sharper like someone else suggested.

That said, I think the idea of fractal appendages is really cool. But I'm not sure if this is the right place to put it.

WAIT, I JUST REALISED:

My vampires can transform into bats. So they can actually transform. SO THEY CAN TOTALLY GROW FANGS NORMALLY AND THEN REVERT TO NORMAL. HOW DID I NOT THINK OF THIS?
