Thanks for the thought, I agree, 2 is the most workable. I think I'll stay away from the kiss/lick: that's a world of darkness thing, and I've already got the concept of ghouls from them (though watered down a bit).

However, fun fact! Vampire bat bites actually look like pulp vampire bites [[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/04/article-0-1886C98900000578-353_634x420.jpg][1]], [[https://cdn20.patch.com/inline_images/44719/1465527788.jpg][2]] , and they [[http://cdn2.arkive.org/media/F2/F24D1381-854B-492C-A82E-1AF761A3246E/Presentation.Small/Common-vampire-bats-open-mouth-showing-teeth.jpg][have fangs to match]].

I'm wary about giving vampires fangs, because I don't want to do retraction like Buffy (the machinery for that in snake mouths is... elaborate), and if we just assume they grow enough tooth tissue to be in a "top 1%" level, I mean, you're looking at [[http://cosmeticdentist.com/pointed%20canines.jpg][something like this at best]] (from a dental cosmetic surgery page). I don't see that being an effective tool for drawing blood. And I don't want to give them obvious fangs as they need to be incognito. So it makes the mechanics of drawing a wound tricky... unless the process of vampirisation causes the teeth to be coated with something that facilitates the piercing process.

Vampires were ultimately created technologically (think Atlantis), and probably run on nanites, so I suppose I could justify extending fangs being made by nanofactories, but the "created by atlantis 5000 years ago" aspect of the mythology is very unlikely to ever come up (I'm writing paranormal romance after all), so I try not to lean on it if it would otherwise look like an ass-pull.
