Way I understood it from some half remembered nature documentary is those are upper and lower jaw points, not left and right fang.

Snake fangs don't retract, they fold back. A human with incisors that fold back would look really weird. And if the fangs retracted, the muscles that extended them would also have to take a human bite force without yielding.

The vampire fangs don't have to be longer, maybe, just sharper. The vampire would sort of gnaw side on to get the short sharp incisor in play, or use blades if they're being all urbane and sophisticated. My mental image of 'vampire' is somewhere between WoD and Buffy.

Wound shape:small but messy.

How does the healing factor work, some kind of beneficent nanobot plague?
