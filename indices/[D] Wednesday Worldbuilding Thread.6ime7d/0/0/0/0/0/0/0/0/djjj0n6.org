  The idea is that vampires were created by an advanced civilisation ("Atlantis"), and they were usually propagated surgically. Much like with cane toads and Jurassic Park, the Atlanteans underestimated the vampires and they were able to come up with a rough and dirty equivilent of the surgical procedure, involving, like I said, vomiting vampire propagating sludge into a corpse, and that is how vampires became self-sustaining and an all around plague.

That's pretty fantastic.

  The success rate is on the order of 30-50%, more if the corpse is from an otherwise healthy person.

Oh no. If I were a vampire, that would seriously make me question whether/when to turn someone into a vampire if that person were irreplaceable in any sense (e.g. I have an emotional connection to this person). I imagine that this would raise the age of the average neonate (because you're waiting till your beloved/pawn is going to die anyway) and/or lower it (so that you can play a numbers game and get your new vampire before you spent any resources on the people who die). Probably raise it.
