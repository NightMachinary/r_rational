To be honest, I'm not sure. I've got a few ideas:

1) Being a janissary, if you can feed a vampire often enough, is good, so I could see an unscrupulous person having a stable of vampires whose services he sells; this has probably happened several times. The vampires occasionally break out.

2) Not all vampires are the same. Perhaps a vampire sect is like the quiverful movement: they think it's their duty to be fruitful, and their children do that too. (problem: that movement would be the biggest, but most vampires that my story encounters aren't from that)

3) After the Catastrophe, they thought it was their duty to expand their population, and so did so, perhaps as a general agreement (problem: I don't want my main vampire, William, to have created a childe. That said, there's no real reason why he couldn't have, and it could have some depth: especially if he didn't actually care about or keep track of the human he turned, he wouldn't necessarily consider it more than an obligation)

4) They produce vampire goo in their digestive system. When it becomes full/ripe, they have an urge to reproduce. (problem: this goes against the "they were meant to be made in labs" theory)

5) Vampire couples might want to have a "vampire baby", and not consider the human they turn of any great moral consequence

6) Young vampires want to have someone lower in the pecking order than them, so make babies

7) A vampire king wants to have subjects

8) To experiment on

9) company you can trust

Big problem: since 1600 CE, the vampire population has gone from ~800 to 20k-40k. This is one new vampire a week, every week, over 400 years. This does not include young vampires who are killed or failed vampires (the majority).

Other way of looking at it: To get to 20,000 vampires, each of the original 800 would need to have made 25 (!) children. As a result of this, young vampires probably trace their lineage directly to one of the 800 Founders

The vampire genesis failure rate is less for young, healthy humans though.

I /think/ we're probably going to have about 100 of the 800 vampires deciding to start their own dynasty, and vampire names/titles to include reference to their ancestor.
