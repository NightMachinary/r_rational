    The idea is that vampires were created by an advanced civilisation ("Atlantis"), and they were usually propagated surgically. Much like with cane toads and Jurassic Park, the Atlanteans underestimated the vampires and they were able to come up with a rough and dirty equivilent of the surgical procedure, involving, like I said, vomiting vampire propagating sludge into a corpse, and that is how vampires became self-sustaining and an all around plague.

  That's pretty fantastic.

Thanks! It was the result of a long and drawn out conversation with my partners, where we were kind of wondering why making a vampire is so hard. (The reason they often bury pre-vampire corpses is because it puts pressure on the wounds, though ancient funerary practises involving wrapping a body in cloth did much the same thing)

  If I were a vampire, that would seriously make me question whether/when to turn someone into a vampire if that person were irreplaceable in any sense (e.g. I have an emotional connection to this person).

Absolutely. It's one of the reasons my vampire doesn't turn his protege into one (well, ultimate; a vampire who wants to keep a human around can turn him into a thrall. It makes them into a slave, more or less, but they keep their personality and all of that, become immortal, and have super powers. Feeding from them no longer becomes a pseudo sexual experience though, but if you like the human enough, it's a great way to keep them around. Plus they are far stronger.

  I imagine that this would raise the age of the average neonate (because you're waiting till your beloved/pawn is going to die anyway) and/or lower it (so that you can play a numbers game and get your new vampire before you spent any resources on the people who die). Probably raise it.

In practise, because you can keep a favoured human alive indefinitely as a thrall, it doesn't do much to it either way since said favoured human wouldn't seem to age. That said, a thrall has few rights in vampire society, and after a minor disagreement, you may end up embroiled in a war to get a particularly favoured thrall back and have to give up more than their "face value", which may cause a hit to your reputation if you can't find a way to take the focus off of you and onto someone else instead... So it's best not to get too attached to your thralls, though it's kind of hard not to.
