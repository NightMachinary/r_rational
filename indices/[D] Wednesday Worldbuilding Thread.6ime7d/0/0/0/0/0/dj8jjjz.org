  A human with incisors that fold back would look really weird

Yeah, that was more or less what I was saying with snake fangs being "elaborate" and leaving it at that. I didn't ever try to understand it as well as you clearly do, but just seeing the structure of the mouth and how it looks so inhuman was enough for me to abandon the concept.

  The vampire fangs don't have to be longer, maybe, just sharper. [...] Wound shape:small but messy.

That's probably a good compromise. Someone posted further down about the teeth being "wider".

  How does the healing factor work

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/b99wv/crossposted_from_rwikipedia_when_asked_how_does/][It works very well, thank you]]; more seriously, yeah, likely something to do with beneficial nanobots that, I guess, quickly die without a vampire body to keep them alive, hence why that effect doesn't last like the other effects do.

The other effects (alertness, senses, etc) are probably based on chemicals that the vampire physiology produces - so essentially, drugs that are somehow able to persist in the body for a month or so. I suppose the depo-povera shot lasts three months, so that's not so unrealistic.
