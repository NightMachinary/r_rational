Let's talk about the physical mechanics of a vampire feeding.

Originally when I wrote my story, I gave the vampire bites a classic "two point" appearance, but in re-evaluating that in a rational lens, it doesn't really make sense. My vampires drink blood through their throat and then lungs (quicker way to the heart than via the stomach), rather than the pulpy "sucking it through the fangs like a straw" that I first envisaged.

Given vampires are going for high-pressure blood in arteries, they're going to need to have some sort of healing factor so the humans don't bleed out afterwards. Vampires can heal supernaturally fast so it's fine that the feeding process heals the human afterwards, we're not adding anything new. (In fact, after being bitten, the human has about a month of reduced need for sleep, sharp senses, improved ability to focus; so adding a healing factor that starts out very strong but quickly decays is not an issue)

So, that leaves us with a few main options for vampire bite appearance (I doubt it's exhaustive but nothing else is coming to me at the moment):

1) Looks like a human bite. Here's an image of a "human bite" makeup to give you an idea: [[http://sometimesalicefx.deviantart.com/art/Human-Bite-528440762]] (contains a realistic bloody wound in case you didn't already guess)

- Pros: realistic
- Cons: probably doesn't bleed very quickly so takes a long time to eat?; is very large so will be obvious (fix: vampires may bite on locations such as the inner thigh rather than the classic neck)

2) They nip and possibly tear a small opening (maybe 0.5cm diameter?)

- Pros: Smaller and not as obvious

- Cons: How did vampires figure this out? (fix: vampires can feed by methods 1 or 2, but adopted method 2 to maintain the masquerade); also, are human teeth actually capable of it?

3) They don't bite but use a knife, nails, etc to make the hole

- Pros: very small hole, definitely possible

- Cons: vampires being dependent on a knife to feed is dumb (fix: see #2); being bitten has a very sensual component to it that the knife doesn't; My Vampires /have/ to feed from humans in order to dispose of their waste products, so adding an artificial link in there seems contradictory to the spirit (though not in reality)

4) Don't specify in-story exactly what the bite looks like, just leave vague references to a wound

- Pros: Don't have to worry about this

- Cons: Super cop-out; don't have the opportunity to tell the reader that these vampires Make More Sense as without being informed the wound was different than "classic pulp vampire", people might assume it was

So... I'd be interested in anyone's thoughts on what a Rational vampire's bite might look like.
