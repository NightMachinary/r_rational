The way transformation works uses 4-dimensional space, so they are limited to 3 forms total, more or less (not really, but it's easier that way). So I have "bat", "human", and "fangs". So if I declare they do their fangs via transformation, then I can't make my vampires turn into wolves or whatever else they might transform to. Also, abusing the transformation thing as a deux ex machina is a bit unsatisfying: then again, feeding is literally what a vampire was made to be able to do, so it makes sense that would be an "on-board" ability. Hmmm.

Also, it might have some knock-on effects like vampires become more-or-less invulnerable when feeding, depending on how 4D physics works with their brains and whatnot.
