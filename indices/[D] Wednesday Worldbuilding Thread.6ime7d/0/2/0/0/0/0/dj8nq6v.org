Maybe bat and wolf are two optional "animal forms", and the fangs are a standard "feeding form". Perhaps some vampires are lacking the feeding form and has to go about in a more messy way (maybe they have 2 animal forms instead, and feed in one of those).

Playing around with extra dimensions would also allow a vampire to drink much more blood than should fit in his body.
