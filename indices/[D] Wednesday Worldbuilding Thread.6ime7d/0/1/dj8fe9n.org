I prefer 2. If you're not constrained by actual dentistry, I think making an incisor that's incredibly sharp is the way to go - a tooth that gets much more narrow than a human tooth does, but looks the same if you're facing the vampire head-on. You then only need "fangs" that extend a short distance past the other teeth, or perhaps the other teeth are dull and meant to hold the skin/artery in place during the bite, rather than piercing the skin.

I agree in principle with Vampires Make More Sense, but you still want something that's recognizably a vampire.
