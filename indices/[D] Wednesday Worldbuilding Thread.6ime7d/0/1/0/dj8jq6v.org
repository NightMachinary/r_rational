Thanks for your thoughts!!

  If you're not constrained by actual dentistry

What do you mean by "actual dentistry"? As in, the teeth don't have to be identical to human teeth? Or do you mean, like, having a dentist able to tell the difference?

  I think making an incisor that's incredibly sharp is the way to go - a tooth that gets much more narrow than a human tooth does, but looks the same if you're facing the vampire head-on.

Hmmm. The fact you said incisor and not canine is intriguing. I like the idea of the vampire's front teeth being sharp (like a knife blade), and the incisors tend to be longer than the rest of the teeth anyway.

Plus, the thought of a vampire with buck teeth... just tickles me.

  I agree in principle with Vampires Make More Sense, but you still want something that's recognizably a vampire.

Yeah, and I don't think "two fangs that extend" is necessary for the vampire to be a vampire; I'm more, "as long as he's immortal, strong, and drinks blood", it doesn't matter how they drink the blood.
