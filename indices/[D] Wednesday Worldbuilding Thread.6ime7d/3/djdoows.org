Infections use the strategy of invading white blood cells (like HIV) or red cells (like Malaria) and then lysing the cells when they have propagated.

Perhaps there is a weaker lytic form of the vampire plague passed on through the bite that some of the blood cells excrete the healing factors for 30 days within human hosts. Red cells persist for up to 90-days and they don't have any nuclei so they'd just be a shell for the plague to hide in.

Hmmm.. you could derive a whole undead mythology based on the perversion of different white cells. Neutrophils are short-lived suicide bombers, while memory B-cell lymphocytes last a lifetime. A lysogenic viral form that invades the B memory-cells would be very insidious and difficult to get rid of, the perfect host cell for an immortal blood-borne vampire pathogen. The other forms could give rise to different types of ghouls, zombies, and ghasts, all themed around the different white cells like neutrophils(soldier/WoD ghoul), basophils (ichor ghouls), eosinophils(miasma/poison gas ghasts), monocytes (munchy zombies) and lymphocytes (immortal vampires).
