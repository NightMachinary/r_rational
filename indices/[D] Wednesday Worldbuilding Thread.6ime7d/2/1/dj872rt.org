As it turns out, a lightning bolt carries some ~5 gigajoules of energy, while a ton of TNT carries ~4. Turing this into kinetic energy via =W = mv^2 * 0,5= gives us, for one ton of water, a velocity of approximately 3 km/s. That is roughly 15% of escape velocity, and fast enough to reach the ground, from a typical cloud, in about one second.

Naturally, at these energies, you get atmospheric-entry levels of friction. I'm pretty sure you'd see a bright trail as the water jet vaporised itself on its way down.
