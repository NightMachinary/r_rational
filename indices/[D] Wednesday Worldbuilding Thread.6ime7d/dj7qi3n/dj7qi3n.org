So, designing a world from the ground up, similar in many ways to ours but with a lot of physical processes swapped out. Wholly different cycles and ecosystems than our Earth. Not really supposed to be hard-sci-fi realistic, more fantasy-ish, but I do still want the physics to be like ours unless noted.

The point is, in this world, instead of lightning strikes, there are columns of water that fall out of the sky, obliterating what they hit (water moving fast is /powerful/). How thick and tall should a column of water moving around terminal velocity (100-200 mph) be to have similar implications to a bolt of lightning? IE, it'll kill on a direct hit, pose a serious danger to anyone nearby, but not obliterate a city, even if several hit the city in a typical storm?
