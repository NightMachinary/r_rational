A "good" story is one that achieves its goal. That goal might be simply to let the reader down an enjoyable path, it might be to preach an ideology, it might be to expose a hidden truth, or to teach a simple lesson. A good story will keep its audience engaged until the end, and, if there is some lesson or message to convey, will get that message across to the reader, if only subconsciously.

For example: HPMOR is a rational story because its protagonists and antagonist act rationally in pursuit of their goals. It is a /rationalist/ story because it preaches the benefits and methods of rationality. It is a /good/ story because people enjoy reading it through to the end, and, when they put it down, want to think more rationally themselves.

Terry Goodkind's /Wizard's First Rule/ (the first Sword of Truth book), though not rational, is a good book. It's enjoyable to read, and gets the author's message across that you need to make sure you're not just reacting emotionally to what you've been told, believing it because you want it to be true or are afraid that it's true.

/Confessor/, by the same author (the final book in the same series), is a preachy, logically inconsistent mess. It is /not/ a good book. I didn't really want to read the pages-long speech that the character directed at the audience; having read it, I don't want to read it again, and, far from adopting the views of that character, I think he's /monumentally/ stupid for believing them. The book fails utterly, both as an enjoyable read and as a vehicle to spread the author's personal ideology.

You can have good stories that aren't rational, radical stories that aren't good, and stories that are both, or neither. I think that most stories can be made /better/ by having rational plots and characters, but, beyond that, the quality and rationality of a story aren't related much.
