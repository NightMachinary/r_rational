  So what is magic realism, anyway?

Phinneas and Ferb is [[https://www.deviantart.com/tyrannotitan333/art/Magical-Realism-and-Phineas-and-Ferb-755095265][considered an example]].

#+begin_quote
  Characters might discuss Phineas and Ferb doing extraordinary and impossible things on a daily basis, but the framing of the show never treats them like they're fantastical or beyond this world. In a more realistic setting Phineas and Ferb would be hailed as child prodigies and use their inventing skills to rapidly advance the world's technology and solve all our problems. The show however simply has them having fun with what they do or using their skills to help people like their friends. To Phineas and Ferb, defying the laws of reality is daily routine.

  "You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualise a whole cat's anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?"
