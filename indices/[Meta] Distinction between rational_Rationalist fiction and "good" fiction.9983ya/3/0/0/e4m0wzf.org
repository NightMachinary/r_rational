Oh dang, the Pokemon Professor himself! Big fan, love the podcast, etc....

To be fair, it's been almost a decade since the month I spent poring through the original version of the text, using a translation book to work my way through the novel. I came out of it feeling drained: the story started as a sprawling epic and ended like a Greek tragedy. It gave me the same feeling I felt so often with rational(ist) fiction: that your Ur-protagonist was careening toward a bad ending because they put emotional pragmatism and socipathy over social awareness and incorporating other people (and their emotions/values) into your model.

I liked your review, and honestly, I need to reread the book to see if I feel the same in my 30s as I did in my early 20s. At the time it felt poetic and fatalistic. Not sure that would be the case nowadays!
