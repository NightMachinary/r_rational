That's a good example.

I don't notice any differences in the sidebar from earlier today, so I'm pretty sure it's the same one I showed him. I thought it was excellent.

I had to expand on the points a bit. He basically thinks rationalist fiction is fiction that avoids stupidity tropes and favors an intelligent protagonist, as opposed to other types of protagonists (strong, brave, etc.)

To me, it's... bigger than that. It's a trust thing. It feels like I can trust the author, and by extension the MC, to be sensible. Rational, I suppose :P That I shouldn't be able to easily come up with a far superior plan than the stated intelligent characters of the story - or if I do, there's something I missed. That my suspension of disbelief doesn't have to be brutalized.

He did find the sidebar more compelling than my own take. Still, he feels like "well made fiction that features intelligent characters" isn't distinct enough to be a sub genre. And I can't seem to convince him that it's beyond that.
