I still have to read up on the sidebar discussion (new job, getting up to speed) but have a virtual coffee, for clearly articulating what we should consider doing, as also illustrated by [[/u/derefer][u/derefer]] being the top comment with his proof by negation.

Caveat: this may have been discussed but seems like a good idea.

Edit: [[/u/ArisKatsaris][u/ArisKatsaris]] If this hasn't been brought up (it's going to be two months to never, before I can give the sidebar discussion the level of attention it deserves, if I want to follow up on this idea, and you seem to care and have spent time on the effort); would you please follow up if this is an idea with merit, worth the effort, if a continuing improvement process has been instituted?
