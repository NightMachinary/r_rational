Hmm, this is interesting. I think in many ways the best fiction has a lot of irrational actors, primarily driven by their emotions. Which is a good description of what humans and society really are, and in many cases rational characters don't exist in the real world. These irrational characters behave a lot like us and are relatable and deal with issues that face a lot of us in many ways, many of them poorly.

For a great example, I'm gonna go with TV, Bojack Horseman is something I'd say has a lot of irrational characters dealing with depression, ennui and unhappiness and most can't articulate their thoughts and actions well, but behave in relatable ways. Bojack doesn't solve any of his issues by thinking about anything rationally and his betrayals, breakups and friendship's don't make a lot of outward sense. But it speaks to that depressed and destructive side of us. Other books like catch 22 god of small things, the sellout are some great novesl that have characters primarily driven by emotion.

Rational fiction is still a young genre in many ways and to criticise it, is to criticise something that is not quite fully formed. A lot of the work doesn't quite approach anything resembling literature and they are in many ways superior versions of pulp fiction. By ensuring there are no idiot balls and Deus ex machinas there are no distractions to the reader and by generally having great flow with plenty of foreshadowing it's very narratively satisfying. The trope lampshading is a cheap source of humour and has become a bit of a hallmark but doesn't inform. Conflict is primarily driven by agents with opposing goals rather than emotional conflict.

I find that as much as I love rational fiction, I also find myself unable to relate to any of the characters in any way. The only exception has been worth the candle, in which we have a lot of hallmarks of rational fiction and emotional conflict is present in allies rather than enemies. But this too has a very large overarching plot, a call to action and high stakes. Add: Twig is a much better example, though again a huge overarching plot is required.

Are there other recognised works of literature that I'd consider rational? Of all my reading, I'd be hard pressed to even find a rational character in traditional literature, with Sherlock being the closest and only one I can think of, though maybe others may have thoughts.

Overall, i think your friend is not wrong - rational fiction is definitely fiction done right, but I also think rational fiction is still finding it's feet and a lot of the work is more comparable to pulp fiction that established lit.
