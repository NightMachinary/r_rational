IMO, cutting out all the pedantry it boils down to this:

​

Rationalist Fiction: fiction written to teach the scientific method (or derived methods) to the reader though characters applying it to solve their own problems in the story. Generally has to also be also rational fiction to have this work out.

Rational Fiction: fiction written with the hard rule that the philosophy of science is correct baked into the world-building and narrative. And the soft rule that most major characters should be rational people (to within the tolerances with which one must define "rational" for there to exist "rational" people in the real world).

​

The problem, is that second definition is hard to apply. (to the point of not being very useful)

It's hard to distinguish between the story is set in a "dualist" world, vs a "physicalist but souls are a physical phenomenon" world, or between "science doesn't work on magic" and "an 11 year old poorly crafted several of his early experiments to understand magic", or between "John made that mistake because it furthers the plot" and "John made that mistake because he has a cognitive bias which influences his otehr actions as well (which the author gave him because it furthers the plot)". And it's even harder to write concise rules for the general case that someone not already familiar with the genera can use on arbitrary fiction to determine if it is "rational".

​

So, most functional definitions of rational fiction focus on things that are easy to identify (usually internal consistency) and end up reading like generic good writing advice because the scale and end goal of presenting a Scientific story doesn't get properly communicated.
