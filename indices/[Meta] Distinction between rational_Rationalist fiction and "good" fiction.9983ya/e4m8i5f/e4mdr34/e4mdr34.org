Much appreciated!

I think a lot of that boils down into, "rational (ist) fiction favors a certain subset of 'Cool Stuff,' which aligns with Good Writing in some ways (partially due to it being incompatible with certain forms of Bad Writing), but ultimately Brust's theory applies in that this specific subset only appears to be quintessentially Good Writing if you're the target audience, as it were."

Which is a helpful perspective.

I am sure he'll love rationalist writing, though, which is why the topic came up in the first place. He's convinced fanfics are universally awful, and that's why he's so curious about HPMOR. If he doesn't love it, I'll be sad.

I thought The Sword of Good was the best introduction, because it shifts from a parody non-rationalist story at the end, but for some reason, they keep deciding to do other things instead of reading it. It's like 20 minutes...
