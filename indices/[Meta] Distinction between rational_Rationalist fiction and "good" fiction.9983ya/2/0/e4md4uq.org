Another thought - based on some replies here, it might be a good idea to have a thing on the sidebar that lists some examples. Lord of the Rings, Hamlet, and Harry Potter are good examples of good fictions that aren't rationalist. The Dresden files are in the fuzzy zone, and plenty of others are, too, I'm sure - Flowers for Algernon, maybe.
