  He was saying that... the rational/rationalist subgenre (?) is just a fancy way of describing stories that are "done properly."

Nope. No way. I love rational and rationalist fiction, but Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite authors. Magical realism is about as far from rationality as possible, but his novels grasped me and pulled me in like nothing else. Heck, my username is based off "Cien años de soledad" The common thread is "meta-narrative is my drug of choice," but clearly it doesn't need to be rational to ensnare me.
