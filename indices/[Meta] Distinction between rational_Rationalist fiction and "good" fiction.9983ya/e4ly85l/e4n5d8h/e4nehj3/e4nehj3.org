It's stories that aren't properly fantasy but aren't properly realist either. Usually they're set in the real world, but there are surreal or supernatural elements - however, they're not lampshaded or even drawn attention to, but they're just part of the reality everyone experiences. A big thing is also that they're not /explained/ - they're lived on a spiritual/emotional level, not a rational one. If magic has rules, it's just science yet to be discovered, after all.

Examples:

- a story about a man seeing ghosts but it's all in his mind is realist
- a story about a man seeing ghosts and finding out that he needs to exorcise them with a certain method or he will die is fantasy/horror
- a story about a man going on about his normal life and meanwhile happening to see ghosts which is, like, the most natural thing in the world and doesn't surprise him in the least is magical realism.

You want to read magical realism, I'd suggest Isabel Allende's "The House of the Spirits" or Italo Calvino's "Our Ancestors" trilogy (especially "The Cloven Viscount", one of my all-time favourites). Calvino's not classic magical realism - usually that's south american authors - but I think he too can be considered an expression of the genre.
