Does your friend understand tropes?

I ask because rational fiction does things because of reasons, instead of because of tropes. Good thinking is not just first layer pattern matching. Whether defying tropes because the world runs on detail, is a definition of "good fiction" or not, says more about the critic making the judgment's personal taste than the about the fiction.

I hope that helps.
