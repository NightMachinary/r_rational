Please have him read the updated sidebar, and please to offer his opinion on it. Let us know what he thinks. (There /will/ be small tweaks to it in the near future as well, so any contribution from an outside perspective is genuinely useful)

The problem your friend mentions is one of the primary reasons we changed the sidebar, after 5 weeks of deliberation, discussion and voting (you can see the final results and links to the previous weeks at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/93aqlu/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/]] )

To offer an example of what I consider excellent but non-rational fiction, consider "Lord of the Rings".
