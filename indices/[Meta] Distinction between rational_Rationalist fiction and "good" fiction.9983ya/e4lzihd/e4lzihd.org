My favorite distinction between rational fiction and good fiction is that rational fiction tries to actively reward thinking, either on the part of the characters or the reader. It is a /genre/ that communicates what sorts of challenges the plot will contain and how the characters will have to overcome them: by using clear and demonstrable thinking, rather than physical might or social power or a triumph of will.
