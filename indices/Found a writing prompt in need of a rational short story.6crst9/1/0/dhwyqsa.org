Only in the last third, which I thought was the worst part of the whole story. I didn't exactly like the rest of the film, there were some really stupid plot points and painful dialogue, but it was at least thematically consistent up until that twist came out of nowhere.

The movie suddenly went from being about a depressed asshole Superman finding meaning in his life by paying his debts to society and becoming a superhero to Hancock discovering his publicist's wife is coincidentally his long lost mate who saps his powers.
