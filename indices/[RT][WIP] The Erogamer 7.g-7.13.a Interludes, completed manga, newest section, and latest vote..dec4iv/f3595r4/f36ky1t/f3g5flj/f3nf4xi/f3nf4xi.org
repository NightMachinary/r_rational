Oh gosh. I haven't read the latest chapters and it's been a while. The story covers lots of fetishes. Tons of BDSM type stuff. Tons of Exhibitionism. Lots of mind bending and disturbing philosophy as the world slowly transforms until everything is about sex.

If you are talking about the Rape, the readers pretty much voted against it for the majority of the story. Eventually the author was like "look guys, rape is my fetish so it's happening. You can either have the character experience it on their own terms or I'll just write it into the story somewhere". I'm paraphrasing badly, but the forum was persuaded to vote for a rape scene in which the main character put herself in a situation where she knew she would be raped. MC thought she could handle it but it ended up being worse than she expected. The entire scene is point of view from her and every detail is described including her mental state. She is mentally harmed from the experience and takes a while to recover. I haven't read everything after that but there may be more rape scenes later.
