I think you're misremembering some things about how he expressed the thing about the rape.

For starters, the voters *did* vote for the rape in question -- it was only *after* the majority voted for it, and some people were upset about the outcome of the vote, that he said (in part to console the people in question I think) that the rape would have eventually to be dealt with anyway -- but he didn't say something as blunt "I'll just write it into the story somewhere" AFAIK.

And IIRC he didn't bring up anything about it being "his fetish" or not, he said that from a Doylist perspective, Cindy has this part-fear, part-kink, part psychological hangup, that made her being raped to have to be dealt with *eventually*, (and he also said that there had been points in the story already were a different worse roll, might have led her to encounter rape already -- e.g. in the strip club, where a bad roll had already led her to be harassed and blackmailed -- it could have been even worse with as worse roll)
