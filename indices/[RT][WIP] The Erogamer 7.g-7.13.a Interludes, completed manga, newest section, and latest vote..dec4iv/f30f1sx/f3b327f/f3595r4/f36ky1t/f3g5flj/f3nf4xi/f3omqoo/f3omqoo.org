These are the content warnings as the author describes them in the start of the story:

#+begin_quote
  Content warnings: Body shame, noncon.

  Spoiler: More detailed content warnings.

  *Body* *shame:* The protagonist's view of her universe does not always reflect her universe accurately. And her universe may not reflect the beliefs or values of the author. That said, this protagonist is definitely not fat-positive.\\
  *Noncon:* Noncon is not a primary focus of this story, but it's something that happens in eroge, and it's explored to a sufficient extent that anyone who stays away from even non-poorly-executed noncon should stay away from this. By-chapter trigger warnings appear for heavy but not light triggers.

  Further triggers may potentially be added if the story goes there. Loli/shota will never be a thing, and the protagonist is never going to get it on with her Mom.

  Never forget, IRL there's no "dubcon", just con and non. Sane people use condoms and safewords.
