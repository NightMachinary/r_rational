The Marauder concept from Mage: The Ascension is kind of like this. There's a quest on Sufficient Velocity by Panopticon where the Marauder is a conspiracy theorist. A hardcore conspiracy theorist, who thinks her life is the plot of an action movie. At one point, she rides in on a motorcycle and leaps off of it; it /accelerates in mid-air/ and does an action-movie explosion on impact with the baddies.

Anyway, I would imagine that, if this is a phenomenon that can be trained by prior experience, you could raise a child from birth to have very specific experiences - like, whenever they made a certain hand gesture, a computer would identify the target, and a sniper rifle would shoot it. Once their power activated, they wouldn't need the rifle anymore. What about virtual reality? Raise a child in a virtual reality, and the rules of that place would follow them into the real world.
