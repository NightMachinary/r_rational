  How can you acquire information that surprises you -- that you don't expect -- if the world that you perceive changes specifically to fulfill your expectations?
#+end_quote

Simple: My 'subconscious' expects to be truly surprised. It would be surprised if the information it receives is generated by its own expectations rather than by the information-feeding lobe.

Perhaps it's more simple to put it like this: I'd sort of split myself into two people. One a blank slate low-control reality warper and the other a high-control internal self-modifier, where the former LÃ¶b-believes the latter to be outside of his control and capable of controlling him, and the latter holds accurate beliefs and determines what kind of information to feed the former.

  Not to mention that altering your brain with that level of precision isn't possible if you're only able to affect reality subconsciously.

What makes a thought "subconscious"? How does the universe decide to make something into law - where do the neural XML tags switch from 'conscious' to 'subconscious'?

As for changing your brain precisely according to your CEV being impossible, /I'm sure it isn't really that hard and that my brain can change itself to work that out/.

  Also, thanks for the tip on relativity! If I now make the authorial decision that the magic is not coded in at a higher level than relativity, what are the implications, in your opinion?

No retroactive causality means that a lot of expectations would be faked by the universe. If I expect to see my friend (healthy) when I open the door in 1 second, and I know what the room looks like, and I don't expect to see any spatial distortion, and my friend is 500 meters away in a different room, the universe can't easily comply with my expectations. Would it create a copy of my friend, with fake memories of coming to this room instead? Would it hijack my senses to make me believe I'm seeing my friend?
