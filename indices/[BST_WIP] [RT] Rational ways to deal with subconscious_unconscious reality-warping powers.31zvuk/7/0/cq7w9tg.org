Unfortunately, it's the grueling mental training that lets you /stay away/ from the two irreversible ends of the scale -- the mental discipline required to merely activate it only takes a month or so of regular meditation exercises. So steps 2 and 3 don't work unless you go into the training already with a super-intuitive understanding of mathematics and a fully-realized CEV, which you wouldn't necessarily know to do.

I'm sort of imagining every character who makes it to the "low-control" stage an UFAI, since remaking the world in the image of any imperfect human is going to have negative consequences when that human can't perfectly grok all the changes they're making to their environment -- not to mention that they can't learn anything once they get to that state either.

The benefits of being high-control are salient in the context of existing low-control UFAI, since high-control people are the only ones who can reliably kill UFAI -- or change them, since they have the power to not-fit in with the UFAI's model of the world.

On the other hand, if some normal genius mathematician/logician stumbles across people with the latent ability, and manages to track one down in their youth -- well. That's another story. I'll think about this.
