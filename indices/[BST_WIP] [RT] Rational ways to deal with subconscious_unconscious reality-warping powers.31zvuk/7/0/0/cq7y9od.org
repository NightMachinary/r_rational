LÃ¶b's theorem is not hard enough to grok to require "super-intuitive understanding of mathematics". [[http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2014/02/lobs-theorem-cured-my-social-anxiety.html][People claim to have used it]] for comparable purposes. Professional mathematicians ought to be able to do it as a matter of course.

I subconsciously expect(ed) the universe to be able to derive my CEV from my brain automatically, and for it to go all right.

I was also under the impression that low-control people are able of changing their own body and mind, if they expected it to change. My body and mind would therefore also automatically be CEV-optimised, which means it cleverly avoids traps like "not being able to learn anything" by expecting to receive truly accurate information, and storing it in a brain lobe believed to be unalterable, which doesn't automatically alter the world, either by being conscious, by expecting it not to alter the world, or by not putting it through the mental method required to turn thought into fact. Similarly, through transhumanism, I would expect my mind to expand to the point of being able to comprehend reality well enough to verify that CEV is truly being applied smoothly.

Actually, come to think of it, that isn't the optimal way to handle things, and I did give the universe a blank slate to optimise towards my CEV without regards for self-preservation. So it could just restart everything with the most CEV-wise optimal physical laws possible, plus the minimal definition of "me" necessary to observe that all is well.

I didn't expect other players to be a problem either: this should be an instantaneous self-recursive and (if mind-magic is coded in at a higher level than relativity) retroactive foom. If high-control people can't be affected by my magic directly, I'd expect black holes to appear to remove them from time, or inflation to magically restart locally to throw them across a Hubble horizon, or false vacuum decay to start and somehow stop again a nanosecond later, starting at their location, collapsing the space they occupy into zero volume.
