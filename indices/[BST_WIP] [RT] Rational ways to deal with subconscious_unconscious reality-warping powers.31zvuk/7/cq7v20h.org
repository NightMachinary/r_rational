  on the very low-control end of the scale, you manipulate reality such that all your observations confirm your subconscious beliefs.

1. Grok Löb's theorem.

2. Complete gruelling mental training to get to this "low-control" level state.

3. "If I believe that 'if I believe that the universe is about to be rewritten according to my CEV, then the universe is about to be rewritten according to my CEV', then I believe that the universe is about to be rewritten according to my CEV".

4. The universe is rewritten according to my CEV.

So... either this doesn't work for some unspecified reason, or the first logician who stumbles across Löb's theorem wins everything forever.

Okay, so suppose you're a dumbass and you chose perfect self-control instead of perfect universe-control. In that case, since "Anything produced by my body through use of my power vanishes after travelling some small distance away from it", the munchkin-key is "my body". Your goal is to consume everything and optimise it as part of your undying body. Also to upgrade your mind to find a way to eat planets and to have astronomical objects all be part of one singular body.
