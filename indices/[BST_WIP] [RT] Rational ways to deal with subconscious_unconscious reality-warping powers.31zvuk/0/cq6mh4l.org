The anime series "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" is an example. Haruhi has the power to reshape reality to fit her expectations and wishes, but doesn't realize it. It centers around a group of characters trying to prevent her from completely destroying or reshaping reality.

EDIT: See DCarrier's comment below if you're interested in an Eliezer Yudkowsky fanfiction of Haruhi Suzumiya! Fair warning, you really shouldn't read it if you haven't watched the anime first.
