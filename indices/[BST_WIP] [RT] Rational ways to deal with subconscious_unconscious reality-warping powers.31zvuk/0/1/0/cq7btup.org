Wow, I didn't know about this story. He didn't get the characters exactly right, but it managed to be hilarious, thought-provoking, and touching all at once. Thanks for mentioning it!

(I checked out your adaptation too. I'm not familiar with visual novels, so all I can really say is that it was a novel experience. Thanks for making it.)
