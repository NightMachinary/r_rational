Somewhat amusingly, the other popular fiction example is the orcs from Warhammer 40k, an entire species with abilities like this but too dumb to realize it.

They only reload when they think they should have to, weapons break or continue working based only on expectations, red vehicles go faster because everyone knows that painting your war truck red makes it go faster.
