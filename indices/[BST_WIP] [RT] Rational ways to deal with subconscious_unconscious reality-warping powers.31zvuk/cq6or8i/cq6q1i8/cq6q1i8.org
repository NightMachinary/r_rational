Interesting analysis, I'll keep these points in mind.

However: you wouldn't risk creating an evil AI just by knowing about them because on the high-control end you're only affecting your surroundings consciously, not subconsciously.

Edit: I like your interpretation of how low-control characters make decisions, but which pieces of information do you think would be most damaging? Would your view of an ideal low-control character immediately cease learning about the world because anything that actually happened would prevent the character from instating something better? And how do you think villainous, selfish, or megalomaniac characters would control their own learning?
