That's just one example. If you believe aliens exist, then depending on how your subconscious thinks interstellar civilisation should work, they could be completely harmless or they could destroy the Sun on a whim. And thinking and learning about aliens would cause them to move around on that spectrum. Which is bad, because the more they move around, the better the chance they'll eventually hit the "extinction event" marker. So once you've created aliens, you should avoid learning about them as much as possible.

Same for angels, gods, vampires, werewolves, zombies, robots, superheroes, and winning the lottery.
