From a theoretical perspective, this is one of those times when "acting rationally" requires a different approach.

Normally we assume that the mind is a black box, that it only matters what decision you make and not what thought process led you to that decision. Now, this isn't 100% true, for example a poker player might give away his thought process by his expression, or an athlete might be more motivated by his trainer's disapproval to complete a painful exercise. But in general, it's a pretty good approximation to say that your thoughts don't affect reality until you convert them into deliberate actions.

But, if your subconscious beliefs directly impact reality, then it might be to your advantage to /deliberately/ hold false beliefs. To not think about certain things, refuse to acquire particular pieces of information, because they might be dangerous to yourself or the world. Example:

#+begin_quote
  On the high-control end you can grant yourself eternal youth and have complete conscious control over your own biology
#+end_quote

I'm sure someone in this subreddit is going to point out the potential for increasing your own brainpower and becoming a superintelligence. But you wouldn't even /try/ that if you didn't realise it was a possibility. Ideally, you'd deliberately not learn about superhuman AIs because you risk creating an evil AI just by knowing about them... but how could you possibly know that knowledge presented a risk before you learned it?

It's been pointed out on this subreddit that the protagonists of /Gurren Lagann/, while not exactly rationalist, are generally acting optimally considering they live in a world where believing in yourself and doing incredibly awesome things /is the power source that fuels their gear/. Same basic principle: we normally encourage thinking logically and being aware of your own biases, but in some settings that's the wrong approach.

In conclusion, a lot of what we call "rational thinking" doesn't apply here, a lot of the traits we associate with rational characters would be terribly dangerous with this power, so there's some assumptions to be rethought.
