... Huh. You know, I never considered that the reality-warping would be anything other than a bad thing for everyone else. One of the major antagonists I'm planning is a guy with low-control and a Jim Jones-esque island cult. It's exactly as wrong as it sounds.

An optimist would probably be less bad, but I'd see it as being creepy more than anything else. Probably a false-utopia rather than a real one.

I was going to get around the question of an optimist meeting a cynic by only giving low-control types power over a certain specific area. I wonder if the headache of finding a reasonable answer would be worth it.
