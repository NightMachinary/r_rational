With the existence of a prior life, something to base your new reality on, you could probably avoid disturbing people too much if your earlier life wasn't too traumatic.

It would still require a level of self control that one commonly sees in fictional characters with overwhelming mental powers, like Marvel's Professor Xavier. Not how he was portrayed in the movies, which has been remarkably weak, but from the comics, where when he took the gloves off, he became extraordinarily dangerous.

Then there's Franklin Richards on the childish sane side, and Proteus on the young adult insane side in Marvel. DC probably has their reality-warpers too.

EDIT In fact, I think Franklin Richards is probably almost exactly what you describe.
