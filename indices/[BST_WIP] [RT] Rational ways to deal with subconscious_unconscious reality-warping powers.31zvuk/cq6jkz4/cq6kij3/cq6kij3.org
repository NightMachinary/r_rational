Even those with the latent ability can't activate it without training in mental discipline. They learn how to control it through esoteric meditation practices (like those that allow control of your body temperature), and through lucid dreaming. Both practices rely on keeping your mind and body separate from your surroundings -- erecting a barrier of sorts between them. Knocking down this barrier is dangerous without the tools to rebuild it if necessary. Practicing outside of the safety of your own mind/body too early can, worst case, lead to a downward spiral that ultimately prevents you from ever having any level of control.

So, option two. What specifically do you mean by horribly bad or extremely well?
