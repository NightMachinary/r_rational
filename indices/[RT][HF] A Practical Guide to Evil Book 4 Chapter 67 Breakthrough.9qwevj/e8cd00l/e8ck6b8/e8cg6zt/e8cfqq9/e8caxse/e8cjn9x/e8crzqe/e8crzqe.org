I don't see the story going this way, but considering the drow are supposed to be all about backstabbing and cruelty and cunning... and Winter is pretty much the same... I'd find it hilarious if Cat came back tomorrow and found that the two had allied against her.

Just so I'm clear, what happened was Ubua set up a portal under the 11th floor, Cat's army/Archer severed the chains keeping the tower up, and the floor itself fell in Arcadia? Is that right? If so... dang, what the heck is going to happen to the rest of the column and the city itself when it all falls down?

I'm curious about how Cat picked the Arcadian destination for the portal (or how it was determined). If the Everdark, or at least Great Lotow, is on the outskirts of Winter in relation to Arcadia, where is Winter/Summer proper in relation to the geography of Calernia? I'm wondering if Winter overlaps Callow now. Or perhaps I'm thinking too literally of the connections between the two planes.

Also, I was a little surprised that Cat's portal opened to sunlight. Duchess of Moonless Night is what she is, and the edge of Winter is where she sent them. I'd have expected cold and dark on the other side, not midday sun and a cold breeze.
