In a chapter a long while back, we have a glimpse of how Masego acted as a younger man, before meeting Cat and Co. In the chapter he's shown as being incredibly inept and generally apathetic toward socializing and interacting with people. He's introduced to Akua, but immediately forgets who she is, and starts calling her Ubua instead (not to be malicious; he's worried he got it wrong, but when she doesn't correct him, he feels relieved at getting it right for once. She simply didn't correct him because it would be incredibly rude and likely deadly to correct the son of a Calamity). It was hilarious to a lot of readers who really hated Akua at the time, and it just kinda stuck, so now Ubua and Akua are used interchangeably. And some people call her Aqua, probably due to autocorrect.
