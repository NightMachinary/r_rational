I feel like to an extent these are more important for explaining why Drow as a society are where they are, but a few powerful individuals could probably slip out if they wanted.

As for heroes, I don't think there are many who could take on Mighty Urulan, and it wasn't even very powerful in the grand scheme of things. Hell, you'd think a few junior heroes would have some nice Secrets.
