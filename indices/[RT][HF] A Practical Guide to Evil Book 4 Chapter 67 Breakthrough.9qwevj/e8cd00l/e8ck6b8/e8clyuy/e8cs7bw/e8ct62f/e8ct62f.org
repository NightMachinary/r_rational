We know that killing non-Drow grows the Night:

  Killing cattle,” I said. “Taking it. What does it do for you?”

  “The Night grows,” Ivah smiled. “To do such sacred act would redeem any disgrace.”

  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

  I sucked at my lip.

  “Killing undead,” I said. “Would it also grow the Night?”

  The drow paled.

  “Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”

  “It does, doesn't it,” I said. “The necromancy that keeps its army walking, you can claim it for the Night.

We know that the Night encompasses knowledge:

  “You make it sound like there is more to the Night than the shadow tricks,” I said.

  “That is so,” Ivah said, then touched its lips. “Shapeless and shaped, encompassing all. The worthy take. The worthy rise.”

  It's knowledge too, I realized.

It seems pretty open and shut to me. And we know that the Night can contain some pretty esoteric Secrets. See the Secret of Many Lives, or most of what Mighty Urulan did.
