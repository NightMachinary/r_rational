  arc being about how gratuitous use of power isn't the way to go.

That's the arc we're reading, yes, but there's by necessity a difference in the themes and story we're reading as a serial, and the narrative governing the world of aPGtE. Overlap exists, but I don't think this really works as an archetypal story for Cat to have wandered into. It's a reminder for Cat that she should be following Black's lessons, which includes dodging around narratives. There's a bunch of other, more relevant narratives for Cat to potentially be going through here, potentially including Drow specific ones.

  gain more, or even only, from each other.

We've been told that the Night grows from killing non-Drow, that was the context in which we first saw the Night. We know that the Night encompasses knowledge and skills. There's been no direct evidence that Drow's gain more from each other than a throwaway line about how Ivan ran into diminishing returns with corpses (which may have been in absolute or relative terms, and doesn't preclude the possibility of gaining lots of night from powerful non-Drow individuals, potentially). And the big issue is about them gaining knowledge and skills.

  I said that the drow are low on the totem pole, lower than they should be were their abilities as you suggested. With how their mentality is, there's no way that they wouldn't have at least attempted, and likely succeeded to take over other lands

They're already hitting well below their weight, whether they can do this or no. And despite the fact that a host of Mighty probably wouldn't have too much trouble conquering a city or three (let's say a villainous city, and dance around heroes here) they haven't. This is despite the fact that journeying out of the Everdark to add to the Night is a sacred act because they explicitly have the ability to gain Night from anywhere. And yeah, Sve's society is weird, for a number of reasons I figure we'll learn about when we get to Sve.

  I'm sorry if I failed to bring that point across earlier.

This may have been a redundant discussion then. I figure this is a good place to bow out of it rather than follow the quibble over details like.

Outside of the "Drow are strong" thing, the issue I'm talking about here is whether the Mighty at the edge of Winter can learn anything. Whether they specifically pick up new powers with Secrets, or just gain knowledge behind them have to adapt techniques to work within the Night (which actually seems more likely to me), there's the issue that they might learn things in Arcadia. We already know that Night and Winter are related to each other in some fashion - Cat's pointed it out numerous times, tricks with the Night can be converted into tricks with Winter, and Night techniques designed to interfere with Night-based healing can mess with the regeneration of Cat's body constructed by the full Winter mantle. If the Drow have to deal with with outside systems, then Winter is probably what they're going to struggle least with.

Edit: apparently I cut off bits of my reply when I posted, but I've added it back in.
