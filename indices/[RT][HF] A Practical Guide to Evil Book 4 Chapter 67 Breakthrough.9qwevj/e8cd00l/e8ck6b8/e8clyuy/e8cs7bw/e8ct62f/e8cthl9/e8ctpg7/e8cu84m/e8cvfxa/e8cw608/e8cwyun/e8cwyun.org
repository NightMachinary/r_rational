Yes. That's kind of my point? Mighty Urulan put Cat on the defensive and nearly killed her several times. That's a fairly big deal.

Cat and Akua acknowledged how strong Urulan was last chapter. That's how we ended up here, in Arcadia.

And are we really going to argue over whether Cat is a powerful and dangerous figure? There's a bare handful of people as strong as her, and apparently she eats bands of heroes for breakfast these days, as we found out chapter one of this book. Throw her against an army and she can kill the army. If you want to say that fighting a band of heroes isn't impressive because it's a band of heroes, (a) I want to remind you how villains fighting bands of heroes goes (b) it's still impressive because of the logistical advantage of superior numbers (and this is the Practical guide - logistics matter) and (c), do you really think any of those heroes could have taken Cat on their own? Saint and Pilgrim aside, any of those fights would be over very, very quickly.
