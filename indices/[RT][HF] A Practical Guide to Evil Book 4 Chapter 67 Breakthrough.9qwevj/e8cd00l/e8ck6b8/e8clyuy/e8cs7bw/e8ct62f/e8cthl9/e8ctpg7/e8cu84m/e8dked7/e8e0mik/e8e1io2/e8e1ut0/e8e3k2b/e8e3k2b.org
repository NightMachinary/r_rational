  We've been told that the Drow can claim the necromancy that keep undead walking for the Night, and we've been told what the Night is and what it encompasses.

We've been told that the drow can /grow the night/ by killing undead, not that they can gain the ability to use necromancy by doing so. What the night encompasses, so far as we know, is the ability to steal knowledge and grow the night by killing people, living or dead. But simply having knowledge is not enough to grant you new magics, you need the proper power to use those abilities, and the drow have not shown that they can steal that. Even if the drow steal the secret of gate making, there's no proof that they would actually be capable of using it, anymore than someone born without the Gift would be able to cast spells if they were given the knowledge of an experienced mage.

  We've literally seem others with the ability to do so.

Mages, sure, but there aren't exactly a lot of those in Arcadia.
