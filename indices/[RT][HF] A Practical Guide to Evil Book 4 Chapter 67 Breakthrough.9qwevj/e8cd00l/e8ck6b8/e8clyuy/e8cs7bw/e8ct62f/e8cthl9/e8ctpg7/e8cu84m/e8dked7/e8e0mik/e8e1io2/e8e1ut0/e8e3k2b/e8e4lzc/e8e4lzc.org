  But simply having knowledge is not enough to grant you new magics, you need the proper power to use those abilities,

This is actually a really good point, I appreciate you bringing it up.

But on the other hand, we've see how versatile the Night is. Chapter 65 alone involved the Drow pulling off more tricks than we've seen from any one Named who wasn't cheating (im thinking of Cat the Winter queen, of magic types who can pull powers out of their ass).

The Night seems like it can be bent into an awful lot of shapes, if it turns out that they can't adapt things one to one.

And again, Winter and Night have been pointed out time and time again as having a lot of things in common. There's plenty of reasons to think that if Winter can open a gate, then the Night might be able to as well.

  Mages, sure, but there aren't exactly a lot of those in Arcadia.

There's going to be more than a few, in the magical realm of the faeries. But I'm thinking of more ordinary faeries, Larat for one, but also others we saw last book (I'd have to go searching for exact references, which I might have time for later).
