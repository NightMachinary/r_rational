We've been told that the Drow can steal the necromancy of the undead, but as a culture they're all quaking in their boots at the mention of the Dead King.

The issue I'm looking at here is whether they can get a far gate. I think this is particularly concerning because of the parallels that we've been shown so many times between Winter and Night - tricks with the Night can be converted into tricks with Winter, and Night techniques designed to interfere with Night-based healing can mess with the regeneration of Cat's body constructed by the full Winter mantle. If the Drow struggle with outside systems, then Winter is probably what they're going to struggle least with.
