I guess we'll see. It's still Cat's story here, and she's the Named who's creating this situation.

I don't think it's been made particularly clear on what the "Story" would think of attempts to con it, in terms of what would and wouldn't work, so it's hard to judge if this is a plan that would pan out (or whether Cat would think it would).
