Note that the cabal is being formed not to attack the dwarves, but to confront and demand answers from Sve of Night.

The exact words used for the goal of the cabal are "to seek out Sve Noc and ask instruction."

I don't see a way that this backfires on the dwarves. Either the drow join the cabal, in which case they're oathbound to Cat and won't antagonize the dwarves, or they don't join, and the dwarves are no worse off than before, or they rally around Sve of Night, and Cat, down to her last narrative chance to save Callow, exterminates any of them that aren't already bound to her.

And without it backfiring on the dwarves, why would they mind that she's doing /exactly what she told them she was going to do/ (gather a drow army and confront Sve)? Heck, she even asked, and was granted, permission for the "gathering the army" part.
