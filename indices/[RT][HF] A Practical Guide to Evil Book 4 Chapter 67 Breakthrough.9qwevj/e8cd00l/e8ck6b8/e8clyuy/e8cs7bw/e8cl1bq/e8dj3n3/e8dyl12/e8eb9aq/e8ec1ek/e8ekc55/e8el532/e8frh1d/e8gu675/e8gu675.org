Back when she told them all of this, Cat had no way to know whether she would successfully get them into Arcadia. Dropping a tower through a portal is a cool plan and all, and not something you'd imagine the Mighty would have anticipated, but we're still talking about seven of the most powerful characters we've ever seen together in a room, with whole bags of unknown tricks and powers. It's not unimaginable that at least one of them could have gotten out of dodge.

And even now it's a question of how good a trap Arcadia is.

For a start, villains monologing about how their victory is inevitable, dropping someone into a trap, and then exiting stage left is the sort of story cliche that Black would have laughed at even if it wasn't being done in Arcadia, where stories trump everything.

Then there's the worry the Drow breaking free. Remember when Will walked into and out of Arcadia for trainign purposes? Or Warlock opened a gate? Or how Black got himself transported between Arcadia and Creation on his own? Or how Bard travels between the two places?

If the seven demigods don't already have the power to get out, then all they need is a high-ranking fae to open a gate for them (or to eat so they can learn how to do it themselves with the Night). How likely are they to find such a fae? It's Arcadia, chance doesn't matter much. /Stories/ matter, and in Arcadia it's as easy to start one as to swear that you will escape and have your vengeance.
