  He threatened Cat after ambushing her with the help of his bodyguards in a coordinated attack when she was severly underestimating her opponents

I'm not sure how much you can call it an ambush after Cat was the one the one who sort out Urulan and picked the fight. And even after the opening salvo, Urulan was holding the upper hand for a while.

  Additionally, she herself admits that she let herself go skillwise.

Because she was engaging in direct fights instead of trying for tricky schemes? Remember, Cat in a direct fight outmatched over a half dozen heroes this book alone. Her skills haven't degraded overly from then till now.

  (Also, he is the weakest sigil hodler, not the weakest Mighty. Big difference.)

That's fair. I got turned around by how the sigil holder was referred to as Mighty Urulan. But he's still the weakest player in a city at the edges of the map, as far as the Drow are concerned.

Without moving the conversation too far away, I'm concerned that the Drow will gain access to portals. We know that Winter and Night are very similar to one another, to the point where tricks in each can be copied over to the other and techniques to defeat Night regeneration beat out healing from the Winter mantle itself, so it seems reasonable to assume that Night could open a portal.

Actually, given the Night-Winter interaction, there are a whole lot of interesting things that could happen with the Drow in Arcadia.
