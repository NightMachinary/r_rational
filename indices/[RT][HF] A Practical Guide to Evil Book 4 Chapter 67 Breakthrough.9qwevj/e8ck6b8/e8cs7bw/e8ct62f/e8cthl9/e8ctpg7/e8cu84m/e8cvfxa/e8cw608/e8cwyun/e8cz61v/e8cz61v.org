  Yes. That's kind of my point? Mighty Urulan put Cat on the defensive and nearly killed her several times. That's a fairly big deal.

  Cat and Akua acknowledged how strong Urulan was last chapter. That's how we ended up here, in Arcadia.

  And are we really going to argue over whether Cat is a powerful and dangerous figure?

Cat is a dangerous and powerful figure misusing her power to the point where it becomes story relevant, considering how often it gets mentioned. Her fight against Urulan serves two story purposes: To remind her that she's playing for reals in the Everdark and to show her that she is fighting in an inefficient way. It was a wakeup call.

Events in the Guideverse are very strongly influenced by tropes and the story. This is an in-universe fact.

Cat regularily killed large bands of junior heroes, but so did Black, with far less power at his disposal. Cat is strong, but she isn't using her power well, and EE is virtually beating us over the head with that fact. It coming back to bite her in the arse is appropriate and expected.
