Oh boy. I could try convincing you that even used acting suboptimal Cat had enough power that she should be taken seriously - pointing to feat from her, talk about the Winter king, explain how her healing power is still a ridiculous advantage no one else has, and so on.

But let's talk about the Drow. You said they were low on the totem pole. I agree in that they've not made any waves outside the Everdark, but I dispute that it's because of their own lack of power.

Cat days as much literally the first time she meets a bunch of Drow:

  “That lot outside is bottom-feeders, Diabolist,” I murmured. “And still they were capable of a trick most Named wouldn't sneer at. There's something wrong here. If their lower ranks are this strong there's no way they'd be a ruin of an empire as they supposedly are.”

Then we learn about the Night, and just how dangerous that is in terms of growth. Skillwise apparently Drow can become master swordsman by killing a bunch of swordsman.

We see Berelun, a random Mighty who is effectively nothing on the (literal) food chain, but who is physically very impressive and had a lot of tricks.

  Drow with that much Night swimming around their bodies had reflexes far beyond anything a human could muster even on their best day -- even the Watch.

Then there a bunch of other stuff I'll gloss over and get to last chapter, where Akua and Cat literally talk about how dangerous the Drow are:

  Urulan was perhaps in the twenty strongest drow of Great Lotow, and likely close to the bottom of that division. It fought... better than I expected. You came close to death more than once.”

  “It was a wakeup call,” I softly agreed. “We haven't been taking them seriously enough, have we? Lotow's not one of the big cities when it comes down to it. *There's leviathans lurking ahead*.”

At what point do you start thinking that the Drow are a bunch of weak punks?
