  We've been told it grows the night and we've been told what the night is. It's nature is to encompass knowledge.

It doesn't necessarily follow that growing the night and stealing knowledge also allows the drow to steal new powers outside their own species. The Mighty can gain new tricks and powers from killing other drow because ultimately they're all using the same magic system and simply applying it in many different ways. Replicating something like a fae gate or a hero's aspect would require the drow to gain access to entirely different types of magical energy (Winter, Light, etc.) which they haven't actually shown themselves to be capable of.

In my opinion it's likely that the drow could ape /some/ tricks used by other magic systems, in the same way Cat is trying to reverse-engineer the night with winter, but they can probably only achieve a pale imitation of most powers they encounter.
