  And the Mighty have just been locked into a deathtrap by a villain who monologued about their inevitable victory and walked away: on a level it would be surprising if they didn't break out.

That's a heroic story though, and these guys are definitely not heroes by any stretch of the imagination. Plus, it has to compete with the existing narrative of 'newcomer crushes arrogant pre-existing power structure.'

  As to whether they could beat a Fae - Urulan had the power, skill, and tricks necessary to nearly kill Cat, queen of the faeries, and there are now seven guys stronger than he was with reason to forma cabal and a story to back them.

Oh, I agree that if they could force a fae noble into a slugging match the Mighty could probably take even a prince down, it's just that I doubt they'd have the opportunity. Even if they were lucky enough to have a noble wander by and get curious (which, as you say, isn't as unlikely in Arcadia as it might be in reality) I don't think the noble would be stupid enough to get into a fight with a whole team of powerful opponents. And even if they did, or the drow just attacked instantly, fae nobles are tricky bastards with thousands of years of experience and powers the Mighty have never seen- it's likely they could slip the noose and make with the fleeing like a proper villain.
