  Cat's used flimsier stories in Arcadia before. And just this book she co-opted a heroic story back in Creation proper.

Yeah, but Cat intentionally manipulates the narrative, and was trained to do so by one of the most successful villains of the modern era- I don't think the drow even know what a 'narrative' is.

  On the other hand, the Mighty are tricky bastards with thousands of years of experience (some gathered over their own long lifespans, some gathered from the Night) and powers the Fae have never seen.

Mm, fair enough, but fae abilities are better suited to deception and escape than the night is for detection or mobility.
