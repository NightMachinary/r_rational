I had a (super quick) look for who can open portals and more than just princes and princesses, Masego says that it's "high-ranking fae" and even as a Duchess Cat could do it. Still not incredibly common, but chance and coincidence are a funny thing in Arcadia though. And the Mighty have just been locked into a deathtrap by a villain who monologued about their inevitable victory and walked away: on a level it would be surprising if they /didn't/ break out.

As to whether they could beat a Fae - Urulan had the power, skill, and tricks necessary to nearly kill Cat, queen of the faeries, and there are now seven guys stronger than he was with reason to forma cabal and a story to back them.
