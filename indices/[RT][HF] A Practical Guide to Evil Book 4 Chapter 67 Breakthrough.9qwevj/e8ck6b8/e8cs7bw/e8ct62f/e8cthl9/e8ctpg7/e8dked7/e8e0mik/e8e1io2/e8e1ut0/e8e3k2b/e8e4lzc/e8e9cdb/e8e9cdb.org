  And again, Winter and Night have been pointed out time and time again as having a lot of things in common. There's plenty of reasons to think that if Winter can open a gate, then the Night might be able to as well.

I agree that if the night is capable of creating portals, copying winter power is probably how they'd learn to do it. I just don't think it's likely that they'll get that lucky.

  But I'm thinking of more ordinary faeries, Larat for one, but also others we saw last book (I'd have to go searching for exact references, which I might have time for later).
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure it was outright stated at one point that the only fae who can open portals are those with the power of a prince/princess.

#+begin_quote
  I doubted they understood everything I could do with those, or even that I wasn't the only one who could make them: the Wild Hunt could open its own, if it was led by Larat.

Yeah, it seems like the only one of Cat's followers who can open gates is Larat, the fae formerly known as prince.

I'm not saying it's impossible, but the odds of a fae prince wandering by the area the Mighty are in, getting into a fight, /losing/ that fight, and then the Mighty figuring out how to reverse-engineer a portal using night- all in the next day or so- is pretty damn low.
