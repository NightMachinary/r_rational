  I'm worried that this plan of banding the drow against the dwarves might have the side effect of pissing of the dwarves. You know, the continental power house that sinks cities if people piss them off?

If the dwarves have any sense whatsoever, they'd expect what they're doing right now --- invading a foreign realm in a war of conquest --- to unite the inhabitants against them with or without Cat's intervention.

If Sve of Night had any sense, it's what she'd already be doing.
