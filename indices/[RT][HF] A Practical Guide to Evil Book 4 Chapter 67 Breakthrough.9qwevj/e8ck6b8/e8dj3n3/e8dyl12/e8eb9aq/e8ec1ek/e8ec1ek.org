I figure they'll care if Cat makes their job harder for them and helps get the Drow organised into a cabal. She'll probably be forgiven if she pulls of the mission and kills Sve, but betraying the dwarves is like playing with fire, if fire was an unstoppable force that could sink all of your cities just to prove a point. It's a huge risk to take without even spending time thinking about how the dwarves could casually destroy all of Callow if they took offence to this.
