I'm mostly talking about this:

#+begin_quote
  To get an audience, I needed a gift.

  A warning about the dwarves invading ought to do the trick.
#+end_quote

She's telling the Drow things they don't know, to the detriment of the dwarves.

Then she tells them specific details about the invading force that.

#+begin_quote
  “As of two months ago,” I said, “the nerezim have begun an invasion of the Everdark.”

  You could have heard a pin drop in the silence that followed.

  “Allow me to be perfectly clear,” I said. “I did not misspeak. This is not an expedition, it is an invasion. At least a hundred thousand soldiers came through the Gloom, their vanguard led by a Named. They bring with them civilians because they intend to stay. Even as we speak most of the outer ring has fallen into their hands. They aim for nothing less than the extermination of your kind.”
#+end_quote

Ivah mentioned before all this about how the Drow would form a cabal in the face of a dwarven threat:

#+begin_quote
  “They will know that if a cabal is formed for the defence of Lotow against nerezim encroachment, its first act will be to devour them to strengthen ahead of the battle. I do not believe the others will enter your service.”
#+end_quote

And in fact this is what the drow immediately want to do, right after Cat ghives more details:

#+begin_quote
  “Do we know when the nerezim will strike?” one of the Mighty said, staring at me.

  Vasyl, the symbol said. The other bottom sigil, and noticeably less hostile than the Orelik so far.

  “At least two weeks,” I said. “Perhaps more, if they spread their forces to completely clear out the outer rings.”

  “Then this is no time for quibbling,” Mighty Vasyl grimly said. “Defences must be seen to, or the city abandoned. There is no middle path.”
#+end_quote

If things don't go according to Cat's plan here, the dwarves won't be amused about having to face a forewarned force that has banded together and made weeks worth of preparations. To be clear, unhappy dwarves is not a good thing.

If it goes well, great! If it doesn't, then I'm predicting a bear market for Callowan property.
