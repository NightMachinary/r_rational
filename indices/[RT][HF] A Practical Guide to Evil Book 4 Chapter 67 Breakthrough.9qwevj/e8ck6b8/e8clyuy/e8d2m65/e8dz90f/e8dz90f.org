Remember how narrative works. When William was fated to defeat Cat, he was able to just keep healing himself over and over again even when she kept beating the shit out of him. The Exalted Champion was able to kill the Captain because of the narrative even though she was objectively vastly more powerful. The Stalwart Paladin was given an ability specifically to counter Cat's glamours right when he needed it, although he still couldn't beat her even with that. But a Might would be completely helpless compared to Cat, because they would have no idea how narrative works or how to manipulate it. They would stumble into a story ensuring their defeat pretty much instantly.
