  Die? Heroes don't have a great track record from what we've seen on screen, except for two times with Black, involving Pilgrim or Bard.

You get this impression because both Cat and Black are very, very good at manipulating the narrative and avoiding dangerous stories. The Drow would not be, to say the least. Remember this quote from Black:

/"It doesn't matter how flawless the scheme was, how impregnable the fortress or powerful the magical weapon, it always ends with a band of adolescents shouting utter platitudes as they tear it all down. The game is rigged so that we lose, every single time: half the world, turned into a prop for the glory of the other half."/

It literally does not matter what the actual objective power levels of two opponents are if one of them is fated to defeat the other. Remember the time Cat killed a minor god with nothing but a bullshit prophecy, back when she was still only the Squire?
