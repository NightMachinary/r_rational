  It does, but I'm still not quite sure why some of the Mighty haven't wondered out of the Everdark and been lesser gods on the rest of the continent. There's only a very select group of people who could deal with even the weakest of them, and they could probably achieve a better lifestyle.

I think there are three reasons for this:

1. It's cultural. To the Drow, status comes from being closer to Sve. Leaving the Everdark is a punishment reserved for the lowest of Drow.
2. It's hard to get out. Remember, they're surrounded by the Chain of Hunger, the Golden Bloom, and the Kingdom of the Dead. A few exiles won't draw much notice, but a powerful Mighty trying to leave risks annoying the Dead King, and we all know how that ends.
3. Even if one of them successfully reached the southern lands, there is approximately a 0% chance that they wouldn't be killed by a Hero tailor-made to defeat them within a few months or years at the longest. Outside of the Everdark, even the Mighty have to play by everyone else's rules.
