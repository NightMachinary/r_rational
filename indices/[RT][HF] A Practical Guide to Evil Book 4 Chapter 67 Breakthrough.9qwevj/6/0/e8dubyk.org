Regarding the portal placement: as far as I'm aware, only the floor of the room they were in was cut and fell through the gate. Whether the floor was cut by Archer and/or Ubua, or the gate itself is a bit unclear to me.

I think the connections to Arcadia are more metaphorical/metaphysical than geographical. The Everdark, with the culture being so similar to Winter, would logically be connected to somewhere in Arcadia like that. Opening a gate in Ater should also lead to somewhere similarly bleak/dreadful, I imagine. And the location's connection would explain the outcome of the portal better than Cat's fae title (she's now Sovereign of Moonless Night, not Duchess).
