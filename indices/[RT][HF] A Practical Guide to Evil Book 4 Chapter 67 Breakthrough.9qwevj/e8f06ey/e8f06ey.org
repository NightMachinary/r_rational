I see a lot of comments expressing consern that some of the drow is going to find and harvest fae. IIRC the reason that Kat is queen of Winter at all, despite only being dutches formally, is that all of the winter fae ditched Winter and moved into the new place, so there's noone to contest her claim. Winter was dead before and now even more, no matter how strong the drow are what is their chances of running across food?
