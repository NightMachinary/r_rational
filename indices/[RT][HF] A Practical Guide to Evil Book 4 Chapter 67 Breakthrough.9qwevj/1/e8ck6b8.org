  A warning about the dwarves invading ought to do the trick.
#+end_quote

I'm worried that this plan of banding the drow against the dwarves might have the side effect of /pissing of the dwarves/. You know, the continental power house that sinks cities if people piss them off?

  Which did explain, at least in part, why the Everdark didn't currently consist of half a dozen lesser gods sitting in their own city with the rest of the race long gone.
#+end_quote

It does, but I'm still not quite sure why some of the Mighty haven't wondered out of the Everdark and been lesser gods on the rest of the continent. There's only a very select group of people who could deal with even the weakest of them, and they could probably achieve a better lifestyle.

After what happened to Black I'm kind of jumpy about the stories of other cultures. Cat's running a big risk running around the Drow homeland - who knows what kind of stories they tell? (Well, Ivah does, but thus far there's been no evidence that Cat is looking in that direction. She only just walked out what a cabal is.)

  “- have commanded armies larger in number than this entire city,” I flatly replied. “I've slain heroes and tricked fae, walked the streets of Keter as a guest and pried life out of the hands of the Hashmallim. You're just a rat in a hole, Orelik, and if you try my patience once more I swear on all the Gods I will feed you your own fucking limbs.”

That's one hell of a boast. It'd sound lot less impressive if the Drow knew the full details of it all, but thankfully for Cat they don't.

  The moment the shiver had been felt the gate had opened. Akua and I were not without cleverness, and so we'd planned to have it unfold right under the ceiling of the floor below. Unfelt until it cut through the walls
#+end_quote

Wait just a moment. Cat's portals can cut through stone?!? Since when? That's a huge deal. Could she cut an enemy in half? Open a mile wide portal that cuts through a city, or an army? Cut through things thy otherwise could not conventionally be cut? That's a hell of a thing to gloss over.

  I'd been controlling and left them to stand alone in the outskirts of Winter.
#+end_quote

Well that's a power move and a half.

A few things I'm worried about here. One is that the Drow find a faerie to eat, because a Drow with portals is not a fun idea (especially if portals can be used offensively now). Two is that she's really playing into a story here where the Drow are becoming her unwilling army of monsters held in place by mind control - how long until they free themselves and turn on their master? Three is that the Drow might wander off and conquer Arcadia (Urulan gave the faerie queen a good fight, after all, and these guys are stronger than it was). Four is that these guys have now got a great reason to form a little cabal and attack Cat next time she shows up.

But still, this was a very ballsy move.

Also, there was a reminder in this chapter of how time flows differently in Arcadia. If Cat waits a day in the Underdark, I wonder how long that'll be over in faerie land?
