  Yeah, but Cat intentionally manipulates the narrative, and was trained to do so by one of the most successful villains of the modern era- I don't think the drow even know what a 'narrative' is.

Not knowing what a narrative is in the Guideverse seems like one hell of an oversight to have, especially for guys who feast on knowledge older than the current incarnation of Calernia.

I don't think Cat's narrative manipulation is too subtle, we've seen her do it a fair few times and mostly it's a case of pattern recognition and stunts like throwing bricks through windows. Even the framing around the Crusade wasn't much more complex than trying to give the Crusaders an out and telling them they weren't legitimate.

And Arcadia's a place where narrative's take hold easily and Cat's already set one up for them before they've had a chance to do anything: She tried to suborn their free will, monologued about her awesome power and inevitable victory, pulled them into a deathtrap, and then walked away. That's villainous behaviour straight off the evil overlord list. All of Black's lessons point to that being the sort of thing that comes back to haunt villains.

I don't think we know much about what tricks these Drow might have up their sleeve, except that there's going to be an awful lot of them. Counting on the Drow to be ineffectual seems like one hell of a risky gamble, especially right after Cat got a huge reminder that the Drow should be taken seriously.
