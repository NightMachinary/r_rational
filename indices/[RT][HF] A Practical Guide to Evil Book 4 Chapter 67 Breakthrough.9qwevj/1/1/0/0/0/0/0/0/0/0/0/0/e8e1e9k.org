  Oh boy. I could try convincing you that even used acting suboptimal Cat had enough power that she should be taken seriously - pointing to feat ftrom her, talk about the Winter king, explain how her healing power is still a ridiculous advantage no one else has, and so on.

From what we've seen she isn't even comparable to the (former) King of Winter, if that guy was even remotely in the same league as the (former) Queen of Summer.

Because, and here's the thing, storywise using her power inefficiently is a big, /big/ deal.

Yes she's a badass, yes she's hard to kill, all that. But that pales in comparison to the arc she's going through, said arc being about how gratuitous use of power isn't the way to go.

  At what point do you start thinking that the Drow are a bunch of weak punks?

I did not say that. I said that the drow are low on the totem pole, lower than they should be were their abilities as you suggested. With how their mentality is, there's no way that they wouldn't have at least attempted, and likely suceeded to take over other lands if their abilities included literal, direct power transfusion.

The fact that their Empire seemed to literally self-destruct once Sve killed the Twilight Sages and made them into the first of the Night suggests that they gain more, or even only, from each other. Otherwise it'd have been much more effective to consume others.

I'm sorry if I failed to bring that point across earlier.
