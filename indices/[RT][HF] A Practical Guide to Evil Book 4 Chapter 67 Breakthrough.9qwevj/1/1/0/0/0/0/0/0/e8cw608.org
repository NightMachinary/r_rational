  I'm not sure how much you can call it an ambush after Cat was the one the one who sort out Urulan and picked the fight. And even after the opening salvo, Urulan was holding the upper hand for a while.

She was on the defensive from the opening salvo onward, so that's not really saying much.

  Because she was engaging in direct fights instead of trying for tricky schemes? Remember, Cat in a direct fight outmatched over a half dozen heroes this book alone. Her skills haven't degraded overly from then till now.

Dominating multiple opponents for a time isn't overly impressive in the Guideverse. Moreover, Cat herself admits that she took hits she shouldn't have and used tricks that should only be used as a last resort in her fight with Urulan. She said that Amadeus would've wept if he saw that fight, that's a pretty strong indicator. Villains /die/ the moment they start prancing around with their powers.

Additionally, Winter is the season of trickery and cunning, not brute strength. Bludgeoning her opponents with her power is a summer thing.
