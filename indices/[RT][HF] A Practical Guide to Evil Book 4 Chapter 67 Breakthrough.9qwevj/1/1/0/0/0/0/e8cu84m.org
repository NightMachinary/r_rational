He threatened Cat after ambushing her with the help of his bodyguards in a coordinated attack when she was severly underestimating her opponents. Additionally, she herself admits that she let herself go skillwise. (Also, he is the weakest sigil holder, not the weakest Mighty. Big difference.)

Additionally, we haven't really seen any powers that are not somewhat night-flavoured. I can't help but feel that Cat would already have encountered hero-like Light constructs or similar tricks from the above if direct power stealing was a possibility.
