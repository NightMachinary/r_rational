This was a pretty smart move- even if the Mighty as a group are strong enough to fight off any curious fae or strange creatures that might be roaming Arcadia, they have no food or water and clothes designed for a much milder climate. Even if there are edible plants in the land that's actually named Winter, the drow probably won't be able to identify them. The likelihood is that they won't last more than a day, maybe two or three for the longest hold-outs, and once one goes the others will start caving faster and faster.
