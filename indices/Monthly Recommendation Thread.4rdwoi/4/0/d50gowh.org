  Shogun by James Clavell - European ship crashes on a shore of feudal Japan. English navigator must survive in unknown land and Japanese must deal with political turmoil. Lots of ambitious characters thinking about their next move.

Slight aside. I recall reading this book about... oh, a decade ago? I mentioned it to my mother (who as a rule doesn't care for most fantasy or historical fiction novels). She started talking about all sorts of things from the book. I was shocked.

Turns out the book was made into a TV miniseries in the early 1980s, and she and her friends had tuned into it religiously. She still recalled it almost three decades later!

Anyway, I seem to recall liking the book. Hopefully you're enjoying it too!
