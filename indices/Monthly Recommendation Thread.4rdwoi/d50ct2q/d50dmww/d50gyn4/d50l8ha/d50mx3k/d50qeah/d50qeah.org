I second the recommendation of PTU, the system isn't /that/ complex.

In terms of campaign, you can use programs to make GBA maps for towns and routes, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3K5U74mCUM][like this]]. With how many over-world sprite resources there are, it'd let your players easily pick out a trainer that suits their look and personality.

I've been trying to design an adventures/anime based kanto campaign setting, but I keep losing motivation. I'm not a great DM.
