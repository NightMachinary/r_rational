[[https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=1082173&page=submissions][Salamando_Flames]] has written many short stories in his "Sex Mage" universe, in which women have irresistible telepathic power over men. However, he's also written a few interesting deconstructions of the setting.\\

/[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps][GURPS]]/--the Generic Universal RolePlaying System--is an *unbelievably*-awesome system for tabletop roleplaying. What evidence can be cited in support of this claim? Here are some snippets from the introduction to [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic][the /Basic Set/]]...

  /"Generic."/ Some people like quick, fast-moving games, where the referee makes lots of decisions to keep things moving. Others want ultimate detail, with rules for every contingency. Most of us fall somewhere in between. /GURPS/ starts with simple rules, and--especially in the combat system--builds up to as much /optional/ detail as you like. But it's still the same game. You may all use it differently, but your campaigns will all be compatible.[...]

  I'm satisfied that /GURPS/ is is the most realistic, flexible, and "universal" system ever developed.
