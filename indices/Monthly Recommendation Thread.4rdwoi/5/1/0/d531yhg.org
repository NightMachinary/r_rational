I could have called it "portal hard fantasy", but that would've sounded even /more/ like abusing teleportation.

Personally, I liked it better than the Wiz Biz series, in that Wiz Biz emphasized wit and whimsy over consistency. If Broken Crescent errs on the side of being mostly too-predictable by an experienced programmer, Wiz Biz errs on the side of protagonists pulling rabbits out of hats.
