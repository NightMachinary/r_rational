[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4645725/1/The-Grand-Vizier-of-Oz][The Grand Vizier of Oz]] - Wicked fanfic where characters are slowly making social change, carfully learn magic and are resonable about relanshionships. Optimistic, but not unreasonably so. As author put it: /"I wondered what it would take for the characters of Wicked to actually achieve a real 'happily ever after' -- what work they'd have to do, what troubles they'd have to deal with, and what things would never work out no matter what. I wanted it to be canonically plausible, not a total fantasy with no sadness or negative consequences. I think I've managed."/
