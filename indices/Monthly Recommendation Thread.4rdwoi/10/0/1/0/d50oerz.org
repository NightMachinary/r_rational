I assume you refer to the anime of Higurashi, right? Umineko is on a whole different level and the two are hardly comparable. The author even makes fun of the some of bullshit of his previous work.

I could say more, but I want to keep it as vague as possible: Umineko is a unique experience which should be enjoyed spoiler-free, although it has a somewhat slow build-up. You should definitely check it out regardless of your opinion on Higurashi!

Thanks for the recommendation, that does sound like an interesting premise.
