  (there's always going to be sex scenes)

I don't think sex scenes are an essential (or even all that common) component of good VNs. There are no sex scenes in /Ever17/, to use one of your examples. The various anime adaptations of /Fate Stay Night/ are basically the VN with the sex scenes removed and they are very popular.

The sibling comments also mention /Umineko no naku koro ni/ and /World End Economica/.

Could it be that the VNs that people from [[/r/rational]] like contain relatively few sex scenes? Or maybe VNs with no sex scenes are more likely to be translated and enjoyed in the West, in general.
