Not always :) I've played a good part of ever17 but what turned me off it is that the choices seem to be completely unrelated to where the story goes and it takes forever to go back to try another path. The most blatant example of this and what made me drop the game is when [[#s][spoiler]]

I was told to just look up spoilers for what choices to pick to get what ending but that kinda ruins the gameplay/mystery aspect of the VN for me so I haven't finished it.

I don't like mecha stuff so haven't really looked at muv luv but rewrite is on my list of things to read through. Hoshizora no memoria looks prettier though so I thought I'd read that first :)
