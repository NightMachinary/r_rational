  Muv-Luv Alternative is a classic time travel story
#+end_quote

People usually recommend going through the whole trilogy to properly enjoy [[#s][the traumatic impact]] of the third one. I'm not sure it's worth the time investment in the end, but that's the way I've done it. At the very least, I'd play Unlimited before jumping to Alternative. The first one (which is Muv-Luv Extra) is a tad formulaic, silly and even boring at times: this is used to set up a thematic contrast to the later games, which works, but makes the first one a bit of a slog to get through on its own merits. You'd best not expect the way in-game world works to resemble reality, though. The authors also tend to use the word /quantum/ to refer to the ridiculous hand-wavy bullshit narrativium rules their world has, rather than the actually sense-making ones of ours, which annoys me a quite bit, but YMMV.

P.S. Marimo-chan best girl TT_TT
