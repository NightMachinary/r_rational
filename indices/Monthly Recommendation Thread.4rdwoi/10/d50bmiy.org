No idea if any of the below are rational.

Finished G-senjou no maou recently. Highly recommended VN, best one out of the handful I've played so far.

--------------

Also playing through Alice:madness returns. This is like the inverse of g-senjou: ok gameplay, story is worse than its predecessor (the dialogue is pretty bad too, way too much handholding and meaningless things that sound philosophical), but the art is gorgeous. I'd recommend this just for eye candy.

--------------

Also also I'm playing the steins;gate VN but while I'm enjoying the playthrough, I'll admit it doesn't contribute much to the series beyond the anime. I'd recommend it to people who loved the anime since the VN itself is not bad by any means but the anime was well enough made that it seems to cover pretty much everything in the VN so far. I'd obviously highly recommend either to those who've watched neither.
