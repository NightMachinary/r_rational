  Also playing through Alice:madness returns. This is like the inverse of g-senjou: ok gameplay, story is worse than its predecessor (the dialogue is pretty bad too, way too much handholding and meaningless things that sound philosophical), but the art is gorgeous. I'd recommend this just for eye candy.

Yeah, I don't usually take screenshots, but this game I basically [[http://imgur.com/a/qAQZx][treated like a photoshoot]]. (Chronological order has been lost in the uploading, I'm afraid. Possibly NSFW for gore on a few pics.)

They had very good artists, but apparently nobody else of talent, and they clearly ran out of money. (Did they really think we wouldn't notice that they /cancelled a boss battle/ and replaced it with a slideshow cutscene?)

Best hair physics of all time though.
