Any good rational comedy you can recommend?

I'd like to read some for inspiration for an idea I got. Problem is that I suck at writing comedy and it always ends up as gallows humor or black comedy no matter how lighthearted it starts.

I'd like to know if there's some good non-cynical rational comedy you can recommend.
