IMO, that book would also be relevant in the /[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3jz4js/d_good_ideas_in_bad_stories/][“[D] Good ideas in bad stories?”]]/ thread. The programmable magical system was nice, but the plot wasn't interesting enough, the characters weren't clever and developed enough, and the advancement felt too artificial.

All this also made the story similar to R. Cook's [[http://www.goodreads.com/series/43084-wiz][/“Wiz Biz”/]] series.

p.s.
