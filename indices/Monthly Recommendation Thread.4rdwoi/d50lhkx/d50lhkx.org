[[http://www.sandrewswann.com/books/broken-crescent][Broken Crescent]] by S. Andrew Swann. Hard portal fantasy with one of the most developed magic-as-programming-language systems I've seen. Level 1 intelligent characters, with factions differing in values rather than "good" vs "evil". Good reasons for why the locals haven't exploited magic OR science as much as the protagonist. Tough problems for the protagonist, including the need to learn the local language -- no miraculous translation spells here. Protagonist enacts some level 2-ish solutions but they are pretty obvious if you're a programmer; in fairness, the main character is not supposed to be a genius in general, just a reformed black-hat hacker.
