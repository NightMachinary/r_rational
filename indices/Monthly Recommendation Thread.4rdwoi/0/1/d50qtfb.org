I thank you very much for recommending this to me. Weird, imaginative character designs, alien cities, strange worlds that are not meant to be fully understood by the reader and cryptic, Michael Kirkbride-style world-building are some of the things I enjoy most of all in fiction, and that make this story a giant superstimulus for me.
