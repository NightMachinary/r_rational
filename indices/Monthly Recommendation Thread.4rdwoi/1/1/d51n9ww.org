Having played GURPS for a couple years, I can second: It is a really nice system. After coming from GURPS, other systems tend to feel rather restrictive, especially with respect to character building.

That beeing said, whether GURPS is a good fit for your game really depends on what you want to do:

-Worldbuilding: Other systems tend to provide vast, lovingly crafted worlds. Gurps encourages GMs to engage in world-building themselves; this is hard.

-Magic system: Frankly, I hate the default magic system of Gurps. In order to get a coherent state of affairs, the world-building and magic system need to be designed for each other.

-Combat: In contrary to other posters, I don't think the combat system is overly complicated or cumbersome. It is, however, incredibly lethal, both at lower and higher tech-levels. So this is a matter of taste: Do you want "realism" or shiny, powerful fiction-like knights or space-marines? During each fight, a couple bad rolls can mean permadeath for your beloved character that you nursed for years. Does this extra tension make the game more fun for you, because you have to actually think and plan and avoid fights? Or do you rather want to relax with a couple friends over some beers? Both are totally valid answers, but your entire group should agree on this, and your choice of system should reflect this.
