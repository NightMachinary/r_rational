Having worked and played with GURPS, I can say that in general (heh) I would NOT recommend it as a first RPG system to anyone. It's a different and refreshing breath of air to someone familiar with tabletop roleplay, but will be difficult and fiddly for new players. GURPS is probably the best system I've encountered from a simulationist perspective, and I've used elements of it in custom RPG systems I've made and quests I've run. That doesn't make it easy or fun for anyone not already very interested in tabletop RP. During actual play there can be some problems. It's the [[http://i.imgur.com/B8327D0.png][Dwarf Fortress]] of tabletop rpg systems, for better or for worse.
