You could try converting PTU's numbers to GURPS, in some fashion. GURPS operates on a somewhat-different scale--like D&D, PTU allows humans to have many dozens of hit points that increase with level (from an average base of 42 for a first-level trainer), while GURPS's rules have humans at an average of 10 HP regardless of character-point total and indirectly imply that even bodybuilders among humans rarely have more than thirty hit points--but it could still be possible. Maybe just dividing PTU's damage numbers by 4 (e.g., Flamethrower goes from 6d12+40 [averaging 79] in PTU to 5d+2 [averaging 19.5] in GURPS) would be sufficient!

Each PTU move could be treated as a GURPS spell. /GURPS [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/magic][Magic]]/ and /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/thaumatology][Thaumatology]]/ would be useful for devising a /Pokémon/-based "magic" system: /Magic/ has guidelines for calculating a new spell's energy cost based on its effects (for example, a Flamethrower spell capable of dealing 5d+2 damage would cost about 5 points of energy, which is pretty expensive for a standard human wizard--but Pokémon would have huge energy reserves), and /Thaumatology/ has guidelines for devising entire new systems of magic.

For the Pokémon themselves, GURPS assumes as a baseline that a living being has ST (Strength) and HP (Hit Points) of about 2 × ∛(weight in pounds), so that would make conversion of Pokémon stats at least /somewhat/ doable, maybe...
