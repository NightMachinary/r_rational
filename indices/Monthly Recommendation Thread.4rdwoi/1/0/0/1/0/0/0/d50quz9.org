Yeah, I'm not a great GM either.

I kind of prefer classless, point-based systems like GURPS, though; it feels less structured, although the amount of options PTU has is somewhat fascinating... I do plan for the game to be as lethal for trainers as it is in The Origin of Species, however. So we'll see how much all this supports my idea!
