Depends how much of the mechanics you use. The big problem with GURPS is that combat is in one second turns, and is fairly complex. There's simplified combat, but it's still 1-second turns. GURPS combat is blow-by-blow. Like, if you have a big weapon, you have to ready it. If you have a crossbow you spend like, 1-2 rounds reloading, for every shot. Actually you might be able to ready and attack in the same turn, but remember a turn is 1 second. So then, your heavy weapon is unreadied. And attacking cuts your other options, like you can't do stufflike parry if your weapon is unreadied.

There is some cool stuff though, like, if you are super strong, unbalanced weapons do not need to be readied. Er, not unbalanced, but heavy or something. The point is, GURPS combat is really high-granularity, which makes it great. I think if you avoid certain classes of things, like spellcasting, it's less bad. You often want to charge up spells for like 2-3 rounds. You can only like "charge" an amount to a spell equal to your magery level for free each round. Also you get penalties to parry based on how many other parries you did in the same round...

It's a lot of fun, but in general, it's complex and slows down combat a little bit due to the large amount of options and systems like defense roll. Most of the options in GURPS combat should be treated like 3.5e grappling (pretend it doesn't exist and never use it). You will probably end up writing a combat system that is very close to GURPS but throws a bunch of stuff out the window and adds other things that make sense.

I don't know if there's a good pokemon RPG, so GURPS might be your only option anyways. It's certainly capable of doing pokemon, as GURPS can basically do anything.

EDIT: they also have these combat cards you can print out and pretend it's a card game, playing one each turn. Basically a combat options cheat sheet: [[http://www.sjgames.com/gameaids/gurps/Combat_Cards_Color.pdf]]

So yeah overall the system is great. Really just the combat has issues. IT's not even THAT awful, it just requires that everyone knows the rules pretty well.
