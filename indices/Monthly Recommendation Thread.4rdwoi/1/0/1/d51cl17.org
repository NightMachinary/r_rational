Probably my favorite system from a "simulationist" perspective is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_System][Hero System]]. I've run everything from cyberpunk to a campaign set in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire w/ a tinge of necromancy to street level martial arts to superheroes in it.

The way the rules are structured, say, things like strength double every 5 points. This exponential curve scales to more power levels than the GURPS equivalent. This is a particular strength in the superhero setting it was originally designed for, but it works well with "normal characeristic maxima" for street level campaigns as well. Also the stats for your characters are more interconnected in terms of base points, which leads to fewer absurd stat combinations.
