[[https://ebihime.itch.io/lily][Lily of the Valley]] is an excellent, free visual novel by ebi-hime. It only has one choice near the end (it's fairly short). It's not rational, but it's an excellent depiction of depression. Summary: Returning home to Wales for the first time in ten years to attend his mother's funeral, a middle-aged man encounters a young girl he has never met before on a walk in the countryside. Although her face is often expressionless, her words harsh and cutting the man soon forges a friendship with her, of sorts, as he confides in her his worries. However, their every encounter leaves him with more questions. How did she know his departed mother? Why does she have such a morbid fascination with death? And why does she look so much like his childhood sweetheart?

I also recommend that people here try out [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/251990/][Long Live the Queen]] if you haven't already. It's a visual novel with raising sim elements and lots of choices. Your goal is to survive as a 14-year-old princess until you're crowned queen. The game has a lot of branch points and it's fun replaying it to see the different ways of surviving are and slowly figuring out all the nobles' backstories and scheming.

I'm not sure if I've recommended this here before, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown][Wearing Robert's Crown]] is probably my favorite Game of Thrones self insert fic, with the main character making many rational decisions in governing Westeros. It updates regularly, and unlike most Game of Thrones fics, is actually starting to approach the point where the White Walkers become relevant.
