No one really seems to talk about E.B.O.N.Y. ([[http://www.ebony.extra.hu][www.ebony.extra.hu]]) aside from a few forums. No discussion at all in Reddit, even. Well, this is an attempt to fix that.

E.B.O.N.Y. ("The Weirdest Riddle Game On The Internet!") is a "riddle game" - a screen will give you the clues that you have to solve, and (generally) you put the answer directly in the URL to get to the next level. The riddles are pretty varied - some are a little straightforward if kinda lengthy to work out, but others require you to think "different" - they're exactly the kind of puzzles that makes no sense on a first look but then, when you actually know the answer, you think again and say "****, this was so obvious!" Some also reference other works/disciplines, so you might have an easier time on some levels if you, say, went through classical music training, or like to read mystery novels, or such.

Riddle games were something of a fad around the time E.B.O.N.Y. first came out, I think, though as far as I know this one's the only one that has a story, the concept of which I found pretty compelling, which is what had me hooked all these years. That said, the overall story isn't actually done. The creator says it'll take about 200 levels, not including forks, to finish, and only recently did he update the game up to level ~75. And most of the story come from conversation with characters, where there tends to be an average of 10-15 levels between meeting a character. Half of me think that's the reason meeting a new character felt so engaging, though the other half wanted to bulldoze through them so I can meet a new character already.

Hope some of you try it so I have someone to talk about it with.
