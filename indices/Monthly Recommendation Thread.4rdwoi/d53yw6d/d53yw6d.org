Does anyone have recommendations for (preferably complete) television shows that are primarily about the workplace with some element of learning? I've been watching /Shirobako/, which seems to be largely about the professional environment and working relationships, and when I get to the end of it, I'd like more of that. /Atelier/ was also like that, in that the relationships and characters were largely defined by work, in contrast to American sitcoms where work is just the forgettable backdrop for jokes or romance.
