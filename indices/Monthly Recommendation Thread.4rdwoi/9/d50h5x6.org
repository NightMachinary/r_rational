I can only recommend some fanfics I've read recently. I make no guarantees as to how good they are or their rational qualities. I will list them in reverse chronological order (the one I read most recently being the first).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10753296/1/Lesser-Evils][Lesser evils]] HP fic. Harry responds differently to Voldemort's resurrection and Cedric's death, which leads to him delving into his mental connection to Voldemort, resulting in consequences good and bad. The writing is largely in-character, the changes to canon believable and not at all overdone.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] HP/ASoIaF Harry is born as Robert Baratheon's middle child, regaining his old memories and magic, but not his full personality. An interesting concept, adequately executed. The writing is reminiscent of ASoIaF, not HP. Left me wanting more.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7977390/1/Life-in-Konoha-s-ANBU][Life in Konoha's ANBU]]. Naruto has the Hokage's personal attention and training from an early age. He's still the same person in some ways, but in others the brainwashing/conditioning has palpable - and scary - results. One of the more enjoyable Naruto fics I've read. The characters are distinct and believable, even the OC's, the storylines interesting. Makes use of filler material, but it works out well.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters][He who fights monsters]] Rosario + Vampire. Largely does away with the canon storyline (I believe - I never could get myself to watch it). Instead, the protagonist gets no help and no reprieve in his stay at the monster academy. He has to make his own way, and he does so - badass human style. Some of his kills strain credulity, but overall it's an enjoyable work that I'd recommend to this subreddit in particular.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8114428/1/Death-Is-Only-The-Beginning][Death is Only the Beginning]] Bleach. Ichigo is born and dies in time to meet Rukia and Renji as they get their start in Rukongai/the afterlife. It's a fairly interesting take on the Soul Society, and slightly more in-depth than the usual fare. There's not as much action as you might expect of Bleach, but it didn't bore me.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8963527/1/Tale-of-the-Setting-Sun][Tale of the Setting Sun]] Naruto. Standard "Naruto is smarter/better than usual" fare. Enjoyable enough, but I genuinely can't recall much of the story only a month after reading it - so take that as you will.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11209443/1/How-Long-Is-Forever][How Long is Forever?]] Naruto. Sakura time-travels into her younger self, and makes some changes. Chapters are in a slightly non-chronological order, but they still tell a story decently enough, and the concept is pretty neat. Definitely more memorable than the above story, too.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7233479/1/Ver%C3%A4nderung][Ver√§nderung]] Blue Exorcist. Rin accesses his blue fire very early, which results in him becoming more competent and entering a different, perhaps closer, relationship with his family. In the Anime, I found Blue Exorcist's world to be very interesting - but they never quite showed enough to satisfy me (and the final episodes were horrible and clearly filler) - this fic did far better.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8144246/1/Miserly-Old-Man-Trickster-Fox][Miserly Old Man, Trickster Fox]] Naruto. The Hokage's old friend (an OC) comes to town and takes an interest in Naruto, essentially fostering and training him. The OC can feel slightly grating in the beginning, but he finds his pace, and overall makes for a good addition that fits in pretty well.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10490270/1/A-Political-Perspective][A Political Perspective]] Naruto. The civilian council tries to force Kakashi into passing Team 7. He retaliates by agreeing. Surprisingly well written, fun, and sometimes touching. Recommended.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][Coming Back Late]] HP. Harry comes back into his body late after Voldie hits him with the killing curse. This results in him faking his death for the greater good. Has a pretty good romance with Hermione, surprisingly believable and touching. It's essentially complete, so you won't feel empty after it stops mid-story, not really.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam][In Memoriam]] Toaru Majutsu no Index. Essentially a rewrite of canon, and for the better in my opinion. It feels like an actual world instead of something cobbled together the way anime worlds tend to. Has a pretty enjoyable writing style, too.
