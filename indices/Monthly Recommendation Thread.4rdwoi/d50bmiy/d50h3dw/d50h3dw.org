If you're into VNs, I strongly recommend reading Umineko no naku koro ni. It's possibly my all-time favorite piece of fictional media.

Plot teaser: October 1986. A rich and extravagant family holds its annual reunion in a western-style mansion on a private island in Japan. A raging typhoon prevents them from leaving while the massive portrait of a mysterious young woman smiles at them from the main hall...

It's not quite rational but has rational themes and can reach impressive levels of meta-awareness. It's a bit of an unconventional VN in that it has no gameplay at all- you just read along. Also, no sexy scenes!

Additional notes: epic lenght (8 separate novel-lenght episodes) and absolutely stunning soundtrack.
