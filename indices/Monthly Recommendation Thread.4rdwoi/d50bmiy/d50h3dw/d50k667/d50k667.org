I know you said it was not quite rational so I shouldn't expect too much, but do you know how it compares to Higurashi no naku koro ni? Because that one was painful.

Also if you enjoy episodic visual novels with no gameplay, take a look at World End Economica. It's about this kid who lives in the moon and works as a day trader.
