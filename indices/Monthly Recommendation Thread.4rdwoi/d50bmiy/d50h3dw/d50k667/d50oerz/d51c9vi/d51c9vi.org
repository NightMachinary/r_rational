  I assume you refer to the anime of Higurashi, right?

The first two episodes of the Higurashi VN are available on Steam and were fairly cheap at some point. Haven't seen the anime yet, but I think I will do that instead of playing through all the dozens of episodes.

  You should definitely check it out regardless of your opinion on Higurashi!

I will try to give Umineko a shot. No matter how good it is, I'm subject to a powerful Streetlight Effect where I only play VNs that work in my Linux laptop. I'm too lazy to re-boot every time I want to play a Windows game. Maybe Wine will work.
