  Finished G-senjou no maou recently. Highly recommended VN, best one out of the handful I've played so far.

Ohhh, yesss. It was brilliant for me.

If you've got a hundred hours or so to waste, then a visual novel can grip you like few other media. [[https://vndb.org/v/all?q=;fil=tagspoil-0;rfil=;o=d;s=pop][Here]] is a decent list. [[https://vndb.org/v92][Muv-Luv Alternative]] is a classic time travel story, and I can recommend both [[https://vndb.org/v17][Ever17]] and [[https://vndb.org/v751][Rewrite]], as well.

The only reason I don't get more into VN's is because of the sheer time investment - but nothing else gets me as invested emotionally, and the catharsis that brings is absolutely /delicious/.

If you've the time, and can bring yourself to ignore or enjoy the explicit parts (there's /always/ going to be sex scenes), I heavily recommend VN's.
