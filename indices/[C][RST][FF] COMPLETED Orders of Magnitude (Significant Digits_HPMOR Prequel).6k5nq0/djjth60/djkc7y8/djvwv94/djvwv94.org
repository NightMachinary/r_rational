You know, I liked both hpmor and sd, but I just don't get oom. I'm not stupid, but I don't know anything about programming and I had just enough background information to know that most of the references went over my head. The others were both accessible to someone who understands logic from a non computer orientation, but oom really wasn't.

From a comment, I realized that the light and lawliet bit was about deathnote, and I googled to find other references that didn't make sense to me. I feel like I missed a large part of the story and it might have made more sense to me if there had been fewer references or if they had been more integrated into the story.
