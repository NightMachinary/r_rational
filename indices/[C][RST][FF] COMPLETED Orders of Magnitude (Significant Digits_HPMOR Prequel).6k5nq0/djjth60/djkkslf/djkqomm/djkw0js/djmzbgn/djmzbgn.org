I'm in the middle of SD now and I feel the same way. My friend told me it was of comparable quality and that is what made me start reading. While I am very much enjoying SD, it lacks whatever quality MoR had that caused me to obsess over it.

I may change my mind as I keep reading, but I have to say, MoR had me hooked immediately and kept me hooked continuously.
