I haven't gotten around to OoM, though I will say that I prefer SD to HPMOR, for all that HPMOR was the more transformative experience. Spoilers for HPMOR below.

I mean, don't get me wrong, HPMOR was neat and dramatically raised the bar for what I consume in fiction in a lot of ways, but its premise is at war with itself. It wants to be pedagogical via Harry but isn't rigorous about citing sources and sometimes even does so incorrectly (or has incorrect scientific info to start with), and sometimes is incorrect /on purpose/ to be more realistic about the characters and so does neither quite right.

It tries to have the characters act realistically and intelligently in their own interests, but has the explanation for the society's estrangement from muggle science and the ability for muggle knowledge and scientific technique to be hugely important simply be that the society is mostly stupid.

It wants to make the thought processes of the characters solid enough to be genuinely emulate-able, but most often displays those processes as Harry going on a lecture about rationality to say why the person he's speaking to is wrong, and when this happens he is never interrupted and the other speaker never tries to Ad Hominem Tu Quoque with it on the spot or later on - even though those are the number one things you're going to be hit with if you try that in real life. Harry's rhetorical victories, however correct he may be in a situation, were ultimately as removed from the real world as any Sherlock Holmes chain inference, and that takes a huge chunk of the demonstrations of Harry's thought processes with it.

The story wanted to be about the origin of Hermione, and to demonstrate how knowing just enough to be dangerous can backfire... but also wanted to be a mystery and so withheld almost all thematic elements which would actually illustrate that origin story or that thematic arc in order to preserve the mystery, resulting in something that LOOKS like it'll be a scientific exploration of magic fic but which never really delivers on that promise.

This is to say nothing of the pacing and interspersing problems - the narrative tunnelvisioned quite a bit, resulting in stuff like the war games getting sole focus for several chapters and then ceasing to exist for a long while, with almost nothing else happening. Basic techniques about parallel narrative, and choosing what and when to show about the world which could have helped mitigate stuff from above went nearly untouched.

HPMOR was a trailblazer and did a lot of extraordinary things, but it was a deeply, /deeply/ flawed work which tried to be too many things at once and suffered for it. SD's strength, in my mind, was that it narrowed its thematic focus as a story, planned out how it was going to achieve that, and stuck to it. It had the trappings of mystery and intelligent characters and continued the story using a much firmer literary foundation than HPMOR ever had. By giving up some of the things HPMOR tried to be, and by employing parallel narrative more liberally, it did what remained better.

Far be it from me to tell anyone else not to enjoy what they enjoy, though. There's no reason not to get the most out of our entertainment, after all.
