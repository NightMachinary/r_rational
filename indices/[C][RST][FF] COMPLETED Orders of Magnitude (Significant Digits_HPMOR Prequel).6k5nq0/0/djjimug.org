I'll write up a more in-depth analysis tomorrow morning, but I wanted to make sure I fulfilled my promise to complete OoM on Tau Day.

I've made a few key changes to some prior chapters, but if you prefer not to reread the whole thing, you can start from the most recent chapter, [[http://www.2pih.com/uncategorized/writing-orders-of-magnitude-chapter-27-the-tragedy-of-light/][The Tragedy of Light]]

I tried to resolve all of the dangling threads, but if there are aspects of the world you are curious about, I'll gladly answer any questions you might have.
