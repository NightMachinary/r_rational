From someone who has recently finished reading the whole thing: it's the shit. It's frickin' amazing. If you haven't read HPMOR or SD, there are a lot of references you won't get, so I'm not sure how much enjoyment you'll get from reading this fic but I'll just say it's incredibly well-written and compelling with all the cleverness of HPMOR and all the inventive world-building of SD.
