Ok, that actually helps to clarify why I enjoy HPMOR so much, and why I couldn't really get into Significant Digits. HPMOR was kind of crazy and all over the place, but I guess I see that as acceptable in serial fiction, and while it does have quite a lot of loose ends, that just leaves fertile ground for meta-fic.

Speaking of which, I really ought to get to writing myself.
