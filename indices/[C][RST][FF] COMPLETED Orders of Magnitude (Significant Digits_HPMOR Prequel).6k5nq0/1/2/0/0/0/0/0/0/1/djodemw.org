I fully acknowledge all of the weaknesses that you identify in your post.

It is definitely not in the same genre as HPMOR. Whether or not that's a bad thing up to the individual reader. I personally have a hard time the pedagogy of purely rational fics, because it's easy to be a rational protagonist when the universe is designed to fit your needs. For example, Harry "winning" the final battle against Quirrell just as easily could have been a spectacular loss if just one of about twelve different obvious failure points had gone off. For the most part, in any rational fic, if characters were ACTUALLY rational, there'd be no story. So either the author has to create an implausibly convenient universe or they have to deliberately write flaws into the characters, neither of which bode particular well for trying to teach people things.

I do muse on this very subject in the chapter "The Tragedy of Light". But ultimately if you came into OoM looking for lessons in rationality, you will definitely be disappointed because the only real lesson here is: [[#s][Spoiler]]

As for the drivers of the plot, it's funny that you mention Brandon Sanderson because at some point in OoM I make a deliberate reference to the Sandersonian style of fiction where things just "happen" to work out in a very specific way. But being self-aware of a problem isn't the same as fixing it. OOM fully acknowledges the inherent capriciousness of the Magical universe and specifically seeks to explain it [[#s][Spoiler]] Whether or not you will find the explanation satisfying is a different question entirely.

As for the Chekhov Gun misfirings: I'm guilty of a few of these but I feel like I did a decent job of wrapping up all those loose ends. I even quite painfully had to get rid of about 30,000 words worth of writing because it just didn't contribute to the main plot. I think if this was a reader's chief complaint with SD, they may actually enjoy OoM. (But realistically I think that for most people, this particular point isn't the /primary/ problem they have with SD, it's one of the secondary)

As for the climax- one of the biggest points of OoM was to offer an alternate explanation to the climax of SD wherein Merlin's actions actually make sense. HOWEVER: OoM's explanation in many ways is cheating an in a certain sense has all the literary satisfaction of [[#s][Spoiler]]. The fact that <spoiler> is heavily foreshadowed probably doesn't make it any more palatable.

So to summarize, if you didn't enjoy SD because of the tonal/genre shift from HPMOR, you probably won't enjoy OoM. If you didn't enjoy SD because of the climax or the Chekhov Gun misfirings, you still have a chance of enjoying OoM.

Edit: as for the other two posts, I think I generally acknowledged the meta-impact of EY's declaration in a previous comment. And I agree about serial publishing not being an excuse. If anything I have even less of an excuse because I specifically eschewed the serial approach multiple times, having significantly rewritten the story and structure twice, and publishing the final arc all at once.
