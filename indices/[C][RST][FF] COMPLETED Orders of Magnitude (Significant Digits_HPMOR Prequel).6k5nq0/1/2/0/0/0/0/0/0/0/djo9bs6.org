*In response to a counterpoint on that critique:*

In general, I think we disagree on the percentage level---for instance, you point to the arrival of a hundred phoenixes and /don't/ think of that as cheating for a cool moment, whereas I think it /is/ cheating for a cool moment. There's nothing about that moment in the battle, or even that battle in general, to imply that it's more phoenix-worthy than any other moments throughout history (or even in the story itself) to have a suspension-of-disbelief-breaking HUNDRED phoenixes show up. So I imagine it's just an issue of where each of us draws the line.

Same thing for idiot ball. Merlin firmly held it throughout the entire story, in my opinion. Same thing for explicit rationality, of which /I/ think Harry and Hermione did basically zero, except "generally plan ahead." Same thing for the repeated "oh, the problem will be solved by an ancient magical artifact" sort-of deus-exes.

Re: worldbuilding, there's good and bad side stuff. Speaking as someone who loves the Wheel of Time and has read every book in it at least four times, I love me some ancillary action. But ancillary action has to pay off /in itself/, if it's just there to enrich the world, or otherwise it's wasted time. Again, I think it's just that we have different tolerance levels? I notice that you more-or-less agreed to the majority of my points, and basically just felt that each was either enjoyable anyway, or less egregious than I was making it out to be.

Probably the only point I have an ... antagonistic? As opposed to friendly debate-y? ... reaction to is your last one, about the strengths and weaknesses of publish-as-you-go. I think you make a fair appraisal of the situation, but I personally don't think that explanation suffices for an /excuse./ I recently got into a long back-and-forth about how terrible the book Elantris is, and someone was like, hey, give the guy a break, it was his /first novel/. To which my response was, no one made him publish /before/ he learned how to write passably well.

I think there's a similar deal with serial fiction. I'm writing serial fiction myself---I'll be up until two or three in the morning tonight, working on r!Animorphs. But if one of my chapters sucks because it's branching, verbose, or haphazard, I think I should still be criticized for that. Saying "but but but it's because I'm publishing as I go!" seems, to me, like saying "but but but this is only my tenth painting ever!" Sure, and it deserves credit for trying, and maybe the hundredth one will be better. But that doesn't make it /good/, and if it's bad, valid criticisms should be "allowed" to be spoken. The immaturity of a given artist or a given draft is no defense---if a creator doesn't want to be criticized for those flaws, they can always just ... wait until their work doesn't have those flaws.
