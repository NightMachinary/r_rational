I think it's actually fairly relevant, as if you did not like SD, you will almost /definitely/ not like OoM, likely for the very same literary reasons.

There's also the meta-factor here. Rational Fanfiction, by its very nature, is a genre that /has/ to concern itself with the "meta-game" (ex-Magic player here, I still can't shake the terminology). For example, you could make the argument that Significant Digits played a major role in EY's lack of an official HPMOR epilogue. You could also argue that EY's proclamation of SD as the 'unofficial sequel' had a stifling effect on other HPMOR continuation fics. The outpouring of praise for Significant Digits does not exist in a vacuum: it obliquely impacts the thematic direction of future HPMOR-related fiction. If you vastly preferred HPMOR to SD, then the latter's success negatively impacts you.

Incidentally, my description of the SD-universe within OOM is, on one of its levels, a deliberate metaphor for this: Merlin inadvertently "binds all worlds to this one [the SD-verse]" and thus destroys his own world's chance at salvation.
