Gotcha. I think that's a fair point to bring up. If you didn't enjoy the direction that SD took HPMOR in, you'll almost definitely not enjoy OoM. It continues in the direction that SD pointed, and abandons much of what drew people to HPMOR.

There's very little of the HPMOR charm, action, or intrigue. It doesn't attempt to teach any lessons and there's no clear protagonist, it's really only a rationalist fic in a very meta, global sense and there's very little transparency or solvable mysteries within the context of the individual storylines.
