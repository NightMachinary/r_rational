I thought this one was awesome. It's basically cementing Deadhand's legend. As Diabolist has already proven, names can evolve with enough zeitgeist.

Also, Hakram doesn't have a third aspect... yet.

Edit: Also I'd like to point out. The scope of the two songs is entirely different. One is about an entire army of footsoldiers and how they'll live. The other is about what happens if you fuck with the one handed man.
