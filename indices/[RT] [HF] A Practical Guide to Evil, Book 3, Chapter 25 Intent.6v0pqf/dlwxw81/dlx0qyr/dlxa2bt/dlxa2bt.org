Can't get anywhere in life by -not- becoming a necromantic abomination while being the right hand to a future evil overlord.

One thing I really like about Hakram is that he has essentially traded a hand for renown, respect, and a toolbox to deal with things he normally could not. It's like one of those magic weapons they talk about, super useful with potential huge drawbacks (if he ever fights a necromancer, but if Apprentice is around who cares about necromancers?)
