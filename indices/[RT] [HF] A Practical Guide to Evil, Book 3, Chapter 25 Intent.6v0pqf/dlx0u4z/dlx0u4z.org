Loved Cat's mature approach here.

1. Recognising her mistake.

2. Gathering all her forces rather than going it alone.

3. Sending Hakram in for the Count and cementing Hakram's rise in power by doing so.

4. Plotting with the Duchess.

5. Sending in the Watch immediately once the Count was dead.

She's learning.
