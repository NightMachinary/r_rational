The military would care because the military wants to know of any possible sources of future problems. A highly-aggressive woman is still within the scope of things they know how to handle, but a highly-aggressive crossdressing/transsexual/intersexed individual could warrant further monitoring for unforeseen complications.

Ultimately it IS just wanting to retain complete control and authority over the soldiers. It's a power thing and a group dynamics thing. Outside of a military context, this is probably near-completely inappropriate. In a military context, it might still be, but the military essentially gets a pass on some inappropriate things because they're the military.
