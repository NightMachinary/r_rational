Intersex medical conditions have been known to physicians since antiquity. The terminology has varied over time, and understanding of the specific details of the medical etiology are fairly recent.

For the purposes of historical accuracy, I went ahead and did some research.

The term used until fairly recently was "hermaphrodite," which was broken down into "true" and "pseudo" during the Victorian era. Any well-read physician in the 20th century would have access to documentation of the phenomenon. The term "intersex" was introduced in the 1940s and accepted in use in the UK in the 1960s; I can't find a specific timeline of when it was used in the US.

Genetic testing was first used in the 50s for phenylketonuria, and expanded to include a small number of additional disorders in the 70s. Card would possibly have known about the possibility of a genetic test to identify the presence of the Y chromosome, although it's not likely he would have known of the non-chromosomal genetic factors.

The developmental function of androgens and estrogens was already well-known to physicians by the 1960s. If Card cared to know, he would have been able to know about these, and they're easily checked with a blood test.

I think the most relevant piece of information with regards to institutional sex testing for cases of unexpected performance, though, is that it was first proposed for the Olympic Games in 1936. The earliest known case was that of a 1932 runner that was discovered to have intersex genitalia upon her death in 1980 -- this discovery could well have been news Card was aware of, as it would have been relatively recent history at the time Ender's Game was written.
