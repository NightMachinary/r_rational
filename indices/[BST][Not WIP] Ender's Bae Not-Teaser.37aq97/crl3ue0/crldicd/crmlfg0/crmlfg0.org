On the assumption that Ender's Game is set in the future of our own world, such a test -- even administered by a blunt, uncaring, sexist organization -- ought to be recognized as /medically/ incorrect. If the obvious visual cues of Petra's physical sex aren't sufficiently convincing, then slightly-less-obvious visual cues aren't going to be sufficiently convincing either.

The first step, for an organization aware of the existence of DNA and hormones, ought to be a blood test -- evaluating androgen and estrogen levels, and checking for a Y chromosome. After all, if you're already uncertain about her sex and your existing data doesn't make you convinced, "intersex" ought to be considered a possible conclusion.
