Start with the tests, but make them about something else. Come up with something cool. The thing she is being tested for will be the focus of the story. A character study is only interesting if the character's strength is trademark, like Ender or Sherlock Holmes. You need one for her to have a story about her.

The most important thing: don't write a parallel novel, especially don't while copying his style. That's caged death. And pointless.
