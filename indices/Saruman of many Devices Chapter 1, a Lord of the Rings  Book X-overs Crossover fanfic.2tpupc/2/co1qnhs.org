So after reading the first two chapters I have one thing that irks me most. The Uruk's anachronism. It makes sense that the ancient and wise Saruman mentally connected to the stunted FAI 'Central' thinks in a rather modern fashion, but what made the Uruk into disciplined and educated men discussing Gandalf's bigotry? And what happened to the LOTR canon degeneration. Did Saruman manage to cure his race completely of everything but their ugly face despite millennia of corruption through Morgoth?
