I am curious how it will develop given that God literally has a plan for this world that He's acting to defend and I'm pretty sure that plan does not include outerdimensional AIs. I wonder if this world is even still in the same cosmology. I mean, the power of the Maiar is technically outerdimensional itself, no? So how does that work with the cosmology?
