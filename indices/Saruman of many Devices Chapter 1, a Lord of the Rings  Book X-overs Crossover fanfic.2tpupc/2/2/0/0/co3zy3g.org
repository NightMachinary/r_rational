I'm not intimately familiar with the uruk creation process but Saruman manages to train an entire army well enough to carry out a siege and march in ranks, there's clearly some initial knowledge dump which presumably could be tinkered. Other than that I think it was mainly just the author using a conversation to contrast the story uruks to canon uruks.
