So generations of purposeful inbreeding don't have any actual effect? Because it seems like the book treats all the rest of the book as canon, including fiery balrogs, magical palantir and Sauron with all his evil magic and manifold minions. In any case, even if the Uruk minds are as sharp or sharper than those of humans they still wouldn't suddenly become a wise-cracking, post-medieval culture casually talking about Gandalf's bigotry. Not to mention how they are suddenly completely at home with any new innovation, supremely understanding and disciplined and generally more perfect than life all the while, if I understood the Uruk creation process right, having had less than 5 years of education since their birth. Because if Uruk have a normal life cycle then when did Saruman manage to breed several regiments plus support staff in the little time since he came into contact with Sauron? And who the hell gave them all of that anachronistic culture? Allfather Saruman?
