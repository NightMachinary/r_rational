If you like often highly specific and technical reading I definitely recommend the alternatehistory.com boards where the author posts this story. You can find lengthy stories on what seem like tiny changes and outside of ASB (alien space bats) forum they all are attempting to accurately represent people and their desires (huge part of history), no evil irrational antagonist. You also get lots of discussion about how a 17th century weaponry operates etc. I've recommended the site before here.
