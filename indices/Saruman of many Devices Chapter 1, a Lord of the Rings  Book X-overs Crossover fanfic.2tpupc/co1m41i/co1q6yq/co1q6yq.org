fanfiction.net has a category called "Book X-overs" which seems to be used for crossovers with books that aren't in their own category, or for when there's a crossover between multiple books. It's basically a failure state for their categorization system, since saying that this is a /Lord of the Rings/ and /Book X-overs/ crossover is utterly meaningless.

It's actually a crossover between /The Lord of the Rings/ and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_series][/The General/ series]] by S.M. Stirling.
