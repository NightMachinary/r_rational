The Hero with a Thousand Chances is about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle][Anthropic Principle]] (which is what the counterforce really is). Essentially, since the hero will only be summoned to a world which was not destroyed by the Dust, any world in which he is summoned will have survived past encounters with the Dust (but also not defeated it forever, since in that case he would not need to be summoned). A lot of the hero's quotes make a lot more sense in this context, especially this one:

#+begin_quote
  You are the walking dead, and this is a dead world spinning, and /many other worlds like this one are already destroyed./
#+end_quote

As such, the exact form of the Dust is irrelevant to the story, since it concerns itself more with the summoning of the hero than with anything that the hero actually /does/. Per Word of God, he originally intended for it to be some meta-level bias towards disorder that affected the future probability tree of the world (or something along those lines; I saw the comment about half a year ago). He did concede that that wasn't necessary in order for the story to work.

It's been a while since I've read some of these, so I'm not sure what you mean by the Jeni's Oil link.
