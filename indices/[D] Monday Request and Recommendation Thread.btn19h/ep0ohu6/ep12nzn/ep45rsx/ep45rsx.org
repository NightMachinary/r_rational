It's for myself. I think that some knowledge can help interpret the world better, e.g. knowing my biases definitely helps me compensate for them, and it's much easier to learn about them from a psychology book than to come up with them on my own. I agree with you though that introspection and honesty are fundamental in the road to rationality, and that sometimes people get a little too fixated to terminologies.
