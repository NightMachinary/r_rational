Check out:

- the Center for Applied Rationality [[https://rationality.org/resources/reading-list][reading list]].

- [[https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/][A taxonomy of ways books change your worldview]] by Julia Galef (and her short [[https://www.youtube.com/user/measureofdoubt][youtube videos]]).

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1096665.Good_and_Real][Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics]] by Gary L. Drescher (I'm reading it now and it's really good).

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32488786-bayes-theorem][Bayes Theorem: A Visual Introduction For Beginners]] by Dan Morris.

I echo [[/u/JanusTheDoorman]]'s suggestion on reading about game theory and The Strategy of Conflict is a great place to start. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2423424.The_Art_of_Strategy][The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist's Guide to Success in Business and Life]] by Avinash K. Dixit is also a good layman text.
