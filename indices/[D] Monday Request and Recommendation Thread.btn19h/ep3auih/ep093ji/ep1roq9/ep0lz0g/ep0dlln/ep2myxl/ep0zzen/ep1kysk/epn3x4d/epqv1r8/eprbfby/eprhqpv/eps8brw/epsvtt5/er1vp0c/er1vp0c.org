Alright so Ive read everything but Unsong and they were all /wonderful/. I was a bit confused by the last half of The Hero with a Thousand Chances though. Was it the the Dusk was death itself? Or that they were merely on an unlucky branch of reality while the other times the heroes actually suceeded?

The Jeni's Oil link confused me.
