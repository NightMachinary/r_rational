Imagine trying to learn to write. You can get pretty far by having a good intuition of what people like to read and what makes stories engaging for you to read but there is many layers that you aren't aware of conciously, and reading other people's thoughts on those subjects(which involves naming them so you can refer to them) can up your game. This is true for most life skills, if you have a flair you can get far on your own but not as far as you could have gotten if you learned from others.
