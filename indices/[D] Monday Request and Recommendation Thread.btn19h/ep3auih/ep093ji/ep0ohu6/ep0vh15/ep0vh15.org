Yudkowsky's book, Rationality from A-Z is probably the best starting point, and Philip Tetlock's Superforecasting is probably the best book on actually making good predictions. Thinking Fast & Slow is a classic, but also a lot of the results it cites have since failed to replicate, so a companion piece like Re-Thinking Fast & Slow is recommended.

I find game theory quite informative as well. I think there are a few high quality college courses on it that have been put on YouTube. Thomas Schelling's The Strategy of Conflict is good for going being the introductory stuff.

Beyond that, I feel like getting more rational is more about front better domain specific knowledge than it is about better understanding belief formation and decision making. Duhigg's Smarter, Faster, Better is more pop self help than hard science but it's reasonably well researched.

80,000 Hours Career Guide has a lot, lot of stuff that's generally applicable not just in professional life. Of particular value for me at least was Cal Newport's So Good They Can't Ignore You.
