Have you read Worm? There's a fanfic called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/][I woke up as a Dungeon, now what?]] which features Worm's Main Character from after the end of the book suddenly finding herself as the spirit controlling a classical adventure game Dungeon on a world that's based on RPGs.

So far, the fic hasn't involved the Worm parts overly much, remaining almost an entirely original work, but it does spoil the end of Worm.

Politics and subterfuge are a big part of the story, and at least the one country we see explicitly is ruled by a very intelligent and cunning leader.
