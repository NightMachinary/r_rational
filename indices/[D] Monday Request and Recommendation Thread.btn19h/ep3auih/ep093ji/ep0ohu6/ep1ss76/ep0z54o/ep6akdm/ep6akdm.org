I've recently finished the WormFic Tabloid and I feel deeply bittersweet. The Fic itself is well written, interesting, and well rounded. The portrayal of office life and politics is a high point. The characters are eminently believable, complex, with tight snappy diologue.

It is bittersweet because the story ends, and ends conclusively. Worm itself creates an amazingly potent world, with a ton of depth and breadth. Tabloid does a great job of filling out it's particular corner of the Wormiverse.

Worm was one of the first serial fics I ever read, before I discovered this site. I believe I made it through Arc 17 before throwing in the towel. I gave up because I found the story too angsty, too negative, too depressing. Every plan made, every step forward, seemed to be stomped into the mud and laughed at, while the helpless civilians die by the score. While the story was prolific, the writing proficient (or better), I simply didn't enjoy the pain and suffering depicted in the story.

It pains me to finish quality WormFics because I know that they are over, and that the main corpus is soooo much larger yet so much less enjoyable.

Is it worth it giving Worm another try? How about any of Woldbow's other fics? Are there any essential WormFics outside of Tabloid or A Bad Name?
