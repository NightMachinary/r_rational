No, it's not worth giving Worm another try. Taylor (indirectly: readers) was subjected with much suffering, yet she did not get the satisfaction worth all those pain. What she got in the end is a chance to start over. I say WTF!. You'd better find other fics that actually reward you for the pain. I heard it's a common practice. As common as great climax/conclusion if several early chapters were a slog fest.
