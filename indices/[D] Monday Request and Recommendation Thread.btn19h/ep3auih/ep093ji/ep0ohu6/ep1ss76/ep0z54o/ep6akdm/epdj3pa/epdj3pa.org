[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/glassmaker-worm-complete.433391/][Glassmaker]] is something everyone who has tried Worm should read. The prose is something special, and the tone is way lighter. Also it's complete.

The [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]] trilogy is often regarded as an "essential" fic, because it is very true to the tone of canon, which might turn you personally off of it. I feel it has several more decisive wins for Taylor, though; you might find it more bearable.

Taylor's distorted perception colored the world darker than it actually needed to be, in my opinion. When Ward's main character looks back at her life in those days, it's way less dour. One interlude taking place in 2013 is downright sweet for a bit.\\
