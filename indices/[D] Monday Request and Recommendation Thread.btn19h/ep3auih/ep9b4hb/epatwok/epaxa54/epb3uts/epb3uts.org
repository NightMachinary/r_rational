I had almost no prior knowledge of Homestuck before reading Conference Call. Mostly I knew that it has some level of absurdly advanced tech but not any details except a vague sense of dimensional shenanigans.

Not really spoilers but kinda: The Homestuck portion of Conference Call follows, as I understand it, a minor character who appears in one segment of the story who was popular with fans. It pretty much tells you what you need to know as the story goes, but you would probably /get/ it more if you're familiar.

Admittedly, the Homestuck parts are the least well explained / described because of both the viewpoint character and the complexity of that universe. This does produce the right /feeling/; that the Homestuck universe seems bizarre from the outside.
