As unusual as the combination sounds, it's handled well and not a confusing and overwhelming mess (like you might expect if you've had the same experience I have with multi-cross stories).

While it doesn't seem strictly necessary to be familiar with all the source material, I'd recommend being at least somewhat familiar with Worm and MoL, and at least not completely unaware of the other two.
