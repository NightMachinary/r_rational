The author has gone out of their way to not only make knowledge of any of the settings not required, but has actually stated that they will not be introducing anything that could conceivably be considered "spoilers" from any of them.

I personally think they've overcompensated a tad on that front, but I'm familiar with all 4 sources so I might be biased.
