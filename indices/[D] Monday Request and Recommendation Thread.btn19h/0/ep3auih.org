It was recommended [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b5bs7a/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ejctgpv/][a couple of months ago]] and it stayed in my backlog until recently, after reading the first book of *[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/][Oh this has not gone well]]*, I feel like I have to strongly recommend /against/ reading it. I hope I reached any potential readers in time.

This is the worst case of narrative enforced sunk cost fallacy I've ever read.

The story always makes you think the slog you're currently reading is the prelude to the actually good part up ahead, i.e. first reaching the magic school, then claiming the old guild hall, and finally the war, but once you get there it's all over in a couple scenes with noticeable worse writing. It makes this story more harmful than it would otherwise be, since the day-to-day writing is godawful, with some of the most generic and flat characters I've ever read, but there was always the dangling carrot of interesting plot developments hanging ahead to make me keep reading, until I reached the end of the first book and realized it was all for nothing.

In retrospect, the author seems to solely use those parts of the plot as an excuse to write his self insert banging a bunch of fantasy girls, in fact I'm pretty sure he's been in five sexual relationships by the end of book 1. The fanbase encourages it, I've seen more comments about the shipping and encouraging sex scenes than I've ever seen about the munchkinry epic the story advertised itself as.

The munchkinry is another poorly handled area. It started out alright, with the protagonist merely introducing some modern metalworking techniques, and using mathematics and physics to measure spell efficiency, but soon you get the classic isekai trademark of a smartphone with conveniently infinite knowledge, and he introduces modern guns, explosives, even home appliances (he keeps the tech private though, so you don't even get to see the uplifting). In the end, magic munchkinry falls by the wayside.

I could /really/ go on, but this is still a recommendation thread so I guess I'll leave it there. To make this post somewhat productive I will mention the excellent and recommendable Mother of Learning/Worm/Naruto/Homestuck crossover [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.682117/][Conference Call]] just updated.
