[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11221623/chapters/25072989?view_adult=true][The Calculator]] by TimeLoopedPowerGamer

Male SI with DC comics knowledge discovers he's The Calculator. The story doesn't follow any particular arc from comics (that I recognize). Checks off the boxes for taking itself seriously, having a reason to exist instead of trolling canon characters, and the sort of mindset that types the words "interdimensional survival guide."

We can debate over whether it is wish-fulfillment. (Although, per quoted framing, that just makes it one of the best ones.)

Also, it's complete! Loosely-related sequel pending.

Bonus for anyone else reading: you do not need a terribly deep familiarity with the source. The pop-culture osmosis has done the work, unless you have no idea who Batman is or why you might not want his attention.
