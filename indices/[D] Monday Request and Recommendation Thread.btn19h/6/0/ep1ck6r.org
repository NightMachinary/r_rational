SI as the bastard son of Stannis with a member of the Tyrell family. Personally my favourite ASOIAF SI (having tried your suggestions and some others), it focuses on a character who tries to do his best to save the world, deal with the problems that accompanies these attempts, all without setting him as an infallible god. The character makes mistakes and people call him out on them. Regularly updating, and with a pretty large backlog already built up.

I don't know if you've watched MHA (if you haven't you should, I think it's amazing) but this SI does a great job of integrating the main character into the world, creating a realistic progression, whilst still allowing her to have flaws and problems she needs to solve. SI as the younger sister of one of the top ten pro-heroes in the world, and features significant development of, and interaction with, the case of side-characters in the world.

I... don't know what to think of Daedalus. It's competently written, and the power at least is interesting so far (though it is quite early days), but... The author doesn't shy away from showing that the SI (it's kind of not really an SI? Based on the author, but as an in-universe character) is a huge asshole. It's intentionally presented in this way, but half the enjoyment of this fic is cathartically hating someone you don't know.

A big favourite of mine. SI as a character in Gotham with the ability to summon fictional items from books - but it's set years into the future, with the SI as an established member of Batman's rogues gallery. Features attempts from the SI to go legit, creative use of a pretty powerful ability, great character interaction, and unorthodox challenges. Possibly dead, possibly just has really long breaks between updates.
