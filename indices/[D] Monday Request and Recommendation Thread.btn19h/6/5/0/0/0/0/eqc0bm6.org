I actually didn't read the original 1 or 2 drafts, just noticed that what he ended up with was OK.

I think if you don't want to read a story that has a ROB or where he is out to change the world, you are going to be disappointed. There is still a ROB, though basically only hinted at at this point. And he does change his tune a lot and mature and want to work with people rather than it being him against the world. But you will have to read a bit to get to that point.

And the author also makes another two twists in his story telling at this time, changing tone of the story pretty drastically... not sure how permanent that change will be.

In all, it's feels very much the author is writing what he feels like at the time and less of a... cohesive & well-planned story. MC is also rather too OP with not enough foibles.
