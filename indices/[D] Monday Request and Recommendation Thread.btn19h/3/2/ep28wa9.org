Here are some that are perhaps not explicitly progression fantasy, but where the protagonist is still actively learning magic, improving, and growing as a person.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30344847][Masters and Mages]] series - The MC is a second year student at The University at the center of the world, learning magic (and the sword, as a hobby). The last book is coming out later this year, so that's a bonus. The only bad part of these books is the trash-tier world map.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/257869-a-thousand-li][One Thousand Li]] series - This one is explicitly a progression fantasy, written by an author known for litrpg. I thought this guy's other books were barely mediocre, but this book is really good.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister][Book of the Ancestor]] - A girl on a brutal, dying world is being taught martial arts, magic and spycraft. A great, tightly-paced trilogy.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49673-lightbringer][The Lightbringer Series]] - One of the two main storylines is about a teenager who finds out he's a type of mage that can create certain effects from light. Highly recommended.

Edit one more:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] - A man finds himself in a world where humanity is surrounded and constantly beset by dark, powerful creatures. This story is different from the others as the MC is a grown man trying to get powerful enough to get home, and the book is less about personal progression and more of a kingdom builder. The latest book was fantastic.
