Since you asked, I'm gonna unrec Pact by Wildbow. The concept and universe are amazing, and yet it crosses the Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy threshold in the first quarter, and yet manages to sink to new levels of misery till the bitter end. It really puts the glasses to Worm, and that's saying something.

The only good worm fic I can remember which isn't dead is Ring-Maker: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894/reader]]

Putting Sauron in Taylor's body sounds like a silly concept that would never work. It does work.
