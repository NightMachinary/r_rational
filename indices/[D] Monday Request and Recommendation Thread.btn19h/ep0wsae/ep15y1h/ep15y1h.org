You likely know of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], which isn't technically /fan/fiction but instead uses fragments of the SI's world-building from various D&D campaigns. Extremely high quality.

  A petty, self-obsessed teenager who is suspiciously similar to Greg Veder finds out that he is Greg Veder, circa 2010. Armed only with having read 2/3rds of Worm, absolutely no powers, and an extremely kidnappable puppy, Greg “Eric” Veder tries to survive in the face of the greatest foe Worm has to offer: the average teenage girl!
