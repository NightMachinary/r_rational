Hey, looking at that list I'm curious about "his re-write makes for a decent story " in regards to Shinobi act 1.

I read the original version, which I liked until he got to the Chunin exams and really didn't like the turn the plot took there>! with Daisuke going nuts when he got almost perfect and abandoning Konoha, up until that point it was a pretty standard SI solves the main Naruto plot as a loyal Konoha ninja, which is what I wanted to read, not an SI becomes and enemy of Konoha and tries to revolutionize the whole ninja system fic, I just felt bait and switched by that, as that wasn't what I was looking to read and there were very few indications it was going to go in that directon before then.!<The author then rewrote this sequence, possibly a couple times(so the current rewrite is actually the third or forth one I guess), but I didn't immediately read the new version. However a few months later I checked back in with it, and skimmed the last chapter just to see if the story got back on a track I was interested in, and it apparently took another turn, which I really really didn't like, >!where they introduced the ROB as the cause of everything, which imo is one of the dumbest immersion breaking tropes ever, even in premises that are themselves difficult to accept like SIs or gamer powers, something about a ROB just makes the whole fic seem cringy as fuck to me.!< When this happened basically everyone on space battles hated it, and the author said they had it in mind from the beginning and it was the main point of their fic so they weren't going to change it. So anyway I am wondering if the currtent rewrite might avoid those things, or if those things will still bother me if I attempt to read the rewrite.
