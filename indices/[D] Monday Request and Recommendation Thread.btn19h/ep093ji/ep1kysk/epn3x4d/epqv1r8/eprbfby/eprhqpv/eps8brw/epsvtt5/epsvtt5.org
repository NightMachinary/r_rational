I assume you're familiar with [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] already since you're on this subreddit, but if not, that might be a good place to start. It's got a lot of 'applying rational-ish approaches to very odd magical/theological phenomena' stuff. Some more stuff that may or may not scratch the same itch:

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/13/chametz/][Chametz]] is a short story about a Jewish vampire.

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20180101160950/http://squid314.livejournal.com/324957.html][The Last Temptation of Christ]], where the Devil tries a novel approach.

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/03/the-study-of-anglophysics/][The Study of Anglophysics]] is a short-ish story about a world that runs on anagrams. I'm throwing this in because it has a similar feel to the other two.

[[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/the-sword-of-good][The Sword of Good]] is a kind of deconstruction/inversion of classic fantasy settings through the lens of Effective Altruism. It's a lot more fun than it sounds.

[[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EKu66pFKDHFYPaZ6q/the-hero-with-a-thousand-chances][The Hero with a Thousand Chances]] - this is another fantasy-ish setting with a human main character and some rather unusual other characters that he deals with.

All of these, except for Unsong, are short stories. I hope you find at least some of them entertaining.
