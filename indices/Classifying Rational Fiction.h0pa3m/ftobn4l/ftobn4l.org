Hrm.

​

So, I've noticed that most genres will be about certain elements in a story above all others.

Milieu: the genres about setting, like Sci-fi and Fantasy. These are about the world the story takes place in and the rules and conventions of this world, more than the characters and what they do.

Idea: Or thematic genres. This is where the focus of the genre is on the ideas that it tries to convey over anything else. Some sci-fi fits in this (esp. old stories like the Foundation series) but also a lot of stories and books about politics, economics and heavier topics. I think this is where Rationalist fiction would fall, since it's less about the characters and setting and more about exploring the ideas and rational behind the story.

Character: There are some genres that put most of their focus on the characters and their interactions. This is the autobiography, and the genres that have a narrow focus, like thrillers.

Events: Some genres are driven by the progression of events in the story over the characters, or ideas presented. This is mostly for the Action and Adventure genres, where the character could be anyone as long as they go through the right hoops.

​

It's a really rough pattern, and it's also nearly 4am, but... yeah. Genre isn't the most well-defined thing out there, and is usually more for the convenience of the reader (and the marketing team). They're really just a way certain elements within a story are treated.

I think most genres have one major focus, and the other storytelling elements tend to be weaker for it, which is fine. It means that you could take any story and replace the setting with a fantasy or sci-fi world. Or you could turn any novel into a rationalist one by having the characters and narrative spend more time deconstructing the events happening within it.
