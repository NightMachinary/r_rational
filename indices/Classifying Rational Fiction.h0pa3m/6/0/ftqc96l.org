because the problems realistic world poses collapse when challenged rationally. Either collapse into solution, or unsolvability, and thus the tension is gone.

Besides, any rationalist worth the title uses the most optimal science and technology to tackle important problems, and thus the genre becomes at least low science fiction by default, or at least a techno-thriller.
