  Controversially urban fantasy is just an unimaginative, lazy version of fantasy.

I would disagree, there are plenty of good urban fantasy series (Dresden?) that are built on the tension between magic and technology, metaphysics and science, wondrous and mundane. This is an excellent genre for a rationalist protagonist to wreck shit up.
