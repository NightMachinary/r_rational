The story is good and consistent with itself. It has good worldbuilding and the author has above average intelligence. The characters are consistent. But I'm not 100% sure this is a rational romance or story.

It has qualities and traits rational stories have but the author fiat premise and the lack of progress in service of the medium and format make it not quite rational. The author needs the characters to both believe his made up flawed assumption, to take actions based on it and be interrupted and have forced failures constantly for there to be a story at all..

If it was a short story, novel or something similar it'd be easier to accept, but as a gag manga / anime with funny situation of the week format not so much.

I know there's some progress in the manga but I imagine that even after they are dating as two intelligent moderately rational people they'll still be in silly situations like Kaguya wanting to hold hands with BoyIforgotthename, but ending up making an elaborate plan and scenario for it to happen seamlessly instead of just asking or taking the initiative and punishing her boyfriend if he reacted in an undesirable manner, which is fine as a gag but becomes objectively irrational in service of the plot.

You can probably find those scenarios in the story already just from the anime.
