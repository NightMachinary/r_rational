Survivorship bias. There's plenty of one shots too, and in fact there used to be a monthly contest that was ONLY one shots, but as it often happens, one shots get buried and forgotten pretty quickly while a long serialised story that comes out with a chapter every now and then will in time gather a bigger readership. The one thing that perhaps may be missing (but really, they're rarer in general in the landscape of fanfiction/web fiction) is middle-range stories. Stuff in the 20,000-50,000 words range. Usually it's either a short story (< 20,000) or some massive epic.
