I'd say rational fiction is an element you can drop into any genre. As long as your world and characters are as realistic and consistent as possible, it can be an element of any genre of story and doesn't necessarily need to be the main focus of the plot. That being said, i'd say the genre fiction form of rational fiction is *rationalist* fiction, where the focus is much heavier on characters being rational and thinking and reasoning their way forward.
