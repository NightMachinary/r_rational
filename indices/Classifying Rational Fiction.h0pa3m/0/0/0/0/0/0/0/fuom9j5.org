That's the author's choice in depicting the world that way, but you could imagine a world with very complicated/obfuscated/flexible rules such that nobody can use that system at scale (yet). Or, alternatively, the rules are controlled by some superintelligence (like an author) that wants them to be used in a certain way. This isn't logically unsound; there's a rationalist overwatch fanfic with such a premise.

Such authors don't tend to write scenes with characters /trying/ to industrialize magic, either.
