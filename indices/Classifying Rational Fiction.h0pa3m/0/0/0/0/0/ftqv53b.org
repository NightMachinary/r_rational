Except magic isn't irrational. It's just a weird part of the story's natural world, which doesn't happen to exist in our world.

There's nothing logic or science-defying about 'say the words and a thing happens', even if it's somewhat more opaque by what fundamental mechanism they're happening you can still track how they're happening and in what way and use the information you gained to do other things.

Magic and science aren't opposites, magic is just strange rules we haven't figured out yet.
