It could be funny if you clash the logical and sensible protagonist with irrational expectations and reactions of people around them. "Oh my god, look at all the decorations! And a /marching band/!" "He wasted thousands of dollars on a walking fire hazard." "Looks how much he cares about you!" "There are less efficient virtue signals, but not that many."

Also, rational doesn't mean robotic. You can find your perfect mate through a neural network analyzing a dating site's database, then become increasingly romantic and lovey-dovey in person. In fact, being romantic with your chosen mate is a rather logical move- an emotionless, utilitarian relationship is not as strong as one supported by emotion.
