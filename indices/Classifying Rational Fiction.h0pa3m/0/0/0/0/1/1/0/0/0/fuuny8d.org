I mean, a good enough take on a romantic rat-fic would bring the attention of this entire community for sure.

But I see your point- I don't think it would have a chance of making [[/r/all][r/all]], but if it's truly well written and balances rational optimization with some simple fun, it could become a cult classic, a well-known work in certain circles.

Not easy to do, but certainly possible. At least in theory.
