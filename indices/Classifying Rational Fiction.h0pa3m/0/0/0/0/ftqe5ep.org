its not about this sub, its inherent in the definition of rationalism.

If a hero/villain is a rationalist he will apply the most optimal way of thinking to a problem (science) and the most practical solution (technology). This destroys most genres, or turn them into sci-fi, in all but name.

The only way to stop a rationalist protagonist from just wrecking your plot with logic, science and technology, is to make the setting explicitly run on irrational principles...which is the definition of magic, and thus, fantasy.
