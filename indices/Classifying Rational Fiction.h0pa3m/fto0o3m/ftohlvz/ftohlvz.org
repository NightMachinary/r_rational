That's not really true. We've had plenty of not excessively long rational fiction. Especially if you count fanfic, but even if you don't.

This one I've only seen a handful of times personally. I'm pretty sure I've read more monogamous romantic rational fiction on this subreddit than anything that comes to the level of a harem forming around one protagonist.

All that said, one can write both rational and rationalist fiction while leaving away the majority of the tropes you enumerated. It just so happens that this community (including our talented amateur writers) were often fans of a certain number of genres before they even discovered this whole "rational fiction" thing. But you can do a lot with just points 5, 6, 9, and the first half of 4.
