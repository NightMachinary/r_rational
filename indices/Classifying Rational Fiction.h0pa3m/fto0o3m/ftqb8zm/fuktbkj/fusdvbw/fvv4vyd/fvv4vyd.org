Acting rationally doesn't mean having all the answers ready. The future remains impossible to predict with certainty, and sometimes you just lack key information. Not to mention, being a romance, this introduces an element of tension between reason and emotion. It's not like being rational means you don't have those at all (otherwise romance becomes indeed an impossibility).
