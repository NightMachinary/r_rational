You can certainly have rational characters in a slice of life romance. Focusing on making the plot specifically rational is a little more complicated.

Slice of life tends to be character driven. The plot at times is less important than the relationships. As the author, you have to know the characters, how they interact with others, their quirks, their greatest dreams and fears. You have to make them likeable or interesting, and you have to make the /relationship/ between them compelling. This is different from rational fic, which tends to focus on making the plot interesting and compelling.

So, in order to make a rational slice of life romance, you have two options. Either the writer has to be amazeballs awesome and is able to somehow write compelling, complex characters undergoing growth and change AND a complex, riveting plot with no inconsistencies. Or you have to relax your standards on the plot complexity to focus more on the characters. But, while writing version 2 would make a great story, it probably won't appeal to this sub because they're not as interested in relationships. :/

Btw, I feel like Avatar the Last Airbender is a really good example of a rational, character driven story. It somehow manages to be extremely complex in its worldbuilding and plot, but also completely focused on creating compelling characters and exploring their relationships and growth. I mean, even the bad guys got character development!! And it did all that while still driving the plot forward and creating a great adventure.
