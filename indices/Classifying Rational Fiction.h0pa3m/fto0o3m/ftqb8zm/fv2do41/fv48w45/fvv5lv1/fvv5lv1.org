  Stories about social movements staring a rationalist hero would be doomed: either the social leader would appear to be an obnoxious, self-righteous Mary Sue, or the author would have to cast a strong shade on the legitimacy of that social movement. Because, if the Social Movement was both in the right AND rationalists, then how the hell did they not win completely and forever IRL?

Any of thousands of reasons? If you don't have enough power, you just don't. You can make your communication as good as humanly possible, but it won't be necessarily good enough. Do you think if you dropped someone sufficiently rational in the 1820 USA they could simply peacefully end slavery without any bloodshed, purely by political means, and leave no traces of racism either?
