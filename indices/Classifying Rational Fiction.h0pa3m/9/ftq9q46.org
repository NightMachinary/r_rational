rationalist fiction is almost always within the fantasy and sci-fi genres. Why?

Because fantasy and science fiction are the only literary genres that can handle "rationalization" of its tropes and conventions. Every other genre would either collapse on itself, or become incomprehensible mess:

- Romance/drama: depends on deep irrationality to even work, and the whole tension in the plot only works when people make dramatically stupid decisions. Rationalists are simply happy in love or happy single, and the tension does not exist.

- Horror: rationalist horror would have a significantly more capable protagonist, and thus would be just very dark rationalist fantasy

- Western/historical/biography etc - glaringly incompatible with Real Life histories, since 99.99999% of these people were not rationalists.

- Thriller: if the protagonist/antagonist are even remotely competent rationalists, it becomes rationalists science fiction (because there is a technological/scientific solution to every danger and problem)

- Mystery/Detective: rationalist detective story would be all but incomprehensible to a normal person, heck, even to a rationalist. Mystery and detective stories depend on deep deduction, and so do rationalist stories. This would be a level of exponential complexity more fitting for a 3rd year logic exam, not prose.

- Dystopia: basically rationalist sci-fi, with a political bent. Ask Ayn Rand how well that works.

- Adventure: rationalist action/adventure story with a half-capable protagonist/antagonists becomes hard sci-fi.
