  Mystery/Detective: rationalist detective story would be all but incomprehensible to a normal person, heck, even to a rationalist. Mystery and detective stories depend on deep deduction, and so do rationalist stories. This would be a level of exponential complexity more fitting for a 3rd year logic exam, not prose.

Why? By that logic, rationalist sci-fi becomes incomprehensible unless you have a physics PhD. This all depends on how the story is presented. In many ways, 'rationalist detective story' is arguably what Sherlock Holmes tries to be. Arguably a bit unrealistic and mixes up deduction with induction, but still, it doesn't seem a completely unfixable concept.
