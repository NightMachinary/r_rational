  "Rational" just tells me that the story aims to be well plotted out, have robust world building (if needed), rewards readers who pay attention to details, and has characters with clear motivations that keep on acting according to their motives and characterization.

Hence why these stories tend to be sci-fi, or close to it, since other genres would just unravel with this kind of treatment.
