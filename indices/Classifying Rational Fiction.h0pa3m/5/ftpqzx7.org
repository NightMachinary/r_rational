A parallel question: Aesop's Fables, Wind in the Willows, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and My Little Pony are all 'furry' stories. Is 'furry' a genre? It depends on why you're bothering to split stories into various genres. For example, booksellers or streaming movie providers want to advertise similar stories to entice their customers to buy more, which may or may not match the categories of somebody adding tag-clouds to their downloaded ebooks.
