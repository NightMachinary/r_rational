Are you talking about most people here on the subreddit? Because even if one vehemently disagrees with the idea that "rational" is a genre, I wouldn't be surprised if every single story ever getting a full post here and the majority of otherwise recommended stories in this sub fell firmly into one of the typical genre categories. Mostly sci-fi or fantasy of various stripes. And I don't think people are unaware of that.
