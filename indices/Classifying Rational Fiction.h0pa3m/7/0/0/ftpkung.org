Yep, most of the traditionally published fiction people read is genre fiction. Serialized fiction has lots of trope carryover from genre fiction, even if it doesn't follow all the rules (plot structure, pacing, word count).

However, I'm not sure how aware people in the sub are of the definition of genre fiction and what that means for writing. A lot of my background knowledge comes from an interest in publishing, and I'm familiar with the expectations. It surprises me people can't see that rational fiction could be it's own genre.
