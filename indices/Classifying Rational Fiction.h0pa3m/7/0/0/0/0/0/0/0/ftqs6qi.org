Well plotted out might have been the wrong words to use. A lot of rational stories have meandering plots and yet still remain rational. What I meant more was stuff like past events affecting future events, foreshadowing being a thing and stories making even more sense in hindsight or upon rereading, and of course a lack of plot holes.

Just to understand you correctly, according to you the vast majority of stories in this subreddit are not rational? Including the fan favorites?
