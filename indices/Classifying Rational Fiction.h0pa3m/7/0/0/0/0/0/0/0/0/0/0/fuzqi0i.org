Fantasy (and pulpiest sci-fi as well I guess) requires the writer to invent an entire reality, with its own logic, physics, history, etc, just to make things coherent. The more fantastical the setting, the less the author can use RL physics and ideas to prop it. Moreover, the author has to SHOW that his reality is coherent, because it is not self evident.

Worse still, the author needs for their fantasy reality it be as close to perfectly internally coherent as possible, while the reader only really needs to find one mistake or two to be discouraged from further reading.

Hence why the common wisdom about writing fiction is "Your job is harder than God's"

As most writers are not geniuses themselves, nor are they truly rationalists, writing coherent fantasy world for a rational hero to dismantle is near-impossible. Worse still if it is a fantasy fanfic, because the pre-existing fantasy was not written with rational analysis in mind, it was just supposed to be enjoyed on a casual level.

Take HPMOR for example, which I think is one of the best, if not the best rat-fic in existence. Even in it, the author had to make Harry lean on the 4th wall and basically admit that "this magical world simply makes no sense, so lets skip to another topic, shall we?" It only worked because HPMOR is partial satire of the genre.

Take another cult classic, Mother of Learning. It is probably the best rat-fic in here, but even in it the author has to frantically update and expand the lore backwards, inwards and outwards with each chapter to account for reader's rational analysis. (and lets be frank and a bit spoilerish, MoL is basically sci-fi with a fantasy wrapping)

Compared to that, writing realistic rational science fiction, especially hard science fiction is easier, because the author can always fall back on RL physics, evidently existing technologies, math, cosmology, biology etc to support his world-building, and thus cannot be caught with his pants down so easily.

The bane of the rat-fic author is the reader thinking "hey, why didn't the protagonist do the obvious thing (munchkin solution goes here)". With hard sci-fi, the author can preemptively stop that line of thinking, because if there was an "obvious solution" to some problem in a hard sci-fi story, it would also be already used in Real Life, and we would be LIVING in a sci-fi reality.
