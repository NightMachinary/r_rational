Change rationality with a genre like sci-fi. Does it still fit with your questions? I think so. You can add mystery to any story and that will most likely make it a mystery story, unless it is for a single chapter or so.

But what I do think is that most people don't want to admit that they're favourite stories are genre fiction because it has certain low brow-connotations.
