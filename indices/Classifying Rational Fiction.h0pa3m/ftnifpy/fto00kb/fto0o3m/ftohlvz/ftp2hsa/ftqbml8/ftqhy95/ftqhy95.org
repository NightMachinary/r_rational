I meant urban fiction as more of earth where there are werewolves, vampires and other simple worldbuilding scenarios where everything is the same as our own world but with X fantasy elements shoved in.

Dresden and modern technology fantasy setting set in a different world weren't what I was thinking of when I criticized the genre. To me those are entirely different genres from urban fantasy in general, granted it might just be too many bad apples spoiling the bunch or publishers grouping similar things together based on flawed assumptions. But then we'd be discussing semantics and that's not very interesting..
