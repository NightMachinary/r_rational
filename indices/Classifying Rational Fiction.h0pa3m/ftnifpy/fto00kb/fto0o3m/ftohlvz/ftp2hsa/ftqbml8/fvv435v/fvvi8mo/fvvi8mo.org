Depends on your perspective. To me this self deceit, pretend not to like each other and all is inherently irrational. Rational actors would just date if they liked each other which breaks most of the romance aspect, one or two dates, rational considerations of pros and cons. Done, the decision is made and they are dating.

​

As long as the relationship continues to be beneficial, and better than what they could reasonably get with somebody else it continues, with them both optimizing and actively communicating and making changes as needed for optimal returns.

I like the excuse the author uses in kaguya to make his story with intelligent characters doing elaborate things for no reason other a flawed assumption fine, but in most adult literature that kind of naive flirting that doesn't go anywhere for months doesn't really work. It might work as a short story but anything lengthy would fall apart quickly.
