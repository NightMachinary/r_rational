  To me this self deceit, pretend not to like each other and all is inherently irrational.

I think the point is that the /story/ has to be rational - not necessarily the characters. The characters are consistent and believable, even though their judgement is clouded by emotion. Fundamentally:

- they both like each other
- they are both unsure whether the other likes them
- they both want the other to be the one who admits to liking them first because they feel like that will give them an edge in the power dynamics of the successive relationship.

Of course, making fun of how actually silly this whole conceit is, and how the rational thing to do would be just to communicate earnestly and settle matters in a mature way, is the whole point of the story. That's why I'd call it rational. The characters all have believable internal lives - their actions don't span from the need to fit a trope, but emerge naturally from who they are. Many of them are also significantly intelligent and demonstrate that routinely (not only Shirogane and Kaguya, but Fujiwara, Ishigami, Hayasaka, Osaragi, Miko... this /is/ a prestigious school after all). And the story as a whole is about a very rational approach to love and romance - illustrated, however, through both straightforward examples as well as catastrophic failures. None of the characters are entirely rational; the story, as a whole, is.
