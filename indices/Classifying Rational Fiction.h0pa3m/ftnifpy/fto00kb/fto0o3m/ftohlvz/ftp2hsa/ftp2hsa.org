  Regardless, it's rare to see a rational fic on reddit that follows non action/adventure tropes. You'll find scifi and fantasy, but not historical fiction, romance, horror, urban fantasy, suspense, slice of life or young adult. Rational fic in these categories is great, but it doesn't fit the sub's preferred genre, so it's less popular and not recommended as often.

  I'd love to see anyone provide a counterpoint to this argument, as you might not see the same trends I do.

While true I don't think it's exactly fair for most of the examples. If you make a rational character in a somewhat IRL setting many people will call it a mary sue, self inflating, masturbatory..

​

Horror and suspense can't be easily ported over without a lot of changes and work to make it compatible. Rational actors don't put themselves in those situations and if they do they will likely just fix it somehow or die while doing the smart thing which is very unrewarding for the audience.

​

Controversially urban fantasy is just an unimaginative, lazy version of fantasy. Which is often used in YA and other shorter stories for easier worldbuilding so the author can keep word count low and focus on other things like romance triangles.
