  Rationalist young adult story would be just surreal, since rational children are unrealistic and contradictory.

The Promised Neverland wants a word.

I don't fully agree with this because you can always make up a reason for why that work - or you could have an adult mentor character be the 'rationalist' mouthpiece, and the rest of the story merely rational, even if you felt like a hyperintelligent kid would be too creepy, unrealistic or non relatable as a main character (and then again, that's just what HPMOR is like).

Anyway YA isn't a genre either. YA is more of a matter of tone, target audience and age appropriateness. Harry Potter or Percy Jackson are YA /and/ fantasy; The Hunger Games is YA /and/ sci-fi; and so on.
