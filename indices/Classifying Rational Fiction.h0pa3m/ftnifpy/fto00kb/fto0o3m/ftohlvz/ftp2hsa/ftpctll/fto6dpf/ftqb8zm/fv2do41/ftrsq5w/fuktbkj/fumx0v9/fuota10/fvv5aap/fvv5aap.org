  in order to make a rational slice of life romance, you have two options. Either the writer has to be amazeballs awesome and is able to somehow write compelling, complex characters undergoing growth and change AND a complex, riveting plot with no inconsistencies. Or you have to relax your standards on the plot complexity to focus more on the characters. But, while writing version 2 would make a great story, it probably won't appeal to this sub because they're not as interested in relationships

I mentioned it above, but I really think the manga "Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed to" fits the bill here. Not much of a plot that's not romance-driven, but there's an incredible amount of depth that goes into characterization, character development, and how that feeds into the central romance. And all of that while also being incredibly gripping anyway, not because of the riveting plot, but because of the hilarious comedy.
