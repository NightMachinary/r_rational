I don't think it necessarily reverts to Sci-Fi, it can always rely on how characters react within the world. A Practical Guide to Evil is a series like this. It's rational because of how the MC approaches the world she lives in.

Rational Horror could be done well, or at least suspense. Simply have the main characters make all the right moves, make all the right decisions. Make all the best plays with a bit of luck thrown their way. But have the monster still just slowly keep winning little victory after victory.

The rational character can be a person who simple acts in a reasonable and well thought out manner, it doesn't need to be a super genius or a tech wiz. The genre works so well for Fantasy and Sci-Fi is because both have been laden with tropes and over the top stories to the point that having people act like they aren't braindead in a story is awesome.

The only reason why you see less books or stories in other genres is because it's still kinda a niche genre, with a lot of it's interest originally sparking in the Fantasy/Sci-Fi crowds. Romance, Drama, Horror, Suspense, Thriller, heck even Slice-of-Life. Could be done on a Rational or rational Adjacent bent. We just don't have stories like that because the trend of rational Sci-Fi/Fantasy hasn't explicitly spread to as many fans as it needs to in order to attract those writers.
