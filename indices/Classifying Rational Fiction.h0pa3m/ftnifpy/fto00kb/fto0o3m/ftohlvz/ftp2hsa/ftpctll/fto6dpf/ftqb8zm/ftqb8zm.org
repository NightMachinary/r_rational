rationalist fiction is almost always sci fi, fantasy, or sci fi flavoured adventure, because every other genre would collapse if too much rationalist revision was taken to it. Slice of life, romance, drama - the plot literally demands irrationality to create tension. Horror, suspense, thriller, require at least some irrationality to create a feeling of danger.

Rationalist young adult story would be just surreal, since rational children are unrealistic and contradictory.

Besides, if the protagonist/antagonist is truly a rationalist, then the genre always shifts to sci-fi, simply because they optimize using technology and science. The only way to stop that is to make their world run on magic instead of science: but the result is rationalist fantasy.
