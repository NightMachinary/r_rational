I feel like this example kinda disproves your claim. You're Next is an anti-horror, the smart protagonist causes the tropes to be reversed, and the whole story becomes a a subversion. The plot is not fear and anxiety inducing, its a borderline "revenge porn". Kinda like ALIENS was a reaction to ALIEN.

In other words, if you put a truly rational protagonist in a story and he fails regardless, it feels like a cheap diabolus ex machina. If the rationalist "wins" it is by defying or subverting tropes that define the genre.

Innocent person goes to prison (and similar plot - the deserted island castaway) are one of the few kinds of stories where the protagonist can be a rationalist and the story does not implode, but this is because the setting is very limited and constructed like a puzzle to be solved (how do I get past the guards/ how do I escape the island). Still, it is very easy to make the character a Mary Sue in such a setting, if not done carefully, and if the author does not do a copious amount of research first.

Stories about social movements staring a rationalist hero would be doomed: either the social leader would appear to be an obnoxious, self-righteous Mary Sue, or the author would have to cast a strong shade on the legitimacy of that social movement. Because, if the Social Movement was both in the right AND rationalists, then how the hell did they not win completely and forever IRL?

Take an example: If you made a story about rationalist MLK, then either you would need an equally convincing rationalist KKK leader to balance him out (a risky moral choice to say the least..), or the reader would wonder; why is there still racism in the USA?

In general, I would not recommend making historical characters into rationalists, let alone writing rational political and social leaders, because this is bound to insult someone.
