Here's another method to classify rational fiction. Instead of looking at genre fiction as a collection of tropes, look at it as a set of expectations. If they're met, you're writing in that genre.

Expectations of a romance (female/male):

- Meet main character in the first chapter. She is usually young, twenties-thirties and single. She has a personal problem that she can't resolve (insecurity, loneliness, family trouble, illness, etc.)
- Meet main male character. He also has a problem that can't be resolved (cold, arrogant, depressed, etc.) He's usually traditionally masculine and attractive, but not always.
- Story might include a love triangle with a third character, and it's the writers job to make it clear that this character is not as good for the MC as her eventual love interest.
- While there can be other plot elements involved, the love interest is most important, so they must interact frequently. This is how you end up with contrived scenarios like "stuck in an elevator" or "there's only one bed." When characters are distant from each other, they must still interact in some way (phone call, female lead meeting her romantic interest's relative and learning a secret, etc.).
- Throughout the story, we see how two main leads help each other grow to overcome their personal problems.
- In the end, there is a happily every after.

Not all stories follow this exact format, and you can bend the rules, but you risk annoying the reader if you break too many of them. This is because readers want the experience of falling in love, and if the story doesn't do that, they'll feel cheated.

Now, I'll compare this with the expectations of rational fiction.

Expectations of a rational fiction (on this subreddit):

- Main character is usually male, in their twenties. He has a problem with the world as it is and wants to solve it.
- The lead is competent. Whenever problems arise, it is the main lead's job to overcome them using his intellect. While he might not start out as competent, he will progressively get stronger throughout the story.
- The main lead is intelligent in an analytical way. This usually translates to a high IQ. While other forms of intelligence may be present (musical, survival, EQ, etc.) the main character relies on his IQ or game knowledge to solve problems.
- The magic or science of this world must be knowable (as opposed to mystical). The main character must use this knowledge in clever ways that the reader can see and understand.
- At the end of the story, the main character must be instrumental in solving the final crisis. It cannot be a side character or an outside influence saving the day.

While a writer can bend some of these expectations and modify them, they must be careful. People have expectations when reading rational fiction, and if they're not met, the story will either be less popular or disliked. This is because readers want the experience of feeling competent, and if the story doesn't do that, they'll feel cheated.

I can't think of many stories promoted on this sub that don't meet the expectations I described here. This is in spite of the fact that a lot of popular sci-fi and fantasy does /not/ have these expectations. Therefore, we can conclude that rational fiction follows its own genre conventions.
