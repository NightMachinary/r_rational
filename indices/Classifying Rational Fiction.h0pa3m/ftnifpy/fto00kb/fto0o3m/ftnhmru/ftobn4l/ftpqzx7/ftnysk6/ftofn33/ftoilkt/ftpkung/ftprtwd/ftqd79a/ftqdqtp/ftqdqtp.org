That's not true at all. Here in the subreddit itself there's more fantasy stories than sci-fi ones. Historical fiction has the world building already done beforehand (if researched correctly) and while rarely rational/ist/ is rational whenever written well. And I don't see what stands in the way of a rational western, or romance or whatever.
