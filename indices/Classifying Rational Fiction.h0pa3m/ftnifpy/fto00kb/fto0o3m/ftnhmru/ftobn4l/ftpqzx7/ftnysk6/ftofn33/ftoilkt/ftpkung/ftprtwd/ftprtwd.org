The thing is that many of the things that you speculated might "define" rational fiction are actually just tropes carried over from the fact that most rational fiction shared on [[/r/rational]] is also either fantasy or sci-fi. And mostly fantasy I think. Things like action-adventure, predominantly male protagonists in power struggles, anger and/or inadequacy being initially acceptable weaknesses to be overcome as the story progresses are all widespread among fantasy genre fiction and thus also very frequent in fantasy genre fiction that can be labeled as rational. However one can easily write fiction (if writing a good story can ever be called "easy") that will be acclaimed as rational by this subreddit while avoiding all of those characteristics.

Serialized fiction as well has nothing to do with wether a story is rational or not. It is just the currently fashionable way of writing /any/ fiction for free online. Most long form fanfics, regardless of genre or plot coherence, are being published chapter by chapter. And since [[/r/rational]] is a relatively niche online community, the (free) writing of its members often looks like that. But especially among published science fiction there is quite a bit of material that most on here would consider rational, despite not having several of the traits you enumerated. It's just not /called/ rational fiction by the wider community of readers because the term itself isn't widespread. The same goes probably for any truly well plotted crime mystery that rewards intelligent reading and doesn't suffer from plot holes or idiot balls.

Maybe it's just a semantic issue I have. When I think of a genre I think of the primary label a fiction has, that can be used to give an idea of the setting the story is set in without necessarily requiring additional labels. "Rational" just tells me that the story aims to be well plotted out, have robust world building (if needed), rewards readers who pay attention to details, and has characters with clear motivations that keep on acting according to their motives and characterization. That's in no way enough to tell me what I'm actually reading. It could be anything from realistic historical fiction to urban fantasy police procedural.
