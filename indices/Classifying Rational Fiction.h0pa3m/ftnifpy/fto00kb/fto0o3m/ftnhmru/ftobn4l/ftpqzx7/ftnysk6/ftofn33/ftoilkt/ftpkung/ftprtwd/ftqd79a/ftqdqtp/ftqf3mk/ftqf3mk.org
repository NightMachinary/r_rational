if you take a story that is not sci-fi, and apply to it:

- being well plotted out (collapses most biographical or historical fiction, because reality is not plotted)

- rewards readers who pay attention to details (makes writing good fantasy all but impossible unless you are yourself a genius like Tolkien)

- clear motivations that keep on acting according to their motives and characterization. (Absolutely ruins drama, romance, or YA, as it goes directly against the beloved tropes people read those for).
