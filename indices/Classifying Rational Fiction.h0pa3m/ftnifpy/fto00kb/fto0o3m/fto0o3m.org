I agree that rational fiction can work well with other genres, and I'd love to read a variety of stories with rational characters. However, let me play devil's advocate. I would say /in this sub/ we seem to have enough common themes and tropes to form a basic genre pattern:

--Serialized fiction (long word count)

--action/adventure

--set in the future or a fantasy world

--main character has a high IQ, usually male or masculine traits, teen or young adult

--uses their intellect to solve problems and drive the plot forward

--plot is constructed to reward the reader's thinking (clues, foreshadowing)

--MC struggles with anger or feelings of inadequacy

--munchkinry and quests for dominance/power are common

--hero must succeed on their own power or intellect

--when romance, harems

--kids show fanfic but smart

--common elements: tech, AI, superpowers, video games, transhumanism

It might be fair to say that rational fiction is a subgenre of the action/adventure story, while still being something distinctly different. The pace of action in the story and its tension is less important than the internal consistency of character actions. If the city is about to be destroyed, it's not just because the Big Bad is being evil, it's because he wants something and destroying the city is the best way to get it. Instead of racing against the clock to stop his plans with an epic car chase that leads to things blowing up, we get a clever use of manipulation to trick the enemy (which might lead to something blowing up).

Regardless, it's rare to see a rational fic on reddit that follows non action/adventure tropes. You'll find scifi and fantasy, but not historical fiction, romance, horror, urban fantasy, suspense, slice of life or young adult. Rational fic in these categories is great, but it doesn't fit the sub's preferred genre, so it's less popular and not recommended as often.

I'd love to see anyone provide a counterpoint to this argument, as you might not see the same trends I do. Still, though, it's hard to ignore the patterns in reddit's preferences for rational fiction.
