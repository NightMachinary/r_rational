I don't think it's necessary to be munchkining everything, except for the actual, stated goal the protagonist sets for themselves (defeat baddie, save world, cure cancer, etc.).

Though in a rational romantic comedy, getting the girl /is/ the stated goal, so munchkinry is a given.

My comment was countering the assertion that:

  its not about this sub, its inherent in the definition of rationalism.

As long as the protagonist pursues their goal(s) in a.... open-source kind of smart (where you see their thinking code), then you have a (potentially) rational work.

Hell, it could work in a stone-age era drama. Just an above-average caveman using his limited knowledge and cunning to survive difficult times he found himself in. Or a cooking competition, where a scientific approach (actually finding out if something tastes good, without relying on public opinion) allows the main character to find whole new dimensions of taste /(fish with strawberry yogurt?!)/, ignored by calcified 'masters'.

Rationality isn't about the setting. Nor is it a tightly constrained characterization of your protagonist. You could write an old matron who never got a formal education- as long as you /show/ her using her brain right, she can be rational too.
