You could have a rationalist story set in a romantic comedy, where the protagonist uses his knowledge of psychology, statistics, math, biology and pure logic to tear down the tropes surrounding the genre, and find his perfect (within bounds of possibility) girl.

No magic nor super tech needed here. Just someone smart rising above the bar of established genre.
