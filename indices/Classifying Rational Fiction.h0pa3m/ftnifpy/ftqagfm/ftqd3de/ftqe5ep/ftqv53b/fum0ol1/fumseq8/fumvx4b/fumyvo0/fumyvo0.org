This is kind of why I could see rational fiction as its own genre. The sci-fi and fantasy genres don't require the protagonist to have a goal and use his logic to complete it. I've found that frequently the expectation in rational fiction on this sub is that the characters win. This is strange to me because I don't think rationality and competency are explicitly linked.

In order to write a story in genres outside of the broad spheres of scifi/fantasy, I think we'd need to consider how the use of rationality would actually affect their lives, and what other factors of their personality and background might need to be considered.
