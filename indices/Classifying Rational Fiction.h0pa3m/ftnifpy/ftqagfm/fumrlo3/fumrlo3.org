So, I suppose this could be true depending on our definition of rational fiction. Is a story "rational fic" if the characters are reasonably intelligent, don't make decisions out of character just to drive the plot, and overall the story feels internally consistent? If so, those are the markings of good writing, and should be in most stories.

If the definition from TV tropes is more accurate, than rational fiction is more like a genre, due to expectations that not all stories can or should meet.

  A Rational Fic is one which makes a deliberate effort to reward a reader's thinking. It's the opposite of Bellisario's Maxim. The World Building is intended to stand up to careful thought; the plot is driven by characters or circumstances that themselves are part of the story, the heroes generally think clearly (in ways the reader can follow), and a clever reader can deduce what's hidden or what's coming. Very often, the fic is also intended to teach the reader something about rationality.
