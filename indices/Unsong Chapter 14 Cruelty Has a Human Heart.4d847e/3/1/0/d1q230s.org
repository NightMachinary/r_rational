  The repetition of the same word for the same syllable means you could get the semblance of the Name.

The same syllable doesn't show up in the same name very often (I used bad examples above). I don't think that it would meaningfully shrink the search space.

The (prospective) Names in Ch. 1 would look like this (Duplicates bolded, and I did something wrong, as I have too few letters in many of them):

- ABCDEFG (x3)
- ABCDE*E*FGHIJKLMN (x7)
- ABC*C*DEFG
- ABCDEFG*G*HIJ...ZZZZZZ

Other Names:

- ABCDEFGHIJL (SCABMOM)
- ABCDEF (Moon Name)
- ABCDEFG (20/20 Vision Name)
- ABC (Tetragrammaton)
- ABCDEFGHIJLKLMN (Vanishing Name)
