That's kinda like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad][one-time pad]]. In theory unbreakable, but not actually much of an encryption because you would need a new key for each message, and if you're gonna distribute a specialized key you might as well distribute the message itself.

One of the requirements listed is "that the signal be separated from the noise; that the parts which represent letters are fixed in advance and not separated by other parts representing other letters."

So maybe there isn't much signal in that klipah? Your system is much closer to a random scrambling than an encryption.
