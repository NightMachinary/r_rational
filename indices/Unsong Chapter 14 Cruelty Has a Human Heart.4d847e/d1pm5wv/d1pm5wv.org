Idea for a nigh-unbreakable klipah: first, get a large set of words that start with each letter of the alphabet (or just random words, really). Next, use the "A" word to represent the first syllable of the Name, the "B" for the second, and so on. A sample Name would look something like this:

#+begin_example
  APPLE BANANA CANTALOUPE DRAGONFRUIT ELDERBERRY APPLE ELDERBERRY CANTALOUPE 
#+end_example

Use a /different/ set of words for each Name, so another one could look like:

#+begin_example
  ATOM BARYON COULOMB DECAY ELECTRON FIELD BARYON GRAVITY HADRON
#+end_example

If you want to be trickier, then throw non-klipah words in the middle of the pgrase as well, but make sure that /all/ of the licenced users use the /same/ filler words.

Anyone who knows cryptography want to poke holes in this?
