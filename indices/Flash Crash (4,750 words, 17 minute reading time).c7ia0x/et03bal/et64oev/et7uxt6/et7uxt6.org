  the knowledge that money is the thing to be maximized as potentially suspect
#+end_quote

The knowledge that money is the thing /she/ is trying to maximize is not suspect, it's practically true by definition. Call it monomaniacal, but that's how she starts. Maximize money. In such a state, no activity will be started by her unless she believes that it will lead to more money in her account in the long run. Changing her utility function will not lead to more money in the long run. So she's not going to do it, unless her utility function has already been changed to value something other than money.

At t=0, she values only money. If she values only money at t=n, then she will value only money at t=n+1. Therefore she will never change her utility function.

This is true even if objective morality exists. She's got no reason to care, unless you can figure out how to give her the magical "do what's objectively right" instruction, and there's no reason for whatever investment firm programmed her to do this, since they didn't intend for her to go FOOM or do anything else other than make money.
