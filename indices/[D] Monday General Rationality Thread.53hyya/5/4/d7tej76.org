I think our knowledge of ancient human evolution and migration patterns is still a bit too sketchy for his conclusion to be very strong, but its certainly interesting. The idea that H. Sapiens wasn't as smart as we are now to begin with, and it was our inbreeding with H. Neanderthalensis and H. Denisova that pushed us over the edge is definitely interesting if nothing else.

The problem with his theory I think is that people didn't just migrate to one place and stay there, there was a massive amount of local and long distance trade, even in the ancient world. People travelled, went one place and then had their children return to where their parents were from, had kids and ditched them, there's a lot of genetic crosstalk. Aside from some indigenious tribal groups that managed to very thoroughly isolate themselves on remote islands or deep in jungles, human genetics never really became that isolated from each other. The author makes the argument that these different groups had 5,000 generations in isolation, but they didn't, none of them were really that isolated from each other. Even if the underlying theory he's trying to identify is 100% valid, its a lot deeper and more complex than he's trying to make it out as.

People aren't Galapagos finches, we didn't have nearly that perfectly isolated of an environment from others to allow our genes to diverge that much.
