Man, that guy has an agenda and isn't afraid to push it.

Even ignoring all the other arguments against him, the argument is easily falsifiable because of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect][Flynn Effect]] alone. There was a 13.3 point increase in IQ between 1950-1998 for male conscripts in denmark, followed by a 1.3 point decrease between 1998-2004. That's for a very homogenous populations.

That doesn't call into question the actual figures (that whites/asians are slightly above average, hispanics/blacks are below average) but looking at the timespan involved, it's highly unlikely genetic changes alone could have caused that variance in score. Instead, it's likely attributable to some combination of better nutrition, better childhood healthcare, advancements in education, or even just more familiarity with standardized testing.

And it's well known that black and hispanic students in the US are more likely to live in poverty, and thus recieve worse healthcare, worse education, and worse attitudes about schooling.

I wouldn't be surprised if there /were/ IQ differences between races, but the US isn't where they'd show up-- The majority of African Americans should really more accurately be called "mixed race," and the same is true for hispanics.

tl;dr the moderator is a bigot trying to push an easily falsifiable position.

edit: I actually can think of a single case where race might determine IQ (Ashkenazi jews) but that's about it.
