Blacks are a minority group, who tend to have similar economic statuses. I'd predict that whites vary more as the majority group. So in any given situation, the whites and blacks would be largely similar, with some bias in favor of whites. Situations where you'd expect to encounter less intelligent people will be less white-biased, but I don't think the difference is enough that mixed race group of peers will have very different IQs. For example, I'd expect to see black doctors and white doctors have similar intelligences, as well as black garbagemen versus white garbagemen.
