I think there are a lot of variables involved, making work about this sort of thing fairly difficult. For example, let's say that the people in sub-saharan Africa and who were brought to the US as slaves were genetically identical to Anglos, but just looked different, or spoke a different language, or something. I'd STILL expect these groups to have below-average IQ. Why? Well, because of non-genetic reasons. Here are a few.

1. *Parasite Load.* This one is pretty well known and needs no explanation.
2. *Poverty in the US specifically affecting them.* If they're the descendants of slaves, they'll have less money due to the way inheritance and wealth mobility works, and money is correlated with IQ. Rich parents spend more on their children to get them good educations, sufficient nutrition, things that promote mental growth etc.
3. *National Poverty in sub-saharan Africa.* It's generally tougher to do well in life and focus on your intelligence when your country is poor. Sub-saharan Africa has many poor countries, so we'd expect lower average IQs even if pops were genetically identical.
4. *Systems and standardized tests that were explicitly developed to be discriminatory.* Less true now than it used to be, but standardized tests (both IQ in particular and college admissions in particular) at one point used to explicitly attempt to help out the dominate race in the US.

I'm sure there are more, but you get the idea. The real issue here is the lack of a control group, as we have in a lot of social science stuff. Perhaps it really is true that people of mixed anglo/african descent (african americans) and also, people of just african descent (people in sub-saharan africa) are less genetically predisposed to intelligence than anglos are. However, if that was true, we'd still never know it, because of all the other stuff that is piled on them anyways. No controls! You need controls!

If something covered in napalm is burning, it's entirely possible the base object is flammable, but how would we know?

Heck, even famous american eugenicist Lewis Terman agrees somewhat:

  "Perhaps a median IQ of 80 for Italian, Portuguese, and Mexican school children in the cities of California would be a liberal estimate. How much of this inferiority is due to the language handicap and to other environmental factors it is impossible to say, but the relatively good showing made by certain other immigrant groups similarly handicapped would suggest that the true causes lie deeper than environment." (Mental and Physical Traits of a Thousand Gifted Children, Volume 1, 1925, p. 57)

His stuff is an interesting read. Though this was written back when Italians and Portuguese weren't considered properly "white" so it doesn't fit fully with modern conceptions of whiteness, but I don't want to get into "is whiteness a social construct" here since it's a side argument.
