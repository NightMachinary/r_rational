I, personally, don't desire any rules concerning roleplay. Rules are necessary to arbitrate the outcome of combat, but I think that's because combat isn't as intuitive as social interaction is. You can't empathize with a sword swing. Because we're capable of understanding social interaction without the need for numerical abstraction it seems ungainly to try to make rules for it.

That said, the rules that do try to approach social interaction are atrocious. Bluff, sense motive, and diplomacy are minimized at my table because they're incredible oversimplifications. I suppose I would be open to improvements there.

Upon revision, I think I should clarify that I think rules governing personality are unnecessary (maybe even detrimental) but rules for communication and "social perception" such as lie detection have some potential and should be improved.
