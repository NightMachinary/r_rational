I wouldn't call Pathfinder a "bad RPG", but it's poorly adapted to roleplay encounters (I don't know it very well though, so I may be wrong). You have, like, 12000 different skills and rules about hitting things, and not much rules dictating the personality and social skills of your character.

I liked /Pendragon/'s system in that regard.
