It depends on what you want out of the game. I'm a big fan of Dungeon World for your bog standard dungeon delving, but I also like Exalted, 13th Age, and Burning Wheel. Pathfinder just has hella problems with balance and is just kinda boring to me since I grew up on 3e. I've just found that there are a bunch of games that scratch the same itch while doing more interesting things.

I may be biased though, because I find Paizo to be a very crappy company. They made quite possibly the /most/ derivative continuation of 3e and I just can't respect a game company who takes inspiration to the point of plagiarism.
