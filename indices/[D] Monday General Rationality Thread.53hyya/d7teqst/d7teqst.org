Recently started playing Pathfinder, and have quickly discovered that the other players simply don't take it very seriously. They pay attention, so it's not as bad as it could be, but then they blunder into combat, make poor choices and almost die.

This is all well and good, but the part that bothers me is how little effort they put into their characters (roleplay-wise, not rollplay-wise), which leads to me dominating the conversation and planning portions, even though I'm not spec'd for it at all. I've become the leader by default. How can I subtly (or not so subtly) get them to step up their game while participating? The groundwork and tools are all there, they just won't use them.

A fighter with 11 CHA really shouldn't have to take point all the time, guys.
