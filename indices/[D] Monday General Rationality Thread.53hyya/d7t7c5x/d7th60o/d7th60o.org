I don't know much about the statistics involved, but I'd like to point out that anyone on this thread is likely to have motivated bias against the data presented in this link (especially since the poster is very passive-aggressive about them).

So I'm expecting other answers to hold the 'article' to higher standards than they would expect from a less controversial article.
