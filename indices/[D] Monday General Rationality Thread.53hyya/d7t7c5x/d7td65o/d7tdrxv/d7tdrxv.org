#+begin_quote
  the argument is easily falsifiable because of the Flynn Effect alone
#+end_quote

How? The Flynn Effect has affected everyone in the USA. It likely hasn't affected sub-saharan Africa, which is full of malnutrition and parasite load.

#+begin_quote
  timespan involved, it's highly unlikely genetic changes alone could have caused that variance in score
#+end_quote

How long (or short) is that timespan? The argument says "5000 generations", which, at 20 years per generation, is 100k years, way too much. But I can see it happening with 250 generations = 5000 years.

#+begin_quote
  but the US isn't where they'd show up
#+end_quote

Because everyone is very mixed? Still, they /do/ show up, in the IQ test averages.
