  How? The Flynn Effect has affected everyone in the USA. It likely hasn't affected sub-saharan Africa, which is full of malnutrition and parasite load.

Did you miss where I said it measured Danish conscripts? It's not unique to the US. And you're misunderstanding my purpose with the flynn effect-- I'm not hammering the "people got smarter" point so much as the "variability in scores" point.

  How long (or short) is that timespan? The argument says "5000 generations", which, at 20 years per generation, is 100k years, way too much. But I can see it happening with 250 generations = 5000 years.
#+end_quote

I literally posted the years involved. 1950 to 2004.

  Because everyone is very mixed?
#+end_quote

My point is that, because we're so mixed, if IQ really was tied to race we'd see a negligible difference between the US "races."

  Still, they do show up, in the IQ test averages.
#+end_quote

No, they don't. We see a variation of twenty points at most, when we already know that IQ varies heavily due to stuff like nutrition, education, and financial situation. The statistics are /true/, but there isn't nearly enough long-term data to conclude the difference is because of race, and not some confounding factor.

I'll believe it when someone gives me a study that's controlled for things like socioeconomic condition of parents, region, school district, physical fitness as children, etc. That is to say, I'll probably never believe it because there are so many confounding variables, any single explanation is incredibly difficult to prove.
