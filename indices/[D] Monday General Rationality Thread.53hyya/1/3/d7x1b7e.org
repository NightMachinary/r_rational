After reviewing everything, I suppose the best way to phrase my position with respect to yours is that, in my mind, these conceptions of 'life' and 'death' neither seem nor feel meaningful.

In this form, I don't think that 'death' is inherently bad, merely more or less circumstantially bad, which doesn't seem appropriate for a conception of 'death'.
