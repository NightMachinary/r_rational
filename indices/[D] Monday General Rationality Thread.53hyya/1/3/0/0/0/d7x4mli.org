  Death, from your perspective, is only death from my perspective if my agency is over only one agent, and that agent ceases to act under my agency without replacement (with the qualification that the value of a future agent initiating under my agency after an interstice of zero agents is multiplied by the probability such a future arising).

That seems to totally miss everything about my writing. Agency, action and even one's memories play absolutely no necessary part in my model. The model is simply about continuous experience and anticipated future experience, you seem to be talking about identity in the sense of the ego, which is not really what this theory is about.

You are clearly using a different meaning of life and death than what my model defines so it's not clear if you actually have anything to say about the topic, except that you like to use different definitions of those words, so it's probably best to clarify about what it is that you are actually trying to make a point about.

One area we likely differ is that you based on your comment don't actually seem to care whether your existence is cut short if something else steps up to continue your goals, I have encountered people with similar positions before who don't actually seem to care about oblivion, and seem to be primarily motivated to live by obligations; however most people are most definitely more concerned with continuing their experience of existing than they are with ensuring their goals are continued towards.

I think my model is, as far as I know the most defensible one for justifying predictions about whether a given course of action will result in oblivion. Actually predicting whether an action will result in people's experience being permanently terminated, seems like the only real stakes of any actual practical value when it comes to philosophical theories of consciousness.
