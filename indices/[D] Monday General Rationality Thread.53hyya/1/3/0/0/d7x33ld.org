Exactly. 'Life' and 'death' as defined in terms of anticipated future experience aren't meaningful from my viewpoint.

I'm bad at remembering usernames, so I don't remember if you were there for it, but I've mentioned at least once in what I think was the previous conversation about this topic that's been brought up here what I base my own personal assessment of life and death on. Namely, I base them upon the idea of agency.

As it stands, at this very moment, there is an agent which, under my agency, is sitting in front of a desktop computer, typing this message. If, for any number of reasons, that agent were to cease acting under my agency, and another were to initiate it elsewhere, then from the perspective of my agency, the event would only be good or bad in so far as the difference between agents' abilities to act under my agency, as determined by their physical form, their location in space and time, the side-effects of one agent's cessation and another's initiation on the world, and so on.

Death, from your perspective, is only death from my perspective if my agency is over only one agent, and that agent ceases to act under my agency without replacement (with the qualification that the value of a future agent initiating under my agency after an interstice of zero agents is multiplied by the probability such a future arising).

I also have some points about how whether or not an agent is acting under my agency is determined, which is based at a local level on mutual satisfaction of agency, and at a global level on local connectedness. I can go further into that if you want to hear it at a later time, but it's getting late, and I'm trying to fix my sleep schedule so I can stop missing my morning classes.
