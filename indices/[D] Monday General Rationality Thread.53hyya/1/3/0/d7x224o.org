Death in the sense of the cutting off of any potential future experience seems pretty bad unless you thought your life wasn't going to be worthwhile in the future.\\
As thus while that may just be /circumstantially/ bad, that distinction seems kind of meaningless; it doesn't change the fact it's bad, though it might make a difference if you were terminally ill or otherwise had no reason to think you would be missing out on good future experiences.

As for the concepts of life and death: I'm not defining these abstractly, you may have noticed that things are defined purely in terms of anticipated future experience; given that, I'm not sure in what sense you can say it's not a meaningful question.
