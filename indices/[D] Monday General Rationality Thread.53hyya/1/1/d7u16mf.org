If I understand your view correctly, you are essentially saying that you believe that in general, consciousness is identical to an ongoing process occurring in the brain; and that specifically, your consciousness/identity/self is associated with the process occurring in your own brain.

Given that, I don't understand why continuity is so important to you. Assuming you're a physicalist, you believe that your mental state at any given time is completely determined by the physical arrangement of particles in your brain. So, suppose that you could pause time just for your body, while the universe continued as before. Your experience would have ceased until time was unpaused again, but you would notice nothing at all except for a sudden change in surroundings. So, your experience is discontinuous with respect to the passage of time in the universe (let's call this t), but continuous with respect to your perception of the passage of time (let's call this t').

Insisting on t'-continuity means you have to bite some rather strange bullets, which I'm happy to share if you would like to hear them. But t-continuity seems to be a much stricter criterion than what we would ordinarily demand from a physical process, and without a good reason, it seems arbitrary and unsound to subject stricter demands of consciousness than of other physical processes.

In either case, though, it seems strange to object to anesthesia when you don't to sleep. If it's missing time you're worried about, then I don't think there's really a dividing line between sleep and anesthesia--personally, I've had non-REM naps and even full nights of REM sleep that felt like like lying down and then "suddenly being awake with no sense of the intervening time actually having happened." And though I'm not a neuroscientist or sleep scientist, I expect that there are periods during nightly sleep when your brain's activity is essentially identical to what happens under anesthesia. You can resolve that as a self-death happening in both cases or in neither case, but at least given my present knowledge, it seems very strange to worry about one but not the other.
