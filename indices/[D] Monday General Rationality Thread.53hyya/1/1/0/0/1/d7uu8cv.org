Ok the difference with sleep is that many people who don't feel like they skipped time may not remember any details, but they still have some small amount of memory of the sleep even if it's basically devoid of memories, they still feel like /something/ was happening. With amnesia the worry isn't so much that you forgot the experience, but that there that there /wasn't anything to experience/, so you might not have forgotten anything per-say.\\
The thing I care about when it comes to t-continuity isn't continuity of memory but /continuity of experience/, which due to flaws in human memory is unfortunately hard to be sure about.

With simulation of one's brain I think that would likely violate continuity, which is why I would want to avoid ever pausing simulated minds, and would aim for continuous uploading techniques. Among the reasons I found other consciousness models untenable is because of the example you brought up, of both copies being you. Sure both copies can have your ego, but you clearly wouldn't be subjectively experiencing being both of them at once so the idea of them /actually/ both being you is incoherent.

I should state for clarifications that i'm /absolutely/ a transhumanist, I just think it's extremely important to have uploading and stuff done as a continuous process, but no I don't think the hardware of the human brain has any privileged status.
