His model seem very similar to mine but the anaesthesia part seems strange to me because since I don't know how anaesthesia works I can't know if it disrupts continuity in my model and I'm not sure if it's just a difference on which changes in the brain mean death or If I'm just thinkin that anaesthesia is unlikely to work in a way that interrupts consciousness but im wrong and he is saying that it does that ( I will have to investigate that to be sure). My model of consciousness is that I'm a process in my brain that is changing from a state to another (10 year me for example was a different state , actual me is another , in a instant I will be in another a so on )and copy would have my actual state but would be a new instance of the computation also if my process is stoped even if it's restarted in the same brain the original process stops .While sleeping the process doesn't stop, my brain keeps executing the software that constitutes me.So the difference isn't undetectable from my perspective , anaesthesia stops the brain proceses that we call consciousness(so it kills you because you awake as a new process that has or it doesn't(the problem is determining what processes are essential to consciousness )
