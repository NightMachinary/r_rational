  The problem is that to me the same brain whith the same pattern doesn't necessarily mean that you are the same person because the difference between being a copy and being the same one to me can't be your brain state because that's just a pattern.

That's it exactly. In order to tell the difference between identical patterns, you have to look at their history. This works for copies that exist in a separate place from the original: The copy is the one that was physically instantiated more recently. It doesn't work in the case of anesthesia, since the two possibilities (copy or original) have identical physical histories.

  is that what you mean by suspended in 2?

Imagine the following scenario: A computer runs an emulation of your brain at the molecular level. This emulation of your brain experiences consciousness the same as you do, and it has memories and feelings identical to yours. Now, suppose the computer needs to do something else. Your emulation still exists in the computer's memory, but because it's given no attention by the CPU, it is not updated as time passes. The emulation does not experience the passage of time, or anything else. It just sits there, frozen, until the CPU can give it attention again. This is essentially what I meant in #2: The pattern exists, but is not being updated. I don't think that this is exactly what happens in the brain during anesthesia. However, I think that what happens is closer to this than it is to #1.

I can understand what your words say, and there are no parts that confuse me. However, I can't know whether your words say what you want them to mean. I do know I would understand you more easily if you broke your writing up into paragraphs, as I have done. It would be even easier if you used punctuation a little more carefully--reading "[text] . [text]" instead of "[text]. [text]" is quite jarring to me as a native speaker. For my part, I am happy to clarify anything I have said that you had difficulty understanding.
