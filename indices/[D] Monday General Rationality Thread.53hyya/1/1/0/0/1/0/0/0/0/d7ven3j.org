  It's just that there is a very important difference between anesthetization and the teleporter, namely: An patient scheduled for anesthetization can expect to wake up and continue living afterwards. A passenger who enters the teleporter can correctly expect all experience to cease, permanently, when it activates.

/That's assuming your conclusion/, they look very similar to an outside observer, and what to subjectively expect /is exactly the point being addressed/. I think anesthesia may mean a halting of experiential continuity and thus oblivion.

  But if you were initially okay with it, and only concluded anesthetization was bad by deduction from your theory, then I suggest your theory may be giving unreliable results.
#+end_quote

How so? How is that any different from someone saying that our unwillingness to get into a teleporter is objectively bad for us (if teleporters were widespread enough not using them would be pretty inconvenient), and thus it must be unreliable.\\
This isn't a question of ethics, where how good something sounds is the primary way of evaluating a given theory; this is a question about anticipated experience /that ought to have a real answer/ and we shouldn't expect whether the answer is convenient to affect it's likelihood of being true.

  I still don't see the importance of continuity, other than as a means to prevent what we really see as bad, namely, termination of a given instance of the you-process.

This statement is profoundly weird to me, what more do you want? The whole point of this theory is to create a model that is unlikely to unknowingly lead to people's deaths; that's the biggest possible stakes when it comes to a theory of consciousness.

#+begin_quote
  It just seems to me that if you anticipate having experiences after some event, that event cannot be your death, as the word is commonly used. But I suppose it is precisely "you" and "your" that is up for discussion.

I'm not sure you interpreted my point correctly.. I think any break in continuity of experience means permanent oblivion and that's the kind of death i'm talking about, so this last bit seems weird.
