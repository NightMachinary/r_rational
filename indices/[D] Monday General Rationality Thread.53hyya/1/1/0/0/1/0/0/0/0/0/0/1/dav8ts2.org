Ah I found this looking through old threads. I would like to state for the record that i'm not confident either way about whether anesthesia would mean death.\\
After anesthesia you may feel just like you skipped over a period of time during as though your consciousness didn't exist for that time, which if it were true would mean death in my view, since I view any break in continous experience as probable death.

However I don't know that that's how anesthesia actually works, it could simply be that anesthesia gives you anterograde amnesia so you are having some incredibly basic experiences, that simply leave no trace of their existence after the fact.\\
My worry about amnesia is fundamentally, that I have no way of knowing whether you are experiencing things during it. Whether there's a way that it's "like" to be under anesthesia, or whether that's as silly a question as asking what it's like to be a rock.

In contrast, I think even deep sleep is still some form of consciousness. When I wake up from deep sleep (usually because of an alarm, left to one's own devices people usually wake up from REM) I don't feel as though I just woke up from a dream or just fell asleep then woke up. For the record I know when I wake up from deep sleep because you are way more tired waking up from it than other sleep phases.\\
Let me put it this way, if sleep other than dreams was just /nothing/. Then when you woke up, if you could remember your dreams, you would /always/ feel as though you just woke up from a dream, regardless of what phase of sleep you woke up from.

Anyway I'm glad to see someone else with what seems like the same position as me, because it seems like among the rational community this position is phenomenally rare. After all cryonics is pretty popular among this community and within our view it wouldn't really save your life (though you might still think that having a copy of you alive in the future would be neat), but our position never really gets addressed when talking about whether cryonics would actually save your life.

Anyway even if you read my little paper on this position before, I would recommend you read it again, because I've added a few things, and one intuition pump regarding meditation that you might find useful for defending this position: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkJL_8USmcAHNpdYd-vdtDkV-plPcuH3sSxCkSLzGtk/edit?usp=sharing]]
