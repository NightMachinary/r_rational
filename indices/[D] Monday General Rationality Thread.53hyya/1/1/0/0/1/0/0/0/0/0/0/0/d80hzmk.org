  my brain keeps executing the software that constitutes me.So the difference isn't undetectable from my perspective , anaesthesia stops the brain proceses that we call consciousness(so it kills you because you awake as a new process that has or it doesn't(the problem is determining what processes are essential to consciousness )

Right, in that sense, your model seems very similar to vakusdrake's. The main issue I have with it is that, /even if we know exactly what processes are identified with consciousness/, that only tells us whether consciousness is happening when we can measure it. So if we determine that certain necessary parts of the consciousness process are inoperative during anesthesia, we would know then that someone under anesthesia is not conscious. (It's worth stating, though, that we don't know what the processes that cause consciousness are, and given what I know, I believe anesthesia in particular is more sleep-like/differently-conscious than death-like/non-conscious. However, this is a belief subject to change upon new evidence).

However, the really important question, from my point of view, happens later. When a person wakes up from unconsciousness, presumably some sort of re-booting occurs. We know the brain hasn't been wiped clean, because people who wake from unconsciousness retain the memories of prior consciousness. If we continue the computer analogy, then there are two main possibilities for this new consciousness-process (understanding that since the brain is not the kind of computer we are familiar with, it's likely that neither of these is an exact description of what actually happens in the brain):

1. It is a new process, initiated from scratch after the Brain reboot. The process finds your memories where it expects to find them, says "great, this must be me!" and so you 2.0 believes they are a continuation of you 1.0.

2. Maybe, instead of initializing a new process, it's closer to resuming a suspended process. The consciousness process was always there, but it was waiting on hold until your brain had the resources to run it again.

If I understand vakusdrake (and given how we seemed to be talking past each other, I'm not entirely sure I do), he believes that both options mean death for the original. Personally, I believe that 1 is probably death, because it seems similar to the teleporter situation in certain essential ways. Since the original brain continues existing, though, I'm less certain that 1 means death than I am that the teleporter does. I also believe that 2 is not death, because it seems more similar to the "emulated you is paused, then after some time resumed" situation, which I also believe not to be death.

Given my (layman's) understanding of how the brain works, I think that something 2-ish is the more likely possibility (though again, this could change given new evidence). For that reason, and because I think anesthesia is more sleep-like than death-like, I don't worry about anesthesia. However, it's possible that different types or methods of inducing unconsciousness (anesthesia, physical trauma, asphyxiation, etc) differ between 1 and 2, and so I may learn in the future that I should fear anesthesia, but being knocked out with a club is perfectly alright (assuming it causes no lasting damage).

Regarding this part:

If you just mean that there is a detectable process associated with consciousness, even if we don't know what it is, then I agree. If you mean that, having awakened from anesthesia, you can determine whether you experienced death, then I disagree. You would have an identical experience of the event whether you were a copy or survived it with your consciousness intact. That's the part that I meant was undetectable. In some thought-experiments, like the teleporter, what happens is sufficient for us to rule out the possibility of mind-survival. However, I think that as long as the brain remains intact, retains its arrangement of neural connections and strengths, and is capable of being returned to its previous state of animation, it seems somewhat premature to conclude that any cessation of consciousness is permanent for the one that experiences it.
