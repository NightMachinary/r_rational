Thanks for clearing that up for me, and especially for playing along with the spirit of my questions. I feel I can now understand your position much better, and I look forward to reading that Tegmark paper. As an aside, though, I'm curious what measure of qualia difference you'd consider to disqualify members from the set of you. Is any difference sufficient, no matter how small, or is there a threshold of qualia significance such that differences below the threshold are ignored for set membership? Or would your adoption of any standard here depend on experiments with multiple you-copies that haven't yet been performed?

I'm also interested in the quantum suicide strategy you mentioned in the first edit. It seems like it could work for some things, like playing the lottery (assuming each of copies first earned enough money to buy their ticket; otherwise, you might as well just be buying 1000 tickets yourself), but for anything that genuinely turns on the outcome of a random quantum event, it seems like having many copies in a single universe would add no benefit relative to only having 1 per universe. Is that right, or is there something to your strategy that I'm not seeing?
