It seems foolish to even make note of which is the original, given your theory of self. Assuming the original you is an emulation anyway, then it seems to make more sense to include original you in the quantum suicide pact. That way there's no need to fuse "copy me" and "original me" in the case that the original wins.

If "original me" is still a meat-brain, then you could use the process described in edit 2. That process is only going to be important if you need your meat-body for some practical reason, though, since you don't privilege the original's continued experience. If you don't, it might be simpler (if messier) to instantaneously kill the meat body, assuming such a thing is possible.

Re. t'-continuity: I'd gathered that from your prior comments, but I do appreciate seeing it explicitly stated.
