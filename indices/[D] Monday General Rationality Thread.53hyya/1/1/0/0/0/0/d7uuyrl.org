Basically, I reject it because I don't want to die. I'll agree that a computer simulation of my mind, if initialized to an exact replica of my bio-brain state at some time t_0, has as much right to claim descent from from pre-t_0 me as the still-existing biological version of me would. I expect it would diverge more widely in less time due to different brain-body interactions, but it would still have all my pre-t_0 memories and feel that, other than the sudden shock of body transplant, it had an uninterrupted experience of being me that went all the way back to my earliest childhood.

What I'm not okay with is destroying the original. Essentially, I think that identity-as-process is insensitive to differences between instances of the same process, but these are important and should be distinguished. I consider death to be the termination of my current instance, regardless of any others, the same way we would say a person died even if their genes lived on in an identical twin. I guess this view is sort of a hybrid of self-as-process and self-as-hardware, and it seems obvious enough that I'm not really sure why it never seems to be proposed in these discussions.

For example, process theory of identity says that a copy-move-destroy teleporter situation is okay, because you walk out the other side having an experience that is continuous with the one you were having when you walked in. I agree that for exit-me, there is no problem. However, I know that when entry-me walks into the teleporter, he is having the last experience he will ever undergo. Obviously, entry-me prefers exit-me existing to having no me exist, for the same reason that I hope other humans exist after my death. But it's not the same as being around to witness it myself.

I don't care if there exists any me-process with experience continuous into the past; I care if there exists /this/ me-process. That's why sleep and anesthesia don't bother me: As long as I wake up on the other end, no death happens.
