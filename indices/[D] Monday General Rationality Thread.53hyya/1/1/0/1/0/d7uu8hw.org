Well the anesthesia example is tricky because it's not really possible to be certain of what is going on in someones head while under so I'm not sure one way or the other, however I think that since there's few surgeries that can't be done with other methods that one should maybe play it safe. People sometimes wake up during anesthesia (but don't remember it because they give you drugs that stop you from forming memories) so I suppose that's one thing that makes it seem more likely to not be as close to death.\\
My point about continuity was about whether you would be risking subjective death though, how you treat others who are clones of themselves is a different question.

Lets replace anesthesia with something I'm more sure is a cessation of experience, like say something like cryosleep in sci-fi. In a case where somebody woke up from it there's no reason to treat them different than somebody created with a cloning machine I will agree.\\
However I'm of the opinion that since you are presumably friends with people because of their qualities (their personality/memories) it wouldn't make sense to treat a clone of them any different than the original. The only exception to this would be to respect the originals wishes to some extent, but not more than the wishes of any clones.
