  Ok so as for why I care about continuity, I don't think should the internal experiencing process stop that any future process can make any more plausible claim to continuing your experience than any other.

I'm understanding this to mean if you had anesthesia (assuming it doesn't have continuity), then any possible changes could be made and when the person in the hospital awoke, they would be just as valid. Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding.

If I'm getting the above right, does this also apply to other people? Eg. If your friend went to the hospital and it's likely they had anesthesia (assuming they lose continuity), then it's likely that you aren't friends anymore (unless you're friends with everyone)?
