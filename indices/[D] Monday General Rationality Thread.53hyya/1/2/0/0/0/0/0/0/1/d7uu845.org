Yeah I know what you mean, I don't really have math beyond college algebra, so a lot of the sequences were hard to get through. Still you can definitely get most of the stuff without much math since I managed with a mediocre mathematical ability and unwillingness to stop reading and do math.

Given a model for how the soul would work seems like it would necessitate observable interactions with the brain; I really want to know what your model is, and why it would make whole brain emulation impossible. Does your model also prohibit /any/ sufficiently complex computer programs from existing? Also what's your position on animals, where if anywhere is the cut off point for animals/intelligence level? Also if simulating minds is possible than isn't /not/ believing in souls a easier explanation since in that scenario souls would have ceased to have any explanatory power?

Regarding the genetic component you brought up; that seems really unlikely to be more than confounding factors. Religiosity is associated negatively with wealth and intelligence which immediately complicates things. Additionally people often have to face a great deal of hardship in not following the acceptable belief system of their social group, which explains the gender gap and also means religiousity will be negatively correlated with higher levels of rebelliousness. Plus given the countries that are majority atheist it's clear that any genetic factor would have to have a relatively small affect anyway. You can start to see how any direct genetic factor for religiosity /specifically/ would be nearly impossible to pin down.

As for your anecdotes, the fact they're anecdotes isn't probably what would make me dispute them, more likely I would dispute the idea that anything supernatural was involved. Depending on what kind of theism you have you may or may not find it notable that people all over the world with radically different religious beliefs (plus the new age-ers who thought they were connecting with aliens or something) have many of the same spiritual experiences, but the specifics tend to fit whatever ideas they already believed or were prevalent in their culture.\\
I don't know if you've heard of the god-helmet but you may also find it notable /that you can deliberately cause spiritual experiences by putting a magnet on someone's head/.\\
Given we know these experiences can be triggered by very mundane psychological sources; even if you believe in the supernatural, you have to consider whether a legitimate supernatural event is the most likely thing in the vast majority of cases. Obviously miracles can't be /that/ common or they would have some sort of observable effect, and prayer studies certainly didn't show it to be more effective than placebo.
