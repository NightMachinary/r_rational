I've read most of Yudkowsky's sequences already and had trouble understanding some of the math without a background in statistics or Bayes. The only observation I expect to make because of my soul is that I will experience an afterlife following my death. While I have a model for how the soul might work, if whole brain emulation ends up working then my model would clearly be wrong and the soul would have to work differently than I previously thought.

I do have reasons to believe in the soul, it isn't purely a matter of faith, but none of them are objectively verifiable. I could share my spiritual experiences with you but they'd be meaningless since they're all subjective anecdotes. In the meantime I have subscribed to the theory that religious belief has a genetic component so it's easier to accept that I believe in something without any hard evidence while other people do not.
