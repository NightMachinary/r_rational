I've since found a way to accept my beliefs without guilt, so that's made things easier. I have no intention of ceasing to be spiritual and I hope I never do because of how much good it's done me and how little bad. The main obstacle to happiness and self-actualization now is my own neuroses, as I remain relentlessly self critical.
