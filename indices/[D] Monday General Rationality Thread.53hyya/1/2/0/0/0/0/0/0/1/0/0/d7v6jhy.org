Well first off I should point out that calling atheism a belief system is kind of weird and misleading, not holding one's current theistic beliefs doesn't necessitate adopting some whole different belief system. Plus your position seems to basically be materialism, plus some supernatural stuff tacked on.

Also given the way you're talking about your beliefs, it seems extremely familiar to something I've read.. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/]]
