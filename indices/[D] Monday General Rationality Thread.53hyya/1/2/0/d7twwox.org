Did you read the writing I linked to? Because one of my points is that I think talking about the self is usually changing the topic to be about identity.\\
I simply put forth that your consciousness might just be your continued experience, I think a lot of discussion misses the point which I think really ought to be about what subjective experience to expect.

There's also the issue that you can have evidence to favor arguments other than just experimental data. Not every currently untestable hypothesis is created equal; some things will have complexity penalties and others are disqualified for being logically inconsistent.\\
So no your belief in souls is totally incomparable to most materialist philosophy, because there's a difference between faith based claims, and claims that in lieu of evidence are the most justifiable position.\\
That is unless you think you have really strong justifications for the soul; however given you said evidence wouldn't change your mind any justifications you give are not really justifications since they have no bearing on your belief.

Of course since I so rarely get a chance to talk to theists with any thought out belief framework, I would quite like to hear any reasons you have for souls being plausible.
