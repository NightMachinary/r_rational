I think you don't die when you sleep, because I think you don't have a cessation of consciousness when you sleep, I think you are experiencing things even if they aren't very notable during sleep; /remember I say in the writing I linked that I seriously worried sleep might mean death at one point,/ so the emotional appeal of an idea means very little to me.

I don't think people's emotional reactions have any special ability to somehow discern whether a claim is true, and thus I can't get what point you're making in in your first paragraph. How would people's reactions have any method of distinguishing truth? What causal mechanism would somehow allow that?

As for the bit about experience during non-dream sleep, well first off I talk about it in my writing; I didn't say there was a /thought process/ (though during parts there might be sort of fragments of thoughts), however you can experience things other than thoughts, meditation is an obvious example.\\
As for the microchip example: I do think you'd probably notice, because usually people get a sense of time having passed when they wake up instead of feeling like they skipped forward in time. However it may be that for you sleep does feel that way possibly due to not storing memories of it very well. I do mention in the writing that even when woken up during deep sleep I can sort of remember something even if it's barely anything.

I disagree that one's memories are necessarily a good metric for determining whether you had subjective experiencing during a given period, as I mention we know of plenty of circumstances where you definitely have experiences that you either don't consolidate as memory or soon forget. So you can't very well say it doesn't matter /because we know that you have those sorts of experiences all the time and don't remember it/.

Something I could say about my model is that it is talking about what some people call the part of you that experiences events, and doesn't consider what one would call the ego useful in determining whether subjective events continue. It hasn't been lost on me that this does have much in common with eastern philosophy where one's memories and even personality are separate from the "true you" (which in my model is nothing more profound than the process that has the experiences).

As for your last part about the drug: But why would you expect the process in your brain that experiences stuff to shut off at any point just because a bunch of data in other areas got corrupted or lost?
