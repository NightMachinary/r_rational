As far as identity goes, we can distinguish between answers that make sense and answers that don't make sense, though. You've said that 'you die every time you sleep' is stupid, and I figure that our concept of identity (and thus related concepts like personal growth or death) should be consistent with our reactions to related phenomena. We cry at funerals, a significant reaction, so it is consistent to say a significant thing happened to cause that significant reaction. Just the same, we don't cry at bedtime, an insignificant reaction, so it is consistent to say that bedtime is an insignificant thing, as far as identity is concerned. Much of what I talked about is extrapolating from real-life examples (like meeting a childhood friend or your current best friend) to find a definition of identity that matches the reactions each example gives. In this way, I think a meaningful answer to defining identity exists and can be explored.

As far as consciousness apart from identity, well, sorry. I got caught up in thinking about identity that I missed how you were talking about it separately. It might be the connection with death, and that I think of death as intertwined with identity as with consciousness, but I can take a gander at consciousness as a separate concept.

Like my identity idea, I want here to look at examples of human reaction to related events and build a concept that is consistent with our reactions. Under this perspective, what you say about sleep not truly being a cessation of experience due to the continuing thought processes that we simply can't remember sounds a little off. If someone put a microchip in my brain that forced a cessation of experience as I neared sleep and restored experience at a time afterwards, I wouldn't see it as any different from sleep. When you say subjective death, I can't agree with the idea that of two events I can't discern the difference between (sleep and microchip), one of them results in a subjective death and the other doesn't. Or at least, if subjective death /must/ occur in one and only one of the two scenarios, it's meaning is such that I find no reason to care about the concept in the first place.

A drug that wipes my memories and changes my brain chemistry would result in a cessation of experience, but as I understand it, it would also result in a drastic change in identity. The identity theory that I talked about would then cover why I would care about the concept and describe it as a death, but I don't believe the fact that it is an explicit cessation of experience has changed anything meaningful about the event.
