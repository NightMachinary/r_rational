Ok well the major thing I should emphasize (though I assume you read the post I linked so you understand a bit about my position)\\
Is that I don't really think questions about the sort of identity you're talking about are really going to have meaningful answers because there's no clear criteria for a meaningful answer.\\
I think when talking about whether to expect a cessation of personal experience one should really only talk about whether the process your mind was carrying out that contained experience stopped. I think other stuff like whether that process maintained the same memories can't plausibly affect whether that process has a subjective cessation of experience.

So for instance I don't think that if you were given a drug that instantly wiped away your memories and changed your brain chemistry (so there would be no link in terms of personality similarities) that you ought to expect a subjective cessation of experience.\\
I think since it's the only thing we actually experience that our continuous qualia (yes that term sometimes has weird connotations in philosophy sometimes, don't overthink it) is the only thing that ought to be taken into account when talking about whether something will cause subjective death.
