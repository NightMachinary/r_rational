I hadn't planned to return to this conversation, but as I was falling asleep last night, I thought of something that I thought you would probably want to know.

It's your position that any discontinuity in the conscious process means death. You said (I think) that you believe this to apply in the case of an emulated human on a computer whose execution is paused and then resumed: As soon as the em is paused, they die. This has some rather startling implications, I'm afraid:

-Firstly: A computer is a series of values stored in memory and a processor that updates them one-at-a-time (or, with N processors/cores, N-at-a-time). It takes a non-zero duration the processor to do this, and there is non-zero duration between updates. If the duration of the discontinuity really is irrelevant, then ems die after each update, while waiting for the next one. This happens many times each second of their existence.

-Secondly, if we are in a computer simulation, the same is neccessarily true for us too.

-Thirdly, your theory seems to assume that physical time is continuous, but this is not known to be the case. Some theories of physics suggest that physics works more like a computer in this respect: That time is not continuous, but increases incrementally, one Planck Time at a time. If these theories are true, then we die every moment of our existence, even if not in a simulation.

Your position is still self-consistent and reality-consistent, given these observations. And if it's true, there isn't really anything we can do about it--we are always dying every moment, and feels just like normal experience. "Don't do X or you'll die," somewhat loses its argumentative force, however. Furthermore, it seems to me that any definition of consciousness which implies that we die every moment without realizing it in the course of ordinary experience without realizing it is not really a good definition of consciousness. Even if it were (somehow) known to be true, it's just not a very useful way of describing things, and on that basis, I find it worth rejecting.

A modification might be made: Instead of requiring strict continuity, you could redefine continuous to mean "continuous iff time is continuous; else, having no discontinuities longer than the smallest physical increment of time." That seems like a defensible re-definition that preserves your theory, in the case that physics is otherwise than we assume. It would mean that we don't die every moment if physics is discontinuous. However, it doesn't improve the outlook at all for ems or for simulation-us. Since the time between computer updates is variable, and dependent on the hardware, and always larger than the Planck time, I don't think there is any redefinition that preserves your intent, is non-arbitrary about the maximum-length permissible discontinuity, and doesn't imply unceasing death for computer-instantiated consciousness. If you think there's a fair chance that we live in a simulation, and you rejected the first definition, then I expect you'll probably reject this one too, for the same reason.

I'd find it interesting to hear your thoughts on this.
