I did read your writing and I thought it was good. You have an interesting theory of consciousness. While it is very useful to judge hypotheses based on complexity when determining what should be investigated, it doesn't actually describe reality. An improbable hypothesis can still be true, it's just too unlikely to justify the cost of falsifying it.

My reasons for believing in souls is based on extrapolating from my philosophy, which I think is similar to materialism. I agree with materialists how the universe behaves and what will be observed, but I make different underlying assumptions as to why it exists and behaves the way it does.
