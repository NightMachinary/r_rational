Ok so about that first bit: Yes unlikely hypothesis can turn out to be true (though internally inconsistent ones can't) but that doesn't change the fact that some things can affect how likely a hypothesis is to turn out to be true. I'm not really sure what your point is here. I would bring up Russell's teapot, but it's not even clear what point you're making.

As for your philosophy; it most definitely can't be anything like materialism if it has any standard variation of souls. Unless you think there's some sort of physical mechanism that allows soul stuff to affect the brain (which would thus make the soul a physical detectable object) you are proposing non-causal interaction which is the very antithesis of anything to do with materialism.
