Oh I had seen that a while back but nearly forgotten. That does clear things up quite a lot, since it indicates your belief is more characteristic of new age beliefs than christian theology, it also clears up what kind of spiritual experience you were talking about.

In the future you should just start with linking that since your beliefs aren't anything like the norm for people who mention they have theistic beliefs on a somewhat intellectual forum, it's not fully immersed in the dark arts like christian theology for one so that's comforting.

Hmm reading you comments it is clear that we are rather different, i'm not totally the hollywood rationalist vulcan, but that comparison is still somewhat apt. I can definitely imagine why you wouldn't want to stop communicating with those spirits, though for me the novelty would be the primary interest. I'm somewhat curious whether you have seen what hallucinogens do to the phenomenon, since that's among the first thing I'd check. Depending on how hallucinogens affect you, you might even get a similar experience from them that was entirely non-mystical

As for potentially replacing the support provided by your current spiritual beliefs; I would probably recommend sam harris because he does talk about that sort of thing quite a lot. It's entirely possible you might be able to get some sort of similar experience from some other psychological practice, maybe even jury rig yourself a god helmet who knows; I just think it's defeatist to think you can't get the same benefits from some non-mystical method.
