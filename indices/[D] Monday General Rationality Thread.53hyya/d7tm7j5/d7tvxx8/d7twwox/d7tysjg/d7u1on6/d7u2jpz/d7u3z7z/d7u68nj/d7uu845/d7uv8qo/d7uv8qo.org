I have heard of and considered all the things you've brought up, none have convinced me that atheism is the belief system I should follow. I am aware that such a conclusion may not be rational, so the notion that I am genetically predisposed to theism seemed plausible after I read about it in The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt. I know my spiritual experiences could've been fake and I can't prove they weren't, but I continue to believe in them because of a psychological need to. There's no reason for me to share my model of the soul because then all we'll discuss is scenarios that could falsify it, which won't change my beliefs because I know my model is incomplete.
