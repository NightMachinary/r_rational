Sorry, I was incorrectly assuming that you were being passive aggressive towards my beliefs and was responding in kind with my critique of Occam's Razor. It was stupid and only served to distract from the main topic of conversation so I apologize.

My view on the soul is not dependent upon whether it can be objectively measured or how it might interact with brain, and my expectations for how the brain works is no more dependent upon my view of the soul.

I fully admit that my beliefs contradict the principles of materialism, especially since I'm not a materialist. I just don't want to disagree with materialists about how reality works since they seem pretty good at analyzing it.
