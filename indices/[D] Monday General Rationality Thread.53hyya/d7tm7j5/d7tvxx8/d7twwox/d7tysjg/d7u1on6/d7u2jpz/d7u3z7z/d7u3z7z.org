Ok so the next thing I'd want to address is the fact that you don't think you expect any differing observations of reality, and yet a soul is most definitely something which has to interact with reality.\\
If it didn't interact with our reality then whatever connection it would have to have to the mind couldn't exist since our brains are things entirely in our reality.

I'm just having difficulty conceiving of what it is you are imagining a soul, would /do/ in your model.

As for occam's razor, I would recommend reading the sequences if you haven't already, because Yudkowsky talks about more formal versions of it, since the layman version is a bad approximation of the actual mathematics that govern that stuff.
