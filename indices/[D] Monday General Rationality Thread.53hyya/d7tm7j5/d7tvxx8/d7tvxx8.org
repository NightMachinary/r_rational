The problem with arguing about theories of consciousness is that we have no evidence to support our positions. Since we don't know what the self is, we end up adopting a view in line with our philosophical interpretation of reality. I'm a theist so I believe in souls, but new evidence merely changes my beliefs regarding how souls work because the evidence cannot falsify my philosophy. I presume it works the same way for atheist materialists.
