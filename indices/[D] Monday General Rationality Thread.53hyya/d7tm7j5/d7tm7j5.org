I've found that it seems like a awfully large number of people seem to hold very similar theories of consciousness to me and yet I've never really found anything that espoused my particular position in much detail.\\
I'll link to this thing I wrote so I don't have to keep repeating my position: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkJL_8USmcAHNpdYd-vdtDkV-plPcuH3sSxCkSLzGtk/edit?usp=sharing]] I would really implore you to read that brief link before responding, since the point of it was to state my actual position.

I'm interested how many people hold similar views and in where else people have seriously talked about this position. I can't really seem to find much on it by googling, so i'm interested in what else you can link to me. This comic is somewhat relevant to my position [[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1]] (however I don't think sleep is actually a cessation of experience).

I'm happy to hear any criticisms of this position, and haven't really gotten to hear any good one's. I've mostly heard the tired old non-argument of "Oh but that would mean you die everytime you sleep"\\
I've heard this position mentioned a great many places, and yet people never seem to seriously delve into it; frequently they just seem to stop when they get to the point where they think it would necessarily imply that you die every time you sleep (even though that's not an actual argument against it).

/Note:/ This is something which has large consequences; like whether you think cryonics could actually save a person (though even if you think it wouldn't, you might have other reasons for wanting a clone of you to exist in the future). It also raises questions as to whether anesthesia is a horrifying prospect.\\
So I don't think this is just a minor philosophical nitpick, /this is quite literally life or death/ so I would hope that you really think about it seriously.\\
The primary purpose of this theory is to actually make predictions about anticipated experience; whether particular things are likely to result in a cessation of experience.
