Ok first off anesthesia: I think anesthesia is /potentially/ a cessation of experience whereas sleep is not, because anesthesia is somewhat different from sleep. You can be vaguely aware of stuff during sleep, you can be woken usually easily and /most/ people don't feel like they skipped forward in time when they wake up, unlike anesthesia*. I just think anesthesia can't make as good a case for you having experiences during it as sleep can. A brain under anesthesia has less stuff going on than one in deep sleep.\\
*However it's not the sensation of skipping time that worries me; it's whether or not that's what you would see if you could theoretically watch someone's experiences through some weird qualia viewing machine. For an individual things are much harder to appraise due to all the problems I brought up with memory.

[[http://academic.pgcc.edu/%7Emhspear/sleep/stages/nrsleep.html][http://academic.pgcc.edu/~mhspear/sleep/stages/nrsleep.html]] here's a link about non-REM dreams. I'm really trying to drive in the point that we have a considerable amount of experiences which we don't remember. I suppose this is going to be harder for you to swallow since you remember far less about your unconscious experiences than many it would seem.

As for the bullets you think my position would force me to bite I'll be glad to hear them.

Ok so as for why I care about continuity, I don't think should the internal experiencing process stop that any future process can make any more plausible claim to continuing your experience than any other. Remember I don't think anything about the mental process except the experiencing bit matters in this scenario, so that bit is what i'm calling you in this circumstance.\\
As thus I don't think there's anything about any future process that would make it more you than any other, I think the only thing that makes your current process you is just that it has been running continuously.

As for stuff to do with pausing time, well I'm not sure actually /pausing time/ is possible and anything less won't have /totally/ stopped from the perspective of the rest of the universe and poses no difficulty to me model. However that whole line of questioning might be total nonsense for all I know since simultaneity, order of events and that sort of thing get all weird in relativity. In fact even theoretically the idea of totally stopping time might be impossible due to weird complications with infinity.
