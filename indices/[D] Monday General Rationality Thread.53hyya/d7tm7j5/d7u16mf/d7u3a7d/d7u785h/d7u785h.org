You seem more informed than me on the matter of sleep vs. anesthetized brain states, so I'll defer to you there. However, I find it /very/ interesting that you don't seem the sensation of time skipping, since it's essentially having (retrograde) amnesia for the skipped period. I suppose that if you think it's something that happens to some extent every time you sleep (maybe less for you than for others, given your frequent lucid dreaming), I can understand how it would be less of a concern for you. On the other hand, any degree of retrograde amnesia violates t'-continuity, so under that criterion there is no difference between anesthetization and forgetful sleep.

If you have objections to the time-pausing thing on realism grounds, consider it instead to be suspending the execution of a 1-to-1 scale simulation of your brain. The effect is the same. Most of my other weird things are also more applicable to software emulations of your brain, but that shouldn't be an issue if the process and continuity really are what is important. But as far as I can see, a theory that requires t' continuity and nothing further should also endorse:

-That (as before) if you are suspended and resumed much later, this should not worry you, existentially.

-That if you are suspended, copied, and resumed, both copies are you

-That if you are suspended, copied exactly, and the original is destroyed, the copy is you and the original should not consider this a problem, so long as the copy is allowed to resume.

-That the above holds even if, say, the original is your biological brain and the copy is a computer simulation. Aside from body dysmorphia, you should feel no apprehension about becoming a computer copy that you don't feel about becoming ordinary future bio-brain-you.

-That this is still true even if the "computer simulation" is some guy performing computations by wheeling file folders around a warehouse on a hand-truck instead of a processor moving electrons around.

I think I had some others, but I don't remember them. Anyway, these are the sorts of conclusions that I find sufficient to reject the idea of you-as-process, and which you will have to handle somehow should you keep your present view.
