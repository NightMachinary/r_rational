Interesting. I'd like to understand your position better, because while it seems like a perfectly reasonable attitude looking from the outside in, I have difficulty accepting that you wouldn't want to distinguish between elements of the set of you from the inside. After all, if one box is suddenly hit by a meteor, the two box-beings will no longer have identical qualia, and it seems like it will matter an awful lot which box you experience. Given such a possibility, it seems that the important thing would be whether the two beings' experience has the possibility to diverge in the future, not whether such divergence had occurred already. But leaving that aside for a minute, if you identify with the set of beings with identical qualia to yours, no matter how large the set, then it shouldn't matter what size the set is (as long as it isn't empty), right?

Suppose that a robot walks into each of the rooms you mention. Each robot has a gun, and one gun is loaded with blanks, the other with bullets. Otherwise, each robot is identical in its movements, mannerisms, speech, etc, so that your qualia remains the same between rooms. The robot offers to shoot you both, and pay the survivor (who is in the room with the blanks) $1,000,000,000. The robot is a trained shooter who knows the human body well, and he promises to shoot you in such a way that will be ~immediately fatal and therefore ~painless for the one in the room with the bullets. Assuming that you can trust the robot to keep its word, do you accept its offer? What if it offered just $20? Or $0.01? If not, why not?

For that matter, if you knew MWI was true, it seems to me that your position commits you to attempt quantum suicide for arbitrarily small gains, so long as those gains were known to be possible in >=1 world(s) in which you existed. Do you accept this commitment, and if not, why not?
