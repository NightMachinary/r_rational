Apologies. That last bit that seemed weird was me realizing that I was assuming my conclusion the whole time. I probably should have just deleted the post and started over at that point. As it is, I guess I'll make one more try at it.

Yes, it's true that a person who is anesthetized either wakes up or doesn't, just as it's true that a person who enters a teleporter either continues their experience or doesn't, making both questions literally a matter of life and death. Therefore, it is very important to find the true answer, if it is possible. I'm 100% on board with the idea that the convenience of an answer doesn't affect its likelihood of being true.

For teleportation, this is fortunately pretty easy. A person who walks into a teleporter is copied and then physically dismantled at a molecular level. That may not be a good, maximally-inclusive minimally-exclusive definition of death, but it is sufficient for us to know that death has occurred.

In the case of anesthetization, however, I can't seem to think of any experiment that could be done, even in principle, to determine the answer to the question of "Should a person who is going under anesthesia expect to experience anything ever again?" We can appeal to brain activity, of course, but that only helps if we've already agreed, arbitrarily, to define death as a certain pattern of brain activity. So we have a question that we can answer with any model, but for which no answer will tell us if we have a good model. So at least on this question, it is exactly like doing ethics, where we can always answer the question "How do we maximize the good?" but no answer will tell us if our arbitrarily-chosen definition of "good" actually captures all the nuance we want it to.

I think it's somewhat analogous to the issue of P-zombies, where a person acts identically whether they have a soul or are a zombie. Similarly, a person emerging from anesthesia acts identically whether or not they are a true continuation of the pre-anesthesia person or actually a newborn clone with all the memories of the original. There is no difference, even from the inside. So my intuition is the same in both cases: Apply Occam's Razor and conclude that what occurs is exactly what seems to occur: There is no difference between zombies and non-zombies, and the person who wakes from anesthesia is the same person who went under.

Anyway, given that intuition is all we have to go on here, my criticism essentially boils down to:

1: The discontinuity = death model is good because it captures everything that my intuition describes as death. However,

2: It violates my intuition by labeling the unknowable-in-principle situation of anesthetization as death, when intuitively, it is not.

3: Other models of consciousness capture everything that my intuition describes as death and additionally accord with it regarding anesthesia.

4: Therefore, one of those models is probably better.

That's why I asked whether your intuition was different than mine for point 2. If our intuitions agree, then my criticism is valid. If they disagree, then it isn't, and that's that.
