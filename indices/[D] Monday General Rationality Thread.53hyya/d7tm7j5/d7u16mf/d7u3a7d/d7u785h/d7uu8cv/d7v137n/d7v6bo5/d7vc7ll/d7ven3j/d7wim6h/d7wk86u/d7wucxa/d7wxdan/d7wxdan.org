As for the brain death scenario, since no major parts of the brain involved in experience retained function throughout I can't imagine how you could say it wasn't temporary death. It wouldn't in practice be any different from if a person was frozen solid then thawed (safely) the stuff that happens while the person is frozen/vegetative can't really be said to matter, since they don't in any meaningful sense exist.\\
Thus there's no reason it would be different from the transporter scenario which you said means death; it therefore follows that you ought to treat cryosleep and temporary brain death as analogous to transporters.

  With that understood, the brain-death scenario suffers the same problem as the ordinary anesthesia scenario, namely, that no experiment can determine whether or not the individual undergoing the process can expect to have further experiences after a "successful" revival.

I'm not claiming some invisible undetectable p-zombie qualia here; I think it ought to be perfectly possible to tell if the parts of the brain involved in experience are in fact active. It would require better knowledge of neuroscience but it's not a impossible experiment by any means.

  As for the role of intuition--since intuitions are developed by observing and understanding the world, I consider them weak evidence for whatever matter they happen to touch on. So they aren't completely divorced from the facts in this case, but neither are they particularly noteworthy. But even weak evidence can be important when it is the only evidence, as it is here. So I feel justified in rejecting theories that conflict with it when there are others that don't. This probably seems horrifying to you, since you consider that I'm treating death rather nonchalantly. But if not for your intuition that continuity is of ultimate importance, you'd have little reason to suspect anesthesia might entail oblivion in the first place. It's possible that I'm wrong, but I estimate the risk of death as lower than for things I do without worry, like climbing mountains or driving on the highway.

Intuitions /can/ provide information about the world, however just as often they are consistently biased so as to be worse than chance, because the brain has evolved to find only a very narrow scope of reality intuitive. The validity of a intuition with no plausible mechanism for having obtained information on the thing that intuition is about, can't be counted on for even weak evidence. I happen to find my consciousness model intuitive in many ways, /however that has never been among my justification for it/.\\
If you read my writing linked in the original post, and the stuff in my comments to you and others in this thread; I think my model is the most tenable because I think it is the most self consistent and I think their are flaws in other models that I point out. Just because there's not empirical evidence for any position /doesn't make all hypothesis equally valid/. There are a number of other qualities that will affect how likely you should rate a hypothesis such as simplicity and self consistency; there are plenty of hypothesis that don't even need to be tested to be ruled out because they are logically impossible due to internal inconsistencies.\\
For more on stuff regarding that I would recommend the Yudkowsky's sequences they deal with a lot of relevant probability theory.

I think a lot of the last paragraph misses the point that this isn't just a situation where we are talking about which theory was most satisfying. From the beginning I was talking about ways in which other theories have flaws that mine lacks; ways in which my theory /more defensible/.
