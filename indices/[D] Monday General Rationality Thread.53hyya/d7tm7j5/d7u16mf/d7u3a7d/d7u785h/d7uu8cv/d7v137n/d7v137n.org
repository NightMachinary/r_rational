For what it's worth, I very much agree with you on the importance of doing uploading as a continuous process, but for different reasons.

So what you care about then is actual continuity of experience (i.e., t-continuity), not continuity of apparent experience (i.e., t'-continuity). That's helpful to know. However, I'm still a bit lost on why continuity is important.

The main justification you give is that it's necessary to distinguish between identical copies of the the process of you. However, without considering continuity, it's already trivial to distinguish them! Whichever instance is physically responsible for your ongoing experience is the "real you," and each copy will be able to distinguish themselves the same way. It's true that the one with t-continuity back to before the copies were made is the original. But that seems unimportant when the original and the copies all have identical mental states. It seems to be just a case of "privileging the hardware" of the original, which is something you say you're against.

Am I missing something?
