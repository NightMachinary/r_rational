My objection to your solution with occam's razor is that it is basically an appeal to to intuition, that something looks a given way so that seems most likely. The problem is that you can easily imagine slight variations on anesthesia that would unquestionably be temporary death that would look very similar from the outside, there's no easy way out of this dilemma.

For instance you can imagine a variation on anesthesia that temporarily makes the person brain dead while their body is kept alive via assisted breathing for the duration of the time they're "under"; there's no easy way to decide where the cut off point of death is in brain activity until neuroscience is far more advanced and we can directly tell whether someone is having experiences.

As for your numbered points: I of course said I'm by no means certain that anesthesia means death, but I think you can't rule out that possibility. However I don't think one's intuitions on the matter are a reliable way to evaluate a claim like this, being horrible if true, doesn't make it less likely to be true.\\
I have difficulty imagining how you think one's intuitions would affect the probability of this claims validity, given I can't imagine any way that the subconscious factors that lead to your intuitions could gain information about the probability of anesthesia entailing oblivion.
