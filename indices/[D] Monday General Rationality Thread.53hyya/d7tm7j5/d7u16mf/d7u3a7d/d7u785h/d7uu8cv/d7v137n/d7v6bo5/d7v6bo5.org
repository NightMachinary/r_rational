I don't think continuity is important for distinguishing the original for an outside observer, I think identical version of the same person should be treated the same. The reason I think it's important to keep track of continuity of experience is for determining whether a given process is killing people even if it wouldn't be obvious from naively watching the outcome.\\
Given you also want uploading to be done continuously, I imagine you also might share my fear of how horrible it might be if a star trek style transporter became widespread, so I think this sort of thing is really important for potentially stopping those sort of utterly horrible scenarios from coming to pass, and to avoid accidentally dying yourself.

This sort of thing has incredibly high stakes; if people have the wrong theory of consciousness countless people might march unknowingly to their deaths through certain future technologies.

Determining whether any copy is the real you may not be very important /after/ the fact, however it's certainly very important before the fact since one's decisions determine whether someone is going to end up dying.

Also among other things I think apparent continuity of experience is a terrible way of predicting experience because of human memory. Like I have said in previous comments, it's undeniable that people experience far more than they are aware of that gets lost, the best example to bring up is that most people lost most of their dreams, and basically no-one remembers their non-rem dreams.
