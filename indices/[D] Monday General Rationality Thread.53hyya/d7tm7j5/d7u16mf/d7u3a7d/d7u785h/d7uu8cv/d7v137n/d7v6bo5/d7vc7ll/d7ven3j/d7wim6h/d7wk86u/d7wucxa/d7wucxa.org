Hmm. Well, that's a very interesting point about assisted breathing and brain death. I actually would question whether that situation counts as death. Brain-death is, after all, only considered death because it marks the point at which no revival is possible. If someone is put into brain-death and then awakened, that would just lead me to believe that brain-death is not a good indication of true death having happened. Brain-death would become an outdated indicator of death, the same as the absence of a heartbeat is an obsolete indicator of death in our present world.

With that understood, the brain-death scenario suffers the same problem as the ordinary anesthesia scenario, namely, that no experiment can determine whether or not the individual undergoing the process can expect to have further experiences after a "successful" revival.

As for the role of intuition--since intuitions are developed by observing and understanding the world, I consider them weak evidence for whatever matter they happen to touch on. So they aren't completely divorced from the facts in this case, but neither are they particularly noteworthy. But even weak evidence can be important when it is the only evidence, as it is here. So I feel justified in rejecting theories that conflict with it when there are others that don't. This probably seems horrifying to you, since you consider that I'm treating death rather nonchalantly. But if not for your intuition that continuity is of ultimate importance, you'd have little reason to suspect anesthesia might entail oblivion in the first place. It's possible that I'm wrong, but I estimate the risk of death as lower than for things I do without worry, like climbing mountains or driving on the highway.

Anyway, as long as our intuitions can't be reconciled in this matter, I expect that further discussion will be largely unproductive.
