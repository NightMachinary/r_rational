Hmm. I agree about the importance of this thing. However, I still don't see the importance of continuity, other than as a means to prevent what we really see as bad, namely, termination of a given instance of the you-process.

Was anesthetization something you were worried about before you came up with your continuity theory? Because if it was, then I guess we just have different intuitions in this matter, and they aren't to be reconciled. But if you were initially okay with it, and only concluded anesthetization was bad by deduction from your theory, then I suggest your theory may be giving unreliable results.

I guess I'm kind of harping on this point. It's just that there is a very important difference between anesthetization and the teleporter, namely: An patient scheduled for anesthetization can expect to wake up and continue living afterwards. A passenger who enters the teleporter can correctly expect all experience to cease, permanently, when it activates.

It just seems to me that if you anticipate having experiences after some event, that event cannot be your death, as the word is commonly used. But I suppose it is precisely "you" and "your" that is up for discussion.
