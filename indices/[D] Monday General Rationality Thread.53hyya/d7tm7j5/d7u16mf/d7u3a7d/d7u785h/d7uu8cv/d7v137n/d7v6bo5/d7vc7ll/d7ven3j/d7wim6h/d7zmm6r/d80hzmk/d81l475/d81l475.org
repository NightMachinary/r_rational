ok I just misunderstood what you were saying when you said that the difference is undetectable(I meant there is a detectable process) . I agree that case 1 is death(I don't think anaesthesia works that way but maybe it does I don't know ) ,also I didn't mean that you could know if you can't know if you experience d death ,. The problem is that to me the same brain whith the same pattern doesn't necessarily mean that you are the same person because the difference between being a copy and being the same one to me can't be your brain state because that's just a pattern. And because then I don't see that munch difference between restarting it from your brain and restarting it somewhere else like in the teleporter ,to me once it stops then the process is ended and restarting it is creating a new one ( I don't know if I'm being clear and I suspect that I'm explaining things very badly coupled to the fact that English isn't my first languaje that maybe it's making it even worse).And I notice that I'm really confused and that I have to 1 think about the main problem that seems to be what is a process and what means for a process to be the same or be a new one(what ways can we for example "stop" a process without it being a new one, what is a process , when a process stops , what can we count as a separated process) 2learn more about how the brain works if posible(in what ways a brain is different from my intuitions based on computers) In case it helps to understand what is what I'm trying to convey I think that probably(altroug maybe is impossible because I don't know very munch about how neurons work) that you can replace neurons in your brain with something that works the same way if you make it one by one in a way that lets the new components become part of the system And also it wouldn't matter to me that the process in the brain that causes consciousness stayed for a while in a state that wasent consciousness if continuity was maintained (is that what you mean by suspended in 2? ) As a final declaration I don't think anaesthesia produces death it's just that vakusdrake seems to have a similar model but thinks it does so that made me thing that either anaesthesia works in a way that doesn't allow continuty or we use diferent models (I still aren't sure maybe both are misunderstanding him)
