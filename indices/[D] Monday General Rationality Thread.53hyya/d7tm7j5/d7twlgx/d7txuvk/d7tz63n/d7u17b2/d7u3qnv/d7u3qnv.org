Hmm... I think an analogy might help explain my perspective here. If a company is contracted to build a house, and they select quality materials for the frame, the walls and floors, and every other aspect, but build it on a shoddy foundation, on first glance and even thorough examination the house they built will come across as well-built, but hidden beneath the surface it's poorly built and wrong. That notion, of it being wrong in a way no one can tell, isn't something I think applies to philosophical questions about ourselves. This isn't to say that everything is surface-thin, that a casual glance tells you all you need to know, since you can thoroughly inspect the house and only see quality construction. But for something entirely hidden from view, unable to view or observe, I reject the idea that anything under that category is meaningful in evaluations of the human mind. If we scan every minute detail of the human mind and understand it fully, there is no hidden foundation that in some mystic way eludes our knowledge and yet has concrete effects on our understanding of the human condition.

The company analogy is, of course, imperfect, but I think it conveys what I mean. Our brains are fundamentally a resolvable problem, something that /makes sense/, so we can't derive our conclusions assuming they aren't. It sounds cold, inhuman, to say that our brains are just machines ticking along, or that there is no real meaning behind our thoughts and experiences, but I would say that while there is no arbitrarily imposed meaning behind our thoughts and experience there is meaning in how we view and understand them.

If everything meaningful we need to know about the brain stems from the brain and not some external framework, we should be able to use the way the brain behaves to answer the meaningful questions about it. This is the fundamental understanding I hold when I talk about us crying at funerals but not at bedtime being relevant to the meaningful nature of our identity, and why it makes no sense to me to say that events our brains have no means of telling the difference between affect meaningful questions about our identity. There is no shoddy foundation, no hidden variable affecting real equations, and a thorough investigation of the house /will/ tell you if the construction crew did a good job.

I probably misunderstood your examples from earlier, but to keep this conversation from spiraling out of control in scope I'll just drop that specific line of topic. Right now, we're talking primarily about understanding identity and consciousness. Also, I have to go to sleep, so I likely won't be able to respond again for a good few hours.
