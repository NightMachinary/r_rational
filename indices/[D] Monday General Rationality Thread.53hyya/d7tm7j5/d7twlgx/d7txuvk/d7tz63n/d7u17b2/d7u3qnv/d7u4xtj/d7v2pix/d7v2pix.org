What I'm trying to say isn't really about mysticism. In a sense, I could even accept mysticism. If you said that there's 'energies' in the air and that they influence my emotions, while I might not jump to agree with you, I wouldn't see it as inconsistent. What would be happening there isn't a hidden variable affecting meaningful understandings of life and death, what would be happening there is a non-physical, but still visible, variable affecting a factor which in turn affects our understanding of philosophical questions about the mind.

What I'm trying to say is that if you took me apart and created two clones identical to me before disassembly, that our questions of 'did I die?' or 'what are the identities of these two clones?' can't be dependent on something invisible. Mystic stuff, if it exists, would count as visible in how you could 'sense' it and it would affect your brain like your chemical balance does. But some quality that, ultimately, has no affect on our physical state cannot be a crucial factor in a question of identity or life and death.
