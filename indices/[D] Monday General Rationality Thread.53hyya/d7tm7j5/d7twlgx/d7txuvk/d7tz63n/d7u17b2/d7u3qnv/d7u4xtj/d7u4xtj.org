Ok so to address your first paragraph: I think you can /easily/ make a case for people being wrong about their past subjective experiences /because of the stuff I mentioned about memory/. If someone says they don't experience /anything/ during /any/ part of sleep (not that I'm claiming that's your position) then they're demonstrably wrong. I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say here. What part of my position do you think involves any mysticism or other magical thinking? I should make it clear that I am very much a hard determinist, materialist and even a nihilist by most standards.\\
BTW for no reason I'd like to link this talk on free will by Sam Harris because even though I was already a determinist going in I still found it extremely brilliant and novel, it also demolishes the idea of free will being compatible with determinism: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCofmZlC72g&index=13&list=PL8Fthy2NnpXnfkcXztLkNSTbAz6JhzA0s]]

I should probably go to sleep as well so for now maybe watch that amazing talk and get back to me tommorow
