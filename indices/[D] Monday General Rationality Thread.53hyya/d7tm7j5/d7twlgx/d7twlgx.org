To me, the most glaring problem with the 'sleep must mean death' is that it sound prescriptive instead of descriptive. It sounds like saying that, even though people cry at funerals but not at bedtime, that you should really cry at bedtime because the two are no different. Whenever I hear something like that, it sets off warning bells to the tune of 'you're trying to force one thing to mean the same thing as something else, and there's evidence to the contrary.'

At the same time, the 'clone teleportation' concept brings up a different issue. If you take the same pattern of atoms and construct it the same way multiple times, neither instance is 'not a person', but they stop being the same person. What I'm trying to get at is what I'm thinking of as a 'soul' assumption of identity. Not in the sense that a soul literally exists and identity stems from that, but that the identity is like a soul with respect to how it is a discrete value that persists from birth to death. If you hold this assumption, anything that interferes with the identity must be a 'death'. If you deconstruct a person in a teleporter and simultaneously reconstruct them twice in two different places, it's obvious that something has happened to the identity. Even if both clones gain the same identity, they must immediately diverge, so something must have happened. Therefore, death.

Something I've been considering, as a way of framing things, is the notion of every time you refer to someone, write their name, speak it, think it, every reference to their identity, it came with a timestamp. "Greg [April 1, 2006] didn't like that prank so much." It would help get past the idea that they're exactly the same person as they were back then. You aren't like you were as a child, if an identical replica of your childhood best friend as they were back then met you today, even disregarding the physical differences of your grownup age they wouldn't see the same person as your past self. The perspective I'm looking for, I think, is identity not as a soul that persists from birth to death, but a continuous spectrum of 'who you are' and 'what you're like'. An infinite sequence of births and deaths with every passing moment that adds information to your brain or memory that passes out of your grasp.

So why would we cry at funerals? Why do we feel like our identity is a constant, a soul of sorts that makes me the same person from birth to death? Well, imagine your friend nowadays. Each time you see him, he's a little bit different. He woke up differently, knows some new things and forgot some old things, but he's close enough to the person he was yesterday that it really makes no difference. We adjust to the incredibly minor differences and are calibrated for the next minuscule change in our next meeting. If you meet up with a friend you haven't seen since childhood, and they're all grown up and you're all grown up, the differences are much greater and you don't feel like they're the same person you played at recess with.

If it's an infinite sequence of births and deaths, those are hardly the right terms to describe it. They carry too much weight, make us think we should be feeling things we have no obligation to feel. It's better, I think, to use 'beginnings and ends', since those are general enough to not demand reactions from us. Your childhood self is ended, your best friend's childhood self is ended. Yesterday's you ended, tomorrow's you will begin after you wake up. These are all different identities, regardless of the shared memories, and your friend from your teenage years might feel melancholy about the you and him back then, those ended identities that were so different from today's you and him that it feels like a little death for those identities to not exist nowadays.

If you are deconstructed in a teleporter, and reconstructed twice simultaneously, each version of you diverges in identity. One may discover a fascination for a new genre of music, another may fall in love with a certain type of food. The composition of what 'makes you you' diverges, and so do their identities. But this isn't a death for deconstructed you any more than teenage you died as you slowly became adult. If one clone stays in the same life and the other goes to a Mars colony for a new life, to anyone else in your original setting it's like nothing happened. Your best friend still sees the you ever so slightly different from how you were yesterday, everyone else you know recognizes the same 'identity' because 2016 you hasn't died like 2015 you died, and like 2014 you died, and so on. We cry at funerals because instead of a minuscule change every day, where you can look a thousand days back and say 'what a different person' and feel like a little death has happened, real, funeral-type death is an abrupt change from 'everything that makes you you' to a lump of flesh, and nothing more.

Truth be told, I couldn't say I properly understood half of all that until I set about trying to tell you what I thought, but that's basically how I view identity these days. Not as an immutable 'soul' with your name on it from birth to death, but a continuous spectrum of little changes each day that result in the end of old identities and the beginning of new identities, as if every time someone referred to you, the mention came with a time stamp of what you they're talking about. Well, now that I've said all that, what do you think about the concept I rambled around in this horridly long post?
