Well I think the example regarding EM's isn't actually a problem because I don't think updates would necessarily occur like that. I don't think whichever process or processes are vital for experience are as simple as just an on off switch or anything, different parts might be shut off during updates but I doubt you would need to shut off the whole thing at once; effectively I think updates could likely occur more like continuous uploading than destructive uploading.\\
Basically the em scenario is only going to be a problem if you are running a system where you shut the programs down while they're updating, and it assumes there would be any purpose to updating the experiential core (or whatever it is) anyway.

  Thirdly, your theory seems to assume that physical time is continuous, but this is not known to be the case. Some theories of physics suggest that physics works more like a computer in this respect: That time is not continuous, but increases incrementally, one Planck Time at a time. If these theories are true, then we die every moment of our existence, even if not in a simulation.

Well that would only be a problem within particular models, however I have some doubt of the plausibility of any computer-like models like that. For one time doesn't really have absolute simultaneity and whether an event happened before another event isn't something that can be agreed upon between reference frames. Sure time likely has a minimum theoretical span, however in most circumstances it's going to be really bizarre and fuzzy; different parts of the experiential process are likely going to have occurred at slightly different times relative to each other.\\
The thing is i'm not sure the idea you put forth is /even coherent/ in reality, it may only apply to a newtonian model of the universe without relativity or quantum mechanics. The thing is whether time is continuous may not really be a meaningful question at the most fundamental levels of reality; so I can't really guess /what/ that means for my model.
