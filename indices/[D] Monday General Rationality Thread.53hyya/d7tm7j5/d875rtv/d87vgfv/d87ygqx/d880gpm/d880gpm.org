Ok regarding ems: I meant that if the update is happening staggered then there's not necessarily a problem. But I'm not imagining a whole brain emulation where you're just simulating the individual particles and they do nothing except when they get updated. Such a process would seem a incredibly inefficient way to simulate a mind anyway.

I'm imagining a system where any momentary halts will happen localized and staggered enough that you can't say the total system is ever stopped at a given time. At the same time you might also say there's always updates happening at any given period of time so things are also continuous in that sense.

As for the stuff about quantized time; I'm not sure how a system where time ticks along by quantized amounts universally would actually be coherent given relativity. Not to mention not every part of the process that experiences is going to be totally coordinated if that's the case, different parts will tick by at slightly different rates and will have to tick at different times.\\
So even with that variety of quantized time you might get out of the problem by the fact the halts to the process are staggered over the system meaning the whole thing never actually halts.\\
Plus there's something of a problem saying that things ever pause and unpause that way, because unless you have some external reference frame that doesn't even really have a clear meaning.

But to clarify I think planck times are likely similar to planck lengths. In that at the most basic levels you would expect lots of superpositions and for things to be fuzzy; in a similar way to the way location and distance is already fuzzy within quantum phenomenon.
