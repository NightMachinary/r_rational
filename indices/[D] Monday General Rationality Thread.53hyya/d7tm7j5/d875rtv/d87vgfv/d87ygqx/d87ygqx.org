For what it's worth, I have a B.S. and an abiding interest in Physics, and I've done a lot of undergrad-level reading about fundamental theories. There may be some reason that's over my head why what I proposed does not work exactly as I described. However, it does seem that a lot of people who know much more about fundamental physics than I do consider something that is /basically/ what I described to be possible. As for the bit about quantized time (or perhaps the quantization of time being equal and truly simultaneous throughout the universe; I couldn't tell what you were referring to here) only being coherent in Newtonian models, I can assure you that's false. If you don't trust my expertise, however, you can do your own research. It's quite interesting.

Regarding the computer and ems: I'm not talking about uploading, updating firmware, or shutting anything off. I'm talking about how computers work. If you emulate a brain, then you have a copy of that brain's entire state, down to the molecular (or atomic, if necessary) level, in the computer's memory. When the brain-process is "running," that means the processor is going around to virtual molecules and updating their virtual positions and momenta according to the appropriate laws of physics. (This is what I meant by "updating.") That's what brain-emulation means. The processor is not infinitely fast, so some finite time passes between one change made by the processor and the next. During that time, the brain that exists in the computer's memory is just sitting there, existing, unchanging.

Now, you've said that if a brain emulation were to be frozen or paused for some time, and later resumed from the same state, this is discontinuity (and therefore death) under your theory. It turns out that the difference between a brain emulation which runs with the full resources and attention of its processor and the pause-unpause scenario is a difference of the duration of the pause, and not a difference in essential kind. This doesn't depend on any weird assumptions about physics, or details of software implementation. It's even true any reasonable choice (and most unreasonable choices) of hardware. If there are brain emulations, and they run on computers, this will be true for them.

This puts you on the horns of a dilemma: Either ems experience death in every moment that they experience anything, or the pause-unpause scenario isn't actually death. You can take the first horn (bite the bullet) or the second (refine or replace your model). I don't particularly care which you take. I just thought you would appreciate knowing that this is where your assumptions--as currently set forth--lead. Especially since you asked for criticism. That's all.
