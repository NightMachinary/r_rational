My immediate feeling is a sense of indignation at the cruel will that would kill so many for no decent reason. I might defy fate just for that.

Then I thought you might go back a bit further and evacuate the town before it's destroyed. Dunno how Fate would like that, but maybe the people could be saved, even if the buildings are toast.
