A couple of weeks ago, [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/519svm/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d7anofx][asked me]],

  Sounds like you're part of the 5-20% of the population that's immune to exercise. Why are you still trying?

As of today, I have a new answer:

Another of the reasons I was, and am, still trying, is that I was not very confident that I /am/ "immune to exercise".

I've been keeping track - and while I'm starting from near-zero, and my progress is near-zero, it isn't /actually/ zero. Today, I was able to perform a ridiculously minor feat which I wasn't able to do two weeks ago. (Hold my weight up on a pull-up bar for 1 second, more than once.)

There's an old engineer's saying that the difference from 0 to 1 is much larger than the distance from 1 to 2. I am no longer at '0'. The rest is just working out the details of how to maximize the slope.
