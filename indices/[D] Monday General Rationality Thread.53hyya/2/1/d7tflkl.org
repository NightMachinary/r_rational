I'd talk to the GM, ask them to put in some subtle challenges that can't be beaten by rolls alone. Ideally non-fatal ones that leave the others time to learn. I don't think this counts as unfair meta, because GMs are supposed to consult players about how things are going. And make a point to show them how fun this is. One of my funnest campaigns was as a lawful-evil combat-averse Negotiator Bard. I made it look fun, so a couple of them made similar characters for our next game.
