Mostly, I see this with players that are more interested in the combat side of D&D, and much less interested in roleplay. They'll be super into the planning for a fight (or the fight itself) against a dread lich and its armies, but in the King's Court afterward when they're presented with their rewards they're checked out again (at least, until the loot gets rolled).

Are you sure the other players you're with are INTERESTED in that kind of D&D experience? Or are you taking up the mantle of leader because no one else wants to do it, and you're just willing. The kind of campaign the GM is running may just not be the kind of campaign the other players want to have.
