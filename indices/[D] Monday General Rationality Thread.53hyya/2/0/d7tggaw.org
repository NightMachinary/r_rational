The most important thing about this kind of situation is not to be adversarial. You're all playing together, and you should all be honest with each other if you are to have fun. So don't try to game the other players, set them up and/or punish them for not doing what you want, ESPECIALLY if you're the GM.

Otherwise, this is something you should talk about, first with the GM, then with the other players. Try to get on the Same Page, understand why they're playing the game and what they expect of it. If all they want is mindless violence and dungeon looting, your expectations might be too different for you to enjoy a game together.

If the other players are open to more roleplaying, try to get the GM to encourage it, with diplomacy hooks in combat encounters (that can be as simple as having a goblin about to be stabbed by your rogue beg for mercy, making things evolve into a hostage situation with its friends) and other incentives. If the "responsibility" still ends up on your shoulders most of the time, the GM should probably try to focus more on setting up a dialogue with other players, and give them personal incentives for good roleplaying (this merchant has the item your mage needs, but he wants something in exchange that the mage isn't ready to do / give; what to do?).
