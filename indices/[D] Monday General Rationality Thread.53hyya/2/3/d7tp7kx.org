The real question is why you're not playing a better RPG.

But in response to your question, you've just gotta talk it over with the GM and the other players to find out what they're trying to get out of the game. You can't force them to be super into the game if they don't want to be. It might just be that you need to find a different group if you're not getting what you want out of the game.
