One thing I'd like to try some time is a campaign where the players' preferences are explicitly stated before the game. Either everyone goes off the rails, or everyone engages with the story, or everyone agrees to treat it like a board game.

I also want to try an alignment matched campaign. All the ones I've done so far have been kinda same-y in the way that if you add every spice in the cupboard to something, you won't get an interesting flavour. I get that the conflict between a ruthless action and a just action can be interesting, but I think most interesting debates happen between people who agree on a lot, so the within-party conflict would benefit from players having similar outlooks.
