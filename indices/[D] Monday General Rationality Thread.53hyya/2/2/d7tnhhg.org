Your problem sounds like an engagement issue. I've experienced this from all three sides: as a GM dealing with unruly players, as an unruly player in a game, and as an exasperated player in a game with a bunch of unruly players, and it's definitely one of the most difficult problems to solve in a tabletop game.

From the unruly player's perspective, the issue is disconnect. They don't care about the outcome of the conflicts in the game, either because they just aren't particularly interested in the plot or because they don't feel their actions matter. This usually means that they either take a backseat (making their actions matter even less), start treating the game as a board game (avoiding the elements that bore them in favour of a more impactful pure-mechanics experience), or deliberately derail the game (making them more engaged because their actions have a noticeable impact, but at the same time making the disconnect even worse).

I've tried a few solutions, mostly trying to filter for people more likely to start and stay engaged, but none of them have really worked. Broadly speaking, I think it's mostly about making the connection between action and consequence as clear as possible. What definitely does /not/ work is forcing the players to engage by punishing lack of it, either by forcing roleplaying encounters or by directly punishing failure to roleplay.
