I had a dream once that as you slip through the event horizon of a black hole atoms experience absolute zero instantly, and you're frozen in time. Don't know how relevant this is, but it has always been my theory that getting to absolute zero as rapidly as possible is the best way to freeze, and maintain the integrity of cells.
