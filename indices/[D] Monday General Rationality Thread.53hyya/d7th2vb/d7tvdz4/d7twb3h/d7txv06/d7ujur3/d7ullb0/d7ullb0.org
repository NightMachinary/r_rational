I know about the ice crystals, but what I'm talking about is absolute zero in respect to atomic motion. I know that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says you really can't stop atomic motion, so its all theory, speculation, dreaming. I was talking about getting an atom so cold it loses it's energy which could potentially alter it's wave function and stop reactions like forming ice crystals. Like I said, this is just my theory, which is one of many theories about freezing humans. I bet the most likely secret to freezing people lies in tardigrades.
