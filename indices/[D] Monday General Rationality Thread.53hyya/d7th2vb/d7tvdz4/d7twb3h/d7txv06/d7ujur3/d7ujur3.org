No actually. Speeding up the process of freezing will be equally damaging as doing it slowly. The issue with freezing cells is that ice first forms as tiny crystals, which then grow to rip and destroy the cells. Speeding up the process will have the same effect (flash freezing someone is fatal regardless of all the super-villains in cartoons with a freeze-gun). You need certain enzymes which act as an antifreeze to keep the ice crystals small and from damaging the cells.
