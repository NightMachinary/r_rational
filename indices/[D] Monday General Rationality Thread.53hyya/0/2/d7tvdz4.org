I didn't read your text, but one of the things that has kept me from being a cryonicist is that I don't know if it'll actually work. I have no reason to believe that it is possible to revive someone after having their body frozen, it's just a conjecture based on a hypothesis of what consciousness is. I don't know if my theory of mind is correct, but I have no reason to abandon it.

As it is, I can't help but see attempts to undo death as selfish and vain. If evidence comes forward to change my definition of life and death, then I may see cryonics as a technique to preserve life, but I currently see it as wasteful and kind of repulsive. I know it isn't rational to think so, but I can't help the way I feel.
