I am still really, really suspicious of this girl. Hector is apparently such an open book, and it hasn't come up until now? He never realized it ever, over the course of his entire life? Paris never teased him about it? His dad never told him to work on his poker face?

Nah. I mean, he probably is pretty easy to read, but this is going beyond mind-reading. Everything about the way this girl is portrayed points very, very firmly in the direction of mind reading. And now, just when he was perhaps suspicious enough to go home and spend a night Viewing her past to corroborate her story, she finds a way to make him not only no do that, but also take her to his house?

From a paranoid point of view, this is getting a bit ridiculous. Its all in character, true, but the extent to which Hector is risking everything by his reluctance to just spend some time Viewing this girl is stressing me out.

Excellent chapter! Though perhaps you could go a bit more into detail on why Hector is so reluctant to use his power on Kimberly, when he uses it so freely on everyone else he deals with?
