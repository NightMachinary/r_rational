Think of it like a game or a contest, not an experiment. It makes a lot more sense that way.

If you're asking from a roleplaying/fiction perspective what the point of a guard is (rather than just keeping the AI safely in the box without anyone able to let him out), there are a few plausible reasons. It might be that the guard is there as a compromise between the side that wants the AI to be let out of the box and the side that wants to keep it in (or preferably, destroy it). Alternately, the "guard" is actually a scientist who is charged with gaining information about the AI.

But for the purposes of the game, it doesn't really matter. I personally think that the mistake a lot of AIs (and sometimes guards) make is to try to develop the roleplaying aspects of it too much - you only have about two hours, and setting up a lot of background information doesn't really seem that conducive. But I don't know what a (good) winning game looks like.
