I understand it's a contest, but I think the set-up does matter. If as a guard, I know I'm placed in front of an AI that people smarter and more experienced than me have deemed not safe and my job is to keep it contained, that's one thing. On the other hand, if my primary task is something quite different and I am only in the role of a guard because I am close to the AI, I'll be much less inclined to just say "Nope!"
