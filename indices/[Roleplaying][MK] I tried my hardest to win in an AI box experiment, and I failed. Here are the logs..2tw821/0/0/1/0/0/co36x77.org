The ruleset says that the gatekeeper can't simply walk away - they have to stay engaged the whole way through, and can't end the game before the time limit is up. If the AI player were able to make the gatekeeper violate the rules of the game like that, I suppose from a certain point of view you /might/ count that as a win for the AI ... but it takes a very deliberate reading of the rules to get to that point, and I don't think it's a strategy that you would try until you'd exhausted everything else.
