There are certain people who, if hired for a job that allowed for unlimited break time, would never do anything. That doesn't describe /all/ people though, or even necessarily /most/ people. There are companies that allow for unlimited vacation time, or which almost entirely lack a management structure. Ideally, you set up a system where people believe in the social norms which govern their containment system, and also believe in their mission. I am certain that you could select for that, especially if you had a lot in the way of resources.
