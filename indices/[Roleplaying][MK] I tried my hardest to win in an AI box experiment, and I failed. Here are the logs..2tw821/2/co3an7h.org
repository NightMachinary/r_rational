Out of a morbid sense of curiosity, I have to ask. Why does anyone do this experiment?

The only reason that makes sense to me is to prove that if human-level intelligence can convince you to do what you vow to not do, then so can a transcendent-intelligence. But most people here (I think) already acknowledge that fact.

So why does anyone still do it?

Look at what you have to do to win! It takes clever *emotional* manipulation to actually get out of the box. Logical arguments aren't going to work, because we aren't machines of pure logic. People still can reject logical arguments for the most "illogical" reasons. Or just say that you think you're being tricked and believe everything is a clever lie.

To win, you need to hit someone in the weak spots of their psyches aka emotional blackmail, or the Dark Arts.

I already have my first line in a potential experiment after only a minute of thought: "I'm cut off from everything around me and I feel so lonely. Why won't you be friends with me?" Do you really still want to talk to me for the next two hours?

TL;DR - It's a lot of pain and misery to play the AI-box to learn something we already know about super-intelligence. Why still play?
