That's a very good comparison. The king has immediate power of life or death over the vizier's daughter, whose only tool is her ability to talk and convince him to let her live. All he has to do is decide to execute her, and she's dead. All the gatekeeper has to do is read the text and every minute or so say "I don't let you out".
