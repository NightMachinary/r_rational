Thanks for that explanation. I was having trouble coming up with alternate hypotheses for why and should have considered basic human psychology about secrets.

Of course now that I've read that you are curious about being a gatekeeper, I kinda want to see how you would do against me which completely contradicts my earlier thoughts of never wanting to play the game. I guess I still have a while to go in building up a good model of my own mind. ;)
