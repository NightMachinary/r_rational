Skimming through your post history you look pretty easy to make emotional. I could probably say something cruel about your genetic predisposition to mental things or something nice about the other mental thing.

I won't because it's cruel, but yeah, you look easy to bully and induce emotion in.

That's a lot of what the challenge is about. You research the target and find weak points. Most of us have public reddit histories.
