Some of the nuclear launch codes launch nuclear missiles of love and healing and joy and people obviously want to get them.

It's a bit like any science. A better analogy would be genetic engineering. Should we ban genetically engineered crops because potentially they could result in a grey goo scenario?

Plus, if this AI can be made, others will be made too. Do you trust this AI less than the one made by simon the serial killer down the street that he programmed to kill all humans?

It's not obviously an easy question.
