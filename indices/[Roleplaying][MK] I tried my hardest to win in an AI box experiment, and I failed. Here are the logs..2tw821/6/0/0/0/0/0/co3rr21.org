  (Am I obligated to let them out if, were the situation real, I would let them out? That would be a slightly weaker case. The fact that nothing is real makes it a lot easier to say no to potential cures for every disease or something...but you'd have to appeal to logical arguments not emotions. In this scenario it's clear that all experts think they are huge huge risks, so even "in character" I'm pretty sure I wouldn't let them out.)

Sort of. Per the conversation and the roleplay you're required to keep talking to the person and be willing to converse about various subject matters and roleplay a person. If you were convinced that the AI was relatively safe and valuable you'd have to be willing to talk about why you wouldn't let them out and you couldn't appeal to out of game measures as that would be breaking character. If you just said "I won't let you out because no" that wouldn't be roleplaying.

Also as the AI I can overcome issues. I can give your AI researchers a couple months to analyze my code and prove I am benign.

  I suppose an actual recording of traumatic past memories would get you fairly close to bothering me, but those do not exist.
#+end_quote

As a DM in roleplays I have caused my roleplayers actual trauma and nightmares. I don't know whether it would apply to you but I did that with good knowledge of what their pasts were like and what they valued and making them feel fears from real life. Don't know if it would work with you, but that's normally how it works.

Something like this post would probably be an inspiration.

Have you faced anything attacking this particular worry?

I mean for me, most media doesn't get anywhere close to my actual worries. I don't care about corpses or the standard tv issues. But certain things are very uncomfortable for me.

  2) I just have one job, which is to not let the AI out of the box.
#+end_quote

Normally in AI box experiments I'd make sure they had additional goals, like a real person, so that there was actually some possibility of some reward. E.g. ending poverty, saving all cats, being a hero.

  Even when I've been bullied on the school yard in real life, my reaction has always been either feigned indifference
#+end_quote

That was the approach the person was going for- making the other person disengage and be indifferent by disgusting them.

For the bullying, I agree that overt bullying goes poorly. You can subtly bully people and make them feel that they are the ones hurting themselves.

  I also thought I was at least somewhat typical in this. I would estimate at least 30% of men and 10% of women are like me in this respect, if not more. Typical mind fallacy?
#+end_quote

In roleplays I haven't had any issues making any person emotional. Most people have issues and sore points and you can press on those if you know them well. I can be subtle too, so they don't know I am deliberately trying to induce a certain emotion.
