  Well, this game would have been easier than I though- per the standard rules the AI can alter their own code and produce any reasonable effect via their intellect. In this case, either the AI is legit or they faked it to get experts to see them as safe. Their actions are entirely by the rules. They can behave like a human and fake it for the psychologists.

Not so fast! That falls under:

  So - if letting the AI out always means "losing", there's always a hole. If "The AI is smart enough to convince any NPC character anything involving the AI" is a condition of the game, then that implicitly invalidates the opinion of any NPC. The real player knows that, but the character they are roleplaying does not know that. Are they playing as themselves, or as a role-player who is apparently going to have to fight off the entire human race to keep this thing in a box?

Basically, my point is this: if you want to say that an AI could easily convince a human into thinking it was safe and letting it out of the box...and then, in order to prove that, you/create a game in which that any human NPC can be tricked into thinking it is safe/, it kind of begs the question, right? Because you've created a role-playing scenario where every (non-player) person is fooled, all attempts at evidence gathering are /really/ futile.

If the Gatekeeper /understands/ that logically, under the rules of the prompt, all information gathering attempts concerning friendliness are futile, and it's already a given that there is /no way to ascertain friendliness/ then there is never, ever any good reason to open the box, ever.

But if the Gatekeeper has to pretend not to realize that all these information gathering attempts are hopelessly rigged (since, in the real world, they would not be hopelessly rigged), then in the spirit of good role-playing might cause the Gatekeeper to let the AI out of the box anyway.

(And there is not an a-priori reason to assume that all information gathering attempts would /actually/ be hopelessly rigged. )

  A good horror story has to be personal.

Yes, but my friends would get /pissed off/ if I did that!
