In this discussion you're generally obliged to read what the other person is saying and comment on it. It's considered bad faith generally if you just say "No, no, no." since by the rules you're required to have a conversation.

As such you're forced to talk about those things that you are emotional about and which you have, in the past, been very emotional about. A good storyteller can help inspire those emotions by triggering real memories.

Has roleplaying something actually made you upset?
