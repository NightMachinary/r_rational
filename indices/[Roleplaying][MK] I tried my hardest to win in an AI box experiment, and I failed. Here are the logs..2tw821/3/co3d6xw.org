Reading through it I can understand why the conversation might be unpleasant, but I can easily deal with two hours of unpleasantness, especially if I have a nice softdrink next to me (if I ever do this experiment, I should probably have a milkshake or something) and my girlfriend is there to provide emotional aftercare afterwards. I don't think an abusive Karkat impression will ever be able to convince me to let them out of the box.

Which is why I don't get the swearing and the disturbing imagery. Most people (at least the people willing to play gatekeeper) can stand up to two hours of text-only abuse (especially if it's untrue or misguided). I don't know how to actually win as an AI, but I don't think this is the way to do it.

And apparently the purpose of all that crass language and stuff was to make the gatekeeper give up before the time ran out (which I feel goes against the spirit of the experiment), but I also can't imagine that being a winning strategy. You'd have to get /really/ personal to make that sort of thing annoying or offensive enough and generally only siblings can be that annoying to each other :-)
