Yeah, if I were building an AI box, part of the protocol would be that guards are able to bow out whenever they want, even in the middle of their shift, if they feel that they're getting worked up. Free counseling, time to cool down, videogames to play, etc. In the AI box game, you can't even swap /the same/ guard, since the guard isn't allowed a break to cool off. This is by design to make the game easier for the AI.
