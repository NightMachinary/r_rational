I think this is a problem with the set-up of the experiment. It doesn't make sense to me for the AI to be talking to a guard whose only interest is to not let out the AI; why bother having the guard there in the first place? Rather, I'd expect the person talking to the AI to be a researcher, and for him to talk to it with a goal (such as understanding it better, or getting some answers from it).
