Everyone seems to think it's all "intense".

I must be [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/5rs/the_aliens_have_landed/][General Thud]] or something. I don't think there is any combination of word a total stranger who can't /really/ effect me could write that could make me feel anything with intensity. There's nothing difficult about pigheadedly saying "nope, nope, nope, not letting you out..." when nothing true is at stake. It would always feel like a game, and why would you voluntarily lose a game?
