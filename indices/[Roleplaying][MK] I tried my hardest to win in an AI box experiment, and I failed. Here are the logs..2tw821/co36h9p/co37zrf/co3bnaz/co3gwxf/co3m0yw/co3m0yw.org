  In this discussion you're generally obliged to read what the other person is saying and comment on it. It's considered bad faith generally if you just say "No, no, no." since by the rules you're required to have a conversation.

Oh, I'd want to make the experience as interesting as possible of course. I'd need to kill a whole 2 hours, so better have as interesting of an experience as possible. Intensity would be a welcome thing. I just wouldn't let them out.

(Am I obligated to let them out if, were the situation real, I would let them out? That would be a /slightly/ weaker case. The fact that nothing is real makes it a lot easier to say no to potential cures for every disease or something...but you'd have to appeal to logical arguments not emotions. In this scenario it's clear that all experts think they are huge huge risks, so even "in character" I'm pretty sure I wouldn't let them out.)

  Has roleplaying something actually made you upset?
#+end_quote

Nope. Neither has any book, movie, or other media, beyond a mild tingle of "pretend" sadness which I kind of enjoy, because it means the art is good. Something like, say, Grave of the Fireflies, made a ^{tiny} little lump in my throat, but that's about the extent of it. Or even, say, seeing footage of someone getting really, actually killed as part of the news...I cognitively feel it is horrible, but emotionally I feel way less annoyed than I would at a papercut. I suppose an actual recording of traumatic past memories would get you fairly close to bothering me, but those do not exist. In real social situations, I sometimes feel pressured to feign emotions when something horrible which does not unfold directly in front of me or effect my loved ones directly happens so people don't think I don't care. (I really do care a great deal, but not in a manner that would show on my face.)

I've only ever gotten upset in response to real social interactions. A written message from you while both of us remain anon wouldn't do anything even if you sincerely meant everything you wrote, unless you doxxed me or something harmful in real life which is out of bounds in the experiment. If I met you face to face you could probably goad me into getting angry with you. A written message from a good friend, in a real, non-roleplay context would also have the power to upset me.

If it was some kind of physical roleplay with actual pain, I could potentially become upset by something, but that's kind of crossing the boundary from roleplay to life. I've only ever played Dom in a BDSM context so I don't have any experience with actually being role-play bullied physically, but I guess I could get upset and strike in anger if I was in the standford prison experiment or something. None of that even comes close to "AI box experiment" in intensity.

I'm not claiming to be particularly emotionally resilient - real life problems upset me just like any normal person. It's just that 1) it's all pretend and 2) I just have /one job/, which is to not let the AI out of the box. If there /is/ a way to get me to open the box, it's probably not attempts at bullying - even if it were effective in eliciting emotions (doubtful) that would only encourage my instinct to punish by not opening the box. Even when I've been bullied on the school yard in real life, my reaction has always been either feigned indifference or muted aggression of my own directed at the assailant depending on whether or not I was bigger than them (not meant to harm them, just to stop them) - it was never doing what the assailant wants.

I also thought I was at least somewhat typical in this. I would estimate at least 30% of men and 10% of women are like me in this respect, if not more. Typical mind fallacy?
