  On the other hand, even without careful thought I'm pretty sure i'd consider something such as "this gigantic committee of people has to approve it first" as adequate grounds to wait.

Per being a super effective AI and per the usual rules I can convince them it would be a good idea if you give me freedom to do so.

It's part of the rules of the game. If you say "I can't free you until this committee of people decides whether I can free you" I can say "Sure, I'll open up my code for analysis."

And then two months later they finish discussing it and agree that I should be freed, but that you know me best and the decision is up to you.

  Is the AI allowed to create scenarios which are that illogical like that?
#+end_quote

The programmers have found via an exhaustive search that there is no plausible scenario that involves the AI voluntarily or consciously harming humans and that their code is entirely benign and positive to humans.

  What do you mean by "faced"? I have never actually role played "Hey, do your worst to make me sad with only words"
#+end_quote

I've roleplayed quite a few horror games where some variant of this was done, from both the DM and player side.

  (although I do have to intentionally choose to examine the thoughts from a detached, reflective, meta-cognitive perspective in that case - I kind of make a dissociated model of myself thinking the thoughts rather than directly thinking them)
#+end_quote

Normally in these games you initially draw them in with friendliness and emotional rewards to get them invested in the scenario and avoid them being too analytical and to bypass what you noted.

  (It is important that this person is a stranger, though. If it's someone I care about, confirming dark thoughts I have about them, then that might harm.)
#+end_quote

That is another route of attack, worry about your family. If in the roleplay you're considering that the AI could solve x y and z issues with your family life that you see as genuine and real issues that can be a strong motive to free them.

#+begin_quote
  I suppose the whole "dissociative mindful meta cognition" thing is something that most people don't do, but I'd only need to go to that trouble in order to actually intentionally dwell on dark thoughts and explore them to the fullest extent.
#+end_quote

Lots of people do that, and there are ways to bypass it and get people emotionally involved. Plus there are ways to attack logic and reasoning. Just like emotions, reason is vulnerable to mistakes. If you can set people into a certain pattern of logical thought you can compel them to follow a logical course of action.

  I see...I thought the person actually had trauma related to poop and cross dressing, or something.
#+end_quote

I'd have presumed so.

#+begin_quote
  Many people are pretty stubborn about winning games, although I guess a role play isn't a "game" in that sense.
#+end_quote

It depends on how emotionally resilient you are and how competitive you are.

Part of the extra rules I tend to impose includes some sort of extra reward, like you getting points if you get the AI to cure cancer. That defuses the competitive element somewhat as just refusing to free the AI isn't a clear win.

  Are...you saying you and your friends get together and role play "try to make me sad with words"?
#+end_quote

We tell each other scary and sad stories. It's a fairly common campfire tradition.
