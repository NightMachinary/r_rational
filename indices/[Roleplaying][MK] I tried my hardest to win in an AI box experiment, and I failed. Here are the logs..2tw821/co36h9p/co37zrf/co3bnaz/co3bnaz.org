Oh I didn't mean I don't have emotions - I do, just like everyone else. Just that they couldn't actually be anonymously triggered to the point that I'd do something I pre-committed not to do. You could prob. say things related to negative stuff in my life I've mentioned, but emotions in anonymous interactions are kind of pale shadows of the real thing. (If reading something /actually/ makes me upset, that would be a useful signal, but it has never happened before)
