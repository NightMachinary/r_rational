That raises an interesting question...from his perspective, he thinks I am easy to bully. So it might be mildly unethical for him to say something that might potentially upset me (or at least, it would be a cost benefit trade).

From my perspective, I did say that there was no combination of words that a stranger could say to truly upset, so it would be ridiculous for me to be upset with him. (I'm not at all upset, of course.)

It's basically a question of how much you trust people to know themselves. I obviously trust myself, but can he trust me to trust myself? It is a philosophical problem worth solving, given the importance of informed consent in legal matters. Is "Person is insufficiently self aware to know what they prefer" adequate reason to waive informed consent? We certainly seem to think so for children...
