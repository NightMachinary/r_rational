Honestly, I think that a large part of it is the secrecy that surrounds it. The decision not to release the logs makes some sense, but it leaves a lot of people (myself included) thinking that there must be some kind of trick involved beyond just arguments or emotional manipulation. I can't imagine myself losing the game, which makes me inclined to play the game as the gatekeeper, in case there's something that I'm missing.

For people who want to play the AI, it's a challenge against another person that might be seen as proving skill in either cleverness or manipulation or both. It's something that you can brag about to people later. Of course, I have no desire to play as the AI, so I'm mostly guessing here.
