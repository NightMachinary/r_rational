I think it's just a form of hypnotic/placebo/suggestion effect. Some people buy into the idea that they will be convinced and compelled to be let it out, and then they do. In another life, these are the same people that might be taken by the Holy Ghost or whatever. I bet people who go into it insisting it will not work on them find that the outcome fulfills their expectations as well.

That doesn't make it less real, but still.
