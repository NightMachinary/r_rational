No. The story is set in a more fleshed-out world, for instance with actual geography, and diverges wildly. What I mean is that there are many key events in canon which also happen in the fic, for instance in book 1:

- Adora is captured, becomes She-Ra, defects during a battle in a place called Thaymor
- They go to Salineas, and there's a Horde attack
- Glimmer is kidnapped at the ball in Snows, and they Princesses come together in a rescue mission

All of these things happen both in my story and canon.

What I am writing is something meant to evoke familiarity: you might know where it's going but you want to see my spin on it. The world is different, but recognizable, the characters are mostly the same, etc.

I hope that explains it.
