I never claimed this was explicitly rational, just that the demographics here might find it interesting.

In fact I have found that stories with explicitly rational protagonists bore me to read, and annoy me to write. Real people, even smart ones, are dumb as fuck, and that makes them all the more charming, IMO.

What I am presenting here is hard fantasy, a frank look at war as a concept, and the characters we know and love, doing the things we know and love.
