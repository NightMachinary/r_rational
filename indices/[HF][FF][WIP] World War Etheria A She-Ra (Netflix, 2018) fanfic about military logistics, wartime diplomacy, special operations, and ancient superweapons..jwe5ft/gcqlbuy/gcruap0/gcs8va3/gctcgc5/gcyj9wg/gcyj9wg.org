Ah, I feel that. I /do/ like characters who are intelligent enough, but who have flawed /preferences, motivations, and cached beliefs./ And who may be prone to mental-illness-y things like unfounded social anxiety, or inattention to detail. To me, those don't make the story or the character any less /rational/ --- it just means their attempts at rationality are being played on hard mode. :)

Usually, though---at least in serious, literary fiction---such characters are considered to have a /fatal character flaw/, and stories starring such characters are usually tragedies. Such stories are /very/ unsatisfying to me personally.

Meanwhile, the rational-fiction take on characters like this is more-often-than-not a redemption arc, where they slowly learn to be better to themselves and to others. (E.g. the protagonist of /Worth the Candle/.)

I guess I'm a sucker for the starting-from-the-bottom equivalent of competence porn. "Climbing out of a rut"-porn?
