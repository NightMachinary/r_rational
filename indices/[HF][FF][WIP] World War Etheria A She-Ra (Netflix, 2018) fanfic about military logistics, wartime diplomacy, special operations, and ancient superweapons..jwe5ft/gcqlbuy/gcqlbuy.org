For anyone reading this thread, do note: In my opinion a lot of the appeal of rational fiction is taking a very similar starting point and watching it diverge wildly. Characters make entirely new mistakes that are hard to see coming, rather than mistakes you can see a mile away and scream at them not to do. Characters that have intelligence boosts use them to make plans that are better thought out and more interesting.

In this fic...there's none of that. To quote the author from the other thread, it is the same as canon, "plot-beat for plot-beat". I'm up to date and I'm still going to finish it but I doubt I'd have started it if I'd known in advance that every single mistake the characters in canon make, every single important event, I already knew going in.
