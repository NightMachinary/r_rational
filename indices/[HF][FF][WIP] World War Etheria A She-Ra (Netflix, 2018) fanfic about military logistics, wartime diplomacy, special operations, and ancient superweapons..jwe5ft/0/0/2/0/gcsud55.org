There are things that are different, but all of the main events are the same. Spoilers for canon and this fic I suppose, but all of the following happen in the same order in both:

Adora finding the sword, deserting in Thaymor, offering Catra a chance to join her and being rejected

Catra capturing Bow and Glimmer at Princess Prom, Adora leading the Princess Alliance to rescue them, Glimmer losing her powers

Adora and Catra fighting in the north with the First Ones data virus thingy

Catra being exiled to the Crimson Waste, almost becoming happy there, then upon learning Shadow Weaver defected to Bright Moon rejoining the Horde in anger

Adora convincing Entrapta not to open the portal, Catra betraying Entrapta, sending her to Beast Island, and opening the portal anyway. Queen Angela sacrificing herself to close the portal up again

That's about as far as this fic has updated so far. But given that we're halfway through the events of canon, the fact that this has all happened more or less the same way is a bit much, in my opinion.
