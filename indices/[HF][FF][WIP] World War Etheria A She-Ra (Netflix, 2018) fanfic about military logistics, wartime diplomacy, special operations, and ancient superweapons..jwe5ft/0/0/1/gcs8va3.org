  Real people, even smart ones, are dumb as fuck

I read fiction because I'm trying to /get away from/ dumb-ass real people. Are you not stymied by dumbassery often-enough in your own life, that you need to imagine more dumbassery into the world? :P

(Seriously though, it's good writing, and I'm sure /someone/ will like it.)
