I'll explain it a bit better.

Fair use is always decided on a case by case basis. So, technically, we can't really say that fanfiction, in general, is fair use or not, we would have to look at it case by case.

Nonetheless, when deciding if it's fair use, there are several criteria used, including if it's meant for nonprofit purposes (like educational, parody and criticism purposes), if it affects the market value of the copyrighted work, the amount of what is used in regards to the copyright work and the nature of the copyright work.

Based on that, a fanfiction will have a high chance of being considered fair use if it's transformative compared to the copyrighted work, if it's nonprofit, if it uses relatively little of the copyrighted work, and if it doesn't effect negatively the market value of the copyright work.

The issue is that the vast majority of fanfiction meets that criteria. Their use of the copyrighted work is limited to the setting and the characters (being highly transformative in comparison), they are nonprofit and they certainly don't really affect the market value of the copyrighted work.

In conclusion, if taken to court, based purely on merits, the vast majority of fanfiction has a high degree chance of being considered fair use, which is why I stated that it was fair use since I considered it the most likely scenario for the majority of cases, and most countries have fair use in a way or another.

As for the copyright holders taking people to court, that's the thing: literally anyone can take anyone to court. I don't have to be minimally right about my arguments to take someone else to court, I just need the will and money to put them there. Who's right and who's wrong only really comes up later when the court decides.

So, copyright holders, who have lots of money, will take people to court, regardless of being right or completely wrong if they feel that the outcome might be beneficial in some way, even in indirect ways.

Often, big companies even try to win just by putting economic pressure on the opponent, meaning that it ends up not being about who is right but who has more resources because they just try to make it so that fighting them in court is too expensive and too demanding, which grants them an automatic win because the opponent just folds in that case.

All this means that the ability of the copyright holders to take someone to court means basically nothing in terms of who is right and who is not. And in terms of whether its fair use or not, following the criteria for that, most fanfiction would have a high degree of chance of being fair use.

As for the printing companies, once again, it's not about who is actually right. They just want to protect themselves and thus many just don't want to draw any kind of attention from the copyright holders, even if the printing companies are right. It's way easier to simply refuse a few orders.

EDIT: Btw, there's not much of a real difference, even legally, between me accessing a place online to get a digital copy of a fanfiction and me accessing a place online to print a physical copy of the same fanfiction (without distributing it to anyone).
