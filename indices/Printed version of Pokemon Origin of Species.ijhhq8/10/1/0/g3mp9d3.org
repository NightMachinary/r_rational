Fanfiction is probably not fair use, it just typically falls under the "way too much effort/PR damage for companies to do something about" category. The Pokemon Company would be entirely in their rights to tell Daystar to stop making OoS, they just won't because it's not harming their bottom line and doing something about it would make them look bad.

Printing books for your own personal use is definitely not fair use. By printing these books I'm violating the copyrights of Daystar, Arvalis (the guy that made the images on the covers) and the Pokemon Company. It's just that I don't think any of them care.

Finally, printing companies absolutely have to (pretend to) care about not printing copyrighted works as they could get into a shitload of trouble if they got found knowingly doing that. Now, most of the time the policies used to prevent you from printing copyrighted material are easily circumvented (as well as exceptionally poorly enforced), but I've gotten prints rejected before for using copyrighted mtg art.
