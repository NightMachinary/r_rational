Anyone can print stuff like this for their own use because, even though it has copyrighted elements like names, it falls under fair use since it's fanfiction. It's not illegal as long it's just for their own personal use.

And it's not illegal to use a printing store to print the book for your own personal use. So... It becomes kind of redundant. If people are interested, they can print for themselves. There are even HPMOR ebooks out there already ready that people can just print if they are interested, for example.
