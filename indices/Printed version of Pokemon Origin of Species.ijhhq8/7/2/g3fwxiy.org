Aside from the fact that pdfs/epubs are apparently made available to patreon subscribers, which I wasn't aware of (and which incidentally could have saved me a bunch of effort), I wouldn't want to distribute these in the shape they are in now anyway. I was under a bit of time pressure when making these, so they're pretty rough (eg. all the chapters still end on the '/If you have found a spelling error, please notify me.../' message).

Also, if I did that, I would first want to get permission from the artist that made the art for the cover as well as Daystar, because making this stuff for myself is one thing, distributing it like that is quite another.
