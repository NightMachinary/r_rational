It comes out to chapters 25, 42, 55, 71 and then 83 of course. I wanted to split them by story arc first, but I was kind of forced into this split by the page limit on the books. Splitting them any other way would have resulted in 6 books.

It doesn't work out too badly, it helps that basically all your chapters are fairly self contained and end on a meaningfull-ish final line/cliffhanger to set you up for the next book.
