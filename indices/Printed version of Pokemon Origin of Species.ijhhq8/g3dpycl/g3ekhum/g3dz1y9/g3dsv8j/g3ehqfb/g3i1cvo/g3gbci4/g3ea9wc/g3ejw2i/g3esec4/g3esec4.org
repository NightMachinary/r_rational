I don't mean pdf/epubs of the story for reading. I mean print-worthy pdfs for people who also want to self-publish their own copies. There's a fair amount of work that goes into making a file that can be printed out into books, so I was wondering if the OP would be willing to share.

But good point on how the patreons are specifically paying for the privilege of having pdf/epubs. I forgot that was a thing.
