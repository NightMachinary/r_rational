  I also think fanfic takes a lot less effort. Most of the characterization and world-building is already done for you; it's easy to write with someone else's characters and use the details of their setting, but it's much harder to build something new from the ground up.

Oh, definitely this. Half of the heavy lifting is already done for you when working with an established universe, and it lets you spend that much more time on the plot and deconstruction / rationality / munchkinry / etc. I think that's the main appeal of fanfic for rational writers.
