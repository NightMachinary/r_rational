I think that for me, it's because I see so many wasted inventions and plots. The set up for the /Terminator/ movies is that there are killer robots and a human resistance fighting a timelike war with each other, and the movies explore such a vanishingly small fraction of the possibilities inherent in the premise that I can't help but start thinking about what I would do if I were in charge of the franchise. The same goes for a dozen other movies, comic books, and novels.

Fanfic is also a lot easier to come by. Because it can't be sold, it's free and online. As far as a subreddit goes, it's easier to link to something that you can instantly dive into than a book that takes money and effort to acquire.

I also think fanfic takes a lot less effort. Most of the characterization and world-building is already done for you; it's easy to write with someone else's characters and use the details of their setting, but it's much harder to build something new from the ground up. (At least, that's been my personal experience - others might disagree.)
