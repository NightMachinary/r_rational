I don't think it's a bias, so much as it's a standard technique: point out that the reader has already made a particular error. "Reader, you think you are moral and would object to Azkaban... but you already have accepted the real-world Azkabans." It's the same as the example of hindsight bias in [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/im/hindsight_devalues_science/]] - it's not necessarily hindsight or status quo bias in any particular example, the reversal just demonstrates a particular bias in that particular example.
