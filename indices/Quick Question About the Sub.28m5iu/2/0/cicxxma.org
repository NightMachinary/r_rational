I wouldn't phrase it exactly that way, but I agree that this is the primary reason for rationalist /fanfiction/. A character who masters a world you invented to be masterable, or finds flaws in a world you designed to be flawed, can potentially possess a kind of "cheating" or "easy" feel. The morals of American prisons are no better than the morals of Azkaban; if there are no Dementors there it's because American politicians have no Dementors to use, not because they're better people than the Wizengamot; and American prisons are worse in ways that Rowling couldn't have imitated without breaking her reader's suspension of disbelief, at least the wizarding world isn't imprisoning marijuana users that we ever saw. But even so if Azkaban were a feature of a world of my own invention, someone might ask whether Harry's reaction to it, or the fact that other people in magical Britain seem not to notice it as a moral horror (just like Americans don't notice the moral horror! Rowling was not being unrealistic!) would rest on wobbly floors. They might accuse me of having constructed an absurd parody for political purposes, where Rowling is not as easily subject to this charge. There are stories you can tell in fanfiction, in /someone else's universe/ which readers nonetheless aren't pre-blinded to the way they're blinded to the opportunities and horrors of real life, which you can't easily tell in any other mode of literature.
