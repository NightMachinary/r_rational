- My best guess regarding the Librarian's identity is that she is an unpowered fork of the demon --- not directly synchronized with her, perhaps significantly diverged after decades of existence, but still a fork. Or is she part of some /other/ faction?

- Denkne was /reclaimed/, hmm. Mages are totally brainwashed demons. Or brainwashed forks of demons, like the Librarian but with more power.

- Dizzy was really interesting this chapter.

    *Dizzy:* Did it not occur to you that the person being misled here is you? <...> That this moment, where you have everything ready to complete your â€˜task' is really just a pretence? Look who you have to wield as your tools. A girl not yet ready, two boys who can barely walk and talk at the same time <...> and a couple of empty vessels. What kind of fighting force is that? As much as your kind is adept at arranging for people to think they have made their own choice in getting to where you wanted them, haven't you succumbed to the same? Somewhere, there is someone placing you in this position, making you think it is all your own idea. Do you really think you have reached your desired goal with us at your back? You planned so long to get here, with us? This is your grand scheme? Where are your demons? Where is the army you raised to sweep away those who stand in your way?

  This applies to /so many/ faux-Chessmasters in so many works of fiction.
