Well, that too. It is amusing how big she speaks/thinks, and how disproportionally little of consequence she actually accomplished. Killed Denkne and minorly inconvenienced the Librarian --- I think that's all? I think Denkne was even there only to deal with meddlers such as her, so she probably didn't affect the enemy's plans at all.

Her perspective and rants are still entertaining.
