Oh god, Simole and Dizzy together in one room. Time to get some popcorn cause the fireworks will be real.

I still think that mages and dragons are two halves of the same coin. Why does the demon think human cheated them?

I wonder how much of what we see from Dizzy is real. Did she say all those things about Nic because she wanted to manipulate the boys or was there some truth in it?
