I think the QA is doing something more sophisticated than "merely" attaching an extra short-term memory and sensory processing module to Skitter's brain - it learns tactics and, judging from the ending, more complex cognitive strategies involved in "creativity" and analysing complex ideas from her.

I'd model the QA as containing several partially-lobotomized uploads of Taylor's brain; maybe running on co-opted bug brains, maybe running on Shard computronium somewhere, all linked to her conscious mind. (I assume the actual mechanism is more advanced.)

Anything she's practiced enough that she can do it automatically is something the /uploads/ can do automatically, freeing up her /actual/ subconscious to automatically, say, consider which target is most important, or direct bugs to prepare silk just in case, or whatever. And then her shard learns how to do that, it starts doing it, and her subconscious is freed up to do something else in an ever-improving cycle.

The sensory processing is actually quite minimal, brains seem to do OK with prioritizing which bit of information is important.

In short: I don't think Taylor can multitask on thing which require her attention. She /might/ be able to practise writing out pre-prepared essays until her power began automatically doing it in the background whenever she needed it to, but it would take far too much time for minimal reward.

On the other hand, she could use it for computational stuff, like image-classification or solving /simple/ math problems - maybe even complex ones, but she'd need enough practise at math that splitting a problem up into subtasks becomes automatic. She'd probably be great as some kind of PRT analyst, watching camera feeds for suspects or even controlling automated drones; but they wouldn't be as smart as /Taylor/. She'd probably be pretty great at almost anything, really, given enough time to train.
