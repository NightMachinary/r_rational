  Hm?

Whoops, that was moved below. It was going to be "have to farm humans to come up with ideas for them."

(Seriously, though, just look at Scion. He's practically a zombie.)

  But it doesn't matter if shards themselves are less intelligent. A question with AI (or supposed "dumb" intelligence) is if it can do the sort of value judgments we do. If a shard can't do that sort of thing it'd naturally need to run simulations of Taylor's brains.

Oh, yeah, it may well not be a /literal/ copy of Taylor's brainstates - it probably isn't actually. That's just a handy way to model it; to suggest it was mimicking her thought process during combat, style of thing.
