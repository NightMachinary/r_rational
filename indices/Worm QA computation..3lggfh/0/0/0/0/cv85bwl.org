Hm?

  Shards are explicitly much less intelligent than humans. It's kind of ... the entire plot of the story.

The entire plot of the story is that Entities,the sum of shards, are less /creative/. Yes, some of us might find being massively better at computation but less creative strange, but there you go. Number Man apparently has some ineffable quality that both his shard and the Entity don't have, despite being clearly less capable in some fields.

But it doesn't matter if shards themselves are less intelligent. A question with AI (or supposed "dumb" intelligence) is if it can do the sort of value judgments we do. If a shard can't do that sort of thing it'd naturally need to run simulations of Taylor's brains. But shards seem to have little problem with the jump from raw data to categorizing stuff like emotions and working out intentions and so on. Even if they didn't know at the start, it's a temporary problem, not an inherent one like the apparent inability to innovate.
