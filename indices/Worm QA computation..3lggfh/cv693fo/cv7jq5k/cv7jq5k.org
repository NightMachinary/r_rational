  I think the QA is doing something more sophisticated than "merely" attaching an extra short-term memory and sensory processing module to Skitter's brain - it learns tactics and, judging from the ending, more complex cognitive strategies involved in "creativity" and analysing complex ideas from her.

It's sentient and even sapient, if you look at Noelle's interlude with her shard, they do seem to have some sort of self-identity and can apparently outright negotiate with their hosts. I don't even think you need uploads. Shards do a lot of processing that depends on some sort of processing that matches what humans can do (value judgments, etc.). They can then store common patterns the more they get a grasp on host psychology and tactics (imagine what they'll look like after 300 years of that)

  In short: I don't think Taylor can multitask on thing which require her attention. She might be able to practise writing out pre-prepared essays until her power began automatically doing it in the background whenever she needed it to, but it would take far too much time for minimal reward.

She might not be able to. Because shards don't have to work that way. Why can she do spiders but not crabs or ticks? It's deliberately arbitrary.

That's the beauty of shards; they explain the completely arbitrary limits on power and information processing you see in superpowers. Her shard lets her multitask for bugs because that's the stuff her shard wants info on. It doesn't have to grant her any leeway on anything else. How does the shard know about math problems vs. bug problems? How does it subtly encourage conflict here or there, how does it distinguish between the right bugs or the right emotional effects, especially subtle ones, or any of the shit they do?

That's the thing about the talk of "munchkinry" in the Worm universe. It only goes so far since it's a locked system. Apple vs. Android. What you "should" be able to do doesn't matter. The Manton Effect is just the best example of this.
