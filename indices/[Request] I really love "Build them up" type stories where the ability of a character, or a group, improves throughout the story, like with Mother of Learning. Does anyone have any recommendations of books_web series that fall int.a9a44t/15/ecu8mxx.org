This is definitely an odd recommendation, but I really liked Polyhistor Academy. It's a quest, and hosted on questionablequesting because it has some adult content, but the underlying story is 'a bunch of crazy murderous wizards with different powers get put into a school together and encouraged to kill', but with character development. Give it a try for the first few pages and see if it's something you enjoy.
