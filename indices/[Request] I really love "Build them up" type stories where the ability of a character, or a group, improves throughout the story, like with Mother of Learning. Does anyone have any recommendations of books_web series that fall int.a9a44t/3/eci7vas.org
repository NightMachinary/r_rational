Xianxia was mentioned in another comment as a genre that does this, but Xianxia is generally not rational (my heaven defying luck, and the fact that my opponents are all idiots, allows me to prevail against all opposition). The exception to this is Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, which gets recommended on this subreddit a lot, and for very good reason. If you haven't read it yet, you should definitely check it out. As a Xianxia story, it includes many of the standard tropes, including a magic system designed around a large number of discrete power levels, and a main character with special advantages in climbing that ladder... but there are lots of other skilled and lucky geniuses out there, and some of them have different goals than the MC, and those who constitute meaningful opposition are not stupid about their pursuit of those goals.
