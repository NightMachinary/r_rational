Thanks, I'll start reading it.

A Hero's War was just a bunch of examples of bad writing. It could have been executed in a halfway-competent way and I'd have loved it, but the terrible prose and the way the main characters were given plot smarts really irked me. Like, there's this mage who experiments with magic, and the moment this main character meets her he starts thinking up good magic ideas. Which actually are good and work. With zero real magical knowledge. I don't mind when the main characters steamroll over threats, but when interactions are that dumb I can't really overlook it anymore. This also happens with these underground worm things. No one else tried poison? Really?
