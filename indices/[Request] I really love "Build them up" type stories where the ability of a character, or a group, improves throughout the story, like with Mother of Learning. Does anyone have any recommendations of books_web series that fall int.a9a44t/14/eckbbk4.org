I highly recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]]. It's a xianxia quest and has some of the normal non-rationalist problems, but all the characters are well fleshed out and have their own goals and stats/skills. There's a lot of character growth and worldbuilding.

There's also [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/ignition-mtg-multicross-planeswalker-pc.26099/][Ignition]]. It's an MTG planeswalker multi-crossover quest and is extremely long, with the main character going through different settings getting stronger. It's...ok, and has quite a bit of nothing happening or steamrolling or being generally unsatisfying, but I'd still probably recommend it to people simply because there's so much of it and it's entertaining and ability-grow-y.

I'd also recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/][Now You Feel Like Number None]] because it's very well written, although it assumes a lot of Bleach knowledge, but nothing that you can't quickly Google what a term means I think. There's also [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/][A Destiny Of Strife]], which is worse but very long and more "Build em up".

Other people have recommended With This Ring. It's exactly what you want. It's several million words long by now and the author updates it with another 1k words a day every single day. A rationalist munchkiner is dropped into the DC universe with a Green Lantern-esque power ring, and gradually builds up power.

Quests in general are good for this, because they're long running and tend to accumulate power as they go on, with the QM matching up against steadily increasingly difficult challenges with the chance of failure and (usually) low authorial fiat due to concrete stats and character sheets.
