I'm having trouble believing that I only started reading this fic 15 days ago. It feels closer to a month.

I finished it last Saturday. I'd say it's competently done, but it ends at the end of an arc, not at the end of the story, and the author hasn't written any sequel. If you're the sort of person who wants to read to the end of a story, probably don't start reading this story. You will be mad at how many words you read in order to reach the end of this volume.

But, yeah. RWBY knowledge is not essential for understanding this fiction, though the RWBY wiki is helpful for finding character images.
