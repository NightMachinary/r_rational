Yeah, but they'd have to have read hundreds of thousands of words to get to that part. How could you get that far into /WtC/ and expect it to turn into fetish porn? It would be like getting to the end of /The Lord of the Rings/ and expecting a sex scene with Sauron. Or it would be like /not/ expecting gross sex scenes in the next season of /Game of Thrones./
