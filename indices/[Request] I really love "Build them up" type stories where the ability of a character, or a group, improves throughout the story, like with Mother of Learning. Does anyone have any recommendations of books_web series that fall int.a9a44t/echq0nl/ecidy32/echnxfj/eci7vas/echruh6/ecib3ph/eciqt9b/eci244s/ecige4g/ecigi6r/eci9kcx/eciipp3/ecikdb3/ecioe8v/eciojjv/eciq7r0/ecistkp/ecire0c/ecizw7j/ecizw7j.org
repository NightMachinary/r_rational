Ok, let's trace what happened here. You made an argument that was both irrelevant and incorrect. I explained in my post why it was irrelevant. That on its own was sufficient reason to dismiss your argument.

Then as an aside I pointed out your argument was also wrong. I put that in an aside to indicate that it was independent from the Wheel of Time discussion. You asked why. I explained by giving an counter-example. I took the simplest, clearest counter-example I could think of. Now you're complaining that the counter example, which was deliberately and explicitly not Wheel of Time related, is not related to Wheel of Time.

Your logic is flawed on so many levels I have lost track.

And the worst part is that none of this bears the slightest relevance to my original post. Because all I said is that Wheel of Time contains a lot of gender essentialism, so that if you dislike gender essentialism it might not be the book for you. Whether gender essentialism is correct or justified or right or wrong is all utterly irrelevant to that point.
