Sorry I am on mobile so I cant link anything but I have plenty. I am really into self insert fanfiction and I prefer the fanfics to be the type your looking for. All self inserts have omniscient knowledge of the universe/timeline that they were reincarnated/transmigrated into so they have the ability to know certain routes to obtain the most amount of power the fastest. They easily have the "weak to strong" vibe you are looking for.

The problem with self insert fanfictions is that most of them are extremely irrational focusing on building harems, wish fulfilment, crack, and trolling canon characters. They also obtain power ridiculously easily,even with the godlike knowledge they possess. Its like they are treating their new life as a fun adventure playground and a well written self insert is all about how realistically you can make your SI's life to be.

Enough of my ranting. Here are the self inserts that I reccommend that tries to be realistic.

Naruto

Kaleidoscope. It is a self insert about a man reincarnating into the Uchiha clan in the timeline 2 years before naruto was born. He knows the Uchiha massacre is coming for him and he does everything he can to prepare for it. It has a very rational outcome but be warned because some people might find it offputting of all the 'agnst' coming from the SI. I thought bothing of it because I felt the agnst was him just thinking rationally. 2nd book has alot of stuff that I tend to avoid of self inserts but judging of how good the first book is I let it pass. Complete.

Sanitize. It is about a girl that was reincarnated into the warring era clans period before formal villages was formed. The self insert has no knowledge of naruto but she was a modern medical practitioner before she was reincarnated. She doesn't get stronger after every chapter but more smarter and accumulated to the grimdark world of ninja. It is ongoing with an extremely slow update rate.

Walk on moon, son of gato, settling hot water, what doesn't kill you.

Dc universe-with this ring

Harry potter-Magical me

Weak to strong web serials- Wandering inn, Savage divinity(have issues with fluctuating writing quality and its shameless harem)

Stranded in fantasy is a greentext novel that I highly recommend.

Sorry no time to explain them all and link them on mobile heading somewhere.
