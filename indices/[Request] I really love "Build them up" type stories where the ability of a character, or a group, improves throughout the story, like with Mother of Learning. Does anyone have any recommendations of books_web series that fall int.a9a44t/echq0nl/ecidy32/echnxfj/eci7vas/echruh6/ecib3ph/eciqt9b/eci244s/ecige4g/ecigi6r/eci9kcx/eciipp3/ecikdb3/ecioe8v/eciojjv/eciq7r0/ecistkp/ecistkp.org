If you gain any popularity you'll probably be accused of lot of things anyway. Obviously it would be stupid to write exactly what you said. Not necessarily because it would be absolutely morally wrong, but because of the backlash.

Notice that you didn't really quote my whole argument. It's not like it's just the real world where the only difference is that women suck or something.

Wheel of time is in a fantasy universe, which was created by a creator god thingy, who divided the magic between men and women. It has a really good in-universe reason for the "gender essentialism".

In fantasy there are actual evil races, who worship evil gods. Is that racism? Maybe. Is it bad?

Fantasy doesn't pretend to be real world. Completely different worlds should be allowed to differ from reality.

IMO these kinds of issues should be saved for other kinds of works.
