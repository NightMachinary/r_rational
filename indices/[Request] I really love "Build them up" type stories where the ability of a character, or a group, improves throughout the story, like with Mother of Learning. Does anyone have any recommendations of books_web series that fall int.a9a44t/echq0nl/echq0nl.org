I can wholeheartedly recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/reader][The Games we Play]]. It is exactly what you are looking for, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story, competently written and full of action and training. It's a fan fiction but stands perfectly well on its own, I had never even heard of RWBY and never really felt I was reading a fan fiction.
