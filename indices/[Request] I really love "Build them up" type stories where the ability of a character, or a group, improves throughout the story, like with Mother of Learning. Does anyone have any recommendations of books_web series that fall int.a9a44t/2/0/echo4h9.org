Thanks for the reply, and yeah, these types of stories usually are focused around "game" like settings... looking into it seems LitRPG is what I'm looking for... although maybe not ones where it's clearly obvious it's a game.

Thanks for putting a name to this type of story though, I need to go looking about some more.
