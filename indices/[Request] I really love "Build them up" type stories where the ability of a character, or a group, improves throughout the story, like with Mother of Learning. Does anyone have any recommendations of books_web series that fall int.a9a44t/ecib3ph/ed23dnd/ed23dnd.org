Agreeing with this, Cradle is awesome and has the good parts of xianxia without most of the bad ones. If you like that, also try the webnovels Metaworld Chronicles, Savage Divinity, Worm, and possibly Arcane Emperor. Warning, the grammar and editing isn't necessarily top notch in many of these, but the stories are great. It also depends on your tolerance for MCs becoming OP at various speeds. Also they aren't necessarily super rational.
