Wheel of Time is very far from rational though. A lot of major decisions are made on the spur of the moment, and the main characters often act very irrational. Expect a lot of angst from all three main characters over their powers and how they really don't want them.

The series has a few strong points. The magic system is really well thought out, the world building is top tier (Only Tolkien himself is better), and the battle scenes in particular are extremely well done.

Weak points are that the series is waaay too long. It goes on forever, and gets really boring after a few books. In at least one book the main character isn't even included, and several books are all side plots of side plots that aren't even resolved at the end of the book. It gets really annoying.

A other weak point is the characterization. Especially the female characters can be pretty flat. Some major characters have basically no more personality then 'Gets angry a lot'.

Finally the book has a really dualistic worldview regarding men and women. They are seen as fundamentally different, using completely different magic systems, and never ever able to understand each other (this drives most, no, all, of the romance subplots in the books). Don't read these books if that kind of gender essentialism annoys you.
