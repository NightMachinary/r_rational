  Finally the book has a really dualistic worldview regarding men and women. They are seen as fundamentally different, using completely different magic systems, and never ever able to understand each other (this drives most, no, all, of the romance subplots in the books). Don't read these books if that kind of gender essentialism annoys you.

It's literally a different world. It just might be actually a reality there, so it's not like it's wrong.
