Your comparison is unfair. The racist stereotypes you mentioned are almost always wrong while there are real measurable behavioral and temperamental differences between the sexes. I find that if I disagree with someone I am better served by discussing what exactly conflicts with my view point instead of using phrases like "deeply flawed" with no explanation. It at least gives me some room if I am wrong.
