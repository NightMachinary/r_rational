That's basically the extent of worldbuilding in the original show. TGWP is like The Lord of the Rings in comparison -- canon doesn't come even close to the depth and ingenuity of that AU setting. It also helps that the author completely disregarded the canon plotline and basically wrote whatever the heck he wanted.
