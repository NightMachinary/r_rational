If you're interested in gamer type fics, consider "The Erogamer", which has been recommended on this subreddit several times. It's a quest-type interactive story based around a gamer power based on erotic games instead of RPGs... and it's also a story with a surprising amount of depth and character agency, neither of which are typical in erotic literature, gamer fics, or quest threads.
