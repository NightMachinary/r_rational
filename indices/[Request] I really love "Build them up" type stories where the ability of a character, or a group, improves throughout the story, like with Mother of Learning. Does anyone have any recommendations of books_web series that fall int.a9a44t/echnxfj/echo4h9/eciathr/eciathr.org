There are also "Transport" or other world stories. Stuff like a modern era backpacker being transported to another world with medieval technology and introducing Gunpowder. Or a person being sent to a world with magic and utterly breaking the magic system with modern era concepts (like summoning an imp and giving it precise instructions on how and when to summon another imp, thus making logic gates and simple programs out of magic)

Lots of Litrpg books are also in the Transport subgenre, but there are a lot of ones that aren't rpg like at all.
