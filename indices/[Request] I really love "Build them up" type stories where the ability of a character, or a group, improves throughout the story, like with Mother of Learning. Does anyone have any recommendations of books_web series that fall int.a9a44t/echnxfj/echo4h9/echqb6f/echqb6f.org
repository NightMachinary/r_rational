LitRPG comes in a variety of flavors. Some of them involve a distinct "real world player vs in-game avatar" dichotomy, where the individuals themselves aren't growing stronger (only their avatars are), and those would probably be less appealing to you.

Reincarnation stories are a subcategory of LitRPG where a person dies and is reborn into a world that follows a linear progression system that is "game-like" in the sense that they are usually leveling up and learning new skills. You can pretty easily find these on Royal Road if you search for stories that are tagged as both "litrpg" and" reincarnation," which are two of the more popular genre tags on the site, though finding ones that are specifically rational might be a bit more difficult.

Reincarnation stories are sort of a subset of a more portal fiction-y version of LitRPG where characters from a contemporary earth setting are transported to a fantasy world (a la Narnia), and that fantasy world happens to have an RPG-like progression system where leveling and whatever game-like elements the author fancies are just part of the fantasy setting. And there are some LitRPG stories that are just pure secondary world fantasy (a character is born as a level 1 elf and that is basically the totality of the setting, no acknowledgment of earth).

In addition to genre qualifiers based on setting and premise, people also tend to categorize LitRPG as either crunchy or creamy (or alternatively, hard and soft) depending on how detailed the RPG descriptions are; crunchy/hard LitRPG is liberal with things like damage notifications, in-world item descriptions, and other things that make the experience of reading the story feel more like a video game, while soft/creamy LitRPG has fewer of these elements and might just have "leveling up" as a progression system; someone writing "crunchy" LitRPG will probably have something on every single page to remind you that you're reading a litRPG story, while soft litRPG can sometimes read like a "normal" piece of speculative fiction most of the time where the leveling system is mostly in the background to give a quantifiable sense of progression throughout the story (and sometimes provide a basis for comparing characters' relative power levels).
