Literally every "Gamer"-style fiction, as well as the korean webtoon that started the fad, since the underlying concept is "the main character gains numerically-measured skills that get stronger the more he uses them".

Sturgeon's Law still applies, tho.

Also there's the xianxia genre, which is a similar concept with a more oriental slant. Bear in mind that xianxia is the literary equivalent of junk food. Don't expect any deep plots.

Edit: the spacebattles forum is a good place to find Gamer fiction.
