If you are into reading epic fantasy or listening to their audiobooks I also recommend the stormlight archive and the king killer chronicles. Lots of personal growth.

I actually find this thread funny because I am on book 10 on the dresden files and I am about to drop it because I am so use to reading shonen/build them up stories and the dresden files does not have a system like this. Dresden gets stronger after each book but it is mostly off screen or temporary power ups.
