To play devil's advocate here, it wouldn't have been the first time an online author decided to make a sharp departure from the established premise of a story. It's not exactly /common/, but it's not completely unheard of, either.

Just as an example, there was one MLP fanfiction I remember following several years ago (I Am Going To Save And/Or Destroy Equestria!) where the protagonist found himself in the body of a very powerful villain and the de facto leader of a bunch of ponies trying to survive and avoid/defeat all the other villains. It was a good, solid story.

...then, about 30 chapters in, the character got blackout drunk and turned every pony into anthros. That chapter was /very/ poorly received. The chapter was rewritten, but the story stopped updating a chapter or two later.
