It's not terribly rational, but you might like Will Wight's /Cradle/ series. It's English-language-original xianxia, avoiding the more off-putting genre tropes (like all the misogyny and rape) and embracing the incredible cheesy scope, where power ranges from "basically a vanilla human" to "casually kill billions."
