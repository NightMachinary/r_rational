There are Old Earth Creationists IRL, but they are less common than Young Earth Creationists and they get criticized from both angles: they aren't ideologically pure enough for the religious fundamentalists and they aren't scientific enough for secular intellectual circles. Yecland might like them better than all the scientists that keep fleeing for other countries, but they won't be encouraged in and of themselves.

These Old Earth Creationists would also waste a lot of time, resources, and intellectual capital on continually developing loopholes and convoluted theories in the scientific side and defending there loophole driven theology on the religious side. Enough so that I would doubt their ability to seriously contribute to society. The paleoliberatian ideology of society will also hurt their ability to get government funding.
