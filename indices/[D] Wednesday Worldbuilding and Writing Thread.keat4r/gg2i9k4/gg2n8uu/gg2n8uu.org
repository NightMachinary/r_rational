So YEC contradicts cosmology/astrophysics (the speed of light and size of the universe indicates the age of the Earth is well over 6000 years), atomic theory/geology (radioactive decay and knowledge of the Earth's core indicates the Earth is over 6000 years old), biology (evolution), geology, genetics, and more. They cannot scientifically advance in these fields or related fields because they will be spending their intellectual capital on developing convoluted models around these problems. For example, their physicists and astronomers will be spending time working on models of C-decay to explain how light could have reached earth instead of developing other models/theories that are better motivated by evidence. Maybe with careful double-think, they can get engineering work done (IRL engineering has a higher ratio of YECs compared to other STEM fields). However intellectual honesty and commitment to truth is going to continuously drive scientists to commit heresy, which will in turn make the Yecland society distrust and not value basic science until eventually they have fully retarded their scientific progress.

Even nominally safe areas touch on forbidden conclusions. Studying and managing Global Warming requires studying glaciers which in turn analysis of their pattern of freezing and melting the evidence left in the ice suggests the world is older than 6000 years. So even if Yecland initially recognized global warming they would have to ban fields of science needed to study it.

I think IRL, YEC is a root cause in science denialism. Once you distrust science in one set of areas you stop trusting it in other areas whenever it is convenient. In Yecland, as fields of science contradict the Orthodoxy, science is distrusted as a whole. This also screws up their goal of reducing suffering, even if they maintain research in sociology, all their sociologists will have seen what happened to the other scientific fields which will have a chilling effect and encourage then to push biased results consistent with Yecland orthodoxy. Bad sociology in turn leads to bad choices in government and social policies. I think no matter how good the Yeclanders initial intentions they will be scientifically crippled which in turn leads to bad policies that increase suffering.
