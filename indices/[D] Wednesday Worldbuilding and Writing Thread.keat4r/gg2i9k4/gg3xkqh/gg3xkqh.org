I suspect that science would be completely crippled. I was unable to find any Nobel-prize-winning YECists. [[https://creation.com/creation-scientists][Creation.com]] identifies only 196 YECist scientists (among all scientific fields!), among which only 152 appear to have PhDs. For contrast, as of 2019 the United States had 4.5 million people with PhDs [[[https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/02/number-of-people-with-masters-and-phd-degrees-double-since-2000.html][Census.gov]]].

Just to put even that into perspective, as of 2014, about 42% of Americans adhered to the YEC brand of creationism [[[https://news.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx][Gallup]]]. So, basically, among 134 million YECs, we only know of 152 who got PhDs, or 1.13 per million people. Among the remaining 184 million Americans, 4.5 million got PhDs, or 24 thousand PhDs per million Americans. An America full of creationists would likely end up with less than 1/10,000th of our current scientific capability.

I expect that Yecland would see enormous brain drain as practically everyone smart enough to get admitted into doctoral programs abroad (like in France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, etc.) would be leaving to do so. Public science funding would probably be eliminated or reduced to bare-bones because of political opposition to scientific findings.

Apart from science/christianity, the paleolibertarian ideology would cause some pretty immense problems, especially in terms of negative externalities (like pollution). Most of the country would be dealing with the same situation that Flint, MI is currently dealing with (or worse) because the water would be heavily contaminated with industrial waste products. Much of Colorado's water might even be contaminated with cyanide from its gold mines. Across most of the country, the sky would be a hazy gray with no visible sun on most days, and breathing it without a respirator would be roughly equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes per day, like the air in Beijing. Nixon (of all people) didn't establish the EPA because everything was fine and dandy!

You could expect to see a massive surge in cancer (due to arsenic, radioactive elements in coal ash, heavy metals, and even outright radioactive waste), intellectual disability due to lead exposure, as well as cognitive impairment (cretinism) due to chronic iodine deficiency throughout [[http://www.doctorsreview.com/history/goiters-be-gone/][the goiter belt]] once there's no longer an FDA to require iodine in salt. The quality of medical care would also likely decrease significantly since many of the most talented doctors would likely leave the country (like Chinese and Indian doctors do now), making these problems even harder to remedy.
