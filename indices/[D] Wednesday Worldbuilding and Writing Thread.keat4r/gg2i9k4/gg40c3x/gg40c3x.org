I think that they have a realistic chance of scientific progress in all fields if they posit that the Universe was created with pre-existing history for them to learn from.

In the case of evolution, for example, they know beyond any doubt that the Universe was created 6000 years ago, but the deity creating it left evidence that would show the course of events for a much longer time period before its creation. As their deity helps those that help themselves, and studying the universe to understand it is clearly both an example of helping oneself and an example of worship through studying the works of the deity, then this is clearly an opportunity left for the inquisitive.

Clearly, this fossil evidence is meant to show what could happen. Perhaps, it is hinting at what worlds that did not have direct divine attention could develop. Perhaps, it is hinting at the future of our chosen people, should they experience selection pressures.

This could be applied to a very large number of fields, but I suspect there's some blind spots that this would lead to that I'm not quite seeing.
