"Imminent danger" is /such/ a broad phrase. Why, right now, you are in /clear/ danger of feeling lonely if you don't hear a nice, friendly voice!

Imminent danger of death? Well, some people might feel suicidal if they get too lonely... and of course, if you fail to perform well enough in you job, you might become unemployed and starve!
