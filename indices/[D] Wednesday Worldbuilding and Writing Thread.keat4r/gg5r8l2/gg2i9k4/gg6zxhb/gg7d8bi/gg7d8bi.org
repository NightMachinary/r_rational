Connecting words are your friend and exact word are even better. For example whenever, someone says someone cannot harm me they could kill you instead without harming you, through convenient accidents or murder through poison. Or whenever someone says to work for 4 days it could just be during the day, or all the time since one day is 24 hours. First you must codify a list of oaths and then find ways to work around them while staying within the letters of the oaths.
