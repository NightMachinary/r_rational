Humans live in a world along with fey-like creatures. Inevitably, human encroachment onto lands controlled by the fey leads to conflict which is laughably one-sided against the humans.

Fortunately for humanity, the fey hold ancient and deep grudges against one another, and are utterly contemptuous of the species. One fey queen schemes to bring about the fall of another using a human hero, resulting in her rival's soul being bound into the hero's rapier.

That was forty years ago. Led by the hero, humanity fought a terrific twenty-year war that largely destroyed the fey. Veterans of this war each have a blade forged of steel and the mad, shattered soul of a fey creature.

The swords have the ability to fool the senses of their wielder, as well as those of anyone whose blood is on the blade.

Examples:

- The wielder can render themself impervious to pain.

- The wielder can overlay senses with those of the bound fey to see past illusions spun by other such creatures. They can also see heat, see in darkness, and sense nearby fey.

- Reactions such as sound happen far more quickly than those of sight. One bound to such a blade may hear phantom sounds causing them to flinch or duck when needed.

The blades are bound by complicated oaths which are updated much like modern firmware. Occasional bugs and glitches in these oaths cause erratic misbehavior in these weapons as the bound spirits lash out around them.

Now that the war is over, many veterans serve as domestic police. They enforce the law, guard against insurrection, investigate criminal activity, and so on.

TL/DR; I'd like help imagining a gritty police procedural in a low fantasy setting with prevalent mind magic.

I'm looking for interesting oath glitches, subplot ideas, and other discussion people would find interesting about this setting.
