After doing a bit of research, it looks like the "universe with pre-existing history" hypothesis is not very common among YECs. Mostly, they claim that radioisotope dating can't be relied upon basically because "things might have been less radioactive back then", and the flood somehow magically explains all of the geological strata that we see. It's pretty much just a tactic of putting blinders on and pretending that there's not enough data to falsify their belief. The only ones I found that appear to go with the pre-existing history hypothesis claim that Satan (or godless archaeologists) intentionally placed the fossils to deceive people.
