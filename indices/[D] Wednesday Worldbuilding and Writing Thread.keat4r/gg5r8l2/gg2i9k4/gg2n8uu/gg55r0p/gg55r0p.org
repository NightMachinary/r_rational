Presumably one could loophole oneself around the worst of the inaccuracies. For example, the size of the universe may indicate that the /universe/ is a few billion years old, but that doesn't mean that the /Earth/ is - it could have been made later. Similarly, radioactive decay might indicate that the Earth was assembled from old components, rather than that it is old itself.

Scientists who come up with these 'loopholes' would probably be heartily encouraged by others, who would be glad that their views are not all that challenged... and when they found something that they couldn't loophole, they'd assume that the loophole was merely obscure enough that they couldn't figure it out on their own and they needed to search harder.
