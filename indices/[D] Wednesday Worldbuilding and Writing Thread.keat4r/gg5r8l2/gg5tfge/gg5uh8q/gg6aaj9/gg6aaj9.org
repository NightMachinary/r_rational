All external combustion engines generate power from a temperature differential. As far as I'm aware, most /useful/ engines operate on a differential between room-ish temperature and far higher temperatures, including anything that involves steam.

Of course, it's hard to say how much of that is because available earthly chemical and physical processes are simply more favorable to energy extraction from temperature differences between points in the >270 K range, compared to between points in the 0-270 K range, and how much of that is technology developing around heat sources rather than heat sinks because the former are far more common. If you /can/ find an efficient 290K-to-lower engine that someone invented for the fun of it I'd be very interested to see it, of course. Still, in the scope of reasonably well known technologies, I strongly suspect most useful processes work best either on purely "upwards" differentials - see steam engines - or like I said with Stirling engines, would benefit from both to some extent.
