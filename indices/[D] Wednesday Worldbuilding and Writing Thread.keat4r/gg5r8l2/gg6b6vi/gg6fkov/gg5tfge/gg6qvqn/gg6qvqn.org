For 1, moderate heat by itself won't weaken the weapon too much: [[https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/amp/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html]]

But cooling the weapon back down for storage likely would damage it overtime from the repeated thermal expansion and contraction.

For weaponizing these plates properly I think a sword is the wrong weapon to look at. Any case where you can get touch contact to burn someone you could just cut them instead. To make use of heating up something I think boiling oil or hot sand flung at an enemy makes more sense. Once it makes contact it clings painfully allowing for more heat transfer.

Is the heating/cooling a set amount of energy or proportional to the object mass set against the plate? If it's the 1st one storage or inactive use will be an issue (maybe a hot and cold plate against each other to cancel out?), but if it's the 2nd case just remove whatever is in contact with the plate and let it heat the air to cut its output.

Does the cooling work all the way down to absolute zero? If so, with enough insulation and plates, even a primitive civilization could make use of stuff like liquid nitrogen and superconductivity. Note that a magnet will naturally repel superconductors, a civilization could possibly find crude uses for this without understanding electricity or magnetism.

I think [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine][Carnot Engines]] and thermodynamics in general mean that greater temperature differentials increase the efficiency of any engine using temperature differences. But smaller differentials are easier to use. It would come down to a question of cost of working with greater temperature extremes vs cost of more plates.
