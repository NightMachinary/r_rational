Quick thoughts - most efficient steam engine depends on technology level. The key thing about them in this context is they're [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_combustion_engine][external combustion engines]] - it doesn't matter how you get the heat, so long as you can apply it to water. Traditional steam engines are good, but if your tech level permits you'll want a steam turbine or Stirling engine. In any case, the heater is crucial, while the cooler is a nice bonus - stationary steam engines/turbines aren't usually limited by water reserves, and real Stirling engines are built to function without magical heat sinks - though I imagine they would be a great boon to efficiency.

Also, the best of using cooling limited to a single point is usually to put it at the top of a closed box, that's generally what fridges do.
