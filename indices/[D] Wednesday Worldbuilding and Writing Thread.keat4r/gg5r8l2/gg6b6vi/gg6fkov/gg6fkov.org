  Could you actually make a workable hot and/or cold sword with this
#+end_quote

Fire isn't a very practical weapon. Flaming arrows are mostly a movie thing, flamethrowers were largely abandoned shortly after being invented, Greek Fire was lost and useful technologies generally aren't.

A flaming sword might be so hot that it causes burns through armor, causing pain and reduced mobility, but armor is very well-insulated to begin with, and I'd also worry about the wielder's hand. Maybe hot enough to incidentally blind someone through the visor? My first guess for this is heating the air around the sword to ~650 degrees C (~1200 degrees F), found by multiplying (heat needed for water to instantly burn someone - human body temperature) * (heat conductivity of water / heat conductivity of air). But that's less than the heat of a campfire, and I've jumped through one unharmed, so I don't think I computed that right. [Edit, I went to make lunch halfway through this comment, so Norseman2 had ample time to ninja me. I'd start with his numbers. I would say that those appear to be the temperature that flesh needs to reach, not the weapon causing the burn. You need much higher temperatures to cause instant wounds, and even higher if you're using a poor thermal conductor like air.]

Beyond that, there's hot enough to weaken metal armor, but it takes time for metal to weaken, so you'd really need just a boatload of heat for that. With even more logistics problems and concern about the wielder coming with.

Finally, before abandoning swords entirely, it's possible a flaming sword is used as a banner. Big bright object that you can use to coordinate your army, and unlike an actual banner it's still a sword in a pinch. However, battles are generally fought during the day, so it's not like fire is /that/ visible. Still, potentially something dashing that people would romanticize in a setting where it was done.

Cold swords are harder to guess since a magical cold source is even further from real world experience than a magical heat source. Similar thoughts though - does it flash frostbite people through armor (noting that armor consists of rather a lot of padding)? Does it cool metal so much it becomes brittle?

With enough heat differential, you can make a gun.

Lobbing molten metal at people with a catapult might work, though it's a waste of good metal until at least the early modern period's equivalent technology.

Pressing a hot plate to a castle wall or gate allows a lot more time for heat to transfer than a flaming sword does. You could alternate hot plates and cold plates to induce thermal stress. So a battering ram replacement might actually be practical here; it's lighter and requires less manpower than the tool it's replacing.
