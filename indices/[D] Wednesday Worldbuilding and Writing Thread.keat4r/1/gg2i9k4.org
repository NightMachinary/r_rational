How academically literate could a staunchly Young Earth creationist society be/become?

Say a theonomous nation emerges in North America sometime in the future, which we'll call Yecland.

The national religious institution, the Church of Yecland holds that as of 2000 A.D. the Earth is 6,000 years old, the universe was created in 6 24-hour days by God, the KJV Bible is a factually inerrant piece of literature, (aside from books that are clearly not nonfiction) inspired directly by the Holy Spirit, the only valid form of scriptural interpretation is historical-grammatical, and that the Church of Yecland is the one, holy, universal, and apostolic church that Jesus founded.

Reason should dictate truth as long as it doesn't contradict the former axioms.

Believers are obligated to conform to the all of the Church's doctrine to remain in good standing. They're the only religion allowed to exist in Yecland. Heretics, schismatics, and apostates alike aren't criminalized, but instantly marginalize themselves, risking their professional status and interpersonal relationships. Clergy aren't politicians like in a theocracy, but Yeccish society is centered around their faith, orthodoxy defines all interactions and identities in some way.

Yecland is a federal republic not overly dissimilar from the USA with a capitalist mode of production, think [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolibertarianism][paleolibertarianism]], traditions are sacred, but so is property. You're not going to get along with most people very well if you're not enthusiastically pious and charitable.

That being said, climate change, disease, scarcity, mortality, natural disasters, etc. are still very real problems. Consequences of humanity's Fallen nature and the physical results of moral bankruptcy.

The Church believes God helps those who help themselves and that God gave humanity both the right and duty to exercise dominion over the Earth and overall universe. Genesis in the KJV technically only refers to the Earth, but the Yeccish are historical-grammatical literalists, not obtuse. The Earth isn't flat, there's cosmos out there for humanity to subdue and sanctify!

Speaking more in the short term, what everyone does for the least of them, they did for Jesus. They must work to minimize suffering.

Assuming they start from a roughly 21st century level of knowledge and ability, how far they could go while sticking to their principles?

What would be some specific, major stumbling blocks for them?
