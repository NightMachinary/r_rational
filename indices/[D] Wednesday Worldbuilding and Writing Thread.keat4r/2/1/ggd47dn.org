They aren't limited to whispering merely /advice/. They /are/ limited to whispering the /truth/ by oaths, but they are /not/ on the same side as their wielders.

Being limited to the truth doesn't mean they can't point out how that hobo over there is standing in the /perfect/ place to keep an eye on the comings and goings of the bank guards. Even though the hobo is just some down-on-his-luck guy looking for a handout. It doesn't mean they can't whisper a /hilarious/ joke just after the police commissioner has mentioned that his wife's in hospital, trying to get the wielder to visibly smother a laugh. It doesn't mean they can't whisper about how full of money and easily breached the bank vaults are when the wielder /really/ needs some money...

They might not be able to /control/ their wielders. But they can sure try to /persuade/. Of course, the wielders will be trained to ignore this... which would be /mostly/ successful...
