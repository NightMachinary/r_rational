As far as weapons go, a hot sword doesn't seem to be the way to go. Instead, you'd want to go with a dart or an arrow, something that's intended to get stuck into an opponent and be hard to remove. Making it burn anyone who touches it would easily do that. The other alternative is something like a net or bolas, where it wraps around a target and is hard to remove that way.

Mostly, I see the military applications being limited to something akin to barbed wire for the hot version and as a construction material for the cold version. If the cold version is cold enough to freeze water, then it's cold enough that a chicken wire mesh of it could be used to keep something like pykrete cold even in the summer, allowing for field fortifications and (if you can get enough of the stuff) entire self-repairing ships build out of water and sawdust.
