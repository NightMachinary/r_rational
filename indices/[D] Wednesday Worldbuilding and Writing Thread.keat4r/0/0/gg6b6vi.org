  Could you actually make a workable hot and/or cold sword with this, or some other weapon?

Sort of, but it might be better as a utility item rather than as a weapon. If you want the heat to make it do significantly more damage than a regular sword, it's going to have to get /really really/ hot. Keep in mind that high temperature blades are actually commonly used in the real world, but they're called electrocautery scalpels and they use heat from electrical resistance to cauterize small blood vessels in order to minimize blood loss during surgery. With this in mind, there's a range of temperatures where a hot blade might do less harm, rather than more!

Also keep in mind that the depth of a thermal injury (from where the blade touches flesh) will be affected by both the temperature of the blade and how long that temperature is applied. Typical sword usage would not leave much time for the heat to conduct deeply and cause more than just localized cauterization. That said, let's take a look at a range of possible temperatures, and the effects those temperatures have:

- 43 °C (109.4 °F): This is the threshold for thermal injury. Body tissues could be kept at this temperature for over two hours without injury.

- 50 °C (122 °F): Body tissues can be necrotized if they're kept at this temperature for at least one minute. A sword at this temperature would be unremarkable.

- 75 °C (167 °F): Full-thickness burns (3rd degree burns) can be inflicted within five seconds at this temperature. In /Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants/, McDonalds was found negligent for selling coffee at 82--88 °C. A hot sword with an outlet at the tip which could heat water to this point and spew it at people's faces or clothing would be somewhat scary.

- 100 °C (212 °F): Full-thickness burns (3rd degree burns) can be inflicted within 1-3 seconds at this temperature. Unfortunately, water turns to steam beyond this point, and steam does a poor job of sitting on people's skin and clothes to cause burns after exposure, so the sword becomes a bit less worrying beyond this.

- 480 °C (896 °F): This is enough to cause a faintly visible red glow. If the sword does anything extra with stabs and cuts, it would just be local cauterization of small blood vessels; it's actually less dangerous than a regular sword.

- 730 °C: This is enough to induce a bright red to slightly orange incandescent glow. This is around the range for what would be called 'low-temperature cauterization' with surgical tools. As above, this is less dangerous than a regular sword.

- 1,440 °C (2,550 °F): Temperatures at or above this are hot enough to cause a bright white glow, like a filament in a lightbulb, so the sword might look like a white lightsaber. Here's a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YMFRF8NMNI&t=1m37s][video]] of a cube of tungsten at somewhere around this temperature being placed on a steak (the video claims >3,000 °C). Stabs and cuts will definitely cauterize the wound, and there might be some more extensive burns and tissue necrosis around the wound. In combat though, this might actually be most useful as light source when fighting at night or inside caves or dark buildings. You could have someone behind you hold it so that it doesn't blind you by being in front of your face.

There's obviously a wide range of possible temperatures beyond this. For example, you could have a white-hot blade which is so hot that its radiant heat could cause burns at significant distances. This would be dependent on the exposed surface area of the blade, so the person holding the blade just needs to wear thermal protection and always hold the blade perpendicular from their body to remain safe. They could then let the flat part radiate heat towards everyone else, though this would quickly raise the local air temperature to intolerable levels and kill the wielder eventually if they don't have some way to shut the blade off.
