As a relatively minor piece of worldbuilding for a future project, I was thinking about a metamaterial that magically heats up or cools down things on its surface. The origin of this idea was a way to have ultra-hot flaming swords, but I enjoyed thinking about mundane uses, like making a plate of this material in order to replace a burner on a stove, or using cold plates in a refrigerator (probably with some kind of conductor so that you're cooling the whole space instead of freezing a single side of what you put in it), or cooling in the summer and heating in the winter with swappable plates.

Unfortunately, I'm not an engineer, and a lot of my attempts at engineering are just getting 'close enough' with some fudging on the details. At the moment, for this little corner of the world, I have two outstanding details I need help with:

1. Could you actually make a workable hot and/or cold sword with this, or some other weapon? The problem with weapons is that contact is usually quite brief, a flaming sword might be a liability, and you would need to compensate in terms of materials if it was actually hot enough to usefully hurt someone. It's magic, so the sky is the limit in terms of energy output, but my inclination is that the sword would be self-heating to a point of useful heat, with relatively low energy used so that it could be cooled down for storage in a cold-sheath. The damage would come from being hit with a hot piece of metal, rather than from direct heat production while the sword was in contact. Assuming that the heat didn't weaken the metal, what kind of energy requirements would we be talking about?

2. How do you most efficiently build a steam engine? Assuming that you have two materials, one of which generates heat, the other of which sucks heat, both in perpetuity. I'm fairly sure that you could just do a Rankine cycle type thing, with a cold rod in the condenser and a hot rod in the boiler, but I'm not sure that's the best way to go about it. You would also have to deal with what you do with the heating/cooling elements, since they don't shut off. You wouldn't necessarily /need/ to do anything with them, so long as you're disconnecting the rotation, but it seems like that would run into wear and tear problems, and make service on it a royal pain.
