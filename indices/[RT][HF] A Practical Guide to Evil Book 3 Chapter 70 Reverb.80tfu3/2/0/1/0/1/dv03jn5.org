Is the wandering bard the heavenly counterpart to Triumphant as Scribe suggested in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/villainous-interlude-cadenza/][Cadenza]] If so does that mean the preponderance of competent lawyers don't go to hell? I'm thinking "Good omens", Crowely, and EULAs, because the disparity in their actions in the realm of creation is a bit surprising.

RAFO is of course a valid answer, you've more than got me hooked, and baring exposition/revelation as my thread on the topic implies I see the picture and want the wandering bard's tale to end.
