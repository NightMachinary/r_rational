Black's coma is probably caused by his Name - a more advanced version of what happened when Cat let The Lone Swordsman go. In a way, while betraying the Tyrant is perfectly in-line with the Black Knight's Role, destroying an evil super-weapon is definitely not.

I'm surprised Cat is able to bleed after accepting her Winter power in full. Wasn't her blood made out of ice? I'm still hoping a new Name will present itself. Cat's ability to maneuver the story is game changing and I don't think she'll be able to do so much as Winter fae with a husk of a Squire in her.
