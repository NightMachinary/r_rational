Not just Cat; I wonder if /Black/ will get a new Name. This felt like a pivot for him as well - he's been preparing for "retirement" (Cat), he's recently dealt with the death of one of his oldest friends (Captain), he's broken with another (Malicia), and who knows what the deal with Assassin was. That would explain Bard's presence as well.
