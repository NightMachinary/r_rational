  Purging his most loyal followers to make way for Catherine's would be exactly the kind of thing he would do

Eh... he's got contingency plans for the Calamities, sure, because we know that Warlock, Scribe, and (likely) Assassin would go after Cat. But I don't think he'd kill Istrid. Her daughter leads Cat's legion, and while Istrid was a huge Black loyalist, I always had the impression that it was more because of what he made of the Legions (and orcs) than following him reverently. If Black told her to follow Cat if he died, I think she'd have done it.

Not to mention that if Black was going to start purging, I doubt he'd leave the goblin leaders alive...
