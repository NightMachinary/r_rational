So who betrayed General Istrid? Juniper ruled out Sacker, and we saw no hint of betrayal in Ranker's interlude. So if it's not goblin conspiracy, then that left Malicia and Procer.

However I think Cat missed an obvious culprit: Black. Purging his most loyal followers to make way for Catherine's would be exactly the kind of thing he would do, especially since he thinks that he doesn't have much time left.

Continuing this thought, maybe he's only pretending to be in a coma for the same reason.
