I suspect Black stopped her transition to the Black Queen, and now with Procer bearing down she'll end up with a different name.

Alternatively, I could see Cat never transitioning at all. To take up a proper role gives more power but it does narrow what you can do, and for someone whose endgame will probably be going after the gods themselves that sounds too limiting.
