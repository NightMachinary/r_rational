Something is tickling my brain, and I can't tell if I'm missing something or if I'm nitpicking.

In chapter 68, Cat rips the scaffolding off her soul and goes full Winter. It's written to be a huge, dramatic move. See here:

#+begin_quote
  Winter was no longer a thing tamed. It ran wild through my veins, through my Name, and a scream ripped its way out of me. My blood was red ice, my bones snapped and beyond it all my heart beat once -- and ceased... Winter had taken it all and left nothing behind that would warm me, no refuge to reassure me that I was still Catherine Foundling.

She seemingly has a major personality shift along with new powers, kills Ubua, and in the beginning of the next chapter, she freaks out Vivienne. But then her conversation with Malicia and Black is... practically the same as old Catherine? She gets mad, she mentally discusses her love for Black, she puts Callow first... but she doesn't seem like the preternatural, "above all of it," ice-hearted fae creature she should be and was for 1/3 of a chapter.

Same in this chapter. Her conversation with Juniper, even her internal monologuing, all sounds exactly like old Cat to me. She still feels sympathy, takes her oaths seriously, hesitates, and even gives a Callowan oath. Winter (fae-style) doesn't even get mentioned, nor does cold, or ice. Despite her blood "turning to red ice" two chapters before, she cuts herself and bleeds like normal with no mention of this change.

If we cut out the parts about her going full Winter, I really would see no difference between how the old Cat acted and how Winter Cat is acting. But I really expect to - it was a big change, right?

So am I missing something in the dialogue, like her mannerisms changed somehow (besides reacquiring a limp) or her personality being subtly off? Or maybe was it not actually as big a change as I expected it to be? Or, and I hate to suggest this because I really like this series... is it just a weakness in the writing?
