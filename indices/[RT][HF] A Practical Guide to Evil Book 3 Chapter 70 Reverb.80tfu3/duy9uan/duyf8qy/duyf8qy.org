I like Malicia better for it. Black was going to need some convincing on the topic of nukes; if he thinks there's any chance the legion can hold the Vale, he's never going to agree keeping the superweapon, for all the stated reasons. Thus, Malicia has an interest in weakening the legions, first by sending them into Akua's grinder right before Procer invades, and second by culling the top Marshals.

What was Malicia's plan for using the superweapon though? I thought it needed Akua's Bind to control the devils?
