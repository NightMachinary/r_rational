With the bullshit luck heroes are blessed with such an endeavour wouldn't be entirely impossible for them.

Remember, all information regarding the ability of a breach being closed comes from Named Mages firmly allied to Evil and that side don't have the benefit of bullshit luck. Closing them would take either an insane amount of ingenuity or more mundanely (well mundanely in this setting) a Miracle. Hierophant's entire schtick is observing Miracles, deconstructing them and making their power his.

It stands to reason that there might just come forth a Heroic Named that makes use of Miracles from the Gods Above; Hierophant's Heroic counterpart. Something like The Messiah or something similar. A Hero that employs Miracles and would easily be able to close said breaches since doing the impossible is one of the definitions of a Miracle. We've seen a watered down version of this before in the Bumbling Conjurer.

If they kept the Weapon or used it I have no doubt that situation would create the correct narrative weight for such a Hero to emerge and a Hero like that would be practically impossible to beat.
