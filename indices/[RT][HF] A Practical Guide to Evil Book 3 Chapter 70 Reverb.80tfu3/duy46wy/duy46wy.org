Daoine gets their gestalt back thanks to Cat, Juniper now leads Callow's military, and Cat is on the cusp of open rebellion. Reverb indeed.

Kinda wish we'd seen a resolution to the events of last chapter, beyond a mention of Black's coma and the Tower's silence, but setup is important, I guess.

Unrelated: does anyone know if EE announces when a chapter is the last in a Book? I feel like we're very, very close.
