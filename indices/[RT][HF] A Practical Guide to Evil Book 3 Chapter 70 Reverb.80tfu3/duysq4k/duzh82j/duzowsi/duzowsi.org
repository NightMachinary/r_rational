I mean, he did... but she was acting normal even before then. There are some Winter mentions in the convo with Black and Malicia, and I feel like Cat was a little off her normal tempo there... but I don't see why stopping her Name transition would make Winter suddenly disappear. Especially when it had practically shaken loose the Squire Name anyway.

I'll say, I DO expect that the Winter change will be addressed in an upcoming chapter. I'm just saying that right now it feels like it was supposed to fundamentally alter the character... but it hasn't. I worry it won't until it's the focus of the chapter, when I feel like good writing would have it subtly infuse everything Cat does /until/ it gets directly addressed.
