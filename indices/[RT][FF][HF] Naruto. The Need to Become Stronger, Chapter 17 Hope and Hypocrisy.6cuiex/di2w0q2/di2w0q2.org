Why does Kakashi refers to himself as the White Fang. In canon the White Fang is his father. Either Kakashi was reading Zabuza's mind and Zabuza was incorrectly assuming that Kakashi was the White Fang therefore Kakashi was using that against Zabuza, or you're changing canon to give Kakashi another nickname (which is fine but confusing for those familiar with canon).

I don't understand why Zabuza ran off either. He used the eight gates. It's assumed that he wasn't in a stable state of mind since he was reminiscing about the time he had to kill his friend to graduate. Giving that the last time he used the eight gates (that we're aware of) he went on a rampage and killed everybody, why would he run away this time. He even taunted Kakashi after using it. I don't believe that he would have done that and then ran off given his mental state.

Finally, why did Kakashi even go fight Zabuza If he figured out their plan. We find out that he's playing at the fourth level but I don't believe that Kakashi could have thought that was the best move. With how things are playing out he is simply doing what he wants but didn't seem to really even considering that whatever he does will even be effective at keeping his team safe. All that he did was keep Zabuza and Haku away from them (Which is great for their protection), but he must have considered that if he sacrifices himself his team might still go and get themselves killed because he left them to their own devices. And that's only if he was successful. If he died his team would have been doomed because of a gamble.

My question is, what stopped Kakashi from taking his team and hiding if his priority was his team's safety? Yes, he is the target, but if they can't find him they are not a threat. If Kakashi cared about the mission he wouldn't have blown up the bridge or more precisely kept close to Tazuna to keep him safe. I'm missing the part that suggest that whatever Kakashi did was the most reasonable thing for him to have done.

I find that things are happening because the plot demands it to happen and while it's an interesting read I have a hard time suspending my disbelief with regards to how everybody is acting.
