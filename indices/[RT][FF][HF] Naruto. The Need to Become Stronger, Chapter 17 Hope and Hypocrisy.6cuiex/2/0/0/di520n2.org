  It's a bit questionable (which is why Kakashi was surprised), but you have to consider Zabuza's perspective: The eight gates damage the user's body (even if Zabuza was using only the first and second or so), Zabuza does not have any clones left to protect him and Kakashi up until this point seemed almost unbeatable to him.

  I also wanted to highlight the point that rational ninjas would almost never take unnecessary risks - you just don't survive to get promoted to Jonin otherwise! Zabuza's plan was never to engage someone as powerful as Kakashi head-on with his real body, because he knows he's weaker than him.

I really don't buy that. It doesn't seem like a smart move to use a flashy skill that will leave you in a worst state to escape. If he was so sure that Kakashi was stronger than him I don't believe that he thinks he could get away. He thinks Kakashi has the upper hand and knows that Kakashi is capable of tracking him. He should knows that if he doesn't die from the eight gates he'll be weaker than a bug for the next week at least. Escape through water could be his salvation (he doesn't know if Kakashi can track him in water) but all Kakashi has to do is keep up with him and wait for him to suffer from the backlash. Even if he gets to the water, with his gates open he isn't exactly stealthy. His enhanced state is only temporary. What makes him think that that's enough time to run away *and* completely conceal himself for the recovery that he'll need to survive *if* he survives the eight gates (however many gates he opened).

Using the eight gates means he's risking a lot (I'm assuming at least the 6th gate according to canon symptoms). Had he attacked Kakashi the moment he used the eight gates, he could have landed a surprise hit (which could easily be fatal) before Kakashi could respond.

  except that the whole village would have died
#+end_quote

Then he should have went to save the village. If he failed the village would have died anyways (had he lost to Z and H they would go after the village and his team)

#+begin_quote
  Naruto at least would have insisted on fighting to save the Villagers
#+end_quote

So you're saying he's putting Naruto's want to save the villager before his own priority to keep his team safe (at the potential cost of the villager and the team)?

#+begin_quote
  Even if they had hidden it would not have been guaranteed to work as Z+H were very quick to locate them in the past, making Kakashi suspect they have some sort of sensory technique.
#+end_quote

Suspect of a sensory technique isn't enough to dismiss the thought of hiding. If he hid he could have bought enough time to rest up and face Z + H on his own terms instead of following their plan. I also don't understand why they can't run away? They could escape through any other part of the country back into the Land of Fire by walking on water or swimming or whatever. They're not required to use the bridge or boat, they're ninja's for goodness sake.

#+begin_quote
  Do you have any other examples, or is it just this specific case that feels off to you?
#+end_quote

Sasuke getting his sword stuck in the giant thugs body. I have a hard time believing that a blade forged and infused with chakra would get stuck. Or that a body full of chakra couldn't pull out that blade, especially after this

#+begin_quote
  His blade flashed out and carved off the first foe's arm with chakra-enhanced strength
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  He grabbed one man and tossed him into another before impaling both
#+end_quote

First he performs superhuman feats then he's a normal boy? That whole scene feels contrived. I get that he's just killed for the first time but it still doesn't seem right to me.
