Ooh, long review, nice!

#+begin_quote
  Why does Kakashi refers to himself as the White Fang.
#+end_quote

This is the result of Kakashi being more rational: He kept using his father's chakra blade instead of simply discarding it in favour of using a kunai like he did in canon. I mean, he even received training in tanto's as an Anbu, so I see no reason for him not to use his powerful ancestral blade. As a result he gained the nickname "Second coming of the White Fang" instead of the much lamer "Copy ninja".

You're probably right about it being confusing - overall I think I've been too eager to change little things like Tsunami's name and it throws people off.

  I don't understand why Zabuza ran off either. He used the eight gates.
#+end_quote

It's a bit questionable (which is why Kakashi was surprised), but you have to consider Zabuza's perspective: The eight gates damage the user's body (even if Zabuza was using only the first and second or so), Zabuza does not have any clones left to protect him and Kakashi up until this point seemed almost unbeatable to him. So fighting just doesn't seem worth the risk. Also, like you said, he was very much affected by Kakashi's psychological tricks at this point, just like in canon where he also lost it and was soundly beaten as a result (both times).

I also wanted to highlight the point that rational ninjas would almost never take unnecessary risks - you just don't survive to get promoted to Jonin otherwise! Zabuza's plan was never to engage someone as powerful as Kakashi head-on with his real body, because he knows he's weaker than him.

  My question is, what stopped Kakashi from taking his team and hiding if his priority was his team's safety?
#+end_quote

Essentially, this is what he would have done, except that the whole village would have died and Naruto at least would have insisted on fighting to save the Villagers. Even if they had hidden it would not have been guaranteed to work as Z+H were very quick to locate them in the past, making Kakashi suspect they have some sort of sensory technique. But yes, from a strictly selfish perspective, it probably would have been more rational for them to all dig underground and hide out for a few weeks until the threat had passed.

  I find that things are happening because the plot demands it to happen and while it's an interesting read I have a hard time suspending my disbelief with regards to how everybody is acting.
#+end_quote

Hmm, that's somewhat worrisome. Do you have any other examples, or is it just this specific case that feels off to you?
