This is another of my favourite chapters - I would love to hear what you guys think. Was this a satisfying climax to the K vs Z confrontation? Anyone want to issue bets on how the rest of the climax (2 more chapters!) between the kids and Haku will pan out?

To spur any (aspiring) writers as well as commentators that might be reading this, here is again my beta-reader's feedback (which I didn't entirely follow in this case, because I liked the original too much to rewrite it):

  all in all this was an excellent fight scene. These characters make good foils for one another. They now each have outwitted eachother once.

  Although I will note that doing this from the villain's PoV means the reader won't be as invested in the outcome as he would be if you did it from the hero's. You can't ramp up the tension nearly as much, this way. I'm not telling you to change it, mind you. You made your choice, and like I said, it's a very good scene. But it's something to consider when composing arcs. There's the intellectual component: the story has to be believable, has to hang together, has to be interesting and difficult to predict, yet play fair with the information the reader's given. You generally have this down pretty well. But there's also the emotional component, which is generally what really hooks the reader. You have to set the mood, not just of scenes but of chapters and arcs, and have it progress along the curve you want, hitting highs and lows where you want them. The reader has to feel for the characters, and has to experience emotional ups and downs alongside them as he reads along. You have to plan and account for these sinus-lines of emotion just as much as you do the logistics of the battles or the intricacies of the plot.

  Think of it as a musical composition. You can start out slow, or with a bang. You can build up. You can have the crescendo near the middle or near the end. But whatever you do, you have to have a flow in it. An arc. Unless you're a modern classical composer, in which case you want it to be ugly, dissonant, and avoid any possible resemblance to something that the average person might recognise as music. I advise against doing that.
