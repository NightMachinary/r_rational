I liked Zabuza's perspective. I forgot that characters from outside of Konoha don't necessarily know how the sharingan work (they must not be reading enough fanfiction).

I'd expect Haku to mop the floor with Naruto 9 times out of 10 in a fight. I would guess the traidtional Naruto inspirational speech is atempted at some point and then its 50/50 as to whether it dissuades Haku. If Kakashi gets there in time he could maybe bluff that Zabuza is dead or perhaps needs medical atention.

The beta-reader's notes are interesting, thanks.
