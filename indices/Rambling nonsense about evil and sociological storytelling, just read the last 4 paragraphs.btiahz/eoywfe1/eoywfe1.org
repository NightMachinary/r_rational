A very, very good point that you've argued sensibly, thank you. So many people think that they wouldn't do any of the shit they see the Hollywood villains do (or read Nazis/Commies did in History books), and then promptly tell all about what "we should" do about all kinds of topic and how people they disagree with must be subhuman, on their Facetumblitter.
