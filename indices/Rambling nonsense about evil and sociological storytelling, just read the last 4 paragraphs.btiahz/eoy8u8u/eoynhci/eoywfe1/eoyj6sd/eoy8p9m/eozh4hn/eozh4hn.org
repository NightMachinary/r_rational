Reading the article on sci-am gave me a sour taste of deepity. In fact, if we are going to use xkcd's, then this one [[https://xkcd.com/435/]] seems appropriate. So when prof Tufekci labels Dany's abrupt plunge into cartoonish villainy as 'spontaneous psychology' I can't help cringing. This sociologist is salty, and I know this because GOT writing wasn't psychology. That was just bad, lazy writing, period. So maybe that essay has a point, but HBO!GOT is a poor example to illustrate it because the glaring flaws just obscure the nuance, or maybe leave no room for it whatsoever.

So in regards to sociological vs psychological writing, and the writing advice I think the distinction is how many actors does the writer simulate and how well he does. It's fairly easy to tell when the writer does not simulate an actor in his story. The Dothraki in the GOT finale is a good example: so they are in this foreign land, their ruler is treacherously killed, and they react... how? Oh, right they just disappear peacefully. If the writers asked themselves how they would feel if they were an average Dothraki rider, it would be apparent to them that they can't and won't go away peacefully, and this issue has to be addressed, somehow. But nope. So failure or unwillingness to simulate enough actors is /laziness/ and it's a deadly sin. Then there's /quality/, which stems from how diverse and accurate these actor models are, which is where the 'knowledge of medieval stuff' helps. This is less of a sin, because we, readers, are also biased and are not very good at modeling medieval peasants inside our heads, so we can give presentism a pass. At least to some degree. Ideally, you want to simulate in earnest, but in terms of practicality, building a set of decent Chinese rooms for minor characters is okay. Let's call it our 'Chinese hotel'. Then we add some real models of our main cast to explore this hotel and we have a story that feels /alive/ (no laziness) and /authentic/ (no, or at least not too much presentism). Last seasons of GOT fail on both count. It wasn't perfect in terms of authenticity from the start (but it was good enough!) but it /really/ dropped the ball on laziness.

This is reductionism, I guess. And yeah, "sociological" writing is just "psychological" writing done non-lazily and authentically on a large-groop scale.

AKA Simply Good Writing.
