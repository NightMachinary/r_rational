Great essay, and I agree with a lot of points but... why do you say Joffrey is "tragic"? As far as evil goes, he's an example of a character who really goes out of their way to just do evil shit for the lulz, fuck incentives, he does evil stuff /even when it actually goes against his interest/. He's a sadist. Sure, he's young and not exactly mature, and sure, he's grown up in a horrible environment to develop his moral fibre. But so have Tommen and Myrcella, and they're both reasonably good kids. No matter how you put it, the individual Joffrey has many characteristics that can be considered understandably as "hateable".
