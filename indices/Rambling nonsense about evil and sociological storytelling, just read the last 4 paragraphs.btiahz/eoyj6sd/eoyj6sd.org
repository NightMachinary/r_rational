Read the last four paragraphs, and yes, I agree, and actually, I think you make the good point in a very succinct way:

"Robb's problem, and what makes this sociological storytelling, is that the universe does not know that Robb Stark is the main character. He wants Edmure Tully to lure the Mountain in while the Mountain continues to brutalize Edmure's home. But actually, Edmure is the main character..."

I think this is really well put, actually. Sociological storytelling (among other factors) then has two parts: from the universe's perspective, there is no main character; from each character's perspective, they are the main character.

I think PGtE does this really well, as well, and frequently takes huge advantage of the degree to which each person actually is the universe's main character, at least for their part of it.

Like, in the Pilgrim's universe, he's DEFINITELY the main character. In living Akua's universe, she's definitely the main character. Up until they're not, and I feel like this really comes through when you read their perspective chapters - especially Pilgrim's. Cat (and the Bard) are kind of the only two for whom that's not completely true (ironic, given that Cat is the literal main character).
