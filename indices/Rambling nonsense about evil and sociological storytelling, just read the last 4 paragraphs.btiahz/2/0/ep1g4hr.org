A lot of problems in this world can't realistically be "solved" without a lot of people dying. (Slavery in the US wasn't resolved until the American Civil War, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has people on both sides who would rather die than give in to the other.) The "least evil" strategy for dealing with these kinds of problems is often /not to deal with them/ - let the armed insurgency go on for thirty years instead of acting like Saddam Hussein or Stalin and killing as many people as it takes to end it, regardless of whether those people are "innocent" or not. Eventually the insurgents will get old and die, and if you're lucky the next generation won't carry on the fight.
