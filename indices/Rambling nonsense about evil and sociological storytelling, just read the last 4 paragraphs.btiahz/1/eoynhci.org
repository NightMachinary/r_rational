  Why is it rational for Robb to start a war so he can maintain power? Only if he values his own power more than the lives of thousands of innocents. Which makes him an asshole.

Maybe he's reasonably assuming that he makes a good enough king and whoever replaces him is likely to be worse, and the net loss from that is more than what it takes to keep him in power?

And that if you don't punish the evil other people may follow suit?
