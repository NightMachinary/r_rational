ok. sorry i misunderstood. thing is, timecube literally commented above that expressing insecurity over his post because it wasn't written like a perfect standard formal english essay and was saying he wasn't going to post that stuff here anymore because of it. it looked like you were kinda twisting that knife a little. I'm glad to see I was wrong about that. :)
