I think a TLA fic could be good, but it would be much harder to do than Harry Potter, for the reasons you described. The characters don't have to, and really shouldnt, start off as making extremely smart decisions and having few character flaws. You could have Zuko consumed by his quest for vengeance, and eventually realize that honor isnt all that it's cracked up to be, or that taking down the Fire Lord is the only way to bring peace to the world. Aang could still be the same character, but then he is forced to deal with the consequences of not being aggressive towards the fire nation, or in not using his power to stop them while they wage war on the Earth kingdom. Or maybe even allowing the Earth King to have so much power in the first place.

Arguably, many of these themes that I described are already present in the show, and that is part of the reason the show is so great, but they could still be expanded upon, and have a more lasting effect on Aang and the rest of the group.

Something else I thought of: what if the Avatar state, instead of giving the combined bending power of all the avatars, gave the combined knowledge of all of them? Like, Aang is no more powerful in the avatar state, in terms of bending, than he is normally, but he understands bending on such a deep level that he becomes vastly more powerful because of it. Then gradually he learns how bending works at such a deep level in his normal form that he is effectively always in the avatar state. Could be really interesting mechanic
