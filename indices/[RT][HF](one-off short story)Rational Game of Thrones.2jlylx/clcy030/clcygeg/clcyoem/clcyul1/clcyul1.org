Not obviously to me, in this case because the plot is so linear. What critical choices does Luke make, aside from abandoning his training to face Vader? If we make that rational, then Luke sensibly listens to Yoda and that confrontation doesn't happen, so....

There's also the problem that making things rational obviates a lot of the plot, like the very existence of a death star or its glaring weak point, the weapons used and the depiction of space flight....

It all depends on the author and the ideas they have, but it seems to me that a serious rational take on Star Wars would require such significant changes you might as well make it original fiction. I don't think the "Star Wars feel" lends itself to rational fiction the way the "Harry Potter feel" so aptly has. Then again, maybe I'm wrong and you could tell a really interesting story about the Force being some kind of intelligence amplifier and a war between supersmart beings across a galaxy. But is that really Star Wars? The amazing thing about HPMOR for all its changes is that it still feels like reading /Harry Potter/.

Admittedly, all of this could just be the bias from having seen Harry Potter rationalized well, and it's possible that had Yudkowsky chosen to write Star Wars IV: A New Way of Thinking, I would be arguing something very different here.
