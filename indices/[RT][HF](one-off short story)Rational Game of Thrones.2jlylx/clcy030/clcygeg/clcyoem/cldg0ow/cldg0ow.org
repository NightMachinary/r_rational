I've got a single change, Rational Star Wars fanfic story 90% done. About 20k words long for the first (almost complete) part. It covers from Obi-Wan's training (briefly) up to a (by that point) almost totally AU /A New Hope/ (the first Star Wars movie) opening scenes.

The change is Qui-Gon helping young Obi-Wan to deal with his female relationships rationally, instead of just watching and encouraging him to ignore a series of interested women, including his life-long friend and fellow Jedi. Basically, I went through the teacher and apprentice working out how to manage the risks of attachment and strong emotions that Jedi face, and the ripples moving outward from that. I also expand on what those emotional issues really are, not just leaving it as a "fall in love: fall to the dark side" sort of thing.

The twist? Force users all unconsciously low-level mind control/force persuade people by accident when emotionally roused. This is not incompatible with movie and even EU canon. In fact, canon Anakin's super-awkward love affair with Padme makes horrible sense in light of this fanon.
