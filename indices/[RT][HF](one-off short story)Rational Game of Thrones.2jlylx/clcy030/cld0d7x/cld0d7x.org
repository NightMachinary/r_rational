You're not wrong, and it's really why this is just a short thing instead of a beginning of a larger work of fan fiction. I'm rereading the Song of Ice and Fire books and was wondering to myself what small deviations at the beginning could have the largest changes later on. Since it's so character-driven, it allows for a lot more chaos (in the proper sense) than event-driven fiction, I think. This is just one such possible divergence point, where I figured a character could (at least somewhat) realistically make a different choice which would drastically alter the outcome of the whole story.

(Besides, I've always felt that someone needed to point out that surviving a years-long winter probably isn't even possible for a medieval-esque society. Think about how hard the struggle was for pre-industrial people to even make it through two or three MONTHS of winter...)
