I always felt like a rational game of thrones would not go well. The characters in the story are not always rational, but they all have personal motivations, and are generally consistent with them. If this chapter was transplanted into the books, it would be really weird, because suddenly Ned, who's most prominant trait is to do the honorable thing at all costs, suddenly goes back on that honor in order to do a more coldly calculated task. I get that this is fan fiction, but it just feels kinda odd.

Ultimately, I think GoT rational fan fiction doesnt really work because the characters are all usually pretty "rational", in the sense that they do logically consistent things based on their own personal morality. This may not always be the most optimal thing to do, but the characters arent dumb. The difference between rational GoT and regular GoT is small enough that it wouldnt really be appreciated much, and in the same vein, noone hase tried rational Watchmen, as it really just wouldn't be all that different, and would go against the main themes of the book
