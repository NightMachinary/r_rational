I think it's not a coincidence that the characters most rationalized in HPMOR are characters who were never very complex, 3-dimensional, or even just interesting in canon. When the appeal of the story is primarily the world, you can make bland, dull Harry into a very different person and still have a story that feels like /Harry Potter./ When the story is more about the characters and their choices, making them very different characters wouldn't feel like the same story.

Of course it ultimately depends on the writer's skill, but this is e.g. why I think a rational /The Last Airbender/ wouldn't be very good. A story about Zuko making sensible choices from the start or Aang being a calculating utilitarian who has no problem using his full power to defeat the Fire Nation isn't a different story from TLA, it's the /nullification/ of the story.

Superman, HPMOR, Lord of the Rings, these are great for rational fiction. Character-based stories like Got, TLA, and so on don't have such obvious alternative rational stories waiting to be written. Maybe it just needs a skillful author and an innovative take on rational fiction, but I don't see it.
