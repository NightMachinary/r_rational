Sure, but since those themes are in the show, it sounds like regular fanfiction rather than rational fanfiction. Could still be good.

  I thought of: what if the Avatar state, instead of giving the combined bending power of all the avatars, gave the combined knowledge of all of them?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10603283/13/People-Whom-the-Stars-Watch][Way ahead of you]] (plus shitty astronomy). Yes this is definitely how the Avatar state should be handled in rational fiction (which mine is definitely not).

  Then gradually he learns how bending works at such a deep level in his normal form that he is effectively always in the avatar state.

Meh, Goku and Gohan already did that. Besides, it would get kind of overpowered. Also, presumably if that worked you could simply teach anyone to be that powerful. But maybe that's actually the point, and Aang creates a group of transbenders or something. Could be interesting.
