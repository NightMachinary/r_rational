Will do. It isn't rational/ist/ yet, though I might briefly scrub it over with an eye towards that before my first draft is done. Put in some more logical plot clues, a little more mystery, and some in-depth problem solving.

I want to finish the short story before publishing, because I've got so much else on my plate that I can't do the write-post-write-post thing right now.

If it works, I was intending to write the entire 4-6 movie time period, and maybe even some new Jedi-era stuff. Maybe another 20k words each. After that, I might just write a Rational Jedi World novel with all OCs.

Something like that could even have the serial numbers filed off and be turned into an "original" fiction novel. We'll see.
