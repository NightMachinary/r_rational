My personal opinion is that Star Wars would be great for it. If you've ever read the /Hand of Thrawn/ trilogy, it comes somewhat close to not having bullshit space opera all over the place, with a villain that actually seems smart. Or the KOTOR games, which flesh out the Jedi and Sith distinction and make it a lot less clear cut that the Jedi are paragons of good, whatever that is.

Though it's not really that Star Wars is flat per se, it's that it's /very/ archetypal and goes for spectacle over thoughtfulness. Star Wars is all about the hero's journey, and I think sacrifices a lot for that (which isn't to say that you can't have a hero's journey and thoughtfulness).
