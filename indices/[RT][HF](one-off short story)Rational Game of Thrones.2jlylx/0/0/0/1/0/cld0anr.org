Maybe it could be more of a fight between Luke and the Emperor, instead of primarily Luke and Darth? Like Luke needs to work hard in order to counter the propaganda that the Empire uses, and the Death Star was used for more convoluted reasons than just blowing up planets. Before the EU was made mostly non-canon, it was theorized, with decent evidence, that the Emperor was building such massive fleets in order to fight the upcoming invasion of the Yuzhun Vong (how the hell do you spell this?).

Luke finally, after years and countless deaths, through innumerable hardships, finally struck down the Emperor, as his fleets burned around him. The Death Star was gone, as well as most of the Rebel fleet, all attempting to take down this power-mad tyrant. As the Emperor takes his final breaths, Luke hears him talking, at first unintelligibly, but as he listens more he begins to pick out the words the dying man is speaking.

"You fool. You've doomed us all. There is an invasion comong, the likes of which this gakaxy has never seen. They are the world eaters, the darkness in the sky, the oncoming storm. They will tear this galaxy asunder, and make everything in their own image. Everything I have done, from the propaganda to the slavery, the destruction of worlds down to the smallest dark ritual, has been in an effort to give this galaxy the chance to fight back against this threat, this galaxy spanning extinction event. I have not been a good man. I have tortured and enslaved millions, torn families and governmemts and worlds apart, in order to get just one more fleet, one more cruiser into the sky. Because without if we fail to confront this foe, our galaxy shall burn, and every cruelty I have inflicted will seem as nothing to that. Your father, the man that you killed, was the only other person to share my vision, to know what was coming and to take steps against it, while everyone else cowered in fear against this atrocity making its way towards us."

"But you, /boy/, have ruined everything. You have destroyed my fleets and superweapons, the things that so many had to suffer and die to build, in your naive quest to save this galaxy from the tyrant you thought me to be. Now, all hope is lost. This civilization shall die, consumed by this greatest foe, because some child thought to do good."

"My only consolation is that I shall not live to see the horrors that await you. I was prepared to be history's greatest villain, but I had hoped for there to be a history to have."
