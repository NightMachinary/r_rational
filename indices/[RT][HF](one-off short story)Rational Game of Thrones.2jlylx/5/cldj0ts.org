Personally I've kinda been sloshing an idea around in my head about Tyrian taking over, using his proclivity for inventions that's been way under-utilized (remember that saddle he made Bran like it just wasn't even a thing?) I'm thinking things like Wildfire-powered air balloon/zeppelin bombers and reverse-engineering or even /improving/ valyrian steel and equipping legions of mercenaries with it (bought with money he made selling a few more inventions to the Iron Bank, of course)
