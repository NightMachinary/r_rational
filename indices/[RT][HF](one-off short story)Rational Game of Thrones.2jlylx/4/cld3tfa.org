So let's see, what's the smartest thing for Ned to do at this point? Without him around the Lannisters will probably manage to get Robert killed eventually and Joffrey on the throne, but the Starks and the North won't be involved. Would Stannis and Renly still rise against Joffrey without Ned's actions in GoT?

The situation on the Wall will be much better, since presumably once things start to get serious Ned will raise his banners and help out, giving the defenders twenty times more men than they have in the books, and thus easily defeating any Wildling attack.
