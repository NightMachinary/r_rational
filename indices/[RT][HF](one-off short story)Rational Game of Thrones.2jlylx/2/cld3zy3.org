The issue with this is it changes Ned's character halfway through his life. If he's supposed to be all rational, why didn't he take different actions earlier on?

It's also generally tougher to do the 'one character acts much more rationally' concept for GoT, since there are so many plotlines going on at once, most of the story would still be the same. Still, if you were to go for it maybe it would be wise to have the rational character to be one of the younger characters - maybe Jon or Robb or Daenarys.

Or, for a real change, how about rational!Joffrey? Say for whatever reason he's less of an inborn psycho, and maybe forms an attachment to some friendly Maester who tries to pass on some critical thinking. Things progress mostly as in the books until he becomes King, and then go totally off the rails. What does an intelligent and non-evil Joffrey get up to once he's king?
