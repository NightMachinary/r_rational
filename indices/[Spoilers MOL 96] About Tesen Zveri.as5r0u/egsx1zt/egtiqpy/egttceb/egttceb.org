I assumed that Tessen and Zack had an early each restart encounter similar to Zorian and Ilsa.

Probably something along the lines of Tessen runs into Zack as he's leaving for the day and because of the timeloop doesn't realize that it's a bad idea to try and assert the kind of authority adults try to assert over a teenager in their care who looks like he's going to go bar hopping instead of go to school.
