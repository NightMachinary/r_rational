To be more specific Tesen would A) have tried to access Zachs mind to trigger that kind of aggressiv reaction or B) Have knowledge about the content of Zachs contract, thus forcing this very aggressiv behaviour from Zach. Maybe even without Zach knowing why exactly he is so angry. if there is a C) option i have missed it.
