A lot of it is probably that Tesen is just an acceptable target. Even if Zach's anger has dulled over the course of the loops, he still probably thinks Tesen is the worst person within 10 miles (with the fewest consequences for fighting). Therefore, if he's pissed at the start of a loop (because of Red Robe or because he died against a dragon or whatever), then Tesen is the obvious choice to take some of his anger out on.
