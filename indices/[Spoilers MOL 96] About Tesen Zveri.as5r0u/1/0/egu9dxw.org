I really dont think Tesen is RR, I always suspected Jornak, so thats cleared out. But i still think its kind of off for Zach to always be so angry about Tesen, sure the reasons are there and obvious, but that guy was in the loop for what 30 years? He should have adapted to that and zach doesnt strike me as incapable to tame his own feelings. But he kicked Tesens butt a lot and we still dont know how exactly his mind was affected, sure RR is a mind mage but is he good enough?, and i could see some clever way of utilizing Tesen to affect Zach, or Tesen doing so to controll him even bevor the loop. Remember Zach is sleeping at the beginning of every restart, and we dont know what tesen is doing exactly. But just think about Tesen going for his "regular" mind reading update, Zachs contract reacting , and zach kicking Tesens butt in anger.
