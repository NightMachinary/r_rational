The reason Zach is pissed at him is because he's completely ruined Zach's entire family's fortune and inheritance while acting as a benefactor. He's pissed because he's been used without his knowledge, and with the tacit approval and knowledge of most noble clans, including the royalty. He's angry at him for perfectly justified reasons, so I don't see why this is the part you find particularly strange. If Tesen was Red Robe (as I think you're implying), then Zach should have observed unusual activity on his end at some point within the restart, or should have observed that he reacted differently in their fights, even in a very minor way. And Red Robe would have needed to have one simulacrum permanently dedicated to playing normal Tesen in every single restart in which he was still in the loop, doing the exact same actions, the same conversations, and using the same spells with the same proficiency. Although I realize that he could have just sent simulacrums to do this every time and therefore the real one would have no idea of exactly how tedious it truly is, this still seems unlikely to me.
