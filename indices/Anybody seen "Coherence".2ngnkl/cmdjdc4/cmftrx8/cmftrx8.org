I also liked Interstellar, additional assertions of brotherhood and commonality. The music, though, I didn't like at all. Sweeping, dramatic orchestral scores are fine, but there's a time for them, and when the sweeping orchestral scores are literally so loud that I can't hear plot-relevant dialogue, You're Doing It Wrong.

I didn't know what Coherence was and clicked this thread from curiosity. Having seen the trailer now, I will continue my disinterest. Internet Guy Away!
