Thank you for showing me links to his stories. I've been finding more and more of his writings to read, but there's always just one more story of his I missed.

For people first learning about rationalist fiction, I consider Ted Chiang's works to be */the/* first thing one should read, then Eliezer's short fiction stories as a warm-up before hitting them with the epic length ones like HMPOR, Luminosity, Worm, and Ra. The finale is, of course, a lifetime membership on [[/r/rational]] as one of our minions to scour the Internet for more rationalist gems.
