The fact that Chiang's work is considered rationalist fiction confirms my suspicion that "rationalist fiction" really only means: "fiction that some rationalists enjoy".

I really don't see what do his stories have in common with MoR and other core-rationalist works. They don't try to demonstrate any principles of proper thinking, the characters sometimes are scientifically-minded and sometimes they are not, sometimes they act intelligently and sometimes they flail around, the stories seem to be designed to get a strong emotional response from the reader rather than teach anything. You could almost say they are religion-flavored as much as they are rationality-flavored. If Chiang's stories are an example of a genre other than the sci-fi, I don't know what it is. There are lots of authors (like Watts, or Asimov or many others) I'd call rationalist authors before I'd call Chiang that.
