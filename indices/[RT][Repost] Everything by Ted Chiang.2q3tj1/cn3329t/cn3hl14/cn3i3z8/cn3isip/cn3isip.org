It's probable we're using different definitions for what goes in this subreddit, so a direct discussion of whether Chiang's work belongs here would result in us talking past each other. I propose we talk about, in general, what sort of literature belongs here instead, then transition back to talking about Chiang. This way, we'll address the source of our disagreement. How does that sound?

I think things that belong here are things with acceptably good worldbuilding that involve characters reacting internally consistently/reasonably within the world that's constructed-- this should apply to both protagonists and antagonists. I think asspulls of character abilities and features of the world should generally be avoided, and characters shouldn't act unusually stupid, unless that character is in fact unusually stupid.

All of that is required, plus at least one more thing like exploring an idea or deconstructing a world, or teaching me something about how to think, even if I don't want to.

I think something like a character flailing around, assuming that that's what someone would actually do, is fine. I think a character not being scientifically-minded, assuming that they're not in fact a scientist, is fine. I don't even think that being religion-flavored (see: /Hell is the Absence of God/) is at odds with being a rational work. Ted Chiang constructs in that short story a world that takes certain religious ideas to their logical extremes, and although his character is entirely driven by emotion and love for his wife, and it's a world with a literal heaven, hell, angels, etc, none of that makes it non-religious.

I also liked /The Truth of the Fact, the Truth of the Feeling/ and after reading that I really am a lot more critical about what I remember and don't remember. I'm pretty sure I'm actually a better rationalist because I read that work, a work featuring a character who acts on his emotions and is pretty irrational. A work doesn't have to be about a rationalist to be a rationalist work.

I also think that even by your somewhat more stringent definition, /Exhalation/ is a rationalist work. The character doesn't flail around, acts intelligently, demonstrates hella principles of proper thinking, and is literally a scientist for whom making a scientific discovery is the big deal. Perhaps we could compromise on "Ted Chiang is an excellent writer, and some of his stuff is rationalist even if it isn't all rationalist"?
