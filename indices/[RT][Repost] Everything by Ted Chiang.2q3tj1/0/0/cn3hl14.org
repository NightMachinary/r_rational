I agree that Ted Chiang is probably the first thing people should read to get into rationalist fiction. When I want to get someone interested in this genre, I link them to the online version of /Exhalation/ without explaining that it's explicitly a rationalist story. If they like /Exhalation/ then I lend them /Stories of Your Life and Others/ and we see where things go from there.

Chiang's stories are a good introduction because in addition to being well-written, they're not fanfic. Fanfiction automatically turns some people off from the genre. If you're trying to convince someone to enjoy a new type of literature, and the example you're showing them is fanfiction, you're actually trying to convince someone to enjoy two new types of literature and are fighting a two-front war. Once you start getting into a long explanation that sounds like "yes, some fanfic is awful, well, ok, most fanfic is awful, but /this/ fanfic is ok," you're already well past Belorussia and heading into Moscow in December. Things aren't going great.
