I'm actually pretty ok with people submitting lots of very different stories here, basically whatever they happen to like. We are nowhere near the point where too many submissions would become a problem. (Maybe I should also mention that I really, really like Chiang's work and that it's possibly my favorite thing on this sub, and nothing I said about it should be interpreted to mean that it's not worth reading.)

It's just that when people confidently talk about the existence of a genre I want there to be a sort of neatly defined, distinct cluster of works that form it, otherwise I start feeling iffy, and I worry that if we stretch the boundaries far enough to include the entire Chiang's output, we'll end up with a definition so wide, that it will include every single serous, thoughtful book ever written, except maybe the ones that are extremely poorly written or outlandishly po-mo. I fear that some people go: "I really liked this sandwich! Therefore it must be a Rationalist Sandwich, a shining example of the Rational Cuisine!" and then they proceed to use the word "rational" to mean "that which I like". I'm weary about the dilution of meaning.

I agree that Truth of Fact and Liking What You See feel pretty rationalist (even in the narrow sense), because they are centered around characters struggling with their biases and it can make you examine your own thoughts.
