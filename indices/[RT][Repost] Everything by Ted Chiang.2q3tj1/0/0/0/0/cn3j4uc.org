Here's the way I put it over at my blog earlier in the year:

#+begin_quote
  When he writes, Ted Chiang dissects our universe. He keeps cutting until he finds something interesting, one little bit of reality that captures his interest. He then removes this piece, studies it, and alters it ever so slightly to create a unique and fascinating premise for a story. Then he surgically re-inserts this altered bit, re-composes reality, and finally creates the story that would arise naturally from that little bit of the universe being different. And as you examine this story, you can see reflected in its surfaces and vertices what the original piece of our world was. By presenting us a story where that piece is different, it brings light to how that original piece shapes our own reality.

This isn't true of every story, but it is true of many. And the latter ones moreso. This feels like a rationalist-sorta thing to do, even if perhaps the story itself doesn't fit the criteria we commonly use to classify things as rationalist.
