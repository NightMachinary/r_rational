Ted Chiang is one of my favourite authors, I can't recommend him enough. He's a brilliant writer, and he seems incredibly knowledgeable about a lot of things, even accounting for the fact that he chose what to mention in his writing. I'd strongly recommend /The Story of Your life and Others/ and /Understand/. /Understand/ is a good example of a super-intelligent character being written well, and the limits of super-intelligence actually being explored.

/The Story of Your Life and Others/ draws parallels between linguistics and physics, and it touches strongly upon the concepts of free will and determinism. It's about first contact with truly /alien/ aliens who visit Earth.
