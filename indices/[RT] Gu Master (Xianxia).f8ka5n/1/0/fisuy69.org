Read the first 5 chapters of Forge of Destiny and... very underwhelmed. Protagonist hasn't got a clue what's going on and the story shows them learning the basics but it feels slow. No conflict yet, nor anything that so much as hints at conflict, so it feels slow. Just characters being rude and tactless does not conflict make nor is it particularly interesting. Like, in the first 5 chapters of the most recent story I wrote, I already showcased the setting, explained the characteristics of the magic system including some rationalist exploits, introduced twice as many characters as this one, involved the protagonist in multiple stratagems, had the character go through multiple skirmishes and a major battle, and make some very difficult choices that clearly showcased the protagonist's ability, worldview and moral system.

Curious what you like about it from the later chapters, so can I better decide whether to keep reading it?
