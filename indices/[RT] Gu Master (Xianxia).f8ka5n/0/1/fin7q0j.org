I think I disagree, at least with your specific examples.

The shape of the world is admittedly not something that's explained, but I don't think it's inherently nonsensical. It doesn't contradict anything else in the setting, and I actually suspect it'll be a plot point eventually.

The "online auction house" takes a cut of all the sales, which shuts down most shenanigans. The "owner" is basically an AI that's immune to bribery, with one specific weakness that gets taken advantage of later in the story, which is that its utility function is basically to acquire pieces of Yellow Heaven, and if it's given a large piece (incredibly expensive) it will shut down the site while it absorbs it.

The time chamber shenanigans /are/ munchkinned heavily where possible, but the regular heavenly tribulations and exact natural lifespans and extreme scarcity of Lifespan Gu logically almost entirely shuts down most possible munchkinry in a believable fashion.
