Here is a counter-recommendation for rationalist readers.

The worldbuilding in Gu Daoist Master makes no sense and doesn't even try to. Just try to picture what the world looks like. The Gu world is divided into 5 regions that correspond to an ancient chinese cosmological concept, the central plains and the four cardinal directions. Even if the Gu world is supposed to be a flat plane and not a spheroid, what is east of Eastern Sea and west of Western Desert? Is it just an invisible wall, like in a Bethesda game? The world can't be spherical either since there is nothing to suggest contiguity between Eastern Sea and Western Desert. The author never goes into this and I suspect he doesn't really care either, even if it really matters to the coherence.

Ever read Methods of Rationality? Gu Daoist Master would give the Potterverse a run for its money. All of a sudden the author will introduce something totally wacky and gamebreakingly OP, like an online auction house for immortals that clears transactions instantly, or dimensional pockets that accelerate time like a hyperbolic time chamber. Just thinking through the implications of any one of these fully (interest rates? arbitrage? bueller?) would shatter the worldbuilding to pieces. Combine them and its munchkin city.

I really like Gu Daoist Master. It aspires to a literary, mythic quality that few others dare. I enjoy Fang Yuan's insane gambits and the rollercoaster battles of wits he is constantly in. Characters are all Level 1 or 2 Intelligent. And the author has no rose-tinted view of his own society. But I find it very hard to recommend to [[/r/rational]]
