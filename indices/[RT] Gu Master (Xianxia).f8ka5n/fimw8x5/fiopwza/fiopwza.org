  Even if the Gu world is supposed to be a flat plane and not a spheroid, what is east of Eastern Sea and west of Western Desert?

Writers are allowed to posit a setting as crazy as they want, it just makes it Not The Real World, it wouldn't make it irrational. The way it's shown, it's entirely self-consistent.

We have that in the real world and it isn't worldbreakingly OP. RuneScape has the Grand Exchange and that isn't gamebreakingly OP either. There's not necessarily any arbitrage opportunities to exploit, nor is there any fixed income securities market in this story (which you'd need in order to work interest rates). I agree that Treasure Yellow Heaven just came out of nowhere and was then taken for granted, but to be fair, IIRC, it was introduced pretty much as soon as the MC was actually able to be a participant in it, and is then shown consistently thereafter.
