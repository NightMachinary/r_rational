  The shape of the world is admittedly not something that's explained, but I don't think it's inherently nonsensical. It doesn't contradict anything else in the setting, and I actually suspect it'll be a plot point eventually.

It completely is! So much attention is given to the difficulty of travel between regions, the nature of the magical boundaries and their layers, and hence the monopoly power of polities/entities that can facilitate cross-regional trade, the incredible scale of organizations that can accumulate treasures from the entire world, and the sheer OPness of Fang Yuan's teleport.

So I think it's worth asking a basic question about what the "edge of the world" looks like.

Even if this is a world without a pythagoras, surely this should have occurred to Fang Yuan, a reincarnator from Earth.

tbh even if it was a X00% markup on the market value the sheer nature of instantaneous transportation of goods from anywhere to anywhere with just a fee is frankly, insanely economy breaking. And let's not even go into how it is supposed to work because afaicr that was handwaved.
