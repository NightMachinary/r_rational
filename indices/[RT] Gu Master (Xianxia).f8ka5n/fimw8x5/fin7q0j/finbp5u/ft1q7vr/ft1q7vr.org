I'll cede that geography is a problem (~2200 chapters in the world has still not been described) but the 'Auction House' is 100% exploited by anyone and everyone with access to it. If you can think of an exploit it was probably used or attempted at one point.

​

Anyone who is rich enough uses it as a Bag of Holding, people price gouge important items in real time during fights, it's used to hide or trade magic items, it's used to display trophies, it's used as a cell phone, and so much more. The only limitation imposed on it seems to be that it can't transport Immortal (level 6+) Mages and that you need to be able to encapsulate the entire object you want to transport with your magic, meaning people can't "sell" themself to a friend for the sake of teleportation and they can't "sell" the entire world to leave everyone floating in the void.

There are dozens of in-universe exploits and counter-exploits and tricks that are all put to the test repeatedly as people search for micro-advantages during what is effectively a 2200 chapter novel of endless fighting:dying people leave an Auction House Avatar to sell your items (so the enemy gets nothing) AND to inform your friends of the exact circumstances of your demise, teleporting the components of a spell to a friend instead of physically handing them over to get a half-second advantage during a fight, stealing objects and then publically holding them ransom, bothering a dead person's someone's Auction House Avatar with piles of tiny transactions to make it run out of energy and disperse a bit earlier, selling items with 'tracking chips' to find out where the buyer is hiding, selling defective goods that were impossible to appraise...

​

There are dozens of people who almost exclusively buy items of limited supply and then resell them once those supplies run out, carefully calculating their to make half-cent profits because they're freaking poor and any profit is better than no profit at all. People steal MOUNTAINS and resell them; they lose money and magical energy and time and effort, but the entire point was to screw over another party. One person basically used the Auction House as a monster summoning portal during a fight: he uses up all of his money and valuables and information to buy monster after monster after monster to stall his enemy while working on something else. Nudes are traded. Fight VODs are sold at low prices out of spite so that even if you lose this battle other people can strategize against your opponent's fighting style. Fight VODs are specifically not openly sold, so two people fighting know that this battle doesn't need to be a deathmatch.
