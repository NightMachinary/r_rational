It's slow burning, yes. I don't mind slow burning stories at all.

The story is originally a quest on sufficient velocity, still ongoing. The readers are learning together with the protagonist, they both have almost no contextual knowledge for cultivator society. Cue bumbling around in the early chapters. They learn.

And did you catch the part where any open conflict is /banned/ in the first month? Of course there isn't much of it. Things pick up after the ban expires.

Things I like in the later chapters: /excellent/ worldbuilding, the author put a lot of effort in creating a world fitting the genre yet unique, very good friendly relationships between characters (and interesting characters in general), good power level pacing (protag grows very fast, but not absurdly so, like many Chinese novels tend to do, firmly securing a fourth position in her age class... while developing support + crowd control build).
