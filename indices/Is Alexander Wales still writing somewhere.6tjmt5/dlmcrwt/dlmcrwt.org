Writing yes, publishing, not so much. Glimwarden will start updating again once I've written to the end of the first book and not before; that might be a while. I've written a novel and novella in that time, but won't be publishing those unless it's traditional publishing. I did write about 80K words of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ in the last year, linked to in this thread.

(I have also posted a few things to this subreddit under pseudonym, especially to the weekly challenge, but those are of somewhat lesser quality because I use them as writing exercises and don't do much editing, so I don't want to link them to this account.)
