I hadn't realised this was completed! Just finished reading; I find myself thinking that, given there have been spirit-callers before, the most important thing a spirit-caller should be doing is to arrange communication devices that allow others to communicate like spirit-callers can. Maybe not permanent in the longest term, but they would only have to remain in use until near when the next spirit-caller was born (a self-duplication-on-command function would help), but otherwise everyone would be back in the same place within three generations, all items/wards/prices intractable again. Even items that would imitate specific communication signals would be helpful, such as a very specific oathkeeper-related one...

(That aside, at the end somehow I kept thinking of the ending boss fight of BioShock. *amusement*)
