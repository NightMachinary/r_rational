Neat. I guess we can confirm that individual active healing skills can't be stacked, but they can synergize with passive ones. Based on the rough description of the play area, looks like my depiction of the whole arena as a bullseye was spot on, though I have to wonder why the author segmented the bullseye into sections of four rather than five, given the whole 5-element motif going on.

Depending on their strategy, one of their best bets could be to try to find an adjacent elemental statue before another species does by assuming they're arranged roughly like a pentagram around the boss. Given the distance to get from the pillar to the center, they would be able to hit at least one more pillar before the time limit. +2 elemental affinity to their entire group is one of the best rewards we've seen. Now that they're going to build a shelter a lot of their group probably won't go for an aggressive strategy like that, though.
