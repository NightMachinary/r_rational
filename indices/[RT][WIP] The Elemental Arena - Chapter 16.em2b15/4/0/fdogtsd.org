No way to know yet, but i'm guessing that everyone else got their affinity by reading a cached message, as normal.

Ambushing enemies incapacitated by the upgrade process looks like a very effective tactic. This would also cost the ambushers the benefit of the obelisk, though.

The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that the best action the humans can take is to found their city near the mid-zone dungeon, then immediately begin to tear into it. If they can kill the zone boss early, they'll control the entire region and be able to harvest it while the other outer region borders are still closed.

Humans have one reasonably sure advantage in this contest - Nathan and Maya's knowledge of the games that inspire their challenge. Rivals will figure this out soon enough. It's already pretty certain that every other species will be Kill On Sight - and it's likely that at least some are physically far more capable.
