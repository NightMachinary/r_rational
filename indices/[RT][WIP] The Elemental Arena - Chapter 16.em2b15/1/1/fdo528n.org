I kind of see your point. The Obelisk of Fire was practically right on top of them if you consider the size of section 14. That's either incredible luck, or else the Arena did this for a reason that is currently unknowable.

The appearance of the Obelisk on Ava's map also seems odd. Once it's discovered, the effect occurs, and then that's it. The appearance on the map hints that either the Obelisk has some continuing importance, or else its /location/ is important. If location is significant, it could well be that the other Obelisks are arranged in Generation order around the central dungeon.

The defense force of the Obelisk might scale up over time - or else, might not. Consider that each site will probably be in territory controlled by a different species. The PvP risk would be far greater by comparison, and would balance out the relatively light threat of the defending monsters.

I think it's likely there are other rewards aside from Obelisks scattered about for explorers as well. Games such as /Heroes of Might and Magic/ or /Master of Magic/ are liberally sprinkled with ruins, caves, temples, and caches of treasure. Tygerion was inspired by this sort of thing.
