In support of the rarity theory: each of the 9 regions within section 14 take hours to cross according to the scale stated in this latest chapter. A feature that rare and potent is very unlikely to be within a half hour walk of camp. Even if an obelisk is within a species controlled area, the odds still look like less than a 1% chance on a random distribution.

The exploration rewards offered so far have been food, medicine, and crude tools -- and have been revealed largely by Nathan's /Wilderness Survival II/. Maybe Matias, Gabriel, or Ava have this skill or its precursor.

I can see encounter areas with lesser rewards (NPs, skills, gear, game hints). It could well be there are clues to the Obelisks scattered about as well.

/Edit: Looking at the generation cycle (the story's title image), I can see that Fire is on the top position. Since Nathan's group is in the "North" (top) part of the human territory, the others might be also in their corresponding place. Maybe Tygerion is stacking the deck by placing all the obelisks around the humans?/
