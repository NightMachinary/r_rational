The collars make elemental affinity clear to anyone with a line of sight. Hiding them may not even be possible - consider that Nathan's wristband flowed around his glove. These devices will also make it clear when a battle is PvP rather than a monster attack.

Tactics based on elements look to be a very promising tangent in the story. Destroy a species' Earth Primes early and they cannot fortify. Destroy their Water Primes and their healing capabilities are reduced. There are probably significant effects to eliminating other elements as well; we'll see.
