The luck of one of the five totems appearing in the human octant is significant but not unbelievable.

Them randomly wandering across it and it being protected by such a weak miniboss... that doesn't work for me, unless maybe the miniboss scales for the group that finds it, and any totems not found until day four will be much more difficult to claim.

Also I am mildly concerned about protagonist-luck in terms of nothing having happened to randomly change their stats without explanation, like another team or race finding another totem would.
