It's actually not that significant. With 5 totems and 8 quadrants, there's a greater chance than not a species will have one in their territory.

Based on how regular monster spawns seem to scale automatically based on proximity to other players, I wouldn't be surprised if the miniboss did as well. It could also be a time-gated difficulty as you said.

Based on the wording of the totem's message it makes sense for there not to have been any stat changes. The mapping skill confirmed that all the human players are still in their little starting quadrant, and totems specifically affect only your species, so they might not get any notification at all when another species activates one.

For me, our MC's luck has been good but not unrealistic for making smart choices. If anything's felt too good so far it's that the group dynamics have been extremely smooth until now, but I can give that a pass.
