Founding a town is a BIG DEAL and will almost certainly come with NPs and other rewards for participants.

With the constant pressure of the periodic monster attacks, fortification provides an enormous advantage. This same fortification will make inter-species rivalry far different for everyone. If "towns" are relatively safe spots, then crafting and gear will be far more readily available to the players.

I'd also expect elementally-themed structures:

- Wood: Farm, garden, or possibly orchard.

- Fire: NP and/or EP generation

- Earth: Walls and other hard defense

- Metal: Forges or other industry

- Water: A well, possibly with healing properties.

These buildings may even enable limited new skill purchase using NPs.

  +2 elemental affinity to their entire group is one of the best rewards we've seen

Preach it! The damage resistance alone from these affinities makes them worthy of pursuit. Better EP caps and unlocking advanced skills far outstrips even this benefit.

  I guess we can confirm that individual active healing skills can't be stacked, but they can synergize with passive ones.

/I mathed this out in the response thread on Royal Road. The synergy isn't simply additive stacking. The two effects are multiplicative. Nathan would have a x9 recovery speed with an Advanced Healing I buff. With more Water affinity and a higher skill, his recuperation would become near-instant./
