I agree, everyone who contributes NP towards the first building is probably gonna get mad rewards. I guess it'll be a question of how much to invest in static defenses based on the escalation of the past two days. They effectively only need to play defensively for day and a half, since on the fifth day they have to win against the boss or die.

With that in mind, NP investment in buildings is going to be NP that cant be used to increase skills. They can't go too overboard on purchasing yet or they'll be under leveled to fight the boss. There's also the concern that if they all stick around a building to defend the monster spawns will consider them one group and everyone will be stuck running away from the building for spawns then back to defend centrally, which would make it difficult to forage.
