  I think it's likely there are other rewards aside from Obelisks scattered about for explorers as well.

I agree, hence my other observation that it's unlikely the players wouldn't have gotten some other random arena-wide or species-wide or area-effect or whatever else based buff or debuff from someone else somewhere doing something, now that we know at least one such thing exists.

Luck or whatever the principle is that a story is always about the most interesting characters, and if they were less interesting the story would be about someone else.
