If you want an addictive adventure type of novel with a smart protagonist, I recommend The Vorkosigan Saga. It's a series about a hyper intelligent guy with severe physical limitations, and how he uses his cleverness to get around those limitations. If you read HPMOR, you'll have seen several quotes from these novels, a particularly good one is: "The key of strategy is not to choose a path to victory, but to choose so that *all paths* lead to a victory."

You should start with [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61906.The_Warrior_s_Apprentice][The Warrior's Apprentice]]. It's not the first novel (chronologically), but it is the first novel with Miles Vorkosigan as the main character. After that read The Vor Game, and if you're hooked follow [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/98254-vorkosigan-saga-chronological][the chronological order]]. Skip the short/side stories and the prequel books until later, IMO.
