A bit lower. Usual Chinese problems with pace and a bit of harem and pathos.\\
But I can compare it with "Savage Divinity". "Way of choices" is a more deep and scheming (like Practical Guide to Evil) and less wish-fullfillment, but "Savage Divinity" is more... western-like.

Some quotes about meaning of the novel name.

#+begin_quote
  /Chen Changsheng serenely gazed at that star, feeling extremely comfortable, as if that star was his Fated Star./\\
    /The star was peaceful and healthy, overflowing with life, constantly spreading pure and bright rays of light, and not like it was about to be extinguished at all./\\
    /He suddenly realized something./\\
    /Even if he really was going to die in five years, that star would yet continue to shine./\\
    /This fact gave him some comfort, but afterwards, it caused him even more disappointment and grief./\\
    /In the surrounding space of this red star, there were countless other stars./\\
    /He stared at those stars and realized that those stars which hung in the night sky also stared coldly and peacefully back at him. In other words, they were staring at that small red star that belonged to him./\\
    /He suddenly began to feel disturbed, and an extremely strong feeling of fear grew within him. It was just like when he had seen those portraits within the Pavilion of Ascending Mist. He always felt that the people within the portraits stared back at him./\\
    /Those people were already dead, but it seemed as if they were still alive./\\
    /These stars could not speak, but they seemed to want to tell him something./\\

  /Changing fate required one to change the position or brightness of one's Fated Star. Thus, changing the person's position and role within the mortal world, and so.... the positions were related./\\
    /If it was impossible to change the brightness or position of one's Fated Star, then to change the brightness or positions of the surrounding stars could also create a similar effect. The logic was the same. If you wanted to change your fate, you had to first change the fate of other people in your life. The closer the relationship between you and these people, the greater the change in fate you would experience./\\
    /Such as father and son./\\
    /Such as brothers./\\
    /Such as a lord and his subjects./\\
    /This truth was very cold and harsh./\\
    /Chen Changsheng could not confirm whether the images he had seen were illusions or truly history. For the whole night, his body had been drenched in sweat before being dried off. As a result, he felt very cold when he woke up./\\
    /If those bloody, yet cold images were indeed the true face of history, then were the two great lords of Zhou really such cold-blooded people? Was it really worth it to pay such a large price like performing terrifying acts to change fate? Immediately afterwards, he thought of the Divine Empress. If she was the third person who succeeded in changing fate, then how great of a price did she pay?/\\
    /Were those bloody and cruel rumors that had long been circulated among the people true? Was her firstborn son from all those years ago really poisoned to death by the previous queen's assassins or was he truly killed by the Divine Empress herself according to the rumors? Most of her children had never lived past the age of six. Was it really because the imperial palace's environment was too dangerous at that time, or were the children some type of offering? Were they an offering to the stars?/\\
    (...)\\
  /Standing on the high platform in front of the Pavilion of Ascending Mist, he glanced at the morning sun, which had just risen above the horizon. Then, he looked over at the capital, which was being slowly awakened by the morning sun. The countless streets and alleyways seemed to be like the lines of a chessboard, and the countless rivers and water canals seemed like wires, which had been dropped on the board. The countless markets were like an infinite amount of squares, and countless people lived inside the countless residences located within these squares./\\
    /To change his own fate by changing the fate of others; could such a thing really be done? Even if those streets and alleyways became decadent...even if those residences fell into ruins...even if millions of people became homeless...even if there were endless wars and major floods....Did he still have to do it?/\\
    /He remembered the last sentence in Wang Zhice's diary again--There is no such thing as Fate, but only choices./
