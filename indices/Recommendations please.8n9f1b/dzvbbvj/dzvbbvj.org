Not sure that I can help; I haven't read the majority of that list, and Worm I just didn't enjoy (read about half, it wasn't becoming more enjoyable, gave up).

[[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] has written a lot of good stuff IMO, but you didn't like WtC, so...maybe not your thing?

If you haven't already, it's worth taking a look at the recursive HPMoR fanfics. My personal favorites are Following the Phoenix and Significant Digits, but you quite possibly have different tastes, so...maybe Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality?

Oh, and since the stories you like seem a bit darker than mine - Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time was a somewhat interesting time loop.
