I just read Ed stories now, and while the science is clearly magic (unrealistic), the story was a blast to read. At the beginning it appears like a confusing attempt at wish-fulfilment, but as the story progresses the quality picks up and it retroactively smooths over the bumps. Far from rationalist, but it clearly doesn't try to be and it is quite fun and interesting regardless. Thanks for the recommendation.
