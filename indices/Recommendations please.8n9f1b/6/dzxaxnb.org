Since there's already a My Little Pony fanfic thrown in, what the hell, there are more.

There's a whole series of fics connected to [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]]. The premise is simple: tasked with creating an MLP-themed MMO, a game studio creates a superintelligent AI that takes over the world. Its goal is to satisfy human values through friendship, and ponies. Only a cursory knowledge of MLP canon is needed. There are some great spin-offs.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/301077/broken-symmetry][Broken Symmetry]] is a great story on time travel. Hard RT, some RST. However, some knowledge on MLP is probably in order.
