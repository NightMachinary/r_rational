For long stories that were difficult to put down for me (but without timeloops) I will mention [[https://wanderinginn.com/][The Wandering Inn]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]].

For stuff with timeloops I mostly have fanfiction. There is [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]]. Twilight Sparkle is trapped in a time loop that resets upon her death, and needs to figure out how to save the world. In the process of which she becomes utterly badass. And also dies. A lot. One of the sequels, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder]], which has multiple timelooping characters in different loops at the same time. Basically, only the person who actually triggers a reset gets to remember the loop. Which leads to interesting tactical problems when facing another timelooping opponent, and information problems when working with another timelooper. After all, you never share a memory of any of the time loops, so how can you trust each other and work together? Unfortunately it's unfinished and abandoned, but still worth a read despite that.

And then there are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops][The Infinite Loops]]. Which is less of a story rather than a collection of scenes loosely connected by story lines. Timeloops galore for a variety of different canons. Mostly within their own universes, but there are crossover loops where they get stuck in different universes and/or meet people from different universes. Then most characters eventually learn how to create subspace pockets where they can store items in order to take them with them between loops. And the loops don't stop, so it leads to characters with millennia of experience and equipment from a wide range of fictional universes... needless to say they tend to end up hilariously overpowered.
