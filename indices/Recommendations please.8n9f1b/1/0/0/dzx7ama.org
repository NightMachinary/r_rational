Yeah, I can see why. Shards of Honor is not the greatest opener, particularly if you don't also read the sequel, Barrayar. It feels incomplete. In my opinion they're really two parts of a single novel, and should be read that way, back to back.

edit: You should probably go straight to Brother in Arms from The Vor Game, actually. Cetaganda is kind of like a "filler episode" and Ethan of Athos is a side story. Interesting (with the right context), but not relevant to the main plotline.
