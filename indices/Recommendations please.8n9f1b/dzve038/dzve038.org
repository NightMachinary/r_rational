If you like MOL, you should try other novels about gifted and diligent students:

1. "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss
2. [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student][The Good Student]] by mooderino.
3. And

  hence tried some Chinese and Japanese web novels which deal with the hero working hard to get power but was not able to get into them either due to poor writing or long plots or irrationality

Still try [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/way-of-choices/][Way of Choices]]. It have long plot, but still it /have/ plot, and it isn't dumb. It's the only Chinese webnovel worth reading, I think.
