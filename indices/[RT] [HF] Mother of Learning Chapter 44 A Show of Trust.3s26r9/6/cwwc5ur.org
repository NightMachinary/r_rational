As great as this story is, I was a little dissapointed that we didnt get any more emotional reactions/development in this part. I understand how much this story is the "anti-relationship", trying to make its plot the focus as opposed to a vessel for character drama, but Tavien and Zorian have a complicated enough history that I expected Zorian to actually feel things and care about this situation beyond the tactical. Its not bad at all (and he does have some emotional moments) but it still frustrates me.
