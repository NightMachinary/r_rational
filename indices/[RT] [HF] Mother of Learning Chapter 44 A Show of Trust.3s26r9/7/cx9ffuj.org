This will be/was copied and pasted onto several sites, just in case you've seen it before. Anyways.

I have a couple of guesses on things that might happen. They have verious amounts of evidence, so hear me out.

With the whole Silverlake thing happening, at some point Zorian will kill the Grey Hunter. Several things could happen: 1. Silverlake could just take the eggs as a quest item and help Zorian in some way. 2. Zorian just gets the eggs and uses them in some way. 3. Silverlake takes the eggs and uses them to help Zorian. Let's get into the consquences of each one.

1. She could teach Zorian more soul magic, give him soul sight, or just help him in some way. If this happens, it's mostly just speculation. Actually, there might be a way to give him soul sight that would work. More on that later.
2. The eggs could be an unknown way to get Soul Sight. After all, few people kill grey hunters, let alone get their eggs, so they could be really useful in something. They're magic, so maybe Soul Sight. The magic is weak evidence though, nothing was said about their soul, except for shifting. More on that later.
3. Pretty much the same as 2.

So she could help him get soul sight and Zorian might become a shifter. Let's look at other evidence first.

There has been a ton about the time warping rooms. Nobody103 has confirmed that something will happen, but Zorian won't abuse it for training. I think that Zorian could get the dirge larvae for the soul sight potion, put them in a room, get a chrysalis, and then get Silverlake to make him a potion. Boom, soul sight. It's doable, realistic, and there's enough foreshadowing for it. Why would Nobody103 talk about Soul Sight, the moths, the rooms, and Silverlake if not to have him do this? I think it has a good chance of happening. Maybe Kael told Taiven about the moths and soul sight, and Taiven realizes what Zorian could do with the time travel. But first, there's something more important, the packet.

Zorian needs to learn how to open the packet and fast. You probably don't remember, but the Rose Labyrinth Dwellers offered to teach Zorian, saying, "You will live with us for the duration of your lessons. You will eat and sleep in our settlement, hunt with our hunters, patrol our territory with our scouts and otherwise act as a member of our web." Zorian rejected that, thinking about Aranean food, for one thing. But you know what would allow him to accept that offer? If he were an aranean. Or an aranean shifter, anyway. It's highly like for him to end up being a shifter, anyways. He's investigated it a lot and is befriending the daughter of a tribe chief. He could get access to the ritual. And if he can't, he might be able to get an aranean soul transformation potion from Lukav (it would happen if he failed to get the ritual). The weirdest part is whether he would be a male or female aranea. On one hand, he might not be able to bond with a female, because they're sentient, but he might not be allowed to do stuff if he were a male aranea. Weird.

I also think the Silver Wolf is a shifter that lives in the mansion in the middle of nowhere. Maybe Zorian could get the ritual from him.

That's it, I think. Let me know of your thoughts.
