Nobody103 posted on Patreon and Blankdom pm'd me (likely didn't see Nobody103's post). Here are the replies and stuff, to have the speculation in one place (or two, cause I also posted it on the [[/r/rational]] subreddit).

---> Nobody103

Obviously I can't respond constructively to most of this speculation without giving out some massive spoilers. A few things though:

#+begin_quote
  I think that Zorian could get the dirge larvae for the soul sight potion, put them in a room, get a chrysalis, and then get Silverlake to make him a potion. Boom, soul sight.
#+end_quote

That would require a time dilation zone that would compress an entire decade (more, really) into the span of a month. Giving something like that to the protagonist would pretty much destroy any tension in the story, don't you think? It would trivialize 99% of the challenges I could throw at him.

#+begin_quote
  And if he can't, he might be able to get an aranean soul transformation potion from Lukav
#+end_quote

The smarter/saner option. Becoming a shifter of a sapient creature has all the problem associated with soul-bonding yourself to something sapient, except it's much harder to fix things if something goes wrong. Also, an male aranea shifter would definitely have a male aranea alternate form, which would be mightly weird and awkward to the aranea. Using a transformation potion/ritual would let Zorian pick the 'correct' gender as well. Though it would require an adjustment period before he could move and deal with his new body.

#+begin_quote
  Let me know of your thoughts.
#+end_quote

There you go. I know it's not very substantive, but it's as much as I can give without being too spoiler-y.

Thanks for your response. Just FYI, your story is absolutely amazing. I just wish that you could post more and that I had money for the patreon. I should be able to buy hardcover once you publish, though. I definitely will. This story is too amazing to not buy a physical copy. The three weeks are killer. Keep up the good work.

The room would certainly be way too trivial. After all, the story shows how important time really is, and giving him a room... I do wonder what will happen with that room, though. Can't have everything be too easy, and it must cause some problems.

Remember something when you tell your readers stuff: what's left unsaid is just as important as what is said. I can tell that he likely won't soul bond with an aranea (said), but he may soul transform (said/unsaid). You also didn't say that he won't get soul sight (unsaid), nor did you mention the eggs (unsaid) or Silverlake (unsaid), so he might actually get soul sight. There's definitely more with the Silver Wolf and the shifters (unsaid), so... Despite mentioning in the story somewhere that Soul Sight is op, I really think that Zorian might get it.

Don't feel too obligated to respond to the above paragraph. After all, you didn't mention whatever you didn't mention before for a reason, and I'm not asking anything new, so you don't need to say anything else. I'm just excited for Taiven to push the plot more with the next post. And I love your story. Man, I really need to see if I could support the Patreon...

On a side note, I saw someone write that Taiven could write a letter to the future from herself. I'm sure you could come up with a reason for that not to work, but I'd still like to see that happen. I also read that Zorian should look up some sort of potion that prevents him from falling asleep (or something along those lines) to allow him to wake up instantly in new restarts. I do like the charm in the current way he restarts, though.

You know, I'd like to see more people get in on the time loop (preferably like Zorian). In particular, it would be amazing to have Kirelle actually learn magic, but having everyone else being able to start instantly would be amazing. It would remove Zorian's novelty, and thus would likely happen at the end of the story, before the loop stops. I predict that there is a special gate that activates the spell (like a self-casting object) close to the weakening. I don't know if it chooses randomly, or a particular activates it on them. I also think that Red Robe (who's probably not Daimen, because Red Robe is immature, but maybe) might have access to the gate (and thus "soul kill" magic) or just learned time loop soul magic somehow. He might be able to loop, not because he has a tag, but because he has magic to send his soul back before the loop ends (it would sort of hold his soul in stasis, waiting until the restart). Maybe not though. I also think that Zorian might ask his parents if he could come with them to Koth to see Daimen in Arc 3.

Sorry for just spouting out speculation. This is all I could think of, for now. I kinda just needed to write it down. I hope you got over your dumb cold.

Greetings, I read your comment/review on chapter 44 of Mother of Learning, and would like to point of some things, that you seem to have missed.

It's highly like for him to end up being a shifter, anyways. -- This theory is debunked as of chapter 39, search for soul marker, if you don't want to re-read the whole passage. -- Meaning the only real way is either transformation potion.

As for the Soul Perception tidbit, it would depend on the conversion rate of the chamber. Ref: Chapter 16 -- It takes 23 years for the moths to mature, and the last time they emerged was a decade(10 years) ago, so he'll still need 13 more to get one. Then he'll need to make the potion within a few days, in not only one.

Thanks for pointing the stuff out. I posted it on the patreon and he replied, just fyi.

I remember the soul marker (I just reread the whole thing 2 or 3 days ago). I wouldn't say the theory was debunked for him being a soul shifter, just unlikely. They might need to investigate the marker's activation conditions first, which even if he doesn't become a soul shifter, might end up being why he contacts the tribe. The only thing is, there isn't much foreshadowing on the potion, so I'm still banking on the shifting (or at least that being the reason for the help). He also elaborated on the transformation potion, which means it's not a spoiler, which means he might not do it. He might though, cause it makes sense.

Nobody103 said that having the room go so fast would be too op, so it's unlikely for that to happen, anyways. It may be that the eggs are another soul sight potion, though. To me, then, that's what's most likely on the soul sight side of things. As a side note, I wonder if that has the same problem a shifting potion has.

With all these things, something will happen, but I'm not sure what. Nobody103 wouldn't have put in all that he did if they weren't for a reason. The tribe especially is coming back up, but also Silverlake and the grey hunter.
