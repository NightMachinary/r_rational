I'd at least expect Zorian to investigate in this direction first, because it's clearly one of the unique options he's got for getting an upper hand over other loopers. Actually, I had this passive expectation for him from the chapter in which time dilation mechanics were off-handedly described, and seeing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3s26r9/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_44_a_show_of/cwtn0i6][that quote]] was a bit disappointing for me.

  Later, when Zorian actually gains the capabilities to do that, I intend to explain why Zorian can't just casually abuse that idea.

Yeah, he'll define the background rules of his world in a way to support his opinion on the matter, even if it /is/ possible to profit from this ability in many other worlds. I am not even saying that using such an ability wouldn't rise any problems at all, but, at least to me, those would be /interesting/ problems to solve.

Eh, I guess MoL's author has other interests to share.
