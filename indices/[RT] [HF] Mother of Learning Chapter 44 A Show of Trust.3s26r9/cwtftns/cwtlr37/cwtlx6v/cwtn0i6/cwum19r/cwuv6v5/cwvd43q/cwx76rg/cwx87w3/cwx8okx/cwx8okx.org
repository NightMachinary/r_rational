  I'd at least expect Zorian to investigate in this direction first, because it's clearly one of the unique options he's got for getting an upper hand over other loopers.

He has definitely expressed an interest, but we don't know where it really ranks comparatively. He's had to concentrate on accessing the memory packet since before he knew there was a time dilation room, and almost exactly since he found out there was anything there from the Matriarch's message in the first place. Obviously he has to put the memory packet above all else at this point as well, if he ever wants to access it. Plus the memory packet itself might change his plans completely.

In fact, considering the way the chapter ended, I think we might see him list out what his priorities are after he accesses the memory packet.
