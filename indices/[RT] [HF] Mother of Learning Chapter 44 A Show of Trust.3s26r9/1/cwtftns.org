Seems like we're heading towards a pretty lengthy timeskip. Zorian confirmed in this chapter that he's not going to meet with Zach until he finishes his projects, and he seems to have a lot on his plate at the moment. Golems, Xvim, study group, Tavin's suggestions, aranea treasury/secret research, making friends with everyone in his class and mind training.

I think we're going to get a skip of about a dozen restarts, which is when Zorian will feel comfortable enough to meet up with Zach. Either way, it feels like this arc will come to a close soon.

Prediction: Similar to how the first arc closed off on a climactic note and with Zorian leaving Cyoria, I think the same thing will happen again. Either Zach tries to attack Zorian (thinks he's Red Robe), something major in the mind packet or Red Robe discovers Zorian's identity. After that, we get Zorian traveling again, but on a far greater range (the Highlands, the other continent, Silverlake). This is were we will start getting answers.
