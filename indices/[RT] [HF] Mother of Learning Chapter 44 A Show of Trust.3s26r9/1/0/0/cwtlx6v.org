OH GOD TIME DILATION IN A TIME LOOP

Why the hell didn't I think of that? That would close the gap between Zach and Zorian pretty quickly; Fuck Zoiran could just set the dilation to infinity and let himself die of old age.

This also takes care of the issue with the loop being finite in length; only problem is where he can get his mana from. I'm assuming because the facility is located so close to the Hole, they have some workaround?
