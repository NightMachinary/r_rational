He has mainly been concentrating on learning mind magic so he can access the memory packet. The only reason he has anything more than vague rumors "there may be black rooms somewhere," and the possibly not related gate things, is because he was practicing his mind magic and it was vaguely close to his time loop question, he almost didn't notice it.

He couldn't have used it until he accessed his memory packet anyways. He didn't really have a good place to start. Who knows how long he would have had to look before making any progress, whereas training other things helps now, which he /does/ need.
