  The logistics of time dilation are much more complex than people usually posit, though. I cringe every time someone write in a scene where a character spends a few months in their personal dimension (double cringe if they spend all those months alone; how are they not insane by the end?) like it's nothing. Later, when Zorian actually gains the capabilities to do that, I intend to explain why Zorian can't just casually abuse that idea.
