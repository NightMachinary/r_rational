Lol get wrecked. I had "[RT] [HF] Mother of Learning Chapter 44: " and the link that it would be pasted into reddit and everything. I didn't paste it five seconds earlier because I got it on gmail instead of refreshing.

This story is great, but yeah, the last couple of chapters have not had much revelations but a lot of new "activities". It's setup for either the next couple of chapters with the packet, Taiven's suggestions, Fighting Squad, etc.. Much excite!
