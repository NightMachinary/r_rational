Nah, no need to rush him. His series is the only series where I squeal like a little girl when I find the chapters posted. At the same time though, I want him to take his time and not feel pressured or anything at all. Posting every 2 weeks might lower the quality of his work. He is a fantastic author but having that extra week may be really helpful.
