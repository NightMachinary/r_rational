A warm welcome back, and as someone who has both lost at least a few hours of brain cycles trying to set up the problem (and what to neglect), and is audacious enough to ask: will you please include your own thoughts as to the variables needed of it is plot relevant, or just, please, put out what variables (tensor fields really) you think you need to set up the problem as an authors note.

The really hard point for me way when I realized I'd need to at least guesstimate the gravitational flux Journeyman's wards could take, back calculate that through the variance of on Europs and kth based on flicker duping ,m-n entropy into into a region to collect so much mass into a portal. . . well its an optimization problem where minimizing the height of mass on Europa at least eliminates one additional variable where several interacting dependent variables are tensor fields. [comment pre-edited to remove rambling on trying to at least isolate n for how many co-dependent or independent variables are in the problem before I started drinking, because it's an interesting irrelevant problem . . .]

Yeah please give us your broad strokes I don't think it needs to be presentable or accurate, this is a very hard problem, that, probably is within baseline human understanding, after a lot of calculation and error checking, within a few 0-n*hundred man months, and the people who actually think about the math will really appreciate hearing your thought process, though optimizing the mass distribution and associated thermal conductivity on Europa is a great idea and a similarly hard optimization problem.
