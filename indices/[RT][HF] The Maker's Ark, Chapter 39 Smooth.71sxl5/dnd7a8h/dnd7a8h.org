Back from an unplanned hiatus on the main story. I did a lot of physics and planetary science research and it turns out that the answer to a central, plot relevant question is not known, but is likely to be answered by either the Europa Clipper mission or the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, both scheduled for launch in the 2020s.

I didn't want to wait that long to finish The Maker's Ark, so I had to make a choice and hope I'm not embarrassingly wrong. We'll see. 8-)
