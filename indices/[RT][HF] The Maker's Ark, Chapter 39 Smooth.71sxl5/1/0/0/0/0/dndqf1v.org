Heh, I was still drafting my request to your own approximation of setting up the problem when this came back. Yes, when you aren't even sure after ?many googles what you can neglect to approximate the predominate dependent variables problem . . . , well let's put it this way my ethanol intake is a choice and you threw this entrancing tar-pit at me, and for the first time ever "you drove me to drink" (to avoid starting to code a 3D simulator of Newtonian physics) is a honest response.

May I please have the lingerie version of the physics porn youkicked off or at least the variables you thought mostly negligible.
