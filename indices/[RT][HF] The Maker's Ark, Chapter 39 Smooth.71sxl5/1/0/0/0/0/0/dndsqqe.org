Okay 8-). I haven't even looked in detail at the 'gravitational stress on Journeyman during construction' problem because that can be written around. The effects on Journeyman did enter into my bounds on the final black hole mass (tides for high end, Hawking radiation for low end)

The problem I spent most of my time struggling with was 'will Europa's tides cause a problem with an orbit this low'

1st answer (wrong): No. Duh. Europa is tidally locked, so Europa's shape has already adjusted to it, and any minor differences will be filled in by the water

Hmm. Europa's orbit isn't circular, and its orbital period is 3.5 days. Does that matter? (Calculations) Shit. Yes, it does. A lot. But wait! Europa will flex in response to the tides, and the more it does, the less of a problem tides will be. How much?

(Research, calculate, research, research, etc.) Nobody knows, and they've tried /hard/, because the answer will let them know how thick Europa's subsurface ocean is. So the question I thought I didn't need to know the answer to when I started writing (how deep are Europa's oceans) is... relevant.

If you see a line in a later chapter that says 'getting the right orbit for this is a pain', that's where the pain is coming from. 8-)
