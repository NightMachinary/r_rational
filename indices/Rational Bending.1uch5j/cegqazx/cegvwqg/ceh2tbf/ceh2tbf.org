Body temp was pretty arbitrary.

It was just a convenient temperature where air was gas, water was liquid and rock was solid.

And there could be better explanations for lack of woodbending, tradition mixed with confirmation bias, it was just an explanation I thought would work well enough. It's not that no one ever tried to woodbend it's that it's common knowledge that woodbending is "impossible" so it takes a special sort of mindset to try anyway. A mindset which is very rare, so very few people try. Considering how different wood is to earth, the people to /do/ try will inevitably fail as badly as Aang did when he tried to earthbend. Realising that they're "wasting their time" trying to woodbend they give up before the point at which they would start seeing actual results. When people wonder if woodbending is possible these people say "No. I tried it. It doesn't work." and thus the myth is perpetuated.
