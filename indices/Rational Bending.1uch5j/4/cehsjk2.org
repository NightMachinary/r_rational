I just wanted to add that bending was a present given by the great turtles to humans, who were the original energy benders. Furthermore, there was no genetic condition for the turtles to give humans their bending, so the genetic component, if any, happened after the turtles stopped being actively in the picture. I expect this bending power to be purely spiritual or whatever.
