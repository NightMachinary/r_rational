Ok, I thought a bit about how bending could work. One problem is that what bending can achieve differs wildly among the elements.

- Air and Earth bending is just moving things.

- Water bending is moving things plus changing the state of matter (water to ice and vice versa).

- Fire bending is something completely different. It could be just streams of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame][very hot air]] (not completely sure if that's enough to produce something like a flame). Lightning is something different still.

This is not really possible to explain with our physics. So somewhere in the Avatar world things are different from ours.

You could put this point outside of the people into the spirits. We know that spirits exist so we might as well use them to explain things. The humans there would then be just like us.

Proposal:\\
So these spirits are everywhere and are somewhat intelligent, like rabbits maybe. For these spirits the normal physical laws don't hold (at some point we have to assume something like this), they are invisible and they just love doing the things that benders want them to do; like moving a rock or heating something. But they are not that smart so you have to show them what you want by pointing at things and waving your arms. Smoother movements mean less confusion among the spirits and better results. This at least solves the question why 12-year-olds can be strong benders.

A water bender is then simply a person whom the water spirits are obeying. What method the spirits use to make ice from water, etc... is irrelevant. At first at least. If you really wanted to understand bending you'd have to study the spirits. Then you might wonder why there are only four kinds of spirits. And why some people get them to move metal and others don't. Maybe the spirits are really just reading your thoughts and the movements are unnecessary.

So I'm not really sure if this 'spirit bending' is a good idea. I thought I'd share my thoughts. Maybe it's creating unnecessary complexity.
