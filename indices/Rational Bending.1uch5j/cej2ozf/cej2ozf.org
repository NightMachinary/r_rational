You can have it be genetic if you like (it's supported by canon), but I think it's a weaker narrative. If you only get to be a wizard because your parents were wizards....well, that's nice. But it's much cooler if anyone can learn it. It changes the social dynamics a lot -- instead of having a master race that the normals are justified in envying / hating, you have highly trained experts who will be respected by some and (unfairly) hated by others. Some benders will have more talent and skill; if it's a genetic thing, this is just "oh well, he just got lucky." If it's a training thing, this is "I must work harder to equal him!"

I would make the training harsh enough that most people can't hack it, which is why not everyone is a bender.

And speaking of "not everyone": I would make the benders a noticeable but still small proportion of the population -- 5-15% feels about right. This way they are common enough that everyone knows a few, common enough that they can form meaningful political lobbies if they get organized, but not so common that they render nonbenders completely irrelevant, and not common enough that the normals can still oppress them if they really want to. It opens you up to more storylines if the nonbenders can outpower the benders in at least some areas.
