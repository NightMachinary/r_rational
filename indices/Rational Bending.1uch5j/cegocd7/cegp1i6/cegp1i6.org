While benders would have an absolute advantage at pretty much everything physical, they won't have a comparative advantage. In other words, while earthbenders might be better at construction that non-benders, they might be even /more/ better at some other thing, and non-benders will end up doing the construction.

There's also construction made out of wood and other non-stone building materials, although perhaps benders would lobby for legal impediments to such competition (this is something I'm trying to explore in my fic).

As a social scientist, I suppose what I'm curious about is the physical possibilities of bending. Once I know those, it's easy enough to decide what the bender:nonbender ratio is and let the economics rip. What I can't figure out on my own is what kind of physical possibilities would be discovered through trial-and-error in a world that had been populated by benders for a very long time. For example, there's got to be some very interesting things you could do with firebending, but for the life of me I don't know what. Turning calories to fire without the need of a combustible material or a spark as long as you have sunlight and oxygen...well, /I'm/ not going to figure this out.
