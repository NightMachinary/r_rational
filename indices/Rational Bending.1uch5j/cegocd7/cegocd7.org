Benders are strictly superior to nonbenders. There is nothing that a nonbender can do that a bender could not, and that implies quite a bit. A waterbender who can use the healing subschool will make a better doctor than a nonbender. Benders are better soldiers, because they have all the abilities of a normal soldier in addition to their bending. Unless there's a big social focus on equality, the average bender is going to make more than the average nonbender, and will likely make a /lot/ more. Benders will hold a higher social position, and they'll get more promotions.

Bending will also tend to push people towards certain career paths. Earthbenders are best at construction and manufacturing (especially in the post-metalbending era), and make for superior miners. Firebenders will involve themselves in power generation (especially in the post-lightningbending era), cooking (they get the heat for free), and smelting. Waterbenders are the best healers and firefighters, and likely the best farmers as well since they can easily irrigate their crops. Airbenders ... are sort of a nonissue, given that they're all dead, but if they were still around their ability to move quickly (with or without gliders) makes them perfect as messengers, scouts, or fast response teams. So as long as there are benders, certain industries will be dominated by them.

And given the domination of bending over certain domains, that means that nonbenders should start to gravitate towards areas where the playing field is level - service and information, mostly. This somewhat depends on the ratio of benders to nonbenders; firebenders make better cooks (since they need no fuel) but if there are few enough of them, it might be possible to maintain a business even when your competition can undercut you.

As far as the question of the /source/ of bending goes, I'd keep it genetic, with the actual form that bending takes being heavily influenced by the society around you. It's definitely mental as well, but that doesn't mean that there's not a genetic component. Of course, it's not really that important to get to the actual root cause of where bending comes from, so long as you lay out rules and stick to them.
