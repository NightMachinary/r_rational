And yet the source of bending isn't quite genetic, not even in the real series. The fact that Aang could [[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Energybending][energybend]] away his enemy's powers... Do I even need to mention the consequences of that? A highly desirable service for non-benders. (But shh it's secret, though how Aang managed to pass off that I dunno) And, as I said earlier, it suggests that bending isn't entirely genetic. Because then how would energy-bending work? Removing someone's genes? Might... Might chi actually be the best explanation for the data we have?

Aaand just to toss out something else about the Avatar-verse that I love, but completely unrelated to the discussion at hand: Raava and Vaatu are awesome! I hope that somehow Vaatu either merges his spirit into the Avatar flow, or gets the Dark Avatar back as a long-term baddie.

Or it could be /even more/ epic, and... Nah, this is a good place to stop.
