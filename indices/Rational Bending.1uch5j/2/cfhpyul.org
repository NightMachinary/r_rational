I think I got an idea on the genetics of bending. Real genetics is not as simple as the Mendelian rules suggest it. There is an aspect of inheritance which is not purely based on the DNA you got from your parents. It's called epigenetics. As far as I understood it, environmental conditions of the parents can cause certain genes in the gametes (don't know if it's the right word, I mean these cells like sperms and egg-cells) to be activated or deactivated. The deactivation for example happens through methyl-molecules getting attached to the gene. So the deactivated gene can be inherited by the child, who now has a gene which is not active.

As far as bending goes it would be reasonable to say that certain conditions must be met for a human to be a bender. a) A parent has to have passed on a bending-gene and b) this gene has to be an activated gene (maybe because the parent didn't have an easy life and his body "thinks" that the chance for the child to survive is higher if the bending-gene is activated)

So you could use epigenetics to avoid some spiritual explanation of the mendelian rules not applying to bending.
