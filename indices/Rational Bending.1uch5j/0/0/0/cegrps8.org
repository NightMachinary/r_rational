I was sort of under the impression that chi was necessary for bending, but that it wasn't the source of bending. So by analogy, when Aang does chi blocking it's like he's blinding someone - but there's a difference between someone who's congenitally blind and someone who was blinded from birth.

It probably makes more sense to just model bending as being of the spirits, but I'm not sure about the best way to express that to a viewer/reader. I'm sure that the scholars of that world have a multitude of theories to explain why some people can bend and others can't, even if they share ancestry.
