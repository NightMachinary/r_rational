My understanding is that everyone has chi and that it is the source of life and spiritualism but only those with the right genes can release their chi into an elemental form. This is supported by the fact that the guru was an expert in chi matters and spirits without being a bender himself. By this logic Aang sealed the chi "openings" in Ozai's spirit just as chi blockers temporarily seal the physical ones.
