Another thing to consider is how exhausting bending actually is. It's never really addressed in canon (as far as I can remember) but there has to be a limit on what a bender can sustain. Otherwise Toph would be walking around in rock armor all the time. And considering lightbending is a very difficult (and probably straining) technique I don't think it's feasible to use it as a source of electricity on an industrial scale, as is shown in LoK. Not to mention the difficulty of taming the lightning bolt to do something useful.

I think it's more realistic if benders used their power on a smaller scale. Here are some things I would consider useful in an early industrial setting

Water

- making things that contain water explode by freezing the water to ice (water expands when it freezes); many things contain a bit of water, even rocks

- healing is incredibly useful; every water bender should master it, other people would pay good money to get it

Earth

- using metal bending to build precision instruments like clockworks

- making beautiful sculptures

Fire

- welding (to build anything out of metal)
