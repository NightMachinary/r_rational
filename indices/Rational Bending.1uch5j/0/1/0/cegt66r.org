*Firebending*

- Cooking
- Powering batteries
- Melting sand into glass
- Heating water and make steam (to power engines, for bathhouses, cleaning)
- Heating metal to forge (need to determine max temps possible)
- Use lightningbending with loops of conductive metal to make a magnet or magnetic field
- Firefighting (using lots of fire to burn up available oxygen and put the fire out, or simple redirection)
- Home heating
- Cauterizing (wounds or otherwise)
- Welding
- Fast travel via flames

*Waterbending*

- Build near-instant ice houses
- Bend the water to catch fish
- Healing the wounded
- Providing river crossings
- Irrigating crops
- Sailing (calming the swells, acting as a bilge pump)
- Dowsing out water
- Plumbing
- Any of the steam related capabilities of the firebenders (powering engines, cooking)
- Washing
- Water purification
- Fast travel across the oceans
- Rapid dehydration/mummification (preservation of foods, industrial refinements, etc.)

*Earthbending*

- Rapid construction
- Rapid demolition
- Water filtration/purification
- Tunneling
- Mining
- Refining metals
- Rapid travel across sand
- Search/rescue via seismic sensing
- Creating (crude) machine parts

That's mostly what's in (or heavily implied by) canon. I left off airbending because there are only a small handful of benders and so they shouldn't have an impact on what happens socially/economically. If you want more speculative stuff ... it depends on what framework you want to go with, and how much control you decide a person can have. If you can lightningbend, then in theory you can ionize the air to purify the air, for example. Or you could use bloodbending in order to do a transfusion without needles (if that weren't taboo), or use the desiccation ability of waterbending in order to destroy a tumor that you saw with the waterbending equivalent of earthbending's seismic vision.
