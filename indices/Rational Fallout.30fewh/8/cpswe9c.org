There was some pretty interesting commentary about the realistic effects of radiation in the environment in a show called "Life After People" I'd say it's a must-see if you haven't already seen it. I found quite a few snippets of it here and there, but it's probably available in full somewhere, since it was a Discovery Channel show.
