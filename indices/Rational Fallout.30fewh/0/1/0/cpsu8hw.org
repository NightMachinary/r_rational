  Where the Vending Machine technology came from is unknown. While they take Sierra Madre Chips, they seem to supply a number of non-commercial services. A revolutionary pre-War technology that never achieved much commercial success outside the occasional world fair or the Sierra Madre. The vending machine is in fact a self-contained matter transformation device. It can recreate any item (limited by the templates stored in its memory) by using Sierra Madre chips as a battery and source of raw material for the created goods. It can also take certain items and transform them back into Sierra Madre chips. Selection is made through a holographic interface that displays the item being purchased. The machine demonstrates something astounding about pre-War civilization. As the chips are not some form of nanotech feedstock, but simple alloys of common and fissionable elements (see Coin Operator), the machines use nuclear fission/fusion to process this material not only into tools, but edible food and even prescription chems. They demonstrate that civilization was on the cusp of unimaginable prosperity when the bombs fell; a truly great height from which to fall.
