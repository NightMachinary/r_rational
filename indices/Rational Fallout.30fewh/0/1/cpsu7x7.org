I dont remeber where I read or it's cannonicity but an explanation for a big deal of the mutations are due to the FEV (forced evolutionary virus) being released along the nukes. granted this replaces one handwavium with another but hey it's something. on the other hand there is a core of creatures that were the result of deliberate genetic engineering you can keep with cannon sources: deathclaws and super mutants from mariposa research cntr. cazadores, night stalkers, and man-eating plants from Big MT. considering the pre war world had [[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Sierra_Madre_vending_machine][nano assemblers]] i chose to think ghouls are victims of life support nanites that switched to being powered by radiation or radioisotopes (thus explaining why they heal when irradiated)
