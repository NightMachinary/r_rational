My intention is to play it completely straight. This is a world where physics are very different from our own. B-movie Science! That doesn't mean I don't intend for them to discover rules, or that I won't keep them internally consistent. And my protagonist will definitely notice, for instance, that Mackay's theories of mutation due to extended exposure to radiation don't really explain the presence of giant green people. The rules are insane by our standards, but they exist.
