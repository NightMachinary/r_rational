I've thought about a rationalist Fallout but kept more in the spirit of it's origin source, starting with Fallout 1's Vault Dweller and continue on with his descendents influence eastward through 2 and and New Vegas (as the courier). Just have a hard time writing due to being overly hard on myself on such tasks.

Did you have an idea for the protagonist?

If you are going ahead with a story like this I'd highly recommend going though the wiki since New Vegas has tons of small but interesting tie ins with Fallout 1/2.
