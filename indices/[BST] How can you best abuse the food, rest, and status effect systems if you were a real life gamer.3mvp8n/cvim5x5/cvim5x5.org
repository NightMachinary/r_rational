As nobody has mentioned the Randi prize yet, I'll do so.

There is also the fact that pretty much anything which will win the Randi prize will also revolutionize science if you let scientists study it. If you could heal all your wounds by resting, and the circumstances were not contrived to make it impossible to scientifically study, you'll have changed humanity's store of knowledge more than Einstein simply by showing up to the lab.

(If you do this I would recommend going public in such a way that your disappearance would look suspicious and/or piss off some important person. Otherwise you'd get kidnapped by the CIA or Mafia.)
