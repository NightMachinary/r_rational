You've clearly put a lot of thought into this. I like how the diminishing returns allow you to do the training montage thing at the start where it's still interesting, while still keeping progress associated with risk or at least hunting down masters to learn from in the medium and long term. Too many Gamer fics divorce growth from real risk, and suffer because of it. In a word, they stagnate.

Really, the whole genre would have been better off if it had never included ID create. Which isn't to say that such a power can't be used well, (The Games We Play being an example) it's just that's it's rather easy to... not use it well.

Anyway, I'll be interested to see what wonders your mind brings forth if you find the time, seeing as you've clearly gone hard on the worldbuilding.
