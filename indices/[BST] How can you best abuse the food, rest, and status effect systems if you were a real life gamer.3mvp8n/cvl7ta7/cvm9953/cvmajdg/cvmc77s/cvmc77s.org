Yea ID create is so broken. I don't like the idea of getting something from nothing, there always has to be some cost to magic. If you have ID create whats the point of even going out in the real world, you can get all your training without disturbing anyone or ruffling any feathers. With ID create your back in the proverbial basement.

Thanks for the encouragement!
