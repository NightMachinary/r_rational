There's a fanfic called "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited][Harry Potter the Video Game: Exploited]]". The writing is mechanically bad (spelling, etc), but the story is fun and it comes up with a lot of good hacks.

One of them is this: stamina regenerates continuously, but only decreases when you actually exert your muscles. So, when you jump you recover a little bit of stamina while in mid-air; if your regen rate is fast enough, this will be enough to offset the cost of the jump. If so, traveling by bunny hopping is free, yet still counts as exercise so it still grinds strength and endurance.
