First step: Perform initial testing on every consumable available at my local grocery store, keeping a list of all items that have duplicate effects (specifically, keeping track of the most powerful per-use items for each stat, as well as being on the lookout for anything that increases any stats permanently, which I would quickly fully drain the supplies of).

Any beneficial status effects, I'd keep stock on me, keeping a look out for anything not easily reproducible (such as invisibility, damage immunity, etc).

Regarding SP, I'm assuming this would have the largest impact on my life, so I would stock the smallest/cheapest/most easily acquired SP-restoring food/medicine, in order to more fully spam all of my new SP-using abilities. Ideally, I'll be able to get a free-conjuration ability, and use it to continually conjure SP/Stamina healing food/drugs, in order to train it up.

Additional uses could be being used as a medical test dummy, by trying multiple forms of specific drugs in order to determine what potential effects/side effects they might have in normal people based on the numerical effect that it had on me (including hard relative efficacy of treatment).

For the most part, I feel it would be a relatively passive ability, allowing for greater risk-taking in your other activities, but on its own, by being limited purely to yourself, seems less likely to be massively munchkinable.
