Well, apparently you don't need to eat. But it may be handy to keep some food pills to use against "bleeding" condition (as any HP heal clears them). Unless you need to fully heal the damage that caused wound to remove it.

Also, you can try to feed part of your liver to your enemy. When it disappears, it will destroy a lot of molecules inside his body, creating effect similar to radiation poisoning. Can be pretty lethal, I think.

Do you need to breath? If you don't, learn "not-breathing", may become handy sometimes down the line.

Do you continue to piss/poop? What if you don't eat? Can you be used to create enough water for a Moon pool (nobody needs to know how that water came into being)? Actually, do you get damaged by low pressure and/or high acceleration? In any case, you can be extremely valuable to space program.

What happens if you try to eat only half of the hamburger? Do you regain half of hp, how is it rounded? Can you eat hamburger in small pieces each regaining 1 hp?

What happens when you try to eat metallic object? Will you defecate it later, or will it be mysteriously converted into hp (or probably damage)? In latter case, you can try to destroy radioactive waste or other unwanted matter, but you probably won't be able to make significant impact this way.

If it turns out that consuming chemicals (including food) works for you exactly as for humans but with directly revealed consequences (hp, sp, status effects), you can make a bank (and probably help Humanity) by being test-subject for pharmaceutical research. Just eat their drugs and check your status, and let scientists optimize. Just get a lawyer before contracting anyone!
