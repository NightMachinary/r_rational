Find the food I can devour fastest for the highest possible hp/second restored possible. Same for sp.

Through trial and error find out what distances of fall damage I can survive. I'm sure there are tactical uses for that.

If combat is likely, and let's be honest combat is always likely as a Gamer, then armour the areas of my body that are most vulnerable. For example decapitation is a big problem, so a [[http://www.ageofarmour.com/instock/gorgetss.jpg][gorget]] and helmet would be a good combo.

Find out my base hp regen/sec rate. Wear armbands with inward facing spikes/razors/whatever so that I am always taking damage and thus increasing my total hp. On a related note, always be wearing weighted clothing. If my stamina is a single stat that increases total full body stamina regardless of which limb has done the work, then awesome. Continue until the size of the weights makes it impractical.

Finally, be careful writing a Gamer story. Many writers make the mistake of saying to themselves 'what do I do now' to which to answer in Gamer fics is often 'write about numbers going up'. This tends to make for some really mediocre fics, as the numbers going up can easily be completely divorced from any actual plot points or interesting situations. Design your system such that when you get around to asking what the most sensible thing for your character to do is, the answer is not 'grind for 3 years then beat everyone without breaking a sweat'.
