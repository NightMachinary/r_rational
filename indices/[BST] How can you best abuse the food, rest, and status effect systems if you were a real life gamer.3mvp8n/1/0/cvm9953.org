I agree with your assessment on gamer stories ( I like your fic btw). I would massively nerf the gamer powers down to a less OP level.

Inventory system would just detail what you are holding on your person and in your bags with no pocket dimension. Only medicine or magic heals your HP and cut off limbs need to be reattached or regrown with high level magic, a much slower HP regeneration rate too and you can't spam medicine.

You can only observe things you already know about an object (or at high levels things you know in your unconscious). This makes it more of an organizational and learning tool and not some crazy thing that will show you all possible information.

I'd change experience and statistics so that he could become superhuman but never just a walking god, there would be heavy diminishing returns, just like in real life.

As for the skill system (the most powerful in my opinion) I'd change it so he can simply learn things (much) faster and he doesn't necessarily get bonuses from skill level, instead skill level is simply an abstraction of how skilled he actually is. No skill books but he can glean much more information from books than others can and can possibly recreate lost techniques. Also he can learn things while bypassing some of the requirements, he can't learn everything and if he learns certain things they will limit his growth in other areas, but by learning multiple magic disciplines + melee combat he can become quite powerful.

All of this would be in it's own world where every magician has their own power, most are minor some are major. Every magician can possibly learn all the different disciplines of magic (think old school disciplines like divination, enchanting, alteration, warding etc) but their power might pull them in a certain way.

For instance one of the most powerful people is a guy (who I refer to in my head as shield guy) who is exceptionally good at shields. His power grants him the ability to make shields perfectly efficient and cost as little mana as possible, but it limits him to shields entirely, any other magic will not work. He works as a mercenary and is next to invincible, he's even survived a targeted atomic bomb (just barely).

I really like the world I've come up with but I'm already writing another story and this one may or may not happen. But I've tried to make it as balanced as possible, the MC has to actually go through and learn all the magic disciplines and use them together to beat powerful foes. He's more of a generalist mage, kind of like a super zorian if you've ever read mother of learning.

All of this I would mention by saying that powers tend to run down family lines or come from a persons personality. The MC is the type that likes the most hardcore games, hence why his power is like this. A person can awaken their power (and latent magicial ability) by going through a very traumatic experience or by chance, though trauma certainly doesn't make everyone a mage. If a person has too strong of an innate power they will overflow with mana and burn to death (or explode). A normal The Gamer power would cause my MC to explode, leading to a pretty poopy story.
