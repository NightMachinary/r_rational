  Physical or Mental exercise use stamina. The harder the exercise you do the more stamina is used. Mental exercise uses much less stamina overall than physical, though it can still drain you especially if you don't rest or eat.

Does that mean that from now on these two things completely share the same pool? What about work/exercise of only one body part? Could I now use my full theoretical stamina to put it all into biking or lifting weight, thus tiring much more slowly? Can I train my mental capacity through doing cardio? Sounds useful.

Wait, so I could remove my heart, get patched up and just live on with low HP and no other problems until I can get around to getting food/medication? How comes that doesn't deal max damage? Is this a thing from the manga this is based on?
