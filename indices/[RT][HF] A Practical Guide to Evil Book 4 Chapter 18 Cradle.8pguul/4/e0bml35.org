I always get frustrated by Cat's arc right now. It's well written... It's fun.

But it keeps on showing that she and Black should still be working together closely.

Black broke with Malicia because she tried to pull a capital E EVIL move for the first time.

This is also why Cat doesn't like Malicia.

But here's the thing... it's a sunk costs fallacy. Liesse is gone. It's done. There is a crusade coming.

Why does Cat still hate Black?
