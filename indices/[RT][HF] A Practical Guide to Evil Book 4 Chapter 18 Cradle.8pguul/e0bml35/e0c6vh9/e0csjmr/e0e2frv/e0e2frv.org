Black lied to her repeatedly, gave Assassin the code phrase she and Black use to determine they are each other so that Assassin could fool and manipulate her to further Black's plots.

Black deliberately drew up a battle plan which would end in her being enslaved by Diabolist after Akua murdered an entire cities worth of Callowans.
