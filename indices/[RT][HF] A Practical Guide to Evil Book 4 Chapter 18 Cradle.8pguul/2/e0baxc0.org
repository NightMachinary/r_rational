I was originally a bit disappointed when I realized this is just kind of intermission before negotiations. But it turned out to be actually quite a great chapter. I really liked that author has shown more about Cat's thought process and reasoning.

Even since first time her idea of Liesse Accords was mentioned, I seriously doubted their feasibility. They could work, if she fought traditional war. But what she has against her is religious Holy Crusade, backed (and directed?) by angels them self. And it has been shown that Choirs are not really that big on forgiveness or compromise.

This chapter also got me thinking about Malicia again. I'm actually starting to like idea of Cat getting back into some sort of alliance with her. If she could negotiate some kind of equal partnership. Like it or not Malicia is actually kind of mild and rational villain. If Praes gets destroyed and population purged, there could rise someone much more worse from the ashes.
