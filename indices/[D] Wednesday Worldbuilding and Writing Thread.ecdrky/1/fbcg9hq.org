Does anyone have good resources / pages / etc on writing interpersonal conflicts? I'm coming up on an important part of my story where the main characters have a disagreement, and it's important that it's well-written. I know why each character feels that they are in the right, and I believe that there are real people with these attitudes, so I'm more interested in how to "structure" an argument (you know... "you're wrong!" "no you're wrong!" "well you're ugly!" "no your mum's ugly", how do I write all that?). Or just... articles on arguing in general, on conflict between characters, on how to make sure that neither character becomes "unredeemable" to the readers. And on how to write resolutions.

Alternatively, general advice/opining on this would be good, but as I'm not really asking a specific question I think pointing me to general blog posts that have helped others would be better, probably?
