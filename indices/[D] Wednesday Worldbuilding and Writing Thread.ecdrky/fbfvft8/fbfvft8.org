Trying to figure out a way to balance / nerf singularity-esque ai.

Setting is Galaxy-wide, with hard magic system mixed with FTL.

Current thoughts are to make magic only work for us biologicals. Make FTL require magic. And constrain the AIs to a strict deontic morality (by their choice).

Maybe they also have to babysit a few simulated universes they errantly spun up in their youth.

Seem plausible?
