I think there's some sense in the "no incentives" argument, in that you're likely focusing on being a mage /or/ being a scientist, but probably not both. Technological progress (to my way of thinking, at least) isn't caused by the need for technological solutions, it's caused by having enough capital, security, and excess population in order for a fraction of the workforce to focus on labor-saving and the acquisition of knowledge.

So if you have mages, then rather than having a scientific and intellectual class, you have a split scientific/magical/intellectual class, and your once-in-a-generation minds that are perfectly positioned for pursuing whatever they would like will instead go for something having to do with magic rather than something to do with science or engineering. It's not necessarily that there aren't incentives for technology, since there are, it's that a society has limited people that it can put in any one direction, especially in "non-productive" directions that won't be paid off in decades or centuries. If the kingdom can fund one a single brilliant orphan and push them towards either magic or scientific inquiry, then maybe the balance is such that these brilliant orphans get pushed toward magic.

Of course, if magic and STEM had exactly equal payouts, then this wouldn't matter too much, because you wouldn't be stuck with a medieval society, you would have a modern society that had magical solutions instead of STEM ones. So maybe if you wanted to justify a stagnant society, you would have "magic development traps" where lots of resources and people get put into magic ... which then doesn't have accelerating returns, or doesn't allow the population to support more mages/STEM, and requires agrarian society to stay how it is. Alternately, maybe magic just doesn't build on itself like STEM does, and each mage is essentially working from scratch (or close to it) rather than standing on the shoulders of giants, simply because of how magic works.
