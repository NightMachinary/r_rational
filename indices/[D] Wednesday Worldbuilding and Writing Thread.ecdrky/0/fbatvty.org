To what extent would the existence of magic hamper technological progress? A common trope in fantasy is the technologically and scientifically static society, frozen in Medieval European facsimile for millennia. Its usual explanation cites a lack of incentives -- why develop mechanical plows, public transit, or refrigeration when easily summoned spectral horses can satisfy all three needs by tilling fields, carrying you to town, and then sacrificing themselves to produce salty spectral steak?

(sometimes there's also some tyrannical government or shadowy cabal of ancient wizards directly stymieing progress -- but often it's presented as a natural consequence of the existence of magic itself)

But this explanation has never satisfied me much, especially in low-to-moderate, non-utopian magic settings. Often the use of magic here requires years of dedicated study, rare ingredients, and personal fortitude -- all to produce effects well within the remit of modern programming, electricity, and medicine. Why then doesn't it follow similar developmental paths to the latter? Why hasn't it been turned into a branch of engineering? Why haven't industrious magicians developed industrial processes to synthesize the active ingredients in unicorn horns and newts' eyes? And where are those curious souls driven to innovate and explore the unknown as an end in itself (perhaps all dead from tampering with unstable forces beyond their ken)?

Some works do it differently and set stories in lands with burgeoning magitek industries. Others acknowledge external pressures, such as those mentioned in the earlier parenthetical.

Is there any saving the "no incentives" argument? Is the presence of a slightly easier /magical/ solution enough to slow technological progress to a standstill?
