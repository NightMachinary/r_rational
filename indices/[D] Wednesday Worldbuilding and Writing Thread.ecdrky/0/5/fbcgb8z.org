Magic shouldn't hamper a society. Magic is just another law of that existence, a law that is a potential additional resource above what our existence has.

Instead of magic itself hampering society various things related to magic existing could. Magic might scale in military utility on a very steep curve relative to population. A single powerful magic user is a big threat, a few of them working together might be able to take out a city. People would then be very unlikely create dense cities which would significantly affect divisions in labor, thus productivity and the cross pollination of ideas between studies.

[[http://golem-studios.com/prae.php][Prae]] suggests that for a logically consistent world to have magic it should to have a cost to its use. The default cost for the associated campaign setting is a side effect of creating monsters. Monsters being created with magic then creates a variety of problems, one is travel. With less trade we'll see less ideological and economic progress.

Some worlds might simply lack resources our world has, some fantasy worlds are a lot lot younger than ours and are likely to have a lot less oil. Various aspects of young worlds could make gas as an energy a lot more scarce. The physics of a world might prevent or hinder the creation of electricity.
