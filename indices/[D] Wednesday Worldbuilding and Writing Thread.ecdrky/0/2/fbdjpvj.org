The easiest way to get magic to hamper technological progress would be to basically make it a short-term quick 'n' easy solution, but a long term trap. If magic is fairly powerful and everyone is capable of learning it, then it will be used in lieu of technology for almost everything. However, if it must be personally learned and developed, and can't really be taught or effectively have each user's techniques shared or passed down, then it will create a no-progress scenario, where each generation turns to magic out of short-term necessity but then can't make any significant advancements in the long run.

As an example, using a magic system similar to that presented in the stories of the ''Magic: The Gathering'' setting, suppose magic depends upon each individual's memories of certain locations. The longer you spend in an area, the more easily you can draw upon the type of mana that that area provides. Live on an island for ten years while meditating about water and you can pretty easily do some water magic. Live near a volcano for ten years while meditating about fire and you can pretty easily do some fire magic. Most people in their early 20s will have already lived in some place for two decades, so with a bit of meditation they'd be able to easily start performing some significant magical feats. If magic supplants the need for most other labor or technological development, generation after generation would get stuck at exactly the same level of development.
