Depends on how efficient the fat->fire conversion is. A gram of fat has enough energy to heat a liter of water by ~9 CÂ°. Which is the same as heating a raindrop by several thousand degrees. But you'd probably be looking at something more like setting people on fire Carrie style than actual fire blasts. I mean, fire needs fuel, so what are those blasts burning as they shoot through the air?
