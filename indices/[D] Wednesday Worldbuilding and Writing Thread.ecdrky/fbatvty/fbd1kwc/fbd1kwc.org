I think it makes sense for tech to lag behind if the magic that exists is widespread and powerful, such that there would be no incentive to invent the technologies that lead to more innovation. So maybe if there's a relatively common “create food” spell maybe there's no reason for advanced farming technology. A teleportation spell of any kind would weaken the incentive for any other transportation or long range communication, and could make it completely irrelevant if the spell is easy enough. I think utilities like heating and plumbing would still see advancements over time if there isn't any “set and forget” type spells for those purposes.
