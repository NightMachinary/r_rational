It would be an interesting way to examine reason versus emotion if you had the scientific process and its technical applications running alongside the one-off miracles performed by inspired artist-types. On the one hand, you have the mechanized army of the industrial-military complex of a nation of 200 million people. On the other hand, you have Saint Gormiphew and his Lilly of War. Or maybe the artist-type is a movie director or contemporary literature writer. Fun idea.
