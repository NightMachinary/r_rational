I think what I take issue with is the premise that magic and science (or scientific epistemology or engineering or whatever) are non-overlapping magisteria to begin with. Like, why aren't there "research magicians", separate from "applied magicians", looking to understand the source or mechanism of magic as just some other energy source or technology? And even if that's fundamentally ineffable or whatever, you could still make progress in applied settings. Electromagnetism, cell biology, etc. didn't get a decent description until recent centuries, but people could still make progress in, say, the theory of how plants grow.

I guess I can imagine a setting where magical effects are fundamentally limited by one's personal mana pool, but then I'd expect to see experiments directed at increasing that pool or harnessing ambient mana or extracting mana from animals via building-sized spell-engines or something. Maybe attempts to systematically study magic all meet mysterious ends, or cause the spark of magic to fade away etc., but that feels a bit ad hoc to me. It just seems to me like these pseudo-medieval settings still have all the appropriate ingredients for a magical Enlightenment of sorts, in most works.
