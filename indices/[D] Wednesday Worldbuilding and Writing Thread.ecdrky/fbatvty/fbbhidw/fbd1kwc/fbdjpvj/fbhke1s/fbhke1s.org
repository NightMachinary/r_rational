I recall a short story which came up with an interesting reason for this effect; to whit, that "magic" worked in exactly the way that the wizard /expects/ it to work. (The characters postulated that the actual working may involve psychic phenomena).

Thus, a wizard, attempting any sort of scientific experiment, will /not/ get results that reflect the law of physics; as he can't turn off his magic, he will get exactly the results he expects to obtain. Contrariwise, in a scientific civilisation, a potential mage will be unable to pass a degree in physics, because he will be unable to get any of the experiments to work quite right.

This also means that magic is not exactly reproducable between mages...
