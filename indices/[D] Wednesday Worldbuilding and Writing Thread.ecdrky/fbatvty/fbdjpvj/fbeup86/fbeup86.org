Magic isn't a great example, though, as it has high-magitech settings like Kaladesh, Ravnica, and Phyrexia. The worlds which don't have technology are generally either always on the verge of annihilation (Innistrad, Zendikar, Amonkhet), or representative of a different point in human development (Theros, Ixalan, Kamigawa). The representative worlds don't appear to be artificially stunted, they just got a later start.
