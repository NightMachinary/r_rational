(un?)fortunately, although it's a rational story, the characters themselves aren't rational: one is educated and experienced but chock full of biases, the other is uneducated and inexperienced and chock full of different biases.

But I very much welcome the completely different angle: I never even /considered/ having them structure their argument like a formal debate or logic-thing, and it would be unrealistic for them to speak to each other that way, but I think there's going to be some excellent elements I can steal from that to make the whole thing better overall by making it a hair more rationalist.

  I would expect several revisions of the debate before it's going to be something that you and readers would be happy with.

Yeah, I think I'm about to start the third or fourth revision this weekend. The first revision me and my coauthor were both like ".... I am not sure they can come back from this disagreement, it's too strong", the second revision we changed the point of disagreement so that way the more extreme character was /not/ actually an irredeemable monster and just a bit... off, and I think a third revision smoothed it out a bit.

  so creating a proper debate between two rationalists would probably take a while.

Thank god they're not rationalists: that said, you've made me realise that I should probably put some logical fallacies in their arguments or other flaws that aren't picked up on, but that an attentive reader can notice and then feel big payoff at the end when they use these flaws/etc to come to an agreement. Because who doesn't like to feel like they're smarter than the characters from time to time?
