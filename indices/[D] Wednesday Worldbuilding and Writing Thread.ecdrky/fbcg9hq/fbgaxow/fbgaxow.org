I think an important realization here is that making an argument yourself and writing about two people having an argument are two different problems which involve different skills.

For writing an argument, step one is to decide in advance whether you'd like them to come out of it agreeing or come out of it disagreeing, and whether you'd like the two to have an amicable, grudging or resentful relationship afterwards. Note that these are largely orthogonal choices; you can have two people come to an agreement but still hate one another afterwards and you can also have people disagree but admire one another despite their dispute.

From there, you come up with a conversational arc that A] produces this outcome, and B] remains consistent with the characterization of each arguer, C] reveals something important /about/ one or more of the characters involved, and D] avoids anti-rational tropes like Can't Spit It Out or Just Talk To Each Other.
