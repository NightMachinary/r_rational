If it's a rationalist story, I'd recommend starting with the standard format for logical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument][arguments]]. Use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning][deductive argument]] if possible, or an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning][inductive argument]] if not. For a conversation, you can usually skip any premises that both characters (and the reader) already know. If it's an inductive argument, it might not hurt to list and refresh memory of each of the relevant premises.

To then make that argument sound good, you might consider reading works about how to write speeches. Wikipedia might be of use with its articles on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric][rhetoric]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion][modes of persuasion]], and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rhetorical_techniques][rhetorical techniques]] category.

If the character listening to the argument is also a rationalist, then I'd expect them to either agree, or identify [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_premise][faulty premises]], or pick apart [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies][logical fallacies]] between the premises and conclusion before proposing alternative possibilities, and possibly offering an entirely new argument with its own premises and conclusion. Once again, after you have the underlying argument(s) in place, you can make it sound better by employing rhetorical techniques.

I would expect several revisions of the debate before it's going to be something that you and readers would be happy with. It's hard enough to write a convincing, enjoyable, and logically correct speech with just a one-sided perspective, so creating a proper debate between two rationalists would probably take a while.
