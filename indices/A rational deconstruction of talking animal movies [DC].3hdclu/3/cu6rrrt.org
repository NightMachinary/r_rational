I'm not sure that a genocidal war against humanity on the part of sentient animals would actually make any sense. The animals we mistreat the most- chickens, cows and pigs- are so heavily modified as a result of breeding that I don't think they could survive in the wild. For them, an end to humanity would mean extinction.

Wild animals might want to destroy humanity over the destruction of habitat, but in 2015, that's something that would apply mostly in South America, Africa, and in the ocean. Believe it or not, forests have actually grown in America and Europe over the past half century due to more sustainable logging and expansions to national parks. Also, it would raise the question of why wild animals would only act now, when habitat destruction is far from new.

Furthermore, if wild animals did decide to wage a massive war on humanity, how would they eat? If the animals just stayed in their habitats and attacked humans on sight, that would cause some chaos in the sort term, but it wouldn't come anywhere near to ending civilization. To actually have a chance of winning the war, the animals would need to heavily concentrate their forces and strike in an organized way. So, lets say you have an army of thousands of dogs, all ready to run into machine gun fire in the hopes of taking some fortified airport or power plant. Would you also have a supply line of thousands of starving rabbits and squirrels, all willing to be eaten to keep the dogs healthy while they moved into position? Would that even be sustainable if the war lasted more than a few weeks?

I think that if animals were secretly sentient, their best bet for dealing with humanity would be an intellectual revolution, not a military one. They'd want to bring their best minds together and work out a way to decipher human language. Once they could communicate with humanity, they could use a threat of a limited war- or strikes, in the case of domesticated animals- to negotiate for better treatment, without the risk of complete extinction in a giant, apocalyptic war.

On top of that, being able to communicate with humanity would allow sentient animals to participate in civilization, which I think they'd find preferable to nature for exactly the same reasons we do.
