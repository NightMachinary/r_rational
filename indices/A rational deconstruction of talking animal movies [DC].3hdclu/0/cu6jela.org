My headcanon for Disney's /Little Mermaid/ is that sapience is contagious over time, at least for merfolk. Short-term interactions produce short-term increases in intelligence, which fade after the interaction is over; while long-term interaction results in the "uplift" sticking, and the creature even being able to "uplift" others.

For example, interacting with Ariel over a long time "uplifted" Flounder (the blue and yellow fish), while the shark they encounter is just a fish with shark-level intelligence. Similarly, Sebastian (the crab), by working closely with King Neptune and other merfolk on musical and dancing arrangements over a long time, is "uplifted" to the point where he is as "contagious" as any merperson, so by ordering around other creatures, he endows them with short-term sapience, letting him set up impromptu musical ensembles.

The merfolk don't, generally, understand this mechanism, which leads to cultural miscommunication between them and humans: the fish with whom merfolk interact are, generally, sapient (because merfolk interact with them), so King Neptune naturally despises humans for eating fish; but human sapience is not contagious, and since almost all the fish that humans encounter aren't merfolk-influenced, they have no way of learning that fish could possibly be sapient.
