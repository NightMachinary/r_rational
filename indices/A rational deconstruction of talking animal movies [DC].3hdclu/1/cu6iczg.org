Let's look at Watership Down.

The animals verbal intelligence is human-level, but one-on-one their problem-solving ability is in the scale observed in smart dogs, rarely chimp level.

In groups, they coordinate better than any non-verbal animals.

The most likely answer is that they are the beneficiaries of a simplistic uplift process that has installed verbal language subsystems that hook into the underlying animal mind, and provide a modest boost in the problem solving abilities of animals no smarter than dogs, but are not themselves any more conscious than SHRDLU or Eliza. Almost as if an advanced alien (or post-singularity human) high-school student had hooked together a bunch of off-the-shelf open-source AI modules, with a conversational interface, and released it as a virus.
