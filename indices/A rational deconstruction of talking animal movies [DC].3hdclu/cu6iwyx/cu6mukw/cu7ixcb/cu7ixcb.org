In carnivores, talking with your prey might be an evolutionary disadvantage; you'd have to develop additional mechanisms to allow you to be sociopathic towards prey animals without compromising the rest of your goal structure.

There are various solutions to this problem; but one of them is to be a big, physically-capable predator that can kill prey without needing to rely on language skills.

(Or you might become lone, sociopathic "tricksters", or form close-knit tribes that only have loyalty within the group, or have particularly good facility at rationalization and social skills lion-king style.)
