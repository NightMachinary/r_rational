That's very true. But which creatures are unintelligent varies wildly between stories. And I'd personally rather explore the societal implications of intelligent creatures eating each other than downgrade a significant portion of the predator population. And it also makes explaining the intellect more difficult if not everyone has it. The way it is now, humans are the only special case. More special cases means a less elegant rationalization.
