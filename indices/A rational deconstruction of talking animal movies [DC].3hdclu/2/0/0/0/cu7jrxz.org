I'm not sure it's necessary. Humans often don't have too much trouble killing each other, even if they can understand each other. And we don't need each other for food. The biological incentive is there. The psychological rationalizations and dissociations are nothing new. The group dynamic is even present among cultures such as the Vikings or the Mongols, where preying on the weak and innocent is a societal way of life. With food among the prizes and a whole species of peers, thriving happily in such a life will only be even easier.
