First, your story sounds fascinating. I hope your viewpoint character explores all of the ethical ramifications over time as he or she learns more about the process of what is happening, as it would add a lot of weight to the arguments if they applied to actions already committed and not just hypothetical future actions.

Second, how would a time-traveling character even know the fate of a timeline he or she left behind? Assuming that you jumping back to a save point has destroyed an entire universe is a rather large assumption and I don't see how someone could collect data on it either way. The only exception I can see to this would be if setting a save point created a mental simulation and there was some tell to indicate this was the case (perhaps a range limitation causes only a small light cone to be copied and the stars begin to go dark after a few days/weeks/months/years) or if a time limit applied (simulated universe can only last for 90 days, after which point it either collapses or becomes glitchy -- though this tell would make the moral calculus a little easier, which may be a detractor if you want to explore that aspect).

Third, I wouldn't recommend having your character adhere too strictly to a moral framework. It could really get in the way of telling a good story if time travel never actually happens (after presumably a first accidental incident) because of moral reasons.
