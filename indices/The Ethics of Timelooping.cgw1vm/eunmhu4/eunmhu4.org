Book recommendation: [[https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications/dp/014027541X/ref=nodl_][The Fabric of Reality]]

Deals explicitly with how to think about a concept of time travel very similar to this. It's framed in terms of Virtual Reality, but I think you could translate it for your own use easily. As a bonus, it's a pretty fun tour of some really important ideas too.
