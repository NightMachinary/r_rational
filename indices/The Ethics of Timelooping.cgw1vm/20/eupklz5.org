The character-internal ethics are going to depend on how John perceives the multiverse operating. These may be separate and distinct from the ethics perceived by a person (or the audience) who has a different viewpoint on the multiverse.

So what if John is of the opinion that the multiverse, and all possibilities at all moments of time, are fixed and immutable, i.e. time itself only exists as a function of perception? Jumping back in time could then merely be transporting John's mind-state back to point X and continuing down the path of "What if John at this point in time gained this potential future knowledge from nowhere?" Effectively, he'd not have the ability to time-travel, per se, but have the ability to (mentally) jump timelines. No-one dies, the people John's previous timeline are all still there.

It's also possible that the time-travel ability doesn't exist at all, and every time John attempts to time-travel, the author simply picks up the story in the new timeline without indicating directly to the audience that this is now a completely different timeline and different John than the one they were reading about a sentence ago. No-one dies, they just stop getting written about.

Or perhaps a mental copy of John is sent from point Y back to point X and merges with John-X, forming a new splinter timeline X2. Meanwhile, John-Y is confused as to why his timeline-jumping ability doesn't seem to have worked this time (or maybe ever, if the ability follows the mental copy). No-one dies.
