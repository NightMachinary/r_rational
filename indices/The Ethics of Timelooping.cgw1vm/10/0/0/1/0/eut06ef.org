It doesn't matter, if you have a branching style multiverse every possible quantum dice result will create a universe for each possible result. This happens the same way before and after a time loop, so the set of universes in the multiverse won't change. Your specific POV universe might be different, but I don't think the multiverse changes at all.

Thinking some more, if the multiverse is a set of every possible universe (or every universe within constraints), there might be a zero utility cost to timelooping. anything that is different still happens in another universe, a set of all universes is identical to another set of all universes. Although, there can still be narrative consequences to time looping, as John probably don't have free access to whichever universe he wants.
