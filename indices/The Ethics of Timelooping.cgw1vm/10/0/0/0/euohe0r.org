That's assuming no faster than light travel, which in a world with time travel isn't a very safe assumption.

It does seem unlikely that a single instance of time travel could kill even a large majority of the universe, but, hypothetically at least, the protagonist could trigger an interstellar war between a series of FTL civilizations, wait for the various effects to propagate across galaxies and then reset it.
