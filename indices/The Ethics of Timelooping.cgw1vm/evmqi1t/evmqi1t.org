  I'd like to ask you this question: if someone told you that you were a simulation and decided to terminate you, would you consider it murder?

I don't see why not. In the end the universe too is just information processing itself. The whole "is the universe a simulation?" argument is an ill-posed question - the relevant question is, "is the hardware the universe is running on embedded within another, bigger universe?". Functionally, the universe is equivalent to a simulation running on a quantum computer.
