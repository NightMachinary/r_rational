Being potentially-able to avert a seemingly inevitable end-of-the-universe scenario allows your protagonist nigh-unlimited fuel for his trolley problem.

After all, if you look at an unbounded timeline of satisfying folks' utility functions, it would eventually counterbalance the disutility of killing a copy of everybody that is in the simulation 10 years early over and over to get to that unbounded open timeline.

Things get messier if he's only buying time to get to some yet-bigger time-bounded window.

There's an additional moral dilemma of using the ability to advance the save state. You "save" all the beings that existed, giving them a chance at an end-of-universe minus save-time window of opportunity, but reverting to an earlier state gives access to a slightly longer timeline for the beings you bring into existence through the loop. Is there a moral dilemma in "creating" a universe of beings with a shorter clock? and how do you weight one possible restore-state universe against another other than your perceived likelihood that one is more likely than the other to help you achieve the "good end" in which you actually avoid catastrophe in 10 years?
