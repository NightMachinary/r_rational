True. That's not something I'm unaware of though. In John's case, the latter would be escapism as the world ends sometime in the near future (I'm thinking 10 years from when he first awakened), and his ability resets upon death so he would be stuck in the loop unless he can avert the world end. Alternatively he could try searching for a universe with a massive time divergence from earth (say 1,000 seconds pass there for every second on Earth) and live out his life there. But eventually, that dream too would end.
