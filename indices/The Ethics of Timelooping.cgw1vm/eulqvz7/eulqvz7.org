Honestly I had some of the same thoughts as you while thinking about time travel in a series. If you have read Mother of Learning, this idea kinda gets brought up.

I think the most "ethical" view of time travel is that you are merging with a different timeline of yourself. As to what happens to you in your old timeline? You either drop dead or disappear.

Another way to view a purely mental version of time travel is that you are simply receiving mental messages from another version of yourself. This adds the constraint that your future self will only take actions that they reasonably think will succeed.
