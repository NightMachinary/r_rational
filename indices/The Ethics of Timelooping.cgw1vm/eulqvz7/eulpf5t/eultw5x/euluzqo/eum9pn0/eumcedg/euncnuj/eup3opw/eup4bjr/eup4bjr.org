Simulated entities might not necessarily have moral personhood from /outside/ the simulation, but if we exist on an equal basis with each other as simulations /inside/, then we have the same moral personhood. (Which is a similar argument to the theological principle that it's OK for /God/ to kill a baby but not /you/.)
