  Simulated entities might not necessarily have moral personhood from /outside/ the simulation, but if we exist on an equal basis with each other as simulations /inside/ , then we have the same moral personhood.

Aah, this makes sense. I guess my rejoinder is along the lines of: "what if there's no outside?" What if outside the simulation is some alien god and there's no other moral agent of any relevance. Coming back to my story, what if all the timelines are equally real?
