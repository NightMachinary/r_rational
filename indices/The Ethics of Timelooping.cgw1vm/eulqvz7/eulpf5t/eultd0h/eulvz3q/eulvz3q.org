  There's also the issue of whether it's better to exist and be killed or to never exist at all. The protag is basically creating everything living in the universe every time he goes back, but also kills everything from the last branch.

I addressed this:

  I mentioned above that either T_1.1 is created from T_1 due to the rewind, or T_1.1 already exists. I think this also has interesting ethical implications of its own. For one, if the rewind causes the creation of a new timeline, then each rewind causes amounts of utility equivalent to the total utility history of the multiverse (and if that number is positive), then the moral thing for John to do is to rewind as many times as possible (if the number is negative John creates even more disutility). Interestingly, if the rewinds creates the new timelines, and the multiverse is net positive utility, then the positive utility created by the multiverse may outweigh the negative utility created by omnicide.

I'll give the Wikipedia article a look.

  An argument I could see being made is that timelooping is no different than exercising free will. If I take action X at time 0, then by time 10101010, 100 trillion people will have died. If I instead take action Y, 101 trillion will have died instead. This happens for every action you take, conscious and unconscious.

The scale is different, but timelooping isn't unique in having an astronomical effect (the effects are just much more imminent).
