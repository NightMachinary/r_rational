From my understanding of speculative multiverse theory, I do not see a problem. All time frames of all *verses exist eternally. By rewinding, he returns to a frame, which in a linear perspective comes "before", but that is only his perspective. All other infinite time frames, even the ones he left behind exist timelessly.

If this interpretation is wildly off from your ideas, please ignore! I do think that reality, not even fiction, is that way.
