Interesting post. I've had similar thoughts when thinking up my own time travel story, though you've touched on some things that never occured to me.

  I mentioned above that either T_1.1 is created from T_1 due to the rewind, or T_1.1 already exists. I think this also has interesting ethical implications of its own. For one, if rewind causes the creation of a new timeline, then each rewind causes amounts of utility equivalent to the total utility history of the multiverse (and if that number is positive), then the moral thing for John to do is to rewind as many times as possible (if the number is negative John creates even more disutility). Interestingly, if the rewinds creates the new timelines, and the multiverse is net positive utility, then the positive utility created by the multiverse may outweigh the negative utility created by omnicide.

This bit is particularly interesting to me. I wonder if it even makes sense to think of multiple timelines in terms of utility, unless each timeline can interact with each other. Utility is pointless unless it's benefiting someone, so even if you're creating infinite worlds with a finite utility, the fact that you're creating infinite people to use up that utility ultimately negates that progress (IMO).

The only counter argument I can think of, is that the knowledge John brings from the future would potentially allow that world to better utilize the resources available to the people of that world. So in that sense, even though the same resources would be available in the new timeline that were available in the old one, The way they're used could make them more valuable to the New timeline as a whole. So in that case, there would potentially be utilitarian value in time travelling like this.

On a slightly unrelated note: I'm curious what would happen to the John of T_1 when he time travels to T_1.1. Esentially this is a transfer of memories or conciousness instead of a bodily transfer. So assuming a new timeline is created and the old one is still in tact, there's a few options. John's body on T_1 could just drop dead on the spot or have him be a brain-dead vegetable. Or the John on T_1 experiences no consequences. Simply a copy of his memories are sent to the new timeline and the John of T_1 is stuck dealing with his original timeline without reaping any of the benefits of knowledge that the new John on T_1.1 will have.

In any case, there's a lot here to explore. Good luck with your story and good luck not confusing people!
