I would estimate an extremely low probability, well below 1%, that I was destroying an entire universe with mental time travel. The idea in the first place seems like a giant non sequitur. It would be like assuming that upon my death, the whole universe would be destroyed because I'm not here to witness it. Why would I ever assume such a thing? I think there would be a huge burden of proof on the side assuming a universe is destroyed.

Things could become morally bankrupt pretty fast if the MC operated under a strictly utilitarian morality. Any actions in a temporary universe could be written off as very minor disutility relative to other events going on. Adopting virtue ethics for the duration of the time traveling could greatly simplify things, especially if the choice is consciously made at some point to utilize a different moral paradigm within the context of fake time.
