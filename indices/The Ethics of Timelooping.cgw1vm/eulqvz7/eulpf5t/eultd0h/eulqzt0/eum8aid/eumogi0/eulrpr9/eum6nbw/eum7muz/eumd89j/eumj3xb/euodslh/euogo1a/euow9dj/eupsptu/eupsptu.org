I agree with pretty much all of that except for the torture thing. If you torture someone, even if that torture is reversed or undone somehow, there's still terrible suffering that existed in the world due to your actions. There's also the fact that you're a flawed human being, and becoming the sort of creature capable of torturing people for information simply because it's convenient will inevitably start to eat away at your values and normal moral perceptions. You do enough bad things and you start to forget why you thought they were bad in the first place, which is going to lead to some serious value drift over time.
