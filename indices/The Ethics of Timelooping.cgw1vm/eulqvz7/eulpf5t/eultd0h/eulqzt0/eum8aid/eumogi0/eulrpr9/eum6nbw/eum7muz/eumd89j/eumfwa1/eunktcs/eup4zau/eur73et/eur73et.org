definitly a hard reccomend from me. its basically a deconstruction of the standard superhero setting and it explores themes of responsibility, the shifting line between ally and enemy, and what it really means to be a hero. its got kind of a slowish start offset quite well by its worldbuilding and depth of character. plus some of the best superhero fights ive ever read.
