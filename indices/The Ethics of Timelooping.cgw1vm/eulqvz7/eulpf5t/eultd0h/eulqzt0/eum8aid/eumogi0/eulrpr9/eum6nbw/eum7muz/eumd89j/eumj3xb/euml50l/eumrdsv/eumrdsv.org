I'm saying it's functionally identical, so you could reset only the light cone for the same result. In universe, this could be more energy efficient depending on the mechanism. Ethically, the deleted part of the multiverse outside this section will be replaced with a /completely identical/ replica, which in some ethical frameworks is better than destroying something unique.
