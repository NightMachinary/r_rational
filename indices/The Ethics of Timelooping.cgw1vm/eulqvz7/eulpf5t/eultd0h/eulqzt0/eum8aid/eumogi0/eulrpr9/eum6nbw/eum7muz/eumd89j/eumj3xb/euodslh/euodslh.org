This is easy enough to fix. Just make the rewind operation local to John, and also a cause for multiverse splitting.

For all t_y there exists some version of John who did not choose to rewind despite having the same history as the John who did rewind. That version of John continues on in that instance of the 'verse. The version of John who chose to rewind begins a new run at t_x.
