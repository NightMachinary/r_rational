First I'd like to note that all the ethical issues you discuss here are exactly the same as if your universe/multiverse had a branching non-mental time travel mechanic.

Second, you're completely right that a branching time travel model is an ethical black hole for stories - i.e. if you really think about the implications, the time travel itself is more morally significant than any other aspect of the plot or world.

If the timeline you're branching to already always exists, then morality is dead because now that any outcome/timeline that ever could happen, is happening, somewhere, and so all that is left is your personal selfishness about which timeline your strand of consciousness wants to be involved in.

If your branching time-travel creates a universe without destroying the original (or vice versa), that's incomprehensibly more morally significant that any disaster you were trying to stop.

If the branching both creates a new universe and destroys the old, that's the only configuration where other concerns could legitimately have any bearing. This is in fact a kind of "time travel" you could achieve without actual time travel - see the Omega 13 from Galaxy Quest, which is a universal "matter rearranger". If your protagonist accepted that this was certainly playing god on a huge scale, and was both omnicide and omni-nate(?), then he could make arguments along the lines of not privileging the lives currently being lived over the lives that could be lived in another possible timeline, and then just get on with his task.
