I now want a (probably short) Worm fanfic of a utilitarian-morality Coil-powered MC who has read one too many Iain M. Banks novel and so is aware of the simming problem.

That said, after they accidentally cancel a timeline for the first time, they might have a nervous breakdown. You could maybe get a second chapter out of the trolley problem of using it to avert the protagonists' own certain death in one or both timelines, but wow the level of grimderp would get bad fast.
