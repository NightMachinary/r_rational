The spatial impact of one reset can be restricted to the light cone from t_x to t_y, because to the universe outside a c*(t_y - t_x) radius of John at t_y, t_x is in the future. Entering the deleted light cone from outside would be a separate instance of time travel.

Because of the vast scale of space, most resets should only kill all life in the local solar system. Still massive, but quantifiable.
