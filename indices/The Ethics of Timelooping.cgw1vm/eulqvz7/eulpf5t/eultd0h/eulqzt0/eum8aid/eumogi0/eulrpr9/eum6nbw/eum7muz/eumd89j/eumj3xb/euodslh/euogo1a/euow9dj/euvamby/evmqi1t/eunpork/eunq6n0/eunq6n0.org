Generally when it comes to time travel: the only solutions I've came up with that don't have staggering inescapable ethical ramification require your world to either be simulated, or have physical laws that operate similarly.

This is because if your world operates like a simulation then you have the following options, which you didn't considered in your question:

- Firstly one can have the simulation run backwards (with exception possibly made for the MC's mind) to some specified point. This can let your maintain continuity of consciousness for everyone conceivably by letting them experience events in reverse, and erasing people's memories here seems as justifiable as any other form of memory manipulation. Of note here is that you have to either say that experiencing events in reverse is how time reversal works (which the MC would know if the rewrite didn't mess with their memories and they could remember the rewind process), or that the simulation/world is changed in such a way that people experience events in reverse when the time reversal happens.

- Secondly and slightly differently you could just have the state of the world changed all at once erasing everyone's memory (except the MC), but still potentially maintaining continuity of consciousness for everyone involved. The noteworthy difference here is just that people's memories are erased all at once instead of gradually, which you may or may not consider morally distinct. Also this option, unlike the first doesn't have an obvious way of making clear to the MC that they /probably/ aren't destroying entire multiverses.

Now in both cases the there may seem to be the issue that continuity of consciousness is still broken for people who died before the time travel, and the issue of how to deal with new persons that came into existence. However I think I can come up with solutions to both of those:

- One can have the hypercomputer simulation/multiverse that behaves similarly be "timeless". As in one could have the "simulation/reality" reference frame exist outside of normal time. Thus when time was "reversed" (whether gradually or not) the minds of anyone who died, would from their own temporal reference frame not experience a cessation of consciousness.

- People being brought into existence is trickier though, since it doesn't really have an apparent solution which doesn't treat minds as having special significance within the rules of the simulation. However since reality must /already/ treat minds as special in order to let the MC keep their memories (unless they time travel such that there will now be two copies of around at once), there's obviously precedent.\\
  So one could solve this issue in multiple ways: Fetuses or even infants below a certain age could just be imperfect P-zombies (since it doesn't seem like you would need a conscious process to imitate an infant, and certainly not a fetus), except in the final iteration of the timeline. Alternatively the process governing the "rewind" could just tweak any minds created during the duration of the time loop and basically reuse them for the fetuses/infants created in every iteration of the time loop. The first scenario only has the issue of deceiving parents, not so bad given the stakes. The second option has to alter the minds of the fetuses/infants involved (which could happen gradually), but this isn't necessarily terrible as the infants don't exactly have meaningful (conflicting) preferences. So doing this would be net neutral according to preference and classical utilitarianism.

Notably though these solutions presume the time loop isn't long enough for mind created during it to start being hard to simulate and having preferences which would conflict with them having their mind altered. Since in that case things are morally far more challenging. Also time loop stories generally don't involve years long loops, so you probably only have to worry about the creation of fetus minds which makes both solutions above work better.
