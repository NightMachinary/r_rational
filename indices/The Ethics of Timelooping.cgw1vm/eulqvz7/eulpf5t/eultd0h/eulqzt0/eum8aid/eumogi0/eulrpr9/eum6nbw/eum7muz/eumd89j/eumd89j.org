it seems to me that your mc is less timelooping /per se/ and more that they have a form of precog. much like Coil in wildbow's Worm, theyre not creating or destroying timelines (or even moving between them) but instead are running an incredibly detailed simulation of the consequences of n choices over the period [t_x, t_y]. so instead of T1, T1.1...T1.n just have knowledge from t_y appearing at t_n which im pretty sure would allow your mc to create maximal utility within his constraints. as to the mindcrime question i think that its probably not only prohibitively expensive to worryabout in terms of opportunity cost compared to astronomical stakes but probably impossible to avoid commiting once you have an agent running computations of sufficient advancement to be considered moral agents in and of themselves. honestly im pretty sure some humans capable of modelling behavior in arbitrary intelligences well could indeed already be committing mindcrime
