  How is this different from cloning the timeline updating it and terminating the source timeline? If we imagine the timeline as a simulation, I'm not sure that this and the other mechanic I described are any different. Not only do they behave exactly the same, the mechanism of "update the world state to this new world state" doesn't seem any different from a clone, update and terminate.

The difference is that you're rearranging the state of the world and altering people's memories, but no multiverse timeline is actually erased and everybody maintains continuity of consciousness albeit with memory modification.

  I think the maximum length of a loop in this story would be 10 years, but I imagine that there would be other universes where perhaps one earth second corresponds to 1000 of their seconds. Temporal differences between universes kind of obviate this as a solution. Regardless though, I don't expect the simulator to have any reason to care about our ethics, so I don't expect they would sacrifice even an iota of predictive accuracy due to moral concerns (your ideas about mitigating the moral harm of simulation).

Yeah if the time loops are 10 years then there's no good option for mitigating the moral concerns anyway. Since you have to either kill infinite children or completely overwrite the identities of an infinite number number of people which isn't exactly better.

Given you don't seem to want to design the time travel around giving your protagonist moral reason to justify their actions though, the only real good option here is probably just to make them amoral or willfully ignorant of the implications of their actions.\\
Since it's somewhat difficult to design the time travel such that the evidence available to the protagonist doesn't point towards them creating infinite multiverses doomed to death, just to save the small portion of timelines the protagonist exists in.
