I don't see a problem - everything he unmakes by rewinding will any of:

- happen again once t_y is reached (so at the second iteration of t_y there is no net change, no harm no foul)
- happen again, except that anything subject to true randomness (if that exists (in this setting)) might have a different outcome (in which case, the expected net good shouldn't change. I would compare this to doing anything IRL, where some nth-degree consequence has some chance of have a terrible effect - after a point, we must dismiss it). The only time this would be morally wrong is if some horrifically unlikely event occured, such that it changing would be very bad, and after rewinding it is very unlikely to occur again.
- Is something he, at t_x, can affect (so as long as he acts properly based on his knowledge, it is good).

Generally speaking, given the infinite time that time looping gives, a sufficiently competent and good character will probably use it to find maximally good paths anyway, which probably outweighs the temporary loss of the first kind and the probabilistic risk of the second.
