I think of this is similar to learning that your mind is running on a distributed cloud system. The system functions where every few minutes, your thoughts are frozen, the VM is ported over a network link to a different host node, and then restarted. As your reality is also simulated on the same VM each time, you see perceptually no difference.

​

So from an outside reality standpoint, you "die" every few minutes. Nothing about you lasts except for the every changing information making up your mind that gets copied from node to node. But I would imagine you could get used to it - your existence "now" is very temporary, so why sweat the next cycle?

​

Anyways, this seems similar to the idea of existing in a universe where other beings have erased you and rolled back billions of times - you still perceive a connected, contiguous "now" and if those erases and rollbacks are extremely frequently, then there is nothing to be upset about.
