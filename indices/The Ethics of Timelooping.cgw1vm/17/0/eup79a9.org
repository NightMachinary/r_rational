  require your world to either be simulated
#+end_quote

Why is this at all relevant?

#+begin_quote
  Firstly one can have the simulation run backwards (with exception possibly made for the MC's mind) to some specified point. This can let your maintain continuity of consciousness for everyone conceivably by letting them experience events in reverse, and erasing people's memories here seems as justifiable as any other form of memory manipulation. Of note here is that you have to either say that experiencing events in reverse is how time reversal works (which the MC would know if the rewrite didn't mess with their memories and they could remember the rewind process), or that the simulation/world is changed in such a way that people experience events in reverse when the time reversal happens.

This seems gimmicky, and I'm not sure how practical it is/what implications it has. That said, it is another approach to the mechanism of time travel that I hadn't considered, thanks for that. That said, I probably wouldn't be using it.

  Secondly and slightly differently you could just have the state of the world changed all at once erasing everyone's memory (except the MC), but still potentially maintaining continuity of consciousness for everyone involved. The noteworthy difference here is just that people's memories are erased all at once instead of gradually, which you may or may not consider morally distinct. Also this option, unlike the first doesn't have an obvious way of making clear to the MC that they /probably/ aren't destroying entire multiverses.

How is this different from cloning the timeline updating it and terminating the source timeline? If we imagine the timeline as a simulation, I'm not sure that this and the other mechanic I described are any different. Not only do they behave exactly the same, the mechanism of "update the world state to this new world state" doesn't seem any different from a clone, update and terminate.

  Notably though these solutions presume the time loop isn't long enough for mind created during it to start being hard to simulate and having preferences which would conflict with them having their mind altered. Since in that case things are morally far more challenging. Also time loop stories generally don't involve years long loops, so you probably only have to worry about the creation of fetus minds which makes both solutions above work better.

I think the maximum length of a loop in this story would be 10 years, but I imagine that there would be other universes where perhaps one earth second corresponds to 1000 of their seconds. Temporal differences between universes kind of obviate this as a solution. Regardless though, I don't expect the simulator to have any reason to care about our ethics, so I don't expect they would sacrifice even an iota of predictive accuracy due to moral concerns (your ideas about mitigating the moral harm of simulation).
