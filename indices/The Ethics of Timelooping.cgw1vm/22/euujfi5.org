There is an interpretation that involves no such things as multiple timelines:

Let t_0 be the point you're rewinding to, and t_y the point you're rewinding from.

Consider this: There is no such thing as a pre-rewind version of t_0 to t_y. The device is simply an oracle that at t_0 modifies your brain into what it predicts you are going to become, handwaving biocompatibility issues.
