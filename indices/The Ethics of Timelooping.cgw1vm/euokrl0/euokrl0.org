I'm not religious, and don't believe that humans have some kind of innate soul that has value in and of itself. So for me, the sum total of a person's value from a moral standpoint is their mind. Painlessly delete a mind and recreate it exactly and nothing is lost. Minds do have value to other minds, so killing someone, while they might not care afterwards, would cause pain to the people that knew them, or even potentially the people that might have known them in the future.

But none of that happens if you kill everyone. If everyone dies, there's no one to miss anyone. Assuming you do it painlessly, IE by time traveling, there's no intrinsic moral issues. Your actions in the meantime aren't erased, if you torture someone and then time travel it away, that's still bad, but it's actually better than torturing them and not time traveling it since if they don't exist anymore then they can't feel more pain about it in the future.

Now if people in your universe canonically have souls, like the people in the mother of learning universe do, then it's a different matter.
