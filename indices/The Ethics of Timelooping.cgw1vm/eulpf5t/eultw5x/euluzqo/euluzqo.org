  Since many people seem to have a strong preference for even a mediocre reality compared to a simulated life in paradise, it seems feasible that improving the real world at the expense of simulated lives would be morally permissible. Granted, I'm no empath, so I may be wrong.

I addressed this:

#+begin_quote
  If one believes that simulated copies don't have moral worth separate from the original, then I'd like to ask you this question: if someone told you that you were a simulation and decided to terminate you, would you consider it murder? Alternatively, if we found out that this universe was a simulation (and that there was a real "earth" somewhere) should we consider the termination of the said simulation omnicide? In short, do you believe in [[https://arbital.com/p/mindcrime/][mindcrime]]([[https://emma-borhanian.github.io/arbital-scrape/page/mindcrime.html][scraped on github (cause Arbital isn't reliable]]))?

Is that a bullet you're willing to bite? Would you accept the omnicide of this universe to benefit some other "real" universe?
