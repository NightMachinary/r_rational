While it sounds interesting, I think the core of the argument is flawed here. Utility functions aren't meant to be defined for universes where time travel exists, or for that matter lifelike simulations, or even the concept of a timeline stopping.

From this time traveler's perspective, there is only one universe that will last forever, and any other timeline is deleted (unwound) every time he goes back in time. He can't know if the lost timeline is stopped, continues normally, continues with more time travelers and more splits, continues and ends up as a utopia/dystopia, stops but saves all the people's memories and merges and sends them to the final timeline, continues with the absence of the time traveler, or continues to end up including a computer that will simulate every other timeline. He can't even assign probabilities to these things, because he isn't aware of some of the rules of metaphysics. Therefore, I argue that it's useless and irrelevant for him to morally consider anything that he has done inside the loop; only his own experiences, plus the final universe, should matter to him.

Also, since all of these universes are functionally simulations that start from our current world and slightly diverge, it's unlikely that any of them will be apocalyptic hellish morality disasters, or vice versa. The timelines will end up being finitely similar to each other, before he goes back each time. So, if you do want to consider the "utility/morality cost" of each such pruned branch of alternate history, it will always be pretty similar to the "utility/morality cost" of just continuing with our normal universe for some small finite amount of time, and it's pretty insignificant when compared to the entire rest of potential human future in the final (supposedly maximally-good) timeline.

Not to mention - the utility/morality cost of each pruned timeline could totally be positive, and not negative. If most people enjoy their lives and prefer living to not living (a pretty safe assumption), then re-simulating the universe over and over with slight differences could be considered as a very good thing to do.

Your point about "committing omnicide" when you go back in time is ridiculous, because you're also committing the opposite of omnicide when you restart the universe from earlier, and because simply making a person stop existing in a vaccuum where no other people will ever know or be affected by it is what I would consider morally meaningless. It's not murder if the person's life is going to get repeated soon (albeit with slight differences), or if the person is just never going to live again (e.g. when time-traveling after babies are born). Just like we don't consider the fact that we are not spending our entire time creating babies to be murder. The reason we don't like murder is that in our world it has lasting consequences and takes something away from the world, but in a time travel scenario, the murder is just undone and the world isn't any different for it.

I think the only coherent, interesting, and agreeable model of time travel ethics would be to completely disregard the lives that are going to get undone when you loop back, and only consider yourself (the time traveler) and the final outcome universe, or if that does not exist, your final chosen path in all time loops after a certain point.

And yes, this does make it morally fine to repeatedly torture every person in the world for information, unwinding that time, and then creating the perfect timeline. I guess that's the price of progress.
