You should watch The Matrix, at least the first one. It's quite good.

Presenting people with the hypothesis that they're (in) a simulation is generally not going to be taken any more seriously than the idea that the world was created Last Tuesday with our memories intact. It's too ludicrous for most folks to contemplate at all, and even among those of us who do contemplate it, it's really only /useful/ if there are some exploitable implications, eg time-looping or reincarnation with memories intact, or local deviations from the norms of physics.
