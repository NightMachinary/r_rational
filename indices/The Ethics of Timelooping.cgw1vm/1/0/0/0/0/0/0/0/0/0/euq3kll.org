Well, I guess write the story and find out. I suggest having multiple characters with different moral takes on it - narcissistic hedonist doesn't give a damn, utilitarian tries to calculate what they should do, consequentialist tries to live a good life and sees what happens, deontologist decides on a code of ethics in advance and follows that.

There's a reason humanity has not been able to find a binding solution to any moral question in ten thousand years of trying. Your job as a writer is firstly to entertain, secondly to provoke epiphany and amazement, thirdly to educate.
