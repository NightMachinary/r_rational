  Presenting people with the hypothesis that they're (in) a simulation is generally not going to be taken any more seriously than the idea that the world was created Last Tuesday with our memories intact. It's too ludicrous for most folks to contemplate at all, and even among those of us who do contemplate it, it's really only /useful/ if there are some exploitable implications, eg time-looping or reincarnation with memories intact, or local deviations from the norms of physics.

Well the purpose in this case is that apparently, some people believe that simulated copies don't have moral personhood. I merely want to know if they are willing to bite the bullet of omnicide. If people don't find "what if we are the simulation" worth considering, then they are not seriously reckoning with the concept of simulated persons. It shouldn't be possible for a given agent to determine whether they are real or the simulation (assuming high fidelity simulations).
