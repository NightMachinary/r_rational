While we're questioning the basic moral framework we're using, I think it's worth noting that there exists a utility function (that I find quite agreeable) which would open the door to only giving moral weight to unsimulated lives. In preference utilitarianism (or desire-satisfaction consequentialism, or whatever), the value of an action is determined by how well its consequences meet everyone's well-informed desires.

Since many people seem to have a strong preference for even a mediocre reality compared to a simulated life in paradise, it seems feasible that improving the real world at the expense of simulated lives would be morally permissible. Granted, I'm no empath, so I may be wrong.

Side note: At what point does a simulated life become morally valuable? Does your idea of a character have any moral value as a simulated life?
