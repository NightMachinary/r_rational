  Now, if he's using his ability frivolously, then that's a different thing. If John's looping through time to get into the pants of someone he's attracted to, then yes, he should feel bad about the people he's condemned to sure. On the other hand, if he chooses to loop to get closer to a solution to the universe-ending threat, he's not killing anyone. What he's doing is prioritizing the patients he can save over the ones he can't, which is just basic triage.

Thank you very much for this. This is interesting as it constrains John from frivolous use of his looping ability (without me designing any mechanics to do so).
