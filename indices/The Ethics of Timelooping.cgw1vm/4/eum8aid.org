  As an aside, even if hypothesis 1 was true, then John may still cause omnicide as there's a multiverse ending event (John believes his time rewinding ability is to avert it (he auto rewinds to a fixed save point at when he first awakened his powers if he dies or gets stuck in an infinite loop)), so if the time rewind clones the timeline, if all possible timelines don't already exist and rewinding creates a new timeline, then it seems to me that John rewinding time is omnicide.

I'm going to focus on this, because this is a relatively easy one.

The first rule of first aid is "Don't become another patient." If you get yourself injured or killed trying to help someone eldeyr, you've just made the problem worse for the next person to deal with. So, if you see someone bleeding out at the bottom of a steep incline, and, you're not confident you can safely descend in time to save that person... or sounds heartless, but your priority has to be keeping yourself safe.

How does this pertain to your time loop?

From what you've described, the universe your character is currently in would be the person at the bottom of the cliff, bleeding out. They're already dying, through no fault of John's, and getting himself killed to rescue them just makes things worse.

Now, if he's using his ability frivolously, then that's a different thing. If John's looping through time to get into the pants of someone he's attracted to, then yes, he should feel bad about the people he's condemned to sure. On the other hand, if he chooses to loop to get closer to a solution to the universe-ending threat, he's not killing anyone. What he's doing is prioritizing the patients he can save over the ones he can't, which is just basic triage.
