An argument I could see being made is that timelooping is no different than exercising free will. If I take action X at time 0, then by time 10^{10^{10^{10,}}} 100 trillion people will have died. If I instead take action Y, 101 trillion will have died instead. This happens for every action you take, conscious and unconscious.

There's also the issue of whether it's better to exist and be killed or to never exist at all. The protag is basically creating everything living in the universe every time he goes back, but also kills everything from the last branch.
