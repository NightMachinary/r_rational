/This/ is a /very/ important and interesting note; it changes the entire debate around when (and whether) John should use his looping powers. Because, unless he aggressively pursues longevity, we can assume that he /will/ die sooner or later. Perhaps not immediately, but within (say) the next two hundred years, it seems inevitable.

And then, when that happens, he /will/ rewind. There's not much choice here. If John's time travel destroys the universe, then the universe that he is in is /already doomed/.

It's just a matter of /when/ the universe is destroyed; not /whether/.
