Honestly, I think you are going a little too deep on this. Assuming the timeline he leaves effectively ceases to exist, while he has committed omnicide he has also created a similar amount of life. To quote Gandalf, “Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.”. Our MC can indeed give life to people who deserve it. He has the power to choose a reality where those who deserve death get it and those who deserve life get it.

Now you could always get into the ethics of meddling with fate and the arrogance of assuming you're own choices have any sort of moral authority on right and wrong, if you were so inclined. Still though, the reality is that for approximately every person who loses out because he went back there is another who is happier for it, so long as he doesn't manage to incite any particularly bad disasters. Meaning that the morals of making a new timeline are (rationally) the exact same as being able to save one person out of a pair. Internally it could be quite problematic and result in guilt, but there was no right or wrong choice.
