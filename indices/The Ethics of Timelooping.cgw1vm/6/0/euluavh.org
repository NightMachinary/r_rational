  This bit is particularly interesting to me. I wonder if it even makes sense to think of multiple timelines in terms of utility, unless each timeline can interact with each other. Utility is pointless unless it's benefiting someone, so even if you're creating infinite worlds with a finite utility, the fact that you're creating infinite people to use up that utility ultimately negates that progress (IMO).

Well ceteris paribus, do you consider creating new lives (who would raise both total and average utility) a good thing? If you do, then I think you'll consider creating the new multiverses beneficial.

  On a slightly unrelated note: I'm curious what would happen to the John of T_1 when he time travels to T_1.1. Esentially this is a transfer of memories or conciousness instead of a bodily transfer. So assuming a new timeline is created and the old one is still in tact, there's a few options. John's body on T_1 could just drop dead on the spot or have him be a brain-dead vegetable. Or the John on T_1 experiences no consequences. Simply a copy of his memories are sent to the new timeline and the John of T_1 is stuck dealing with his original timeline without reaping any of the benefits of knowledge that the new John on T_1.1 will have.

Or T_1 is terminated?
