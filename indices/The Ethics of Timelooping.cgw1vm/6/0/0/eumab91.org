I think creating completely identical lives is somewhat pointless. If those lives already exist, then destroying them is bad. But I don't personally see the value in creating life, if it will live in an exactly identical way to something that already exists.

Though I'm of the opinion that creating life in general isn't necessarily a morally good thing, depending on the quality of the lives created. Unless you're already living in a utopia, creating more life might just mean creating more suffering. (Note: Not that it's necessarily morally bad to have children in the current world. Just you should only have children if you think you can give them a life worth living.)

Also, my comment's initial assumption was that T_1 was not being terminated.

  So assuming a new timeline is created and the old one is still in tact, there's a few options.

I did misspell intact though, so I don't blame you for missing it.
