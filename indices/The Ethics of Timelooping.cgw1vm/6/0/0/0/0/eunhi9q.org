It only seems natural, if John is the only being who "matters"; in which case the ethical implications are self-resolved.

As someone with an actual real-life superpower like John's, here's how it works for us: we create our savepoints through moments of happiness that are clearly remembered, eg that time we finally finished high school or moved out of home or had a nice date with someone. Whenever we experience a state of extreme regret, such that we desperately wish that we could return back to that time knowing what we now know, the multiverse makes a copy of our mindstate and sends it back down the timeline to the savepoint. It then overwrites the mind of the previous Aeschenkarnos (which is a subset of the data, so it's not "killing him" and we see no ethical issues), and he then proceeds to live out his life in a divergent timeline. The original self continues on, living with all of the mistakes he made after the savepoint.

So far, I've only ever been the original self, but maybe that will change.
