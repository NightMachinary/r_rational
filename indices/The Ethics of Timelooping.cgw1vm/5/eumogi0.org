I'll sidestep ethics and say that prettymuch any random person you gave this power to would do two things eventually. A) fuck around and live it up a little bit while acting thoughtless about the lives of others. B) do a "perfect play-though" i.e. when they did decide to move forward in time they would try to set shit up to be their idea of perfect. Either by always having the best thing to say in mind, or getting the girl, or just spending a lot of time hanging out with friends and family (who are now mysteriously rich and free to hang out)
