  If one privileges some "real" timeline, I'd like to point out that if the simulation goes on for long enough, the simulated agents may sufficiently diverge from their "real" copies that they're no longer the same moral persons. Alternatively, some entirely new agents may be created in the simulation that would not exist in the "real world".
