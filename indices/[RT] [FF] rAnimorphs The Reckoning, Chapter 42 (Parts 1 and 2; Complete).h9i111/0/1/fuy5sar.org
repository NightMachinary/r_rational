That would be one hell of a twist if the POV of V3 noticing he's a single entity now is actually the POV of someone who's been set up as a clone. With the original V3 happy little Alloran-Esplin marriage still being out there pulling the strings.\\
Though.... that clone just being made to negotiate with the Animorphs doesn't make sense, as we see him neutron-bombing the West. [unless that V3 made another clone, but.... eh]

Though it would be hilarious if Marco or Garret thinks of this possibility (whether it's true or not) and V3 freaking out, because this hasn't occured to him yet.
