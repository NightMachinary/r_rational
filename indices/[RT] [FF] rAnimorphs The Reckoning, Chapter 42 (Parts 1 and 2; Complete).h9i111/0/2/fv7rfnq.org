Note that V3 was physically separated from the fleet by the opening of the rift, and even with the bridge/tunnel hasn't been able to directly access them (since they were in the middle of the slow expanse, while the bridge/tunnel goes straight from fast space to fast space). So it's conceivable that, as he headed into bumpkin territory, occupied by an essentially non-space-faring species, he hadn't yet fully ramped up into megaparanoia mode.

It's /likely/ that he's put in some kind of self-destruct, but I think it's also /plausible/ that he hasn't.
