Great chapter <3

Just noticed I don't really have a model of Yerk command structure. Are pools given an allocation of ranks that they fill as they see fit, or do Vissers and such have relatively enduring personalities? I guess Yerk society is changing, becoming more individual based with the greater availability of hosts and ways of feeding outside of the sharing.

Oh no, Jake invoked the unspoken plan guarantee.

I always think this stories at it's best for me when the Animorphs are talking things over with multiple threads going at once in thoughtspeak, so yay for more of that.

Ooo, and Marco got with Rachel, I'd forgotten that he was interested in her. Yay for them!

Also not sure why Garret thought Ante should have gone first in the role call. Maybe for alphabetical order reasons, but the rest weren't quite in alphabetical order anyway.
