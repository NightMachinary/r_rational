I had to go back and check:

  There was an echoing sensation, as if of laughter. ‹Not Temrash,› corrected the Yeerk. ‹Perdão, of the first pool of Terra. Though half of Temrash three-one-three makes up nearly half of me.›

Ah, so Perdao's like 110% of Temrash's size. Ok, I'm curious now. How much did Cirran overshoot by when it made Esplin for Alloran?

Yeah, I would agree that Jake being hella traumatized and ignoring it isn't evident to me from reading the text. But it'd be interesting to see if/how that trauma manifests itself down the line. Maybe if faced with another NEED-THE-INFO situation Jake might not ask that of Perdao again.
