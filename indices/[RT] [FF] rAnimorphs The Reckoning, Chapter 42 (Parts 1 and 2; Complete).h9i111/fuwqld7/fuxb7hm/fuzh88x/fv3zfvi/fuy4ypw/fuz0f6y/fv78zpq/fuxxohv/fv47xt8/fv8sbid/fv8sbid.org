Hey, Jake did the Perdao infestation! Although that was very...uneventful, compared to how Tiyagi experienced it. There's a few ways I interpret that:

- It seems consensual infestation is no-big-deal compared to unconsensual (ex Tobias with Temrash).

- Jake's been through so much shit that infestation trauma doesn't even phase him.

I'm curious, Perdao is a fairly large Yeerk in terms of mass compared to Visser 1/4 and Maninho. She's also bigger than Temrash which I'm assuming is about average size for total human control. Did she leave parts of herself back in Ax's brain when infesting humans? Seems kinda like an Esplin situation here, more Yeerk than necessary for the host brain.
