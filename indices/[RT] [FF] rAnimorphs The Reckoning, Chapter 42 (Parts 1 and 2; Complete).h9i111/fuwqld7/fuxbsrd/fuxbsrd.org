  I would love it if the Visser were actually sincere here, since this seems to leave open the possibility of him being redeemed by, say, using his biotech to explicitly change his own values. But currently I do not trust him one bit. Even if he follows through on his promise to leave humanity alone with the cube, are the Animorphs really prepared to let him take over the rest of the galaxy for himself? What kind of a future for humanity is that, trapped in one solar system surrounded by copies of a greedy alien psychopath?

I don't think he'd be willing to modify himself like that. We know he's single-mindedly, pathologically focused on the preservation of his self, to the point where he would execute his own clones upon waking them up if their perspective had drifted too far from his own. I think he would view changing his own mind like that as being too much like death for him to go through with it, especially if he was modifying himself in such a way that he was less devoted to his goal of beating death.
