Great chapter! The Animorphs have leveled up to the point of having a space fleet. I'm not convinced the Visser doesn't have his own secret ability to self-destruct all the ships at the flick of a switch or something - otherwise why let the Animorphs take them so easily - but at least the Animorphs get to feel like they're doing something.

I would guess that the Visser specifically constructed a clone emissary with tweaked values optimized for negotiating with the Animorphs. Assuming he had time to do this after Telor landed their blow, that is. (The fact that he seems to be able to control so many new bodies suggests he does have copies lying around). I love the interactions with the Visser in this chapter.

> Where do /wants/ come from?  What are they made of?  How do you change them?

I would love it if the Visser were actually sincere here, since this seems to leave open the possibility of him being redeemed by, say, using his biotech to explicitly change his own values. But currently I do not trust him one bit. Even if he follows through on his promise to leave humanity alone with the cube, are the Animorphs really prepared to let him take over the rest of the galaxy for himself? What kind of a future for humanity is that, trapped in one solar system surrounded by copies of a greedy alien psychopath?

And we've yet to hear from Tobias and his trump card Puppyship. (Or to figure out what the deal with Rachel is, or what the deal with the apparent time travel is).

So all in all, I'm very excited! Keep it up, TK17!
