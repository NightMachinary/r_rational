It worries me a lot that we had that interlude earlier about where the Crayak put the Drode in as a helpfile. The Visser is much more of a glove than it thinks it is, and I'm concerned that notion is bleeding over to our crew.

The pieces go back in the box once the game is over, no matter who wins.
