I like how they just bluffed their way into having total command of an entire fleet. There are times when they all just feel like teenagers frantically running around and pretending they can make a difference while the world crumbles around them, and then there are times where they do shit like /that/. It feels really good that this chapter spent most of it feeling like the first way, only to end on that note. It reminds you that they do have a lot of things going for them, that they /can/ make a difference, that there /is/ hope, even if it usually doesn't feel that way.
