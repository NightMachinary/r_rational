As if we need further evidence that the Animorphs and V3 are being manipulated into conflict, consider how much easier it would be for them to take this deal if they hadn't all personally lost people to the war already.

V3 is right in hammering home the earlygame-midgame-endgame point. When you're waging war, unless extermination of all enemies is your goal, there's always a balance to be struck in killing as many of the enemy as possible in the hopes that you cripple their ability to resist and they'll surrender sooner, without doing something so horrendous that you just strengthen their resolve to fight longer.

Earth would never surrender itself to an alien that didn't demonstrate the ability to rain hell down on it. So, once subtle takeover was no longer possible, V3 had to rain hell down on it. Wiping out a small city wouldn't really matter to the people in charge of getting the nations of earth to surrender; it would normally just be a demonstration of power, a way to say Take Me Seriously.

But instead, enslaving and killing the people of Ventura in specific also made it that much more likely that the Animorphs (who by fate are the most agenty Earthlings) would feel /personally invested/ in stopping and killing V3, making even good deals like this one seem that much more unpalatable.

I also really like Jake pointing out that V3 having "got got" might have been enough to change his strategy and goals. V3 is pathologically against any form of value drift or change, but that doesn't mean he's incapable of /learning/ or /updating on new realities,/ which means when he found himself facing enemies that actually needed to be taken seriously, he also might have to legitimately compromise.

That doesn't mean he won't grab a new advantage that has no costs if he can, of course. But his offer seems credible, to me, especially with a leeran being used beforehand (normally I'd say V3 could just send a copy of himself that genuinely believes in the deal while another version of himself intends betrayal, but the way he's set things up I'm not sure if that would count as too unaligned a V3 to tolerate).
