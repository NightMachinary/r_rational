  Sometimes though, it's speculation about things that I know won't come to pass, and I always feel a little guilty about not being able to deliver on things that people want to happen, because I'm not writing quite the story that they want, I'm writing the story that I want.

I don't think guilt is the right emotion there! People like speculating on possibilities in fictional worlds, but that doesn't mean they are disappointed when something else comes to happen. If all speculation comes true, the story is too predictable :P

[[/u/Kuiper]] had a great comment about exactly that, which you've probably seen, but linking it anyway: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9jugqw/what_storytelling_techniques_have_you_learnt_from/e6uj7ld/]]
