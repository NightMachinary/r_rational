Depends on the speculation. Sometimes it's a feeling of relief, because people noticed the things that they were meant to notice, and that I had worried were either too obvious or two subtle. Sometimes there are good ideas, which I wish that I'd thought of but don't have room for, or which are contradicted by the text in a few places.

/Sometimes/ though, it's speculation about things that I know won't come to pass, and I always feel a little guilty about not being able to deliver on things that people want to happen, because I'm not writing quite the story that they want, I'm writing the story that /I/ want.
