I thought it would be fun to make a google sheet for this for easier comparisons: [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YkxeAllnnf_8xlnePSdSIRsEX_H94uxEldLWNQzagvM/edit?usp=sharing]]

Feel free to add a column for yourself, or add more rows with more predictions. I populated it with the predictions in the OP and added a few 'Red Robe is ...' entries.

My own take:

I haven't read PGtE, but for WtC I generally think joon will probably end up with amaryllis, uther is not fel seed, and both earth and aerb are simulations. (I also think that the DM has 'read-only' access to earth and runs aerb as a garage hacker project.)

Don't really have any idea where MoL is going, though, except I think

#+begin_quote
  MoL will be completed during 2019: 30%
#+end_quote

is kind of low, given nobody's statements about how many chapters are left.
