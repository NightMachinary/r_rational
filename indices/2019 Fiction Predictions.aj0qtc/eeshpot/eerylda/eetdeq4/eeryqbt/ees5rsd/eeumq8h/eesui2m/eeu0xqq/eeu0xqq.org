- The Tyrant will survive Book 5: yes, and by exploiting narrative no less

- Pilgrim will survive Book 5: No

- One of the Woe (Akua not included) die in Book 5: yes, in fact I think 2 of them will die

- Akua will betray the Woe in Book 5: yes, but as part of a bigger double-cross, because come on it's Akua

- Akua will heroically sacrifice herself in Book 5: No, she'll move unto something else entirely
