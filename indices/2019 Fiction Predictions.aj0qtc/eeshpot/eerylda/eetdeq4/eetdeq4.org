Re: WtC completion in 2019

The [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][word count document is here]]. Average words per day (WPD) since February 7th, 2018 was 1085. There are 342 days until December 31st, 2019. Assuming historical rates of writing, that means that by December 31st, 2019, and assuming that it doesn't end, /Worth the Candle/ would be another 392,000 words longer than it is today.

For this, we need two probabilities:

- How likely is it that writing on /Worth the Candle/ will exceed an average of 1085 WPD?
- How likely is it that there are more than 392,000 words until the end of /Worth the Candle/?

I suppose two different people could have very different answers to both of those questions, and come to the same conclusions about end date, i.e. someone thinks writing will go really slow, but also thinks that the end is relatively close, and someone else who thinks the writing will go fast, but that there's a lot of ground to cover before the end.

For my own prediction, the only ones that I'll be making:

- 80% chance that work on /Worth the Candle/ will continue at a rate of roughly 1085 WPD until completion
- 70% chance that there are less than 392,000 words until the end of /Worth the Candle/ (21,000 of these are already written for the next update, and ~15,000 are already written for future updates)
