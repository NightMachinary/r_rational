This is a good idea, Id much rather be reading a story I know that has a goal to using resources and common sense to advance human race. I learned about cryonics being applicable in real life, other TH works could teach people about thins as well.

But since were on the topic of accurate tags for books and such, wouldn't it be better to just add a simple number score when posting, something like:

RT 1 (or lowest) Book X

Where the plot is written with a little bit hindsight and occasional common sense.

and

RT 10 (top) Where the plot is based on introducing and calculating every aspect of a certain unusual object or occurrence like magic or aliens, and them the story is just natural progression of what happens next.

I mean this as means to tell apart low and high RT and RST
