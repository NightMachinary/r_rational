Ok no scales then, but any sort of way to determine the level of rationality lesson, rational world building or even competence porn would be great.

Example:

HPMOR: High rationality, low to medium rational world, medium competence porn, low amounts of hard science fiction.

It's been a while since I read it so this, so my estimate may be wrong.
