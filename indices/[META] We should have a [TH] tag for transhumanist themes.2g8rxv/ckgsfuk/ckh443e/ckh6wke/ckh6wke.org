Meh. I first added the genre tags to deal with the complaining about whether fics should or shouldn't be posted, and it's seemed to deal with that quite well. But I agree that [RT] and [RST] do away with some of that - brilliant thinking with those, by the way. Huge fan of the reorganized characteristics.

Looking at the genre tags, [Mk] isn't even in the official listing, and [DC] hardly ever pops up. Those two can be lumped under "rational", anyway. And [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness][[HSF]]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson#Sanderson.27s_Laws][[HF]]] were just an experiment - for a little while, nobody posted anything here, so I decided to open it up to the Hard Fiction crowd (still underrepresented on reddit). I've been pleased to see many people posting stories with [HF] and [HSF] labels as time progressed, and I still feel like there are wealths of literature in those genres that remain untapped in this sub. I don't know how I'd feel about their exclusion.

Up to you, ultimately. We chose you carefully, so I'll leave it to your judgement. I look forward to seeing your decision.
