Oh, and while I'm looking at the sidebar:

- The first sentence of the first paragraph is missing the word "fiction".

- I think the explanation also negates the need for the lesswrong link on the word "rationalist".

- Wise reading was a fun idea, but despite my attempts to push it, it never took on. I think the link should stay, but doesn't deserve a whole paragraph to itself. It sort of takes away from the bit about reposting and spoilers - which come up much more frequently.

- On that note, yeah, those two tidbits should be better emphasized.

- The rational / rationalist fiction bit takes up a lot of space ... Theoretically, it could be replaced with a link to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2el9lr/on_the_distinction_between_rational_fiction_and/][your post explaining it]], but that's more of a aesthetic nitpick than a substantial one. Hardly important.
