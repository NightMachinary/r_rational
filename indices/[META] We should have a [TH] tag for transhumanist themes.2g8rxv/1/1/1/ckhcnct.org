Removing genre tags does help make things more straight forward. I think though it might be a good idea to make an official thread about this before implementing the change. So you get more feedback on the idea and reach a general census.

Personally, I have always found genre tags useful before diving into a read. (seraphnb) And the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=%5BDC%5D&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all&count=25&after=t3_1vy3el][DC tag for example]] allowed us to post loads of relevant interesting content. Some that we might have otherwise hesitated to post under a RT tag - RT has always been serious business :P
