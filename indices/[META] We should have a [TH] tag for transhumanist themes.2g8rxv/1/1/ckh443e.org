Hmm. Looking at our current tag system, they seem to fall into a couple of categories:

- rational-ness of a story

- genre of a story

- I'm writing something

- other topics

To avoid tag overload, how about just removing genre tags? That still maintains the distinction between posting a finished sotry, talking about a WIP, and general discussion; and I think simplifies the system nicely. I'll do this in the morning, I think.
