How nice that we got to see Cecilia again, looks like she's doing well for not having a body anymore.

I've never played Pathfinder, so most of the metagaming went over my head, but the results of it are pretty neat. Can you really make a separate plane of existence and scale it up to world size and make it a hyperbolic time chamber all in the size of a bag? This seems so far out of the scale of magic that I'm used to in a typical game of DnD 4/5e.

Also, I started reading The Dark Tower because of Cowboy Boots. It's every bit a gritty western as I expected.
