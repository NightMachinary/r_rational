Re: your question, yes! Recastings of [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/genesis/][Genesis]] will tack on 60 feet per cast. This turns out to be a massively better investment in terms of planar volume gained per cast than [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-demiplane/][Create Demiplane]], which only allows you to stack a few cubic blocks per cast. Technically Genesis is a higher level spell than Wish can reproduce safely, but if you were in a PF world you could also get a high level cleric and cast the spell directly a million times with him, using something like the simulacrum trick. There are /many/ ways to make one caster into many casters, with PF, and it does tend to break the game.

As far as the hyperbolic time chamber aspect, it's something of a fudge. Technically the spell allows you to set "Double Speed vs Material Plane" as a maximum which is far less broken though still quite OP in distorting the action economy of the game. But the entry for flowing time does /describe/ realms where 1 round of material plane time equals 1 year. That makes it RAW in terms of what is /possible/, but you're going to be hard pressed to trick your GM into setting that up for you, unless you need it for other purposes.
