It might be because of the spacing issues drawing extra attention, but the italicization feels like it's been multiplied by 10 in the last few chapters, to the point where it's a bit difficult to read at times. I remember when I was a kid realizing that /every single page/ of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had at least one italicized word--this is starting to feel a bit similar.
