*Speculaaaaation tiiime (unstructured stream of consciousness, just the way I likes it)*:

Aight, so I'm fairly certain Sasapariller isn't going to pull a teddyx3 on us, which means I can say what I'm really thinking. There's some parallels to the guide here tbh, but only cursory in that knowledge of the overarching reality-bending physics-defying but subjective-rule-following metagame can help you accomplish objectives better.

In Sean's case, this metagame happens to be loosely defined fictional worlds, which can impose their own rules around reality, but kinda fall apart when he tries to scrutinize them. As the rationalist in the story, he's one of the few who can 'defy the story', remembering that the cake is a lie, indeed. He already shown he can do that when logic-bombing the alice in wonderland story.

Haley can't do it because she's living a story; you can see a dragon and find it incredible(literally lacking credibility), but when you are a dragon, not so much.

BAM - its time to logic-bomb them Aslans. Jesus is fake, evil isn't a single witch you can beat, and two can sacrifice themselves for the greater cause. I rest my case.
