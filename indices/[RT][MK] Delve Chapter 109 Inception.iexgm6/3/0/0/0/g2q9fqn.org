It's not "learn to write" so much as "basically unedited". Given the opportunity, people ramble. Basically every web serial (even well-regarded ones like Worm) is way longer than it has any reason to be. Though to be fair, books are not immune to that either (my hardcopy of /Oathbringer/ is /twelve hundred pages long/).
