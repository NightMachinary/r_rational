Ah, Rain has been promoted from random to Custodian. Almost as good as being promoted from employee to customer.

Hopefully this means Rain will increase his level soon, personally this arc wasn't to my liking. I really do wonder what the deal is going to be with Dozer, he's gotta have some major story purpose right?
