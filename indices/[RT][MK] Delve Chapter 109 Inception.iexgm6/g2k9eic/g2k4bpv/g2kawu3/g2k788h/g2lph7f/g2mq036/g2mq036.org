I really like Delve but it's pretty clear if it was ever published an editor would cut a lot of material. Almost the entire stuck underground segment could be cut w/o affecting the course of the story for example. /But/ that's web serials really. Overwhelmingly they're learn to write projects so it's to be expected that mistakes are made.
