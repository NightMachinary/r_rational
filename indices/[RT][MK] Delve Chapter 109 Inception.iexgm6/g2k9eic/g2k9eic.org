This was a chapter where /things happened/ and I really like that.

It seems that Rain is way too often just reacting to bullshit. The story gets bogged down from it.

But here, we see plans for the future. Invitations are extended, decisions are made, and I want more chapters like this where characters move /forwards/

Does anyone have any guess as to what link sight was trying to tell him?
