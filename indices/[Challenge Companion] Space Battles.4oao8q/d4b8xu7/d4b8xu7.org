Jack Campbell's Lost Fleet series really gets me going on this subject. Not necessarily rational, but a lot of thought put into the physics constraints of space warships (at least, the ones he decided to leave in. TWO kinds of FTL travel?).

Plenty of descriptions of jumping into a system and almost instantly gaining a picture of the intrasystem traffic- as it was minutes or hours ago, based on how far away you started, along with a countdown of how long it'll be before they know you're there. Relativistic problems with even computer-generated firing solutions abound, along with my absolute favorite kind of space warfare: chucking a fuck-off big rock at an orbit-locked target that can't dodge, like a planetary command center.
