Stealth in space is one of those big, endless debates that's taken place on online forums since the beginning of the internet. Heat is one of the big things you need to worry about in space, because vacuum is an insulator, so IR sensors seem like they'd be one of the dominant methods of finding other ships. If you're in deep space, you're trying to hide a heat signature against a background temperature of ~3 degrees Kelvin.

It's doable /if/ you know what direction the enemy sensors are in, if you go passive sensors only, and you have a heatsink of some kind, but it's still unworkable if you're also trying to use thrust, because spaceship engines are hot. It's exceedingly rare that scifi authors actually go through the work to get a ship properly stealthy, but I will concede that you might contrive some circumstance where it's useful and practical to go through all the effort to be stealthy.

This goes out the window if you're bringing in some softer science fiction, and there's still room for subterfuge, but stealth in space is really frickin' hard.
