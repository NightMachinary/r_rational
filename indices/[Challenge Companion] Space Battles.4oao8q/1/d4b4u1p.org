[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nubsg-the-scattering.326749/][NuBSG: The Scattering]] is my new default canon for nBSG stories, one that doesn't have the Colonials acting like total morons by crashing their ships into our star.

It's the story that should be written if it weren't for the director's desire to keep it all edgy and grim all the way to the end.
