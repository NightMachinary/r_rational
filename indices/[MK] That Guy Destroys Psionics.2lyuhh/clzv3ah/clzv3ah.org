I'm admittedly kind of uncomfortable with the narrator... he seems arbitrarily misanthropic, and this seems like rewarding him.

That said, my move as the DM (besides avoiding metaphysics-altering crap in the first session) would be to retcon gravity into being dependent on interaction between the Plane of Force and the Plane of Earth (I mean, it makes about as much sense as anything), and watch as the local deities get annoyed with floating around without leverage.

This actually sounds like an interesting setting idea...
