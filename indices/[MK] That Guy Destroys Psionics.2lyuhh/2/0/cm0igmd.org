See, this bothers me on both sides. Player: I want my elf to have a beard. Dm: I'd rather not have facial hair on elves. P: Please? D: Your character is~1/32 human. If you slowly grow facial hair.

Or

Player:I want my elf to have a beard. Dm: I don't want my elves to be super hairy like men. Player: please? Dm: no. Player: fine, I make my eyebrows really long. Dm: if I am saying no to a beard so you really expect me to ok waist length eyebrows?

Either option works. I know of no Dm that would find eyebrows better than beards.
