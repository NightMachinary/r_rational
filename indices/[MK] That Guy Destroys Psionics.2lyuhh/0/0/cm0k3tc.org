  I'm admittedly kind of uncomfortable with the narrator... he seems arbitrarily misanthropic, and this seems like rewarding him.

It's the Tucker Max thing, where you say that you're "not proud" of something and then proceed to describe it with as much pride as possible - revelling in being an asshole while disclaiming your behavior, basically. This is the sort of story where even though he's telling it from his side, you get the sense that from everyone else's perspective he's just an unreasonable asshole.
