*Synopsis*

After the Changeling invasion, Celestia and Luna make the decision to have Twilight investigate the Elements of Harmony and solve the mystery of their power.

A thousand years later, Rainbow Dash awakens in a world she does not recognize. She has no idea how or why she came to be there. She does not know the language, the geography or any of the rules of this new.

*RT/RST qualifications*

- First off, while we see Twilight investigating the Elements of Harmony onscreen, each chapter opens with a passage from the book that she eventually wrote and the characters are in the process of rediscovering the things that she learned (and possibly going a bit deeper). [[#s][spoiler]]
- There are plausible reasons behind the characters' actions.
- Likewise, the characters make mistakes but learn from them, and consistently apply their resources to the problems that they encounter.
- The factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values rather than just being "good" or "evil." [[#s][spoiler]]
- There are consistent rules to this world, and the story sticks to them.
- We are absolutely being given sufficient information to piece together what's happening.
