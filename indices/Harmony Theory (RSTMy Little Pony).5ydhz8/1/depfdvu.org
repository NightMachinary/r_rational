Still unfinished, but currently reaches 544,462 words - the length of eight normal-sized books, or two-and-a-half /Wheel of Time/ books. I stopped partway through the last time I read this, about three years ago, because it moved too slowly for me.

It opens with a lot of very interesting mysteries. Solving them gradually takes a back seat to worldbuilding and introducing new characters; the story introduces new plot threads more often than it resolves the ones it already has, which I found frustrating. Some excellent fight scenes and cosmic horror, though they're relatively rare. Doesn't have a whole lot to do with My Little Pony, the setting is completely different from the show's Equestria and all but a small handful of characters are Sharaloth's creations - read it as a standalone fantasy series, not as fanfiction.
