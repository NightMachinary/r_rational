It's definitely slow, but I found it pretty interesting in its own right. Interesting characters and a reasonable mix of action. Things are always happening. Though, it definitely needs to be read as fanfiction- a lot of the plot points are nonsensical without a basic understanding of the show and its major characters.

Also, I found Background Pony moved far slower than this one...
