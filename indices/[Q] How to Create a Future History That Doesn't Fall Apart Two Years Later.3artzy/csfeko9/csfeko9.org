Just make it into an alternate history at some point. Charles Stross has repeatedly grumbled about being taken over by the real world. Articles [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/10/the-curse-of-laundry.html][here]] and [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2006/09/truth_overtakes_fiction_in_str.html][here]]. I think that if you're doing the "near-future" thing right, this is always going to be an issue, and either you're going to have to drop the setting, or you're going to accept that you divert away from the real world starting around when the first bit is published.
