Stross is really hardcore about consistency. He could have kept writing it as an alternate world or something.

He dropped his Eschaton ("Singularity Sky", "Iron Sunrise") series for not entirely dissimilar reasons.

On the other hand, he doesn't seem to worry about the Laundry series missing its apocalypse dates. CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN was supposed to hit years ago. :)
