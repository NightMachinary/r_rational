My advice, which I don't see in the comments so far:

Preemptively obsolete yourself! Start writing a scifi story based on scientific knowledge that has already been expanded on, updated, or corrected in the present day! You're going to be obsoleted eventually no matter what, so just commit absolutely to creating an alternate history where physics works differently!

They can't kill you if you're already dead!
