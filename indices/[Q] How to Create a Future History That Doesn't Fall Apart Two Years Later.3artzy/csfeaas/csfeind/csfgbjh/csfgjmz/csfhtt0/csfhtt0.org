Why'd they design an AI like that? AIs with a utility function gone wrong should tend to convert their future light cone to computronium, since that's about as generally useful as getting control of the Hogwarts rumor mill, so the aliens would've had to solve their value alignment problem... only to find nothing better to do with their negentropy than leaving everything exactly as is.

Maybe the aliens have already converted the star's masses and are merely replicating their light to keep up appearances, and allow all the civilisations that already exist the time to live out their natural lifespans for the purposes of acausal trade: All the civilizations that would make an AI like theirs get an equal share of the negentropy saved up for the [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/][Archipelago]]-style paradise set to go off in a few million years, all the civilzations that would take all their future light cone for themselves get nothing.
