That might be overcomplicating it - you're the author, if you say that singularity-level AI turned out to be impossible to get right, nobody will question it. Pick some problem that must be solved before AI can be built and just rule that nobody ever figured it out. Unless the existence of an AI faction is important to your story, there's no reason that I can see for AI to be possible.

Space opera with FTL and no superhuman AI is an established setting, a pre-existing trope you can use. People who've sat through Star Wars or Star Trek will assume that you're using the same basic framework except where you explicitly point out a difference. It's slightly further to the soft end of the science fiction spectrum than the place most of this sub hangs out, but there's nothing wrong with that. There's lots of good stories in soft science fiction.
