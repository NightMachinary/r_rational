The underlying plot token is really freaky: it's a change in /mathematics/. There are algorithms that only work when you're far enough outside the galactic core. Go into the Unthinking Depths, and math we know of breaks.

So there are algorithms that make consciousness easy to create, but they don't work down here, and the hacks that are possible are so complex that civilizations don't tend to last long enough to reverse-engineer them. That's why there's no AI.

Apparently in one early draft of AFuTD Vinge had the Tropical Collectives transcend, briefly, when Countermeasure fired... but he decided that wasn't consistent with his story. Not having evolved in the Transcend they wouldn't be using those algorithms, and the brief period before the Slow Zone returned wasn't long enough for them to develop them.
