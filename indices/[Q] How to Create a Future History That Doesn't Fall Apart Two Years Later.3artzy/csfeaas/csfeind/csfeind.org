  Or are you worried about a far-future setting that'll look outdated when our idea of space travel and AI changes?

This one. I'm probably staying away from any possible runaway AI singularities by ruling that some other species got to AI first and gave it the sole task of destroying any intelligences that attempted to increase their own intelligence and then used that heightened intelligence to do it again.

That, or I'm going with my Simulated Universe idea, which solves both AI and FTL.
