Are you talking about a near-future setting, in ten years or so, that you're worried will look odd when the time comes and the major world events of your story haven't happened? Or are you worried about a far-future setting that'll look outdated when our idea of space travel and AI changes?

In either case: do enough research that the flaws won't be immediately obvious to an amateur in the area (experts are a bad test audience, they'll find flaws in anything), try to focus on areas that are important to the story (nobody cares whether Greece left the EU in a story about the rise of telepresence robots), and beyond that don't worry about it. Sci-fi writers are not futurologists.
