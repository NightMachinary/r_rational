I dug around in my backups, and backups of backups, and i do still have some of my email discussions from 1993. They're not even vaguely complete, but here's the bits that are relevant.

    So what happened during the brief period in which Countermeasure pulled the lower Transcend down around Tine World? What happened in the tropics? /(me)/

  At one time, I may have had a few sentences claiming that super-packs were briefly formed. I'm kinda glad it didn't make it into the final version, because without some acoustical augmentation and MAC (like more radio cloaks and a simple MAC protocol), I don't see how it could happen. /(Vernor)/

    And what is it that the Zones limit, that blocks AI but lets Tine and Skrodes function unchanged deep into the slow zone? Or is that something you're just winging?
  #+end_quote

  Skrodes are not even close to sapient, so I don't see a problem with them. However, the question about Tines (and Humans) v AI was one of the major logic consistency problems of the background. Here's my explanation: An AI of human-equivalent capability could operate in the Beyond and even in the Slow Zone. (In fact, Vrinimi Org had concluded that Pham Nuwen was very close to being such a thing.)

  In principle, such an AI could even be /designed and built/ in the Slow Zone by a civilization native to that Zone. In practice, however, the work would require superhumanly competent development tools if it were to be accomplished within the lifetime of such a civilization (much less within the lifetime of an engineering project). Since such superhumanly capable tools are not runnable in the Lower Zones, this means that such projects are for practical purposes impossible. (I see semi-exceptions and perverse exceptions that are actually the fodder for some 'quels I have in mind.)

That last bit presumably referencing the Emergents and Focus in /A Deepness in the Sky/.
