Eh, some variation on this is very plausible. If "Non-omnicidal" AI is possible, then the size of the universe means someone has likely already done it. Once you have one, having it prevent the universe from being paper-clipped by some other species while otherwise altering reality as little as possible would be a thing to do. Which means that the biosphere of earth might well already be thinly sprinkled with nano-scale machinery set to stop anyone or anything from doing anything severely stupid. At least for fictional purposes, this works fine.
