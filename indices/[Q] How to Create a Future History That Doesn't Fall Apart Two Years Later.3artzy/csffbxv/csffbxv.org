  Does it just... not actually matter as much as I think it does, that I could have a running universe that was scientifically rigorous to begin with but (in order to keep continuity with previous stories) is less and less so as Science Marches On?

If it /was/ scientifically rigorous /to begin with/, that means you at least started with something like a coherent, non-self-contradictory model of how things work. That's interesting in itself, even if it turns out not to reflect reality.
